In total, 65 Griffons had been killed, along with 58 Ponies (18 soldiers and 40 civilians). Private Edge's story is especially memorable due to him personally holdiing off ten Griffons from ransacking the village's schoolhouse, which was being used as a refuge by the local population.\n\nHis story, along with hundreds like his, have become the focus of a propoganda campaign aimed at reminding the Ponies of Lake City of the bravery and honour displayed daily in their defense."

###Princely Restoration
 LCT_princely_restoration:0 "Princely Restoration"
 LCT_princely_restoration_desc:0 "In 752, Grand Prince Frail Spear was deposed after the Griffonian Empire destroyed our great city. What followed was an era of feeble democratic rule, with the Ponies of Lake City carried from one crisis to the next. Thankfully, recent events have seen these wrongs corrected, and the reigns of power returned to Lake City's rightful sovereign, Grand Prince Heavenly Snow."

 LCT_long_live_the_prince:0 "Long Live the Prince"
 LCT_long_live_the_prince_desc:0 "While members of the Grand Prince's privy council privately question his qualifications, Heavenly Snow assures his ministers that he is fully capable of handling the affairs of state on his own. This is a bit of a shocking revelation, considering the Prince's initial reluctance to the coup. However, none will openly criticize such a decision."

 LCT_prince_of_the_people:0 "Prince of the People"
 LCT_prince_of_the_people_desc:0 "The idea of an opulent monarch, in a land ravaged by poverty, unemployment, and homelessness might rub many the wrong way. However, Grand Prince Heavenly Snow has continued to live his previous life, living well within the means of an average citizen. This example of self-sacrifice is seen as humbling, and has done much to bridge the gap between monarch and subject."

 LCT_cult_of_the_prince:0 "The Cult of the Prince"
 LCT_cult_of_the_prince_desc:0 "In olden times, the Grand Prince stood at the centre of Lake City's affairs. He was a monarch who ruled absolutely, with his decisions being beyond the realm of criticism. Few would dare oppose him, and many gave their complete admiration and devotion. While our modern monarchy is a long way from these ideals, we can begin to rebuild this cult of personality."

 LCT_reaffirm_the_treaty:0 "Reaffirm the Treaty"
 LCT_reaffirm_the_treaty_desc:0 "The Coltstream Treaty has been a lynchpin to our foreign and domestic policy since it's inception, providing us with the means to defend against Griffon aggression. However, since the rise of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow, there have been growig fears amongst treaty members that our political shift could jeopardize the alliance. We must put these fears to rest."

 LCT_blessed_sowrds_legacy:0 "Blessed Sword's Legacy"
 LCT_blessed_sowrds_legacy_desc:0 "Blessed Sword was the first Grand Prince of Lake City.

 LCT_princely_glory:0 "Princely Command"
 LCT_princely_glory_desc:0 "Previously, the Grand Prince and Minister of War were two separate Ponies within Lake City. However, by combining these two positions into one, we can position the military directly subordinate to the crown. Thus, Heavenly Snow can ensure their loyalty, and command his forces without the interference of his generals or ministers."

 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda:0 "Anti-Griffon Propaganda"
 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda_desc:0 "The February 4th coup, and the period of instability which followed, distracted us from who our real enemies are.

 LCT_strike_at_the_source_desc:0 "In the year 752, Lake City was sacked and destroyed by the Griffonian Empire. Much of our wealth and heritage was lost, along with our last Prince who was overthrown by his very subjects out of misguided anger. It's time we got revenge for that."

 LCT_regency_council_desc:0 "Heavenly Snow may hold the strongest claim to the throne of Lake City, however he still has much to learn before he is truly capable of assuming the duties of his office.

 LCT_subjugate_the_guilds_desc:0 "In 752, the Guilds were the chief benefactors of the revolution which ended the First Lake City Kingdom.

 LCT_princely_welfare:0 "Princely Charity"
 LCT_princely_welfare_desc:0 "We could make great strides in bridging the gap between our new regime and the common citizen, with the sacrifice of a small portion of the Prince's personal wealth towards charity projects. Who knows, these may even help alleviate the crushing poverty of Lake City."

 LCT_DEP_railways_desc:0 "There are rumoured to be vast quantities of crystals within the depths of the Eygsic Forest.

 LCT_forced_industrialization:0 "Deponyian Development Aid"
 LCT_forced_industrialization_desc:0 "Our neighbour to the north suffers from a severly stunted economy, with the vast majority of their population toiling away in the fields just for mere sustenance.

 LCT_DEP_forts_desc:0 "While the transition of power was smooth between our two regimes, the local populace of Deponya has shown some resistance to our leadership.

 LCT_Resource_harvesting:0 "Develop Griffking Basin Aluminum Production"
 LCT_Resource_harvesting_desc:0 "The Griffking River makes up the border between Lake City and Deponya. It's well known, that along this river, there are massive quantities of aluminum.

 LCT_DEP_research:0 "Blackened Heart of the Eygsic Forest"
 LCT_DEP_research_desc:0 "Wayward Breeze was known in history as the scholar Prince, devoting much of his reign towards furthering the education of his subjects. To honour his memory, the army has contsructed Fort Breeze, a military research complex located in the heart of Deponya's Eygsic Forest. This instillation will do whatever it takes to better our understanding of the world, no matter how much damage is done to the landscape."

 LCT_anti_griff_research:0 "Anti-Griffon Warfare"
 LCT_anti_griff_research_desc:0 "The flames of war have finally arrived to Lake City, seeing our brave soldiers engaged against their Griffon foes in a struggle for our very survival.

 LCT_divine_sacrifice:0 "Divine Sacrifice"
 LCT_divine_sacrifice_desc:0 "Death should be seen as an honourable sacrifice to make for your Grand Prince. It's also a sacrifice which will be greatly rewarded.

 LCT_for_the_prince:0 "For the Prince!"
 LCT_for_the_prince_desc:0 "Every soldier should be prepared to sacrifice fully in the name of their Grand Prince. This is the benefit of a monarchy. In a monarchy, our army is not a collection of individuals, but rather a single mightly organic entity aligned in its admiration and devotion to its liege. If we militarize this philosophy fully, there will be few who can stand against us."
 
 LCT_princely_divinity:0 "His Heavenly Presence"
 LCT_princely_divinity_desc:0 "The devotion expected of the army must be extended to the civil sector. The Ponies of Lake City should realize that they do not work for their personal benefit, but rather, towards the benefit of His Majesty, and his imperial ambitions. Once this has been achieved, there will be little hindering our economic hegemony."

 LCT_river_empire:0 "A River Empire" 
 LCT_river_empire_desc:0 "From Nimbusia to Deponya, from the Zebralands to Farbrook, our domain stretches across the entirety of Eastern Griffonia.

 LCT_vanguard_restores_order_desc:0 "During the coup of February 4th, Springtime Frost was forced between a rock and a hard place. In an act of desperation, he called upon Westerly Leeward, who was able to swiftly restore order with the aid of the Republican Vanguards. However, the streets are now patrolled by forces loyal to Westerly, and his presence is felt heavily in day-to-day life."

 LCT_westerly_takes_control:0 "Unify with the Military"
 LCT_westerly_takes_control_desc:0 "There is much tension between our administration and the army, with the old guard being highly wary of the paramilitary branch of our party. We can put these stuffed shirts at ease by offering them cabinet positions while offering to formally integrate our paramiltary wing into the traditional military structure."
 
 LCT_military_guilds:0 "Nationalize the Guilds"
 LCT_military_guilds_desc:0 "For decades, the guilds of Lake City have worked against the common interest of our Ponies, making a profit through their suffering. We must seize the assets of these traitors and wield them in a manner that benefits our nation, army, and Ponies."
 
 LCT_secure_loyalty:0 "Secure Officer Loyalties"
 LCT_secure_loyalty_desc:0 "While our policy of unity, with the army, has addressed the worst of our administration's growing pains, we still have critics within the military. If we were to strong-hoof these individuals into an early retirement, and replace them with party loyalists, we could further integrate the Republican Vanguards and army."
 
 LCT_expand_military:0 "Universal Conscription"
 LCT_expand_military_desc:0 "As the terrors of war approach our border, it becomes the duty of every able-bodies Pony to serve their country. To aid in this endeavour, the government of Westerly Leeward has called for universal conscription, with a minimum of two years service required for all Ponies over the age of 21."
 
 LCT_citzenship_under_service:0 "Republican Vanguard Foreign Battalions"
 LCT_citzenship_under_service_desc:0 "In its early days, the River Coalition was a defensive alliance against Griffon aggression. This has bred a deep seeded xenophobia of Griffons amongst many coalition citizens. We can capitalize upon this by creating the Republican Vanguard Foreign Battalions, offering service to Ponies, with anti-Griffon sentiments, from beyond our realm."
 
 LCT_ban_school:0 "Politicize the Jezeragrad Military Academy"
 LCT_ban_school_desc:0 "The officers of tomorrow are the cadets of today. As such, we could make great strides in securing the military's loyalty by interfering in the affairs of Jezeragrad Military Academy. This can be done by limiting enrollment, so only party members can join, and by altering the curriculum to take on a pro-Vanguard bias."
 
 LCT_national_mobilization:0 "National Mobilization"
 LCT_national_mobilization_desc:0 "In the near future, our nation will be in a state of total war against the terrors of the Griffon world. Our armies will be engaged in a fight for their very survival, and they will require the resouces of our entire society if we are to endure. As such, we must begin mobilizing our nation in preparation for such a day." 
 
 LCT_military_austerity:0 "Military Austerity"
 LCT_military_austerity_desc:0 "Under the prior guidance of the guilds, the resources of our nation were wasted away with little benefit to Lake City.

 LCT_military_science:0 "Military Science Committee"
 LCT_military_science_desc:0 "The underdeveloped nature of both the Lake City science base and economy has limited the amount of resources we can contribute towards research.

 LCT_national_science_funding:0 "National Science Fund"
 LCT_national_science_funding_desc:0 "Lake City is full of intelligent Ponies with great ambition.

 LCT_fan_fanaticism:0 "Fanaticism within our Ranks"
 LCT_fan_fanaticism_desc:0 "Those who serve within Lake City's army should not only be prepared, but eager, to lay down their lives in the name of their country.

 LCT_balustar_arms:0 "Bolster our Arms Industry"
 LCT_balustar_arms_desc:0 "The eve of our final struggle is upon us, yet our military is still woefully underequipped for the conflict ahead. To address this, we must push for our most comprehensive economic policy yet. Our steel mills must be nationalized, our arms industry expanded, and the flow of precious materials, out of our country, stopped."
 
 LCT_expand_frontier:0 "Secure the Griffking River Basin"
 LCT_expand_frontier_desc:0 "The Griffking River is the lifeblood of the River Coalition. It provides water to millions of acres of cropland and is the transit corridor that links together every nation of our alliance. In fact, it is this rive that gives our Equine Union its very name. Yet, the source of this river lies within Griffon lands. This injustice must be corrected."
 
 LCT_defend_frontier:0 "Defend the Frontier"

 LCT_own_the_south_desc:0 "The discovery of crystals in Cessabit has triggered a crystal rush, with thousands of Ponies lifting up their roots and voluntarily moving to the former Griffon lands in search of wealth. While most of these settlers will find nothing of value, they will fulfill the very important duty of filling our newly acquired lands with loyal Ponies."

 LCT_strike_the_red_scourge:0 "The Red Menace"
 LCT_strike_the_red_scourge_desc:0 "With the bulk of Griffon lands in Eastern Griffonia safely under our control, only a single threat remains.

 LCT_militery_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military infastructure of Lake City is severly underdeveloped, leaving our armies inadequately equipped. We can partially address this issue by contracting the Guilds to produce our weapons and other military equipment."

 LCT_west_wall:0 "The West Wall"
 LCT_west_wall_desc:0 "To our west lies the County of Longsword, formerly a member of the accursed Griffon Empire. Since the empire's downfall, the county has acted as a staging ground for raiders seeking to loot our lands. The construction of a wall against them would greatly hinder such activities."
 
 LCT_national_research_council:0 "The Chamber of Innovation"

 LCT_south_wall:0 "The South Wall"
 LCT_south_wall_desc:0 "To our south lies the Gryphian Host and the Princeipality of Lushi. The former is a group of glorified bandits organized into a supposed government.

 LCT_focus_on_defence:0 "Bulwark Against Griffons"
 LCT_focus_on_defence_desc:0 "Lake Ciy shares the largest frontier with Griffonkind, within the River Coalition, and in the event of war will act as the main frontline.

 LCT_focus_on_offence_desc:0 "While Lake City has no love Griffons, we can appreciate that not all Griffon regimes are equally abhorrent. By supporting a more interventionalist policy, we can insure that there are more Griffons willing to tolerate the River Coalition."
 
 ### NAVY FOCUSES ###

 LCT_a_bigger_lake:0 "Rebuild the Lake City Navy"
 LCT_a_bigger_lake_desc:0 "In the past, the lake, which gives our nation its name, used to be owned by three equally powerful city-states who fought each other for local dominance. Part of this conflict took place on the waves where great navies would clash upon the water in climatic skirmishes. Now that we once again have access to hostile waters, it's times to re-activate the Lake City Navy and bring back its former glory."

 LCT_cruisers:0 "Adopt Nimbusian Designs"
 LCT_cruisers_desc:0 "The National Navy of Nimbusia has access to some of the most advanced cruiser designs within the entire River Coalition. While the bulk of their meagre navy exists to support their sky carrier, it can't be denied that they produce fantastic support ships. Our navy would be well-served by importing some of Nimbusia's designs."

 LCT_battleships:0 "Adopt Bakaranian Designs"
 LCT_battleships_desc:0 "The Republican Navy of Bakaran is by far the strongest within the River Coalition, possessing the alliance's single capital ship. Their battleship is what gives the River Coalition its bite and allows us to dominate the water of Eastern Griffonia. The blueprints for this ship's design are a closely guarded secret, but we should be able to pull some strings and get access to the Bakarian records."

 LCT_destroyers:0 "Adopt Diamond Dog Designs"
 LCT_destroyers_desc:0 "The Diamond Dogs of the Diamond Mountain are not very familiar with naval combat. However, what expertise they do possess has gone into constructing fairly proficient screening ships. This is due to their background in submarine warfare. If we were able to acquire their designs, we could ensure that our destroyers would have a decesive edge against hostile submarines."

 LCT_carrier_focus:0 "Develop a Long-Range Navy"
 LCT_carrier_focus_desc:0 "A long-range navy would be tasked with operating in open waters far beyond the safety of friendly ports and ground-based aircraft. In order to operate such a navy, we must invest heavily into the construction of aircraft carriers, to allow for mobile air cover, and logistic systems so our fleets can be serviced thousands of kilometers from home."

 LCT_capital_focus:0 "Develop a Short-Range Navy"
 LCT_capital_focus_desc:0 "A short-range navy would be tasked with patrolling coastal waters and waters close enough to friendly lands that ground-based aircraft can support them. Such a navy would allow us to invest into heavier armour and bigger guns, offering such ships greater staying power compared to their counterparts in attacking navies."

 LCT_carriers:0 "Hire Equestrian Experts"
 LCT_carriers_desc:0 "When it comes to aircraft carriers, Equestria is a world leader in terms of design and doctrine. As such, we should hire experts from Equestrian dockyards and compile them into a crash course program to try and develop our own indigenous carrier design."

 LCT_naval_air_f:0 "Establish Coltsuka"
 LCT_naval_air_f_desc:0 "Coltsuka is a proposed guild which would be tasked with taking existing aircraft designs, manufactured by JASA or Neighjima, and converting them into variants better suited for operating on aircraft carriers."

 LCT_navy_air_supremacy:0 "First Air Fleet"
 LCT_navy_air_supremacy_desc:0 "What Lake City lacks, in terms of technology and production, we make up for in terms of quality. With extensive training, we can ensure that our aircraft carrier pilots are some of the best in the world, allowing our limited equipment to be used to its fullest." 
 
 LCT_expand_naval_production:0 "Establish the Dockyard Guild"
 LCT_expand_naval_production_desc:0 "The Dockyard Guild is a proposed corporations which will be responsible for the constructio, development, and maintenance of dockyards in Lake City. This will be uniquely challenging objective due to the fact that all our coastline is on freshly acquired lands, which can create tension between local populations and this firm."
 
 LCT_establish_snlf:0 "Lake City Naval Infantry"
 LCT_establish_snlf_desc:0 "The expansion of our nation into the realm of naval conflict has brought to our attention the lackluster performance of our army when attempting to launch naval assualts. We can address this issue by allowing the Lake City Navy to recruit its own infantry formations, training and equipping them as they see fit."

 LCT_navy_projection:0 "100 Ship Navy"
 LCT_navy_projection_desc:0 "Our administration has made it clear that we should strive towards increasing the strength of our navy to 100 ships. While a few of these will be capital ships, the vast majority will be made up of lighter support ships which fulfill a wide range of combat roles. In order to achieve this goal, we must prioritize the flow of resources towards the construction of destroyers and cruisers."

 LCT_torpedo_cruisers:0 "Torpedo Cruisers"
 LCT_torpedo_cruisers_desc:0 "When we dismiss the need for long distance operations, we open up a wide range of possibilities to further arming our navy. One such proposal calls for the installation of torpedo tubes on our current crusier designs, greatly increasing their firepower."

 LCT_long_lance_torpedoes:0 "Long Lance Torpedo"
 LCT_long_lance_torpedoes_desc:0 "Since the reactiviation of the Lake City Navy, the engineers are Jezeragrad Armaments have been designing new and more powerful weapon systems for our ships. One such design, has been the Long Lance Torpedo. A torpedo which promises to have twice the range of its traditional counterparts. By utilizing these in our navy, we will greatly increase our combat effectiveness."

 LCT_the_ultimate_battleship:0 "Star Wing-Class Battleship"
 LCT_the_ultimate_battleship_desc:0 "The Star Wing-Class Battleship promises to the be the flagship of our new Lake City Navy. There are few ships which would be able to compare to the sheer tonnage, firepower, and protection this design offers. The construction of such a ship would forever assure the security of our shores from hostile interference."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES ###
 
 LCT_army_modernisation:0 "Begin to Modernize the Lake City Army"
 LCT_army_modernisation_desc:0 "Our armed forces currently lag behind in terms of military innovations. Our rifles are severely outdated, our doctrine is several decades obsolete, and our knowledge on armoured warfare is little more than haphazard theory building. We must begin a crash course program to modernize our armed forces in an effort to better protect Lake City"
 
 LCT_develop_small_arms:0 "Develop Small Arms"
 LCT_develop_small_arms_desc:0 "Infantry formations are the backbone of Lake City's army. As such, we must prioritize developing advanced small arms in order to increase the effectiveness of these units."
 
 LCT_pegasi_f:0 "Import Pegasus Doctrine"
 LCT_pegasi_f_desc:0 "The Pegasus battalions of Nimbusia are some of the best combat formations in the entire River Coalition. They strike hard, fast, and with great effectiveness, easily devestating all their opponents. It may prove beneficial to send an attache to study the Nimbusia army and better understand and replicate their success."
 
 LCT_infantry_supremacy:0 "Reform the Army"
 LCT_infantry_supremacy_desc:0 "The Lake City Army suffers from many faults. However, it is important to realize that what we need is to reform our existing doctrine rather than re-write it. Infantry formations and delicately constructed battleplans are what will win the day against Griffon aggression, not some experimental gizmos."
 
 LCT_tech_supremacy:0 "Revolutionize the Army"
 LCT_tech_supremacy_desc:0 "Infantry and static battleplans have served our nation well. However, these concepts are rapidly becoming relics. Rather we must completely revolutionize the manner by which we conduct war, by focusing less on infantry and more on big guns, motorized formations, and armoured warfare. If we adapt these philosophies early there will be little hindering our success on the battlefield."
 
 LCT_army_expansion:0 "200 Battalion Plan"
 LCT_army_expansion_desc:0 "In 1007, our army included 55 battalions with 46 000 soldiers in the field. This number can hardly be classified as a border guard, let alone an army. As such, our government has set out to quadruple the size of our armed forces through the rapid production of weapons, arming of recruits, and training of soldiers."
 
 LCT_new_infantry_equipment:0 "Modernizing Our Infantry"
 LCT_new_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "When the Lake City Army was created, an infantry battalion required nothing more than Ponies, rifles, and courage. However, modern war has revealed that infantry now require a complex set of equipment which includes machine guns, mortors, and various other components. Our military research has lagged behind in this regard and we must strive towards properly equipping our military."
 
 LCT_spec_ops:0 "Terrain Specilization"
 LCT_spec_ops_desc:0 "The River Coalition covers a wide variety of terrains, ranging from sprawling plains, to densely packed forests, and large jagged mountain passes. Our traditional infantry are poorly equipped in handling some of the more extreme climates. As such, it's been proposed that we train a few elite battalions to specialize in operating in the harshest of landscapes."
 
 LCT_anti_knight_tactics:0 "Tungsten Bullets"
 LCT_anti_knight_tactics_desc:0 "Griffon knights are known to wear a hefty set of battle armour which is resistant to the lead tipped bullets commonly used by our infantry. However, tests have shown that a new tungsten tipped round is far more effective at punching through this hardy gear. As such, we've begun to produce these rounds on mass, distributing them quickly through our ranks."
 
 LCT_engineers:0 "Lake City Engineer Corps"
 LCT_engineers_desc:0 "The creation of a dedicated engineer corp, within our army, could prove highly beneficial. After all, there will always be a need to ford rivers, construct fortifications, build trenches, and traverse difficult terrain."
 
 LCT_army_tatics:0 "Mature our Doctrine"
 LCT_army_tatics_desc:0 "The training of fresh divisions and construction of new equipment is all well and good. However, the impact of a larger army will be significantly weakened if we don't have the doctrine to properly utilize them. As such, we must create a dedicated high command and have them develop Lake City's doctrine for future conflicts ahead."
 
 LCT_trucks:0 "Motorized Divisions"
 LCT_trucks_desc:0 "Trucks are faster than a Pegasus, can carry more than an Earthpony, and require slightly less pampering than a Unicorn. The development of an indigenous truck design, and its implementation within our ranks, would allow for the rapid movement of our armies in times of conflict, allowing us to outmaneuver more infantry-focused formations."
 
 LCT_tanks:0 "Armoured Warfare Experiments"
 LCT_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks are a relatively unknown piece of equipment within the Griffonian continent. Due to this, there can be quite an advantage gained from adopting them early. However, there is much work to do before we can truly integrate tanks into our army. We must develop our own designs, construct prototypes, and test them."
 
 LCT_tanks2:0 "Fortress Busters"
 LCT_tanks2_desc:0 "To our west, the Griffons of Longsword have established quite the defensive fortifications against us. In the event of war, our infantry, motorized, and existing armoured units would prove ineffective at punching through this. However, if we were to develop a more heavily armoured variant of our tanks we might have better luck at producing an initial breakthrough."
 
 LCT_maintenance_company:0 "Maintenance Corps"
 LCT_maintenance_company_desc:0 "The inclusion of trucks, armoured fighting vehicles, and tanks within our army have created a whole range of logistical and maintenance issues. Currently, our maintenance system have proved largely ineffective at handling these. However, the creation of a dedicated maintenance corp would provide the level of specialization needed to effectively upkeep our army."
 
 ###Airplane Force Navy of the Sky
 
 LCT_establish_air_force:0 "Establish the Lake City Air Corps"
 LCT_establish_air_force_desc:0 "Traditionally, our limited stock of aircraft have been put under the army's command. However, examples from the Changeling Queendom and Equestria have shown how much efficency can be gained once the air force is seperated into its own branch. As such, we will follow these examples and formally create the Lake City Air Corp."
 
 LCT_unlock_fighter_man:0 "Jezeragrad Aluminium and Steel Association"
 LCT_unlock_fighter_man_desc:0 "The Jezeragrad Aluminium and Steel Association is one of Lake City's most powerful guilds, holding a monopoly upon the production of steel and alumininum. They are also responsible for producing our current fighter fleet. If we were to expand our  contract with them, they would be justified in opening an airplane factory, greatly increasing both the quantity and quality of planes."
 
 LCT_new_fighters:0 "JASA Fighter Factory"
 LCT_new_fighters_desc:0 "The opening of the Jezeragrad Aluminium and Steel Association's fighter factory puts Lake City on the map as a leading producer of airplanes within Eastern Griffonia. This complex will not only employ close to two thousand Ponies, but also go a long way in arming our burgeoning Lake City Air Corp."

 LCT_unlock_med_air_man:0 "Neighjima"
 LCT_unlock_med_air_man_desc:0 "Neighjima is one of Lake City's leading automobile producer, holding a significant hold upon the production of cars, trucks, gasoline, and rubber within our nation. They also hold the only government contract for producing and maintaining our tiny fleet of bombers. If we were to increase our demand for their product, this would likely push them into establishing a dedicated aircraft factory."

 LCT_bomber_development:0 "Neighjima Bomber Factory"
 LCT_bomber_development_desc:0 "The Neighjima bomber factory will provide several thousand jobs to the people of Jezeragrad, in a wide variety of skilled professions. However, this factory will also be of incredible assistance to both the development and production of bomber technology, helping to usher in an era of aerial dominance for Lake City."

 LCT_the_lake_in_the_sky:0 "Prioritize Aluminium for Fighters"
 LCT_the_lake_in_the_sky_desc:0 "Lake City is poor in alumininum, relying heavily upon imports from other nations in order to make up for its deficit. This lack of aluminum is especially worrying to our air force, due to the heavy use of the metal within advanced aircraft designs. By prioritizing the air force, when it comes to alloting our aluminum reserves, we can ensure that we'd never run short on fighters."

 LCT_fighters_2:0 "JASA Aircraft Facility"
 LCT_fighters_2_desc:0 "The Jezeragrad Aluminium and Steel Association has established a dedicated R&D facility on the outskirts of Jezeragrad. This location will prove vital in developing, designing, and testing new aircraft technologies."

 LCT_bomber_2:0 "Consent to the Neighjima-Jezeragrad Armaments Merger"
 LCT_bomber_2_desc:0 "Neighjima has shown interest in merging with Jezeragrad Armaments, the nation's leading producer of munitions. An aspect of this merger would see the development of bombing ordinance and aircraft under a single roof. By consenting to this merger, our government would see an immediate benefit to bomber development as the two teams collaborate on current and future projects."

 LCT_jets:0 "JASA's Department of Advanced Engine Technology"
 LCT_jets_desc:0 "The Jezeragrad Aluminium and Steel Association's R&D facility has recently expanded to include a wing dedicated to researching new and more efficient engines. Part of this department's mission is to look into the feasibility of importing foreign jet and rocket engines and integrating them into new and existing designs."

 LCT_empower_the_guilds_desc:0 "While the monopolisitic nature of Lake City's guilds have brought much pain to our working class, their unyielding support of the SDP can not be ignored. In order to ensure their continued support, we must reward them with additional resource charters."

 LCT_free_healthcare:0 "Socialized Healthcare"
 LCT_free_healthcare_desc:0 "Our current healthcare system locks access to quality medical care behind barriers which only the middle and upper-class can access. This leaves a large number of our Ponies without healthcare or at the mercy of charities of dubious quality. By creating a public insurance program, we can provide quality healthcare to all members of our society."
 
 LCT_curtail_the_militery:0 "Curtail the Military"
 LCT_curtail_the_militery_desc:0 "After the events of February 4th, the military's role within Lake City's affairs has come into question.

Action must be taken to rectify this issue and neuter the military's political presence."
 
 LCT_roads_not_walls:0 "Roads Not Walls"
 LCT_roads_not_walls_desc:0 "For decades, our infastructure budget has been used to finance the construction of fortifications against Griffon raiders.

 LCT_self_defence_forces:0 "Self-Defense Forces"
 LCT_self_defence_forces_desc:0 "In an effort to draw power away from the military, the SDP has established the Self-Defense Forces.

They will also act as the primary garrison force within Jezeragrad"
 
 LCT_expand_public_funding:0 "Shuffling Around the Budget"
 LCT_expand_public_funding_desc:0 "Previously, our military expenditures made up an incredibly high portion of our annual budget. However, as raids from the Griffon bandits decline, this large of an expense has come into question. As such, the SDP is calling for the slashing of the military budget, with the funds being shifted towards poverty reduction measures."
 
 LCT_free_education:0 "Research Grants"
 LCT_free_education_desc:0 "Previously, the bulk of research finances were aimed towards the development of new military technology. However, the curtailing of our armed forces has freed up a significant amount of money. Money which can be used to kickstart a new civilian research centre."
 
 LCT_empower_the_students:0 "Expand the Apprenticeship Program"
 LCT_empower_the_students_desc:0 "The transfer of trades between two individuals has been the bedrock of Lake City's educational system. We must reinforce this tradition by offering subsidies to tradeponies willing to tranfer their skills."

 LCT_macb_desc:0 "Our armies are unprepared for a confrontation with the communist governments to our south. However, that does not mean we have to stand idle against their terror.

 lakecity.1.a:0 "For the City!"

 lakecity.2.t:0 "The Elections of 1007"
 lakecity.2.d:0 "1007 is an election year in Lake City, and this year promises to be one of the most vicious in recent years. With Grand Mayor Springtime Frost's unwillingness to seek re-election, two Ponies have come to the forefront of the campaign, Wavebreaker and Westerly Leeward.\n\nWavebreaker is seen as the more traditional candidate, with a policy that favours greater cooperation with the River Coalition and increased social spending to alleviate the poverty of the city. This platform has garnered him the support of both the moderate, Constitutional Democratic Party, and the left-leaning, Social Democratic Party.\n\nWesterly Leeward, on the other hoof, is seen as a more extremist candidate. He calls for increased military spending and a greater roll for the military within the affairs of state. While these beliefs are radical, he is able to easily tap into the rampant anti-Griffon sentiments of Lake City, playing upon the lingering phobias of its Ponies. His party, the Republican Vanguards, also operate a paramilitary wing, allowing him to intimidate his opposition.\n\nLastly, there are whispers from within the military, which state that there are certain officers who wish to return Lake City to its monarchistic roots. While these radicals should be discredited as a tiny minority, it can not be ignored that within recent months, the pretender, 'Grand Prince' Heavenly Snow, has been unaccounted for by our intelligence agencies."
 lakecity.2.a:0 "Let's hope it goes smoothly."

 lakecity.3.t:0 "Wavebreaker Gives his Speech"
 lakecity.3.d:0 "In front of a massive crowd outside of Jezeragrad's largest theatre, Wavebreaker gives another of his pre-election speeches.\n\nHis platform is two-fold. First, he will seek greater security against the Griffon Empire through deeper cooperation amongst the members of the River Coalition. Second, he demands the creation of a generous social welfare system which will protect the citizen's of Lake City from poverty, ill-health, and unemployment.\n\nWhile his speech is seen as lackluster, pollsters believe that Waverbreaker's election is assured with his backing from both the SDP and CDP."
 lakecity.3.a:0 "United, we are strong!"

 lakecity.4.t:0 "Westerly Speaks out Against Griffon Aggressions"
 lakecity.4.d:0 "Today, Westerly Leeward, leader of the Republican Vanguards, held a speech in Pristinaigh. This settlement lies mere kilometers from the border with the County of Longsword and has, for generations, been a prime location for Griffon bandits looking to gain wealth and prestige through plunder.\n\nIn his speech, he played into these heavy anti-Griffon sentiments, promising the denizens of the city safety through increased military spending and greater border security.\n\nHis speech was well recieved, with a quarter of the city's population attending the rally. Pollsters put the province of Coltsovo firmly in Leeward's camp. Though, he still has much ground to gain on Wavebreaker."
 lakecity.4.a:0 "We'll stop those Griffons!"

 lakecity.5.t:0 "The February 4th Incident"
 lakecity.5.d:0 "At Dawn, Jezergrad was awoken to large movements of several army regiments into the centre of the city. These units quickly seized control of several key sections of the city including Parliament, the Mayor’s office, the War Ministry and the offices of the UDBA.\n\nThe Mayor was awoken to the sound of gunfire as troops stormed his residence. He was quickly ushered to a hiding spot prepared for just such an emergency. After all, this was far from the first assassination attempt on a Mayor. Springtime Frost himself came to power after his predecessor was shot in his own bed by members of the army in a failed coup.\n\nWithin hours the city was under rebel control and their leader, General Wild Tree appeared on national radio declaring that the democratic system of Lake City has weakened the nation and that through his guidance he would restore national harmony and pride. He also promised a restoration of the monarchy with one Heavenly Snow having been chosen as the new Grand Prince.\n\nThe capital may be lost, but there is a large faction in the military that opposes Wild Tree’s actions are they are ready to movie in to restore order. Alternatively, Westerly Leeward’s Vanguards are eager to fight against their political rivals and to protect the Republic."
 lakecity.5.a:0 "Secure the Mayor and surround the rebels!"
 lakecity.5.b:0 "Send in the Vanguard! They'll stop them!"
 lakecity.5.c:0 "There is little we can do."

lakecity.6.t:0 "The Civilian Government Endures"
 lakecity.6.d:0 "While the coup was successful in capturing a majority of government institutions within Jezeragrad and assassinating many key politicians, they were unable to capture the Grand Mayor. He managed to escape the city, with a portion of his cabinet, and set up a temporary provisional government.\n\nThis inability to capture the Grand Mayor spelled doom for the coup, as the loyalist army soon regrouped and quickly surrounded the rebels. By dawn the next day, the coup was disarmed and peacefully returned to their barracks.\n\nThe coup's leadership was quickly rounded up and taken into custody."
 lakecity.6.a:0 "Let's hope this is the last of our drama."

lakecity.7.t:0 "Aftermath of the Coup"
 lakecity.7.d:0 "Westerly Leeward Mobilized his paramilitary bands and with military support lead them into the city. Within a few hours, the rebels found themselves embroiled in fierce fighting with the Republican Vanguards. Street by street, the Vanguards slowly pushed the coup back towards a few pockets of stiff resistance near the waterfront.\n\nBy day's end, the coup has been virtually defeated and now the streets are patrolled by units loyal to Westerly. As the sun sets, Westerly Leeward takes to the stage before a crowd of nervous Ponies. The main question for many, is what has happened to Springtime Frost? And what will the future bring?"
 lakecity.7.a:0 "Springtime Frost survived and Westerly is demobilizing his bands."
 lakecity.7.b:0 "Springtime Frost died and Westerly will assume temporary mayoral powers."

lakecity.8.t:0 "Return of the Prince"
 lakecity.8.d:0 "Springtime Frost was found in his home and assassinated alongside his identical cousin. Many other members of government were quickly found and executed, including Wild Tree’s political rival, Westerly Leeward.\n\nWith the civilian government effectively cripple, the Lake City army is faced with a crisis. As an organization, they have always been independent of government control, which has put their loyalty into question.\n\nThese fears were confirmed, as units neutral to the crisis began joining the Restoration faction. By nightfall, only a few stubborn battalions continued to hold out in the name of democracy. Though they would not last long against the overwhelming might of the Restoration forces.\n\nBy morning, all was calm in Jezeragrad as an assembly was gathered outside of Fort Hoofboka, the former keep of the old Lake City royal family. Wild Tree proclaimed he represented the legacy of Grand Prince Blessed Sword and stated that he'd be assuming the duties of regent during a transitional period until the full restoration of the monarchy. In his declaration, he stated that the Grand Principality of Lake City was officially restored and that the traitors in the civilian government executed."
 lakecity.8.a:0 "So ends democracy."

lakecity.9.t:0 "The Election of 1007"
 lakecity.9.d:0 "After the attempted coup of February 4th, life has quickly returned to normal within Jezeragrad. As such, Springtime Frost has formally stepped down as election day arrives. While there are some reports of intimidation at the polls, the election has progressed smoothly. Turnout is reported high, and exit polls show the winner to be..."
 lakecity.9.a:0 "Wavebreaker!"
 lakecity.9.b:0 "Westerly Leeward!"

 lakecity.901.t:0 "New 'Elections'"
 lakecity.901.d:0 "It's election time in Lake City. Fortunately, the army has saw fit to provide a list of candidates that they approve of.\n\nThe winner of the election is..."
 lakecity.901.a:0 "Wavebreaker wins with a narrow majorty!"
 lakecity.901.b:0 "Wavebreaker wins with 110% of the vote!"

 lakecity.902.t:0 "New Elections"
 lakecity.902.d:0 "For the first time in decades, Lake City's elections are free of military meddling or candidates, leaving two Harmonic candidates to contend the position of Grand Mayor.\n\nThe incumbent, Grand Mayor Wavebreaker promises to build on his existing accomplishments of social reform and modernisation. His heroism in resisting assassination attempts to push his reforms has won him the admiration of the citzenry.\n\nDeirdra Skye, a former biologist, has gained a large following in recent years with her activism against the worst impacts of rapid industrialisation, and her key improvements for planned dams on the Griffking river. She even managed to gain some votes among the military with efforts to integrate the more dangerous (and cooperative) wildlife into defense efforts against Griffon raiders."
 lakecity.902.a:0 "Wavebreaker!"
 lakecity.902.b:0 "Deirdra Skye!"

 lakecity.10.t:0 "Lake City Demands We Swear Fealty to the Prince"
 lakecity.10.d:0 "At dawn, an envory from the court of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow approached King Grimhoof. They showed little acceptance of our customs and strutted up to his lordship with an air of pompous superiority.\n\nWith them they brought a copy of a treaty signed nearly 150 years ago between the last monarch of Lake City and our King of the time. It was a marriage certificate which would see the unification of our two realms into a single kingdom. However, this had been aborted after revolution struck Lake City, casting away their monarch into exile.\n\nHowever, with the return of Lake City's rightful rulers, Heavenly Snow has asked us to honour this treaty, demanding that King Grimhoof bend his knee to Lake City's dominance."
 lakecity.10.a:0 "We must bend our knees."
 lakecity.10.b:0 "They shall not take our freedom!"

 lakecity.11.t:0 "Deponya Folds"
 lakecity.11.d:0 "At dawn, an envoy entered the court of King Grimhoof on behalf of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow. These diplomats showed little restraint in their dialog and claimed to have only a single demand for the King. Their request was that King Grimhoof pledge allegiance to Grand Prince Heavenly Snow, as set out in a treaty signed nearly 150 years ago by their predecessors.\n\nThe King, seeing his hopelessness in the face of Lake City's superior army, folded at the request and formally submitted, promising us troops, tribute, and loyalty in future endeavours."
 lakecity.11.a:0 "Excellent!"

 lakecity.12.t:0 "Deponya Banishes our Emissary"
 lakecity.12.d:0 "At dawn, an envoy entered the court of King Grimhoof on behalf of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow. These diplomats showed little restraint in their dialog, claiming to have only a single demand for the King. They demanded that King Grimhoof pledge allegiance to Grand Prince Heavenly Snow, as set out in a treaty signed 150 years ago by their ancestors.\n\nThe King, displeased by the supposed arrogance of our diplomats, foolishly dismissed their claims and ejected them from his court. Our representatives and nation were then humiliated before the assembled diplomats and ministers.\n\nWe must strike swiftly and remind Grimhoof of our dominance over his domain. Our armies will cross the Griffking, our tanks will smash his formations, and our planes will bloat out the sky."
 lakecity.12.a:0 "Then we shall take what is ours."

 lakecity.13.t:0 "The Buckrovic Incident"
 lakecity.13.d_knights:0 "In the early Hours of yesterday morning, Lake City Troops crossed the border and surrounded the pony town of Buckrovic. The Lake City general sent a list of demands to the town's garrison commander essentially demanding that all griffons withdraw from the town and the surrounding area.\n\nThe stalemate continued until the Lake City troops, supported by the town's residents, opened fire one the guards and stormed the walls. A group of knights managed to raise the nearby levies and rally them against the invaders. As of this morning, an official communiqué from the Lake City government has been received demanding the total withdraw of [Root.GetName] from all lands east of the River Panacea. There is no doubt that refusing this offer will result in war between us."

A valiant effort by local griffons and ponies managed to lead many of the town’s citizens to safety. Reports say that the Lake City troops where executing any griffon and 'collaborators' they could find. As of this morning, an official communiqué from the Lake City government has been received demanding the total withdraw of [Root.GetName] from all lands east of the River Panacea.

 lakecity.14.d_knights:0 "In the early hours of yesterday morning, a refugee from the occupied town of Buckrovic crossed the border and begged Lake City troops to help save them from the griffon knights who were massacring the ponies in the town.\n\nHorrified by this act of barbarism, the General ordered his troops across the border to save as many ponies possible. The Prince, in his mightily wisdom, has seen fit to support this action and has sent a demand to the Knights to ceases all hostile actions and withdraw from pony lands.\n\nUnfortunetly, this demand was rejected and the Knights have sent their troops, including pony slaves, to fight against us."

 lakecity.15.a:0 "Acceptable."

 lakecity.16.t:0 "The Longsword Problem"
 lakecity.16.d:0 "The County of Longsword was formerly a member of the Griffon Empire before breaking away during the early reign of Grover V. They are one of the eastern most Griffon domains and share a border with the powerful River Coalition. Recently, these lands fought in a border feud between themselves and the equine nation of Lake City which saw the Ponies win and encroach closer towards our capital.\n\nIn an effort to shore up our eastern defences, we must secure what remains of this county and bring them back into the fold of the empire. Only then can we begin to reverse the aggression of equine neighbours."
 lakecity.16.a:0 "We should integrate them."
 lakecity.16.b:0 "We shouldn't interfere."

 lakecity.17.t:0 "An Offer from the Empire"
 lakecity.17.d:0 "Today, diplomats from Griffenheim entered our capital, bringing word from [GRI.GetLeader]. In light of our recent misfortune, at the hooves of the River Coalition, they have requested that our lands be brought back into the fold the Griffon Empire.\n\nThey promise to allow [Root.GetLeader] to retain their titles, and would ensure that our lands remain safe in the face of equine invasion.\n\nHowever, to accept such terms would cost us our complete autonomy."
 lakecity.17.a:0 "We must for our survival."
 lakecity.17.b:0 "We're fine on our own."

 lakecity.18.t:0 "Longsword Accepts"
 lakecity.18.d:0 "Longsword has accepted our offer to be integrated into the Empire."

 lakecity.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 lakecity.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Offered Us an Alliance"
 lakecity.20.d:0 "When Lake City announced that it would be formally leaving the River Coalition it sent ripples throughout the alliance, greatly destabilizing the delicate balanced created over the last one hundred years.\n\nHowever, diplomats apporached the court of [Root.GetLeader] today on behalf of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow. They claimed that the Grand Prince wished to seek a new alliance between our nations, promising us an opportunity to regain lands lost to the Knightly Order of Hellquill.\n\nThough, to accept such terms would greatly tarnish our reputation with the other members of the River Coalition."
 lakecity.20.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 lakecity.20.b:0 "We see your games, Lake City."

 lakecity.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Accepted our Alliance Offer"
 lakecity.21.d:0 "Our emissaries returned with positive news from [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] has pledged to support our alliance and will formally leave the Coltstream Accord."

 lakecity.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Rejected our Alliance Offer"

 lakecity.22.a:0 "Then they shall burn."

 lakecity.23.t:0 "Anti-Military Actions in Lake City"
 lakecity.23.d:0 "In recent years, the army of Lake City has been projecting an increasing amount of influence within the society and politics of its nation. They have orchestrated politically motivated assassinations, created border feuds with Griffon nations, and have made their presence obvious in every aspect of life.\n\nThis has been very worrisome for our administration, as more extremist branches of the Lake City army have been pushing for a Lake City independent of the River Coalition. This would greatly weaken the Coltstream Accord and open up our lands to further invasion and raids.\n\nHowever, the recent election of Wavebreaker, and his harmony-aligned Social Democrats, have seen the civilian government adopt a comprehensive platform to curtail the military's influence.\n\nThis military will not take this lying down however, and we can expect a new era of political violence. Yet, by offering military and security assistance to Wavebreaker's government, we can help them in this transitional period."
 lakecity.23.a:0 "We must ensure that this movement succeeds."
 lakecity.23.b:0 "We should leave them to their own devices."

 lakecity.25.t:0 "Assassinatinon Attempt on Wavebreaker"
 lakecity.25.d:0 "A gunshot rang out through the streets of Jezeragrad today, followed immediately by the rapid rattle of machine gun fire. Then a pause, an explosion, and a few more gunshots. After this brief tremor of violence all was silent.\n\nIn the aftermath, four junior officers of the Lake City army were dead, along with five Ponies of Grand Mayor Wavebreaker's personal entourage. An attempt had been made on his life but through quick thinking the mayor managed to avoid his demise.\n\nWhile today's council meeting has been cancelled, the vigour of the SDP to curtail the military has only been strengthened. It is expected that the coming days will see a series of new anti-military legislations drafted and voted into law."

 lakecity.26.d:0 "A gunshot rang out through the streets of Jezeragrad today, followed immediately by the rapid rattle of machine gun fire. Then a pause, an explosion, and a few more gunshots. After this brief tremor of violence all was silent.\n\nIn the aftermath, two junior officers of the Lake City army were dead, along with eight Ponies of Grand Mayor Wavebreaker's personal entourage. During the fighting, the Grand Mayor caught a piece of shrapnel to his leg, severing an artery. He bled out mere blocks from the ambush.\n\nIn his place, the military has put in power Westerly Leeward, mandating that he will finish Wavebreaker's term. It is expected that Leeward will reverse many of the anti-military measures put in place by the Wavebreaker administration."
 lakecity.26.a:0 "The horror!"

 lakecity.27.t:0 "Foreign Interference"
 lakecity.27.d:0 "During a raid upon anti-government reactionaries, it was discovered that they held a wealth of military equipment and weaponry. It would appear that these rebels were recieving technical and material assistance from an organization known as Military Assistance Command, Brodfeld.\n\nWhile not much is known about this group, they seem to be a special operations branch of a foreign military which is providing assistane to terrorist cells within our lands, in an effor to undermine our revolution."

 lakecity_macb_event.2.d:0 "In the dead of night an attack was launched upon one of our industrial complexes, destroying several storage lockers full of steel, rubber, and other precious materials.

 lakecity_macb_event.3.d:0 "At the break of dawn, several explosions went off across our domain.

However, when local forces assualted the supposed compound they were confronted by an abandoned fortress.\n\nWhile this may have once been the stronghold of this accursed terrorist cell, they had left it behind, with not a shred of equipment remaining.\n\nThe only sign of recent occupancy was a note nailed to one of the fortress' doors.

This led to a coordinated raid launch by local forces, who rapidly besieged the stronghold and swiftly captured it. Now, most of MACB's high command lies within our talons and the organization has been effectively crushed.\n\nAny remaining cells will either be destroyed in the coming weeks or they have already begun to flee northwards, into the River Coalition.\n\nIt is now time to rebuild after their reign of terror."

 lakecityflavor.1.t:0 "Lake Festival"
 lakecityflavor.1.d:0 "Every year, Ponies from across Lake City come together in Jezeragrad for the city's annual Lake Festival. The festival originally dates back to the reign of Blessed Sword who used the occasion as a chance to shore up the unification of the various tribes around Jezeragrad. Throughout the First Lake City Principality, this holiday was celebrated with a week of parades, banquets, tournaments, and ended with a massive boat race around Jezeragrad Harbour. The winner of this race would then become quite the celebrity and be granted a private audience with the reigning monarch.\n\nAfter the fall of the monarchy, the holiday continued to be celebrated annually in much the same way. Though one noticeable difference is that the winner of the boat race would recieve an audience with the Grand Mayor, a key to the city of Jezeragrad, and a generous prize of gold and other treasures.\n\nIn the last fifty years however, the festival has been in steady decline as the city of Jezeragrad has been struggling to finance the opulent festivities which once marked the occasion. The week is now a weekend, the banquets reduced in grandeur, the parades are now mostly made up of military formations, and the boat race only attracts a few diehard participants.\n\nIt would greatly increase the morale of our nation if we were to provide this event with proper funding, financing a week of festivities which could rival those of Blessed Sword's reign."

 lakecityflavor.2.t:0 "A Week of Grandeur"
 lakecityflavor.2.d:0 "Two million Ponies entered the city of Jezeragrad this week, coming from all corners of Lake City and the River Coalition, attracted by what promised to be the grandest Lake Festival in a lifetime.\n\nA pier had been constructed on the waterfront, with an Equestrian styled theme park built upon it. The rides, which most foals had only ever heard rumours of, had been imported from Manehatten and Canterlot and were opened for public use. It was reported that the line for the Ferris Wheel got so long that Ponies were spending upwards of four hours in the queues. Yet, not even this dampened the spirits of the families who came to witness this.\n\nEvery night was marked by banquets, with millions of tonnes of grains, fruit, ales, salt, and other food products pouring into the city in preparation. The weekend feasts featured foods from all across the globe, including Griffking rye, Zebrican coffee and chocolate, and peppers from the jungle of southern Equestria.\n\nThe Friday parade lasted six hours and included military units which were showered in flowers and cheers, floats sponsored by Lake City’s guilds celebrating their technological innovation and products, and exhibits from all manner of organizations and foreign sponsors. One memorable float was that of New Mareland which had an intricate mural of flowers planted upon it which showed the cooperation between our two nations.\n\nLastly, there was the boat race, held on Saturday evening. Last year, this race included 30 ships. This year registration had to be stopped at 300, until pressure called for a second, and later third race to be created. The winners of each of these races then went into a three-way tiebreaker. Overall, the tournament was won by the Bluenose in a photo finish.\n\nAs Sunday rolled around, the train station, roads, and waters leading out of Jezeragrad were clogged with Ponies attempting to exit the city. The festival had been a success, greatly contributing to national morale and the perception of our republic to outside nations."

While private benefactors are scrambling to re-establish a smaller scale event, the hopes of ever seeing a proper revitalization look grim.\n\nYet, the public outcry against this cancellation has been largely muted, as it would seem that few Ponies are really caught up in the mysticism of this once grand tradition."

 lakecityflavor.4.d:0 "The Neighin Maru is one of a hundred fishing vessals which prowl the freshwaters off of Jezeragrad in order to find Walleye, Salmon, and Pike for the city’s denizens. The ship left port about a week ago and was suppose to return yesterday morning burdened with fish. However, that wasn’t the case.\n\nInstead, the vessel has been reported missing with the last known transmission happening three days ago on the southern most edge of the lake.\n\nWhile it’s not uncommon for vessels to go missing, the Neighin Maru was carrying renown Lake City biologist, Case Study. Already, the press within Jezeragrad has picked up this story and have begun to publish it, creating a public outcry to find the ship and its crew.\n\nCaptain Greenpeace of the Lake City Coastguard has asked for our permission to use the organization’s fleet to begin prowling the waters in an effort to find the ship. This endeavour would be extremely costly but to do otherwise would likely sentence these fishingponies to their doom."

An effort had been made to begin the search at the sight of the last known transmission and then move outwards in larger and larger circles.\n\nSo far, this search has failed to find any trace of the ship and the morale for this mission has steadily diminished. The only good news is that while there is no sign of the ship, there is also no sign of wreckage or debris which hopefully means the ship remains in one piece.\n\nThe mission is also running into troubles in terms of funding as the constant running, maintenance, and crewing of coastguard vessels has become a costly endeavour. Hopefully this search ends soon, for better or worse."
 lakecityflavor.5.a:0 "Continue the search, we must find this ship."

 lakecityflavor.6.d:0 "At dawn, a patrol craft of the Lake City Coastguard stumbled upon a small beach atoll located fourteen kilometres north-east of the site of the Neighin Maru’s last transmission. Upon circling to the northern shore of the island, the craft discovered the beached remains of the Neighin Maru left in impeccable condition.\n\nSeveral minutes later, a flare was launched from the atoll and the patrol craft landed. The crew of the Neighin Maru, including famed biologist Case Study, were all accounted for upon this island in good health.\n\nApparently, the Neighin Maru had hit a gathering of rocks while returning to port, which punctured the ship’s hull and allowed water into the electrical systems. In an effort to save his crew, the captain had headed for the nearest landmass and beached his ship. Since then, the crew had been surviving upon the local vegetation of the island, lake water, and the hold full of salted Pike.\n\nIt is expected that the Neighin Maru’s crew will be returned to Jezeragrad in the coming hours."

 lakecityflavor.7.d:0 "The Blessedgrad Grain Commission is Lake City’s chief producer, importer, and supplier of staple crops such as rice, rye, barely, and wheat. They were founded in 903 as a government corporation to help control the instable price of grains during the Eastern Griffonian droughts of 899-905. In 961, this corporation was privatized by the Storm Wind administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Fruits is Lake City’s chief producer, importer, and supplier of fruits, including oranges, mangos, and the highly profitable apple trade. They were founded in 974 when the Trotshima Citrus Collective bought a majority share in the Mareji Apple Estate, unifying the two companies.\n\nRecently, these two guilds came into conflict over a 7 square kilometer stretch of land along the Griffking river, a highly profitable location which has extreme fertility and produces high yields of agricultural goods.\n\nAt first glance, both companies seem to have a very strong claim to the land and they have entered into what promises to be a lengthy legal dispute. However, such a battle would leave these highly profitable lands fallow. As such, maybe we should bring both parties to the table and attempt to broker a government backed deal."

Afterwards, it was mostly smooth sailing with the occasional bit of formal assistance offered to help smooth over some of the finer details.\n\nThe deal eventually reached would see the lands sold to a neutral third party, and the profits divided between the two firms in a 60-40 split, in Republican Fruits favour. Already, a bidding war has erupted over the lands with two of Lake City’s largest timber barons putting forward the most generous bids.\n\nThe press is celebrating this as the deal of the year and both corporations have seen modest increases in the value of their stocks (BGC – up 2.51%, RFT – up 3.04%)."

The tension between the two firms was so intense that it was reported that guild-sponsored military formations had been mobilized. Thankfully, a deal was offered at the eleventh hour, and from there things seemed to progress in a far more civilized manner.\n\nThe deal would see the Blessedgrad Grain Commission acquire the disputed lands in exchange for a soy plantation located several kilometres inland. This deal would benefit the two guilds equally as the river front property is ideal for a rice farm while the former soy fields are rich in nitrogen which will help foster a productive apple orchard.\n\nThe press is already celebrating this as the deal of the decade and both companies stocks experienced respectable showings in the Jezeragrad Stock Exchange (BGC - up 5.61% , RFT - up 7.12%)."

Unfortunately, the threat of violence did not taper the hostility of the two legal teams.\n\nWithin an hour, the first act of violence was reported as a petrol bomb burst inside of a Republican Fruits warehouse, setting it ablaze. This was followed almost immediately by a platoon of Lake City soldiers stopping a convoy of Blessedgrad Grain Commission trucks and requisitioning them for ‘official’ military purposes.\n\nThe first death was reported ten minutes later as a Republican Fruits security officer shot a Pony he assumed was a rival saboteur. This was not the case.\n\nImmediately after this incident, the Lake City army was called in to stabilize the situation.\n\nThe press is already calling this incident a disaster and it is expected that the legal battle which will follow will take years and cost both firms millions. In response, both companies took a massive hit in the Jezeragrad stock exchange. (BGL – down 15.23%, RFT – down 18.68)."

This was then followed by a small speech.\n\nWhile Heavenly Snow has requested that his birthday not be celebrated, his senior advisors are attempting to consult him to do otherwise.

Then, at noon, the Grand Prince and his wife took their place upon a balcony, waving to the crowds.\n\nHeavenly Snow thanked his subjects for coming out to wish him a Happy Birthday, and appreciated their loyalty.

 LCT_develop_civ_industry_desc:0 "A number of Lake City's guilds have expressed interest in purchasing tracts of publicly held lands. By consenting to this request, we'd see a boon to economic growth as fallow lands are converted into farms, mines, and various other enterprises."
 LCT_develop_mil_industry:0 "Buy Weapons from the Guilds"

 LCT_damm_the_river_desc:0 "The construction of a hydroelectric dam upon the Griffking is no easy feat.

 LCT_build_steekworks:0 "Blessedgrad Steelworks"
 LCT_build_steekworks_desc:0 "The province of Blessedzemlja is rich in iron but poor in coal. This means that the rich reserves have previously gone untouched as the heat needed to purify the iron has been absent.

 LCT_build_aluminium_plant:0 "Blessedgrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_build_aluminium_plant_desc:0 "The construction of the Griffking Dam has both reduced the flow of the Griffking River and help better manage its seasonal extremes. This means that previously unfeasible economic projects, on the banks of the river, have become a reality. One such project is an aluminum mine and corresponding smelter in the province's capital."
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant:0 "Expand the Blessedgrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant_desc:0 "The success of the Blessedgrad Aluminum Plant has invigorated private investment into aluminum mines and smelters throughout the provinces of Blessedzemlja.

 LCT_invest_in_neuculer_power_desc:0 "The splitting of the atom has opened up a world of possibilities for us. One such opportunity has been the construction of a power generation facility which will be fueled by the controlled fission of uranium-235. This would offer us a secure and clean source of energy without relying upon foreign imports fo coal and oil."
 
 LCT_improve_science_1:0 "Expand the University of Jezeragrad"
 LCT_improve_science_1_desc:0 "The University of Jezeragrad has been the premier location for Lake City students lookng for an education in law, theology, and philosophy.

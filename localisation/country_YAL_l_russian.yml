 #Focuses#
 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidise Industry"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Although some of our more radical economists despise any government interference into the economy, analyses have shown that there is much to gain from subsidising our industries. A few key investments will give us the opportunity to innovate new production methods that will give our factories an advantage over foreign competitors."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Revitalise Yale"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Yale, the old capital and namesake of our country has slowly but surely been eclipsed by Greenback as the heart of [YAL.GetNameDef]. However, the city lays at a strategic location for trade within the region and still has room to grow its industry. An investment in Yale now could see the city regain some of its former splendour."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Invest in the Capital"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Greenback has been the throbbing heart of [YAL.GetNameDef] since the industrial revolution kicked off. Many of the old cities in Griffonia grew decadent and new centres of industry and culture took their place. With the city already being the home of our most important companies, we ought to incentivise them to expand their production in the city."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Ironworks in Yale"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Yale’s industry is experiencing a healthy growth now and those new factories are creating their own demands. Steel is the key to keep our heavy industry working and it would be prudent to create ironworks on site. A steady supply of iron is sure to make the city even more industrious."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Open the Tungsten Mine"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Tungsten is usually mined in small underground extraction sites. However, an open tungsten mine would mean a way higher yield of this strategically important material, seeing as shells made from this material are essential for modern artillery pieces. Sure, this won’t be pretty to look at, but the locals will surely be swayed by more jobs. "

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Greenback Steel"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Weapons, cars and many other goods are made from steel. We are lucky enough to have enough mines within our borders to supply us with the necessary ores. However, our steel output can be raised even higher by funding another steel mill in the capital."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Secure Aluminium Production"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Although steel keeps heavy industry turning, aluminium is needed for some high-tech goods like planes. By investing in aluminium production alongside our steel production, our industry will be ready for the demands of the future."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Highways to Yale"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Yale’s infrastructure has been neglected for years, since the area lacked the heavy industrial traffic of Greenback. It is imperative that Yale gets properly integrated into our transportation network, so that the southwest will also be open for future industrial development."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Rails to the North"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of the trade to Griffenheim has happened via river, which meant the cities in the north of the country missed out on vital investments into highways and railroads. With the Empire growing ever more volatile, it may be strategic and not economic interests that get us to finally properly connect the north to the capital."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Station One"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our rail network has been planned from Greenback since the first rails were laid down. The station building, a masterpiece of late-imperial architecture in the capital, aptly called Station One by those griffons who work on the railways is the hub for goods and passenger transport. It is time to double down and expand Station One with new platforms and warehouses."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Modernise the Curriculum"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "The speed at which science advances is growing ever faster, leaving griffons in more unfortunate countries behind. However, the universities must keep a steady flow of students coming from the younger generations. To give them the highest chance to succeed in higher education, we must update the curriculum so that the pupils aren’t taught outdated knowledges and refuted theories."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Revise the Banking Law"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Banking is a time-honoured tradition in all of the Herzland, but the laws that govern these bankers are opaque by design. We will have our most senior law professors write a new Banking Law, one that favours our country over these transnationally operating bankers. Even laissez-faire economists agree that the law should guard against perverse incentives as to make the economy shock-resistant."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Refurbish the Public Schools"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "With most of the education budget going to universities, our public schools have been chronically underfunded. They require everything, new classrooms, textbooks and even functioning heating so that our young ones don’t have to sit in class with two winter coats on. We shall provide for our future talent!"

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Land Consolidation"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "The age of feudalism has left its mark on our country as it has on most of Griffonia. Marriages, ancient contracts and feuds have made the countryside a confusing patchwork of farms and fields owned by small farmers and big estates. By encouraging land consolidation, where farmers trade their lands to make more efficient and larger fields, our agriculture will flourish."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "The Science of Agriculture"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Agricultural Studies is not the most prestigious field of science, but the field is rapidly developing. Rational management theories and advances in biology and organic chemistry, along with mechanised tools are paramount to increase food production. Let us remember that food surplus has been the engine of growth for civilisations since the dawn of time."

 YAL_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
 YAL_universal_education_desc:0 "Not every griffon in our country has the intrinsic motivation that draws so many of our people to the pursuit of knowledge. In fact, a lot of griffons in the countryside refuse to send their chicks to school, preferring that they work on the land. Mandatory education is a necessary change, which will make sure that every talented griffon makes its way into the hallowed halls of our university!"

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Embrace the Gold Standard"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "When the Empire ruled Griffonia, there was no doubt about the stability of its currency. Now that the ironclad faith in Griffenheim is but a footnote in the history books, we will require a new idea. By tying our currency to gold, our money will be stable, as no griffon will doubt the value of the most precious metal!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Methods for a New Millennium"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our industry has been lagging behind academia for a while now, due to a lack of R&D investments made by our companies. If we are to move our industry to the second millennium, the state must intervene by investing in industrial modernisation. Science will make it so our factories produce more with less!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Expand Yale University"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Yale University is the oldest and most prestigious university in the country, but much like the city in which it stands, the institute has been overshadowed by modernity. However, its expansive library and tradition for excellence warrant another investment. We must commission an experienced architect to build a new wing for the old university, so that Yale may use it to soar to new heights!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Our laboratories, scientists and other research facilities are ready for the next step to push the boundaries of griffon knowledge. With the Research Focus Program, the government will set out a goal for a period of 200 days. In this time, all universities will focus their attention on tackling this particular area of science, as to produce immediate benefits for our people."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "The Great Yale Archives"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff was both an architectural visionary and a griffon working to preserve our knowledge. He is responsible for many of the reforms that made Yale what it is today, but he could never see his magnum opus finished. A massive archive, housing all the world’s knowledge. The construction of this elaborate building will be a great task, but a worthy project indeed for Borean’s heirs."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Invite Griffonia’s Finest"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff envisioned that his archives would help build peace amongst the griffons of the continent, by becoming a meeting place of the scholarly elite and a beacon against the ignorance that in his view, led to warfare. With the archives complete, we must invite the best griffon scholars from every nation to study in the Yale Archives. May science lead to understanding between Boreas’s chosen."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "The Treasures of the Past"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Warfare, ignorance and malice has destroyed much of the knowledge of the ancient Griffonian Empire. The archives are helping historians and other researchers to piece together the knowledge of the past. Much of the ancients’ knowledge may be outdated, but sometimes they seem to be wiser than we could have ever imagined."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the situation in Griffenheim turning increasingly more volatile, we must gather the Council of Rectors to plan out a new course for [YAL.GetNameDef]. The death of the Emperor and the choice of a new regent has shattered what remained of imperial unity. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so perhaps it is time to listen to some of the country’s more radical minds."
 
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia:0 "Bruma and Gamia"
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia_desc:0 "In the west of Yale lie the two university cities of Bruma and Gamia. These universities maintain close ties with the nearby Eyr Archonate seated in Romau and have become a brooding place for radicalism. Gamia houses brilliant biologists who dare to push beyond the boundaries of the ethical. The Bruma social science faculty, meanwhile, rejects liberal theories about society in favour of a communal system."

 YAL_archons_patronage:0 "The Archons’ Patronage"
 YAL_archons_patronage_desc:0 "The Archons are delighted that Yale has chosen to favour the university of Bruma. To promote Bruma’s traditionalist theories in the rest of Yale, they have chosen to increase their investments into our country, increasing the church’s control of the education system in particular. With the Archon’s Patronage, our country will rise to greatness. "

 YAL_additional_funding:0 "Charitas"
 YAL_additional_funding_desc:0 "Although the role of charity in griffon society is often debated and disputed, a charm offensive by the church would smooth out tensions in Yale. Many commoners question the renewed prevalence of religion in our society, but if we can show the best side of the church, their concerns will melt like dew in the sun."

 YAL_archons_visit:0 "Plan the Archon’s Visit"
 YAL_archons_visit_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Eros VII is the embodiment of the traditional values that will save Yale from the culture-destroying ideologies of republicanism and socialism. However, some of the people still doubt the benevolent intent of the voice of Boreas. A visit by the Archon will remind the griffons of Yale how Boreas would want us to live."

 YAL_social_sciences:0 "Bruma’s Social Sciences"
 YAL_social_sciences_desc:0 "The university of Bruma is an exception amongst universities. The faculty for social sciences rejects the universalist ideologies of harmony and socialism as Equestrian attempts to export their way of life. According to the professors of Bruma, if Yale is to weather the coming storm, we must return to our past and look for guidance in our own culture."

 YAL_indoctrinate_students:0 "Indoctrinate Students"
 YAL_indoctrinate_students_desc:0 "University students are interesting griffons. They have learned so little, yet they think they understand so much. The student body of Bruma already knows their place, working tirelessly to improve Yalian society. It is time to discipline these lazy, good for nothing young griffons into birds Boreas can be proud of."

 YAL_address_population:0 "Local Ethics"
 YAL_address_population_desc:0 "Many of our academics have grown too detached from the real world and the normal people. Let us return to them and learn from the people. The answer to what a just society is cannot be found in any book from Equestrian philosophers. The answer is out there, in the street. We have but to go a-looking. "

 YAL_common_cause:0 "The Common Cause"
 YAL_common_cause_desc:0 "Now that everygriffon in our country is in agreement with the importance of incorporating our culture into government, we can work on the task at hand. More government discretion will be needed to make sure this works and several rights will have to be temporarily restricted to ensure that the process of pursuing the common cause proceeds smoothly."

 YAL_new_council_member:0 "A New Council Member"
 YAL_new_council_member_desc:0 "To ensure an easy advantage for Bruma and Gamia in the Council of Rectors, we will need another vote. We will have our allies in the church convince the people that the Council requires religious guidance. With this pressure, we will be able to push for a new member; the Prelate of the Yaledom."

 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters:0 "Silence!"
 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters_desc:0 "With the Prelate of Yaledom now being one of the most powerful griffons in the country, many voices say that is a betrayal of the ideals of our nation. We cannot have these griffons organize and bundle their strength against us. We must silence these voices. Forcefully."

 YAL_offer_compromise:0 "Calm the Voices of Dissent"
 YAL_offer_compromise_desc:0 "The Prelate’s ascend to the Council has caused many concerns amongst student and professor alike. With compromises, flattery and bribes, we will be able to calm the situation down. It is worth the effort if every Yalian wholeheartedly supports us in the long run."

 YAL_challenge_griffenheim:0 "Challenge Griffenheim!"
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim_desc:0 "The foolish Griffenheim nobility have forced out the Archon of Boreas. Without him as the regent, who knows what corruption these nobles may force into the head of Grover VI. It is time to restore the church before Griffenheim unleashes disaster upon us all."

 YAL_stabilize_council:0 "Stabilise the Council"
 YAL_stabilize_council_desc:0 "The Council of Rectors has a hard time agreeing on anything, with griffons like the Rector of Cyrusval in it. With our newfound power, it is time to make sure the council no longer blocks our efforts to return Yale to its best possible form. They will bend, or they will break."

 YAL_cooperation_offer:0 "Into the Fold"
 YAL_cooperation_offer_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has rightfully been appointed regent of the Empire. With him leading the faithful, a new era is sure to follow. That leaves us with a question for our own land. What purpose will Yale have in this new order? Perhaps Boreas has a use for us yet."

 YAL_biological_sciences:0 "The Science of Life"
 YAL_biological_sciences_desc:0 "Gamia is known for its biology department. While most universities have codes of conduct that restrict their attempts to conduct experiments on the living, this university is dedicated to a pure form of knowledge acquisition. Now, nothing will hold Gamia’s biologists back."

 YAL_initiate_research:0 "Unlimited Potential"
 YAL_initiate_research_desc:0 "With Yale quickly turning away from conventional ethics, there is an opportunity to remove the last obstacles to scientific progress. By altering guidelines and regulations that bar unlimited experimentation, our full potential will finally be unlocked."

 YAL_griffon_biology:0 "Griffon Biology"
 YAL_griffon_biology_desc:0 "We must begin our research at the basis. The griffon body. A unique blend of several different types of animals, it is clear that the griffon has adapted to a level of complexity beyond anything else on this planet. Some griffons even have some potential for certain types of magic, further proving our superiority."

 YAL_encourage_student_research:0 "Encourage Student Research"
 YAL_encourage_student_research_desc:0 "The students, especially the younger ones, are still a bit weary of going along with our methods. However, there is much potential in Gamia and we must encourage these griffons to let go of any ‘morality’ they got taught outside these walls. Progress is the ultimate goal."

 YAL_delve_deeper:0 "Delve Deeper"
 YAL_delve_deeper_desc:0 "Our research is expanding our fields of vision and the future is becoming ever clearer. The griffon body and its energy, divine essence, life itself. These are not, should not, be the domain of just the Gods. Understanding and manipulating these essential concepts is within our reach. It won’t be much longer now. . ."

 YAL_project_auferstehung:0 "Project Auferstehung"
 YAL_project_auferstehung_desc:0 "Life, as it is commonly understood, is an ending process. However, science may yet pierce the veil that separates the living from the death and retrieve a soul lost to our world. Imagine the implications!"

 YAL_project_weihe:0 "Project Weihe"
 YAL_project_weihe_desc:0 "Objectively, the Gods hold the most knowledge about the world and therefore, their instructions should be followed. However, the great distance between us and the heavens has made their word unclear and up to interpretation. What if we could retrieve this information directly at the source?"

 YAL_project_wohlstand:0 "Project Wohlstand"
 YAL_project_wohlstand_desc:0 "The world is run by a very complex system of trade, prices and economic laws. But the griffon mind was never constructed to properly take advantage of these systems, as the inferior understanding of our colleagues in Middenheim demonstrates perfectly. Altering the mind is not beyond our ability, however. . ."


###Non-Alligned###
 YAL_central_universities:0 "The Central Universities"
 YAL_central_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Greenback, Greengate and Middenheim all have different specialties, but their leadership shares a similar vision. Ultimately, the goal of science is to serve society. Whether it is with new medicine, new technology or by increasing prosperity, we will work for a better future!"

 YAL_greengate_engineering:0 "Greengate’s Engineering"
 YAL_greengate_engineering_desc:0 "The foremost engineers, both electronic and mechanical, have made Greengate their favoured university. The university is close to Greenback, the industrial beating heart of the country. The engineers of Greengate are eager to receive more funding, promising quick returns in technical advancements!"

 YAL_radar_research:0 "Project Sentinel"
 YAL_radar_research_desc:0 "For some time now, Greengate’s engineers have dreamt of our own RADAR system. Not only will such an array provide us with invaluable scientific data, the listening post would help us keep an eye on our neighbours and spot incoming aircraft. Of course, there is a price tag involved."

 YAL_better_air_detection:0 "Watch Everything"
 YAL_better_air_detection_desc:0 "Project Sentinel is a resounding success and the data is flowing in. However, our scientists hunger for more data to crunch, while our military command is eager to see even more of our rivals’ movements. A little more funding could mean we can improve our Sentinel stations even more!"

 YAL_industrial_engineering:0 "The Machine Spirit"
 YAL_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "A group of very dedicated engineers have begun wearing robes in our university and they also seem weirdly obsessed with prosthetics. They are really knowledgeable, but they maybe care a bit too much about their prized machinery. Their innovations may serve us well, but let’s leave them alone with their machine spirit."

 YAL_synthetic_research:0 "Transmutating the Black Gold"
 YAL_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Greengate University’s heritage goes all the way back to that of griffon alchemists. These proto-scientists diligently worked to use magic and science to make lead into gold. Of course, without modern techniques, their efforts were doomed to fail. But some of our engineers are insisting that we give it another try!"

 YAL_form_computer_faculty:0 "Found the Computing Faculty"
 YAL_form_computer_faculty_desc:0 "Mathematics is the foundation for all science, in fact it is the frame through which we understand the fundamental processes of our world. Visionaries already dreamt of Automatic Computers, but with electronics and mechanics combined, our new Computing Faculty will lead the way into the future!"

 YAL_encryption_decryption:0 "The Wingaarden Theorem"
 YAL_encryption_decryption_desc:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a Feathisian mechanical engineer, is making amazing breakthroughs in the field of computer technology! We should head his ideas closely and make sure that our Computing Faculty stays up to date in this new and boundless field of innovation!"

 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering:0 "Pioneers in Engineering"
 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering_desc:0 "Greengate University has become a campus full of exciting possibilities! The experiments and theories conducted there seem way beyond the possible. The machines built there will revolutionise modern life when they become available for the public. These pioneers are paving the way towards a better tomorrow!"

 YAL_health_sciences:0 "Greenback’s Academy of Medicine"
 YAL_health_sciences_desc:0 "The largest city of the country is also one of many problems. Hard work in the factory, pollution and poverty all harm many griffons. The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done miracles to advance the medical sciences. With substantial support, cures that seem decades away can be achieved within reasonable time!"

 YAL_greenback_hospital:0 "Greenback University Hospital"
 YAL_greenback_hospital_desc:0 "Close to the University of Greenback stands the biggest hospital in Yale, where thousands are being threated simultaneously. It is also the training ground for many doctors in training and a place where through trial and error, science advances slowly. Some refurbishments, extra staff and a new wing are sorely needed to keep our healthcare in order."

 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures:0 "Modernised Medical Procedures"
 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures_desc:0 "The lessons from Greenback will have to be rolled out across the country, if we are to keep our entire population healthy. Every death is a tragedy and with the latest medical technology for all hopsitals we can keep more griffons alive. Our demographic scientists predict that this may lead to a population boom!"

 YAL_pharmacology:0 "Pharmacology"
 YAL_pharmacology_desc:0 "The study of the practical application of new medicine is an up and coming branch of health sciences. Most academics spend too much time in laboratories, crafting up theories and doing controlled tests. Let us focus on how medicine works in the real world, as better medicines will benefit both the people and the army."

 YAL_enhancement_drugs:0 "Combat Stimulants"
 YAL_enhancement_drugs_desc:0 "Our soldiers are subject to all sort of hardships, both physical and mental. The griffon body already has a lot of ways to deal with them, such as adrenaline. However, to give our soldiers a better chance, we can increase their combat effectiveness and perhaps make life at the front slightly easier. Of course, we do not have conclusive data to support that these drugs have any negative side-effects."

 YAL_magical_potential:0 "Magical Potential"
 YAL_magical_potential_desc:0 "The griffon body is different than the one of the unicorn or the changeling, but we are still able to perform acts that could be classified as magical. We must research what makes a griffon magical. How can we alter and increase this? Is magic something immaterial or is there an organ responsible for this? Who knows what we will find after a little research? "

 YAL_unravel_the_mind:0 "Unravel the Mind"
 YAL_unravel_the_mind_desc:0 "The brain sits mightily atop the body, controlling every movement and processing every piece of information it receives, without us consciously thinking it. How curious that we now contemplate the contemplator. How do we think? What did the Gods give us that makes us conscious of our own existence? Is it possible to find out? We must know!"

 YAL_understand_the_body:0 "Understand the Body"
 YAL_understand_the_body_desc:0 "The body houses our soul and our mind, but is the most curious part of this trio. Its complexity and harmony seem to always reveal new depths. It is clear that with each step we take towards understanding our basic physical characteristics, more questions reveal themselves. But knowledge is the reward of the faithful searcher. Knowledge that could save lives. "

 YAL_promise_of_health:0 "The Oath of the Physician"
 YAL_promise_of_health_desc:0 "“I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability, but never with a view to injury. Into each house I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing. And what I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, I will hold to be holy secrets. If I carry out this oath, may I gain reputation among all griffons for my art; but if I break it, may the opposite befall me.”"

 yale.1.t:0 "Project Delays"
 yale.1.d:0 "Things have been rough at the Great Archives’ construction site. Deliveries of supplies not arriving on time, unusually bad weather and a series of small cases of plain bad luck have together caused a serious delay. No griffon in particular is to blame, but the project will take significantly longer now."
 yale.1.a:0 "Recalculate the timetables. Again."
 
 yale.2.t:0 "Demand for more Funding"
 yale.2.d:0 "“What do you mean, you forgot to put a zero behind that price? You incompetent son of a pony!”\n\nThe head administrator of the Archives project raged uncontrollably at one of his clerks. Of course, the poor griffon could not magically summon a sack of gold coins, so there was little use. The fact remained. The project had gone way over its already ridiculously high budget. He had to ask the government to increase funding, or risk further delays."
 yale.2.a:0 "Increase funding!"

 yale.8.d:0 "The question of the gods’, and more specifically of Boreas’s, true nature had been fascinating the scholars of Yale for a long time. Now, with the most modern techniques and a scientific curiosity some more conservative griffons would call unholy madness, the Yale observatory was ready to pierce into the Heavenly Domain of the Gods.\n\nTheologists, astronomers and physicists collaborated in ‘Project Weihe’, pinpointing the supposed location of Boreas in the night sky, while the most talented engineers prepared the technical instruments which would tear open a path to see into heaven.\n\nAnd on one fateful night, the project was set, and both audio and visual data was coming in from the intricate machinery set up in the university. First nothing, but if the griffons looked close enough, something materialised before their very eyes. Someone, in fact! An intelligent looking, stern, pale, featherless griffon looked back down. His beak seemed distorted in the image, but there was no doubt that this was the face of Boreas. The researchers became ever more excited, they had definitively proven the existence of God! Amidst the excited chatter of self-important scientists congratulating each other, the audio instruments picked up a message: In old Imperial script he proclaimed: "T Genus Emptio."\n\nThis instruction confused the scholars and the theologists present could not place this divine command in any context. When the scholars tried to re-establish contact with Boreas later, the image never appeared again, nor were there anymore messages from the heavens. Perhaps it was better if the wider world did not learn about Boreas’s true message. . . "

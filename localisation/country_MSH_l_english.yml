MSH_prophets_call:0 "The Word of the Prophet"
MSH_prophets_call_desc:0 "There are too many interpretations of the divine, too many conflicting beliefs and practices in the Great Lakes. The Prophet, however, knows the sacred truth. He preaches the only true way of worshipping God, the spirits and the ancestors, and his Word is written down in scripture. He is organizing a formal priesthood around him, burning heathen shamans with holy flames. At the same time, he is both guardian of sacred tradition ambitious reformer. Under his guidance, the faith of the western zebras will at last become a proper, organized religion."
MSH_prophets_warriors:0 "The Sword of the Prophet"
MSH_prophets_warriors_desc:0 "There are many who will refuse to accept the Prophet's word willingly. God has given us divine mandate to enforce the true way upon those who refuse it, to instate unity and order in the Great Lakes, forgiving our warriors, while the spirits and the ancestors will give them strength to smite their foes."

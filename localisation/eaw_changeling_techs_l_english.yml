 #### Drones
 tech_changeling_a:0 "Specialized Factory Drones"
 tech_changeling_a_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialized tasks, we should look into how to improve our workers. Training a caste drones of workers specifically to work in factories, with the appropriate physical build and techniques to use in the workplace."
 
 tech_changeling_a2:0 "Specialized Miner Drones"
 tech_changeling_a2_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialized tasks, we should further train our workers. We should train a caste of miner drones with the aims of increasing the output of raw resources in the mines. The trained workers will have tougher carapaces from a special diet, and increased stamina for longer shifts underground."
 
 tech_changeling_a3:0 "Specialized Engineer Drones"
 tech_changeling_a3_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialized tasks, we should begin training our troops for specialized engineering tasks. We need dedicated combat engineers to construct temparory fortifications for the soldiers on the front lines. A tougher and stricter training regieme should give these engineers the strength they  need to put up defenses quicker than usual."
 
 #### Love Tree
 tech_changeling_b:0 "Love Extraction"
 tech_changeling_b_desc:0 "Extracting love from another living creature, usually a pony, is a natural process for a changeling. To meet the increased demands of a growing nation, the natural magic involved in the process can be improved through research."
 
 tech_changeling_b2:0 "Love Refining"
 tech_changeling_b2_desc:0 "War does not breed much love among the races of the world. To survive and fight in prolonged wars, we must find a way to get the most out of all the love we can harvest."
 
 tech_changeling_b3:0 "Advanced Breeding Techniques"
 tech_changeling_b3_desc:0 "A surplus of love means more changelings. We can look into methods of making more changelings, these methods can then be taught to the general populance. But first, our hypotheses must be 'tested' on some willing members of our science division."
 
 #### Military
 tech_changeling_c:0 "Warswarms"
 tech_changeling_c_desc:0 "A Warswarm is a group of changelings who have formed a unit to punch a hole in the enemies' front line. They are a versatile unit of changelings with the capacity to wreak havoc on the battlefield"
 
 tech_changeling_c2:0 "Magical Fuel Additives"
 tech_changeling_c2_desc:0 "Improvements to fuel technology and magical innovations have lead to the development of magically enhanced fuel to our vehicles. Our ground vehicles have seen an overall increase to their speed, whilst our aviation department has seen improved turning rates and increased acceleration from their planes."
 
 tech_changeling_c3:0 "Magical Munitions"
 tech_changeling_c3_desc:0 "Magically enhanced munitions are the natural next step for us to take. More explosive power can be packet into artillery  shells, making our shelling operations more efficient. Magical munitions also improve upon the lethality and penetration capabilies of the guns the air force use in their planes."
 
 #### Infiltrator Title

 #### Infiltrator
 tech_infiltrators:0 "Infiltrator Company"
 tech_infiltrators_desc:0 "The Infiltrator Company is a small group of changelings trained specifically to infiltrate both enemy  lines and behind eneny  lines. This is both to provide intel on enemy  movements, but to also disrupt their capabilities."
 
 ## Strategic Path: Country modifiers
 tech_infiltrators_di:0 "Strategic Infiltration"
 tech_infiltrators_di_desc:0 "Favouring large scale infitration, the strategic infiltration doctrine will allow  infiltration companies to covertly supress rebellios groups of individuals. It also details the proper way to scout the enemy."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di2:0 "Chameleon Cloaks"
 tech_infiltrators_di2_desc:0 "The development of magically echanted cloaks that can help hide the identity of a disguised or concealed changeling infiltrator. These cloaks also allow soldiers to blend in with terrain, not good enough to fool somepony on the ground but good enough to mostly hide them from enemy air support."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di3:0 "Spy Networks"
 tech_infiltrators_di3_desc:0 "Establishing spy networks in nations across the world will allow for better gathering of intelligence on the plans of local or opposing nations. A more local spy network would supress any groups of partistans trying to organise themselves in territory we occupy."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di4:0 "Massive Impersonation"
 tech_infiltrators_di4_desc:0 "The mass impersonation of individuals in nations will allow us to perform subversive activities at a reduced cost. With more disguised changelings around to carry out plans, the easier it becomes to organise plots of subterfuge in other countries."
 
 ## Tactical Path: Infiltrator improvements
 tech_infiltrators_si:0 "Tactical Infiltration"
 tech_infiltrators_si_desc:0 "Favouring quick descisions and immediate effects, the strategic infiltration doctrine will empower the infiltration companies to perform more efficiently on the battlefield."
 
 tech_infiltrators_si2:0 "Targeted Insertion"
 tech_infiltrators_si2_desc:0 "Infiltrator companies will need to hit their targets quickly and efficiently. They need to be adept at planning incursions into enemy territory and thus quicker with completing them, ready to be used."
 
 tech_infiltrators_si3:0 "Chaos, Confusion, Concealment"
 tech_infiltrators_si3_desc:0 "Changeling infiltrator companies must be trained into sowing chaos into the front lines and the battlefield. Additonly, we should look into ways to better resist would-be conquerors."
 
 tech_infiltrators_si4:0 "Social Engineering Training"
 tech_infiltrators_si4_desc:0 "To truly live up to their names, changeling infiltrator squads must also know how to act like a pony  during reconnaissance excursions. This training will aid them in the circumstance of being forced to disguise to properly gauge the enemy before a fight, and assist them with future descisions."

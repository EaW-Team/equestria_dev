#### FOCUSES ####

### Political Tree ###

## Foreign Tree ##
WIT_Diplomacy:0 "A Changing World"
WIT_Diplomacy_desc:0 "The world changes and so must we. Our ancient castles are no protection when raiders carry artillery. Our magical developments promise a new era of magitech if only we can seize it. Meanwhile political manoeuvring continues behind the scenes of opulent parties..."

WIT_Fed_Diplomacy:0 "External Threats"
WIT_Fed_Diplomacy_desc:0 "The states of the River Federation eye each other suspiciously even as they speak of peace and unification. By turning our focus to the enemies of the River Federation, we can reassure our neighbours even as we arm for conflict."

#Host subbranch
WIT_Anti_Host_Propaganda:0 "The Southern Threat"
WIT_Anti_Host_Propaganda_desc:0 "The stalemate with Helquill and Longsword command most of the attention of the River Federation. But these states are a known quantity, and the strife in the Griffonian Empire prevents them championing any large crusades. We must remind the River Federation that both threat and opportunity lie in the exposed plains of the Gryphian Host and their endless raids against our ponies."

WIT_Defence_Against_Host:0 "Ancient Strategies, Modern Tactics"
WIT_Defence_Against_Host_desc:0 "Our ancient mountain castles and defensive magic have allowed us to weather, if not defeat, the raids of the Gryphian Host. Adapting these tactics to work with machine gun emplacements and artillery can make this time-honoured tactic more deadly to attackers than ever before."

WIT_Attack_Against_Host:0 "Killing Fields"
WIT_Attack_Against_Host_desc:0 "The musket has been a poor weapon on the vulnerable open plains against the mobile raiders of the Gryphian Host. But technology now favours us, as long range rifles, trenches, artillery, and vehicles offer new tactical opportunities. The plains which have long protected our enemy shall become our killing fields."

WIT_Host_Forts:0 "The Modern Castle"
WIT_Host_Forts_desc:0 "Our mountain castles have always provided security, even as we have often been forced to allow raiders to roam outside, ransacking our towns and villages. By building a line of concrete, barbed wire, and machine guns, our borders shall become a new castle wall - one that leaves nothing for the raider."

WIT_Raid_Host:0 "Raid the Raiders"
WIT_Raid_Host_desc:0 "Defence has never been a problem for us. The problem has always been the ability of the Gryphian Host to melt away into their vast plains afterwards. But with modern equipment and tactics, a counter-raid could take the Gryphian Host by surprise, killing every griffon we encounter even as we maintain a line of retreat."

WIT_Attack_Host:0 "Operation Party Crasher"
WIT_Attack_Host_desc:0 "Whether we grind them down against our fortifications or advance en masse across their plains, victory is finally a possibility. With the defeat of the Gryphian Host, never again shall we have to fear the griffon menace at our doorstep. Let's finish this - once it’s over, we'll throw the greatest party in pony history. "

WIT_Core_Host:0 "In the Shadow of the Mountain"
WIT_Core_Host_desc:0 "The new vast plains we have secured present a challenge to hold and assimilate. Fortunately, our ancient castles and modern bases, once for protection, shall now serve as administrative and military hubs from which we can control the adjacent states."

#Barrad Subranch
WIT_Maneuvers_Near_Barad:0 "Magical Exercises Near Barrad"
WIT_Maneuvers_Near_Barad_desc:0 "Barrad is a blight on our history - a breakaway haven for dark spellcasters who use their powers for evil that we have been unable to dislodge. Mass unicorn on unicorn spell battles are tricky affairs - training manoeuvres with our divisions will ensure we are ready."

WIT_Barad_Forts:0 "Enchanted Fortifications"
WIT_Barad_Forts_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us of the situation worsening in Barrad, as their rule grows even more twisted. We must prepare the borders. Stout fortifications may seem little protection against dark horrors, but with a little magical tweaking from our spellcasters they can help us against the magical and mundane alike."

WIT_War_Barad:0 "Assault on The Black Tower"
WIT_War_Barad_desc:0 "The breakaway magocracy of Barrad is a blight on Griffonia and our greatest shame, putting the name of unicorn spellcasters everywhere into disrepute. We must recover our ancestral lands, purge it of evil, and right the great wrong from so long ago."

WIT_Core_Barad:0 "Purify the Blight"
WIT_Core_Barad_desc:0 "Barrad is ours! Now begins the painful task of purifying the land and freeing its inhabitants, turning it into a place where good ponies can once again dwell."

WIT_Forbidden_Vaults:0 "Forbidden Vaults"
WIT_Forbidden_Vaults_desc:0 "Our workers have encountered vaults of the magocracy filled with the forbidden knowledge and dark science. Much of it may have to be destroyed, but some could surely be put to good use... couldn't it?"

##end Foreign Tree

#Magic Studies
WIT_Study_Magic:0 "Advanced Enchanting"
WIT_Study_Magic_desc:0 "Most magical military research focuses on the mass production of magic for simple, small weapons. But our advanced practitioners might be better used to perform intricate enchantments for a few powerful weapons instead."

WIT_Unicorn_Magic:0 "Unicorn Magic"
WIT_Unicorn_Magic_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land of unicorn spellcasters, and it is said that the best gift is a fine wine or a fine spellbook. With a little investment, we could speed up our magical development."

WIT_Natural_Magic:0 "Natural Magic"
WIT_Natural_Magic_desc:0 "It is commonly thought that a pony's magic comes from their horn. It is actually a deeper, more innate magic merely channelled by the horn. Our magical ancestry and ancestral lands are filled with this innate magic. We should realise its potential."

WIT_Best_Mages:0 "Magical Proving"
WIT_Best_Mages_desc:0 "Our nation respects magic and scholarship above all, and we must constantly find worthy candidates to join the ranks of government and elite casters. Queen White Star could invest time scouting local magical proving events, discovering promising candidates before they are snapped up by competing nobles"

WIT_Magical_Saturnalia:0 "Saturnalia"
WIT_Magical_Saturnalia_desc:0 "The Northern Lights are a common, if faint phenomenon in the cold lands of Wittenland. At the Saturnalia festival, skilled mages work to supercharge it into a dazzling light display to accompany lavish festivities. Sponsoring and organising this year's festival would help Queen White Star's prestige."

WIT_New_Archmages:0 "New Mage Generals"
WIT_New_Archmages_desc:0 "Magical armies are best led by magical generals, and it has been difficult to find candidates who are both magical and familiar with modern military thought. With some effort, we could poach some of the more promising leaders employed by other nobles."

#Celebrations and Internal Politics
WIT_SpringField_Festival:0 "The Springfield Festival"
WIT_SpringField_Festival_desc:0 " The Springfield Festival opens Wittenland's most lavish season of parties, as the largest annual harvests are completed, and the peasants and nobility alike have some respite from their other obligations. Although the festival is held every year, Queen White Star will need to be particularly involved this time if she wishes to push her progressive reforms."

WIT_Gallant_Gala:0 "The Gallant Gala"
WIT_Gallant_Gala_desc:0 "The most opulent, exclusive and formal of Wittenland's pageantries, the Gallant Gala is rife with intrigue and lobbying amongst the nobility. It is here that they are at their most powerful, and it is here that White Star will need to be if she is to check their grip over the common folk."

WIT_Great_Debate:0 "The Great Debate"
WIT_Great_Debate_desc:0 "The Monarch of Wittenland rules through consent, wisdom and magic power, not force. They are expected to persuade the nobility of the merits of their policies through rhetoric and reason. (or at least, hide the arm twisting behind the scenes) The Great Debate, though partly spectacle, is another challenge for Queen White Star's continuing reforms. "

WIT_Derby:0 "The Derby"
WIT_Derby_desc:0 "Though modern roller-skates are somewhat new to Griffonia, the ponies of Wittenland have taken to them like a seapony to water. The annual Derby will see roller-skaters from across the region compete, often sponsored by various noble patrons seeking prestige. The more relaxed atmosphere makes it a good venue for striking deals too..."

WIT_Grand_Fair:0 "The Grand Fair"
WIT_Grand_Fair_desc:0 "The Grand Fair is a lavish showcase of the artistic and entertainment capabilities of the nation.  Plays, music, entertainments of every kind, even gladiatorial combat.  Naturally, the spectacle means that important nobles will be there, jockeying for status."

WIT_Reclamation_Day:0 "Reclamation Day"
WIT_Reclamation_Day_desc:0 "In 803, the River Republika invaded our lands, captured Wittenburgh and marched on High Mane, where their treacherous Queen and her daughters fell sieging our stronghold. We pushed them back, though to this day they hold our city of Coltstream. On Reclamation Day every pony of Wittenland remembers the great sacrifices of our armies, and our unfinished duty - the reclamation of Coltstream."

### Three Ideologies ###
WIT_The_Duel:0 "The Duel"
WIT_The_Duel_desc:0 "Anypony with some backing in the court may challenge the monarch for leadership through a duel of mental prowess and magical mastery. If the challenger has sufficient backing, the monarch will often step down peacefully. Though Queen Whitestar has maneuvered well, there remains a small possibility of challenge from the conservatives..."

# Neutral (Queen White Star wins duel)
WIT_White_Star_Triumphs:0 "White Star Triumphs"
WIT_White_Star_Triumphs_desc:0 ""

WIT_Ancient_Ancestry:0 "Ancient Ancestry"
WIT_Ancient_Ancestry_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, we have trained in magic for use in all aspects of life, passing its secrets down from generation to generation. Now others rush to integrate their magic into modern weaponry. \n\n We need not rush. We were born ready."

WIT_Loyalty_To_The_Queen:0 "A Queen of the People"
WIT_Loyalty_To_The_Queen_desc:0 "Monarchs always claim to rule selflessly for their people, but not all do. Queen White Star has proven her dedication to the people, and ponies have flocked to serve the Queen that serves them."

WIT_A_Greatful_Populace:0 "Complete the Reforms"
WIT_A_Greatful_Populace_desc:0 "The nobles have been won over or marginalised and all challengers defeated. No longer will Wittenland have its opportunity and potential squandered of a lavish life of unearned privilege. We shall always be a people of parties. But the true joy of a party is a humble joy - that of friendship, unity and cheer. Not of intrigue, exclusivity and expense."

WIT_Coltstream_Please:0 "End Ancient Grudges "
WIT_Coltstream_Please_desc:0 "200 years ago we lost Coltstream, and today it barely contains a single pony of strong Wittenland heritage and culture. Its time to recognise the obvious and end our claim on Coltstream - peace will benefit them, and we should be able to negotiate some concessions in exchange. And should such a generous gesture be refused, we may still pursue military options with a clear conscience."

WIT_A_New_Generation:0 "A New Generation"
WIT_A_New_Generation_desc:0 "Honoria has proven the Queen's claim - Any commoner can achieve great things. This event is an opportunity to get a new generation of skilled specialists into vital fields."

WIT_Unity_Around_The_Queen:0 "A United People"
WIT_Unity_Around_The_Queen_desc:0 "White Star's success has unified the common pony behind us. We can put this support to good use."

# Fascist (UPP / Honoraria wins duel)
WIT_UPP_Takes_Power:0 "The Peasant Queen"
WIT_UPP_Takes_Power_desc:0 "We have fairly claimed the throne, and just as importantly, the key nobility of the nation are hostage here in this palace. The dream of Wittenland can be finally realised - a nation where every Unicorn, rich or poor, can see their true potential realised as magical masters of all."

WIT_Ready_For_Conflict:0 "Prepare for War"
WIT_Ready_For_Conflict_desc:0 "Wittenland is our home, our parent. Non-unicorns, monarchs, corporations - all would take it from us. We must be ready for them, and ready to reclaim our lost land of Coltstream."

WIT_Renewed_Militarism:0 "The Unicorn Way of Life"
WIT_Renewed_Militarism_desc:0 "Wittenland is unique - a nation of unicorns, where magecraft can be practiced for good, not bound in servitude to the needs of Earth and Pegasi ponies. We must remind our unicorns of the benefits of such a life, and the consequences if we do not act decisively to protect it."

WIT_Productivity_At_Last:0 "Parties Must End"
WIT_Productivity_At_Last_desc:0 "The incredible potential of a unicorn state has been spent on frivolities for the rich, even whilst the people suffered. Parties should be purchased with ones own hard earned money, not the public purse or aristocratic rents. All but the largest parties must end. Those that remain shall be turned into national holidays celebrating our unity and way of life."

WIT_Coltstream_Or_War:0 "Coltstream or War"
WIT_Coltstream_Or_War_desc:0 "200 years ago the ponies of the River Republika stole Coltstream from us. In response, the Queen and her three daughters fell by our hooves, yet we could never retake Coltstream. It is time to finish the job we started 200 years ago."

WIT_Our_Rightful_Place:0 "Spread the Magic of Magic"
WIT_Our_Rightful_Place_desc:0 "Magic rules this world. Yet none can wield it like unicorns can - shielding, teleportation, even time travel. The advantages of such a society are obvious. The unicorn is the best pony and the unicorn shall rule all, for the good of all."

WIT_Not_One_Step_Back:0 "Never Again"
WIT_Not_One_Step_Back_desc:0 "When we gave the small part of land to our north up to the River Republika, we lost it for two centuries. When we allowed the mages of Barrad to break away, we lost it for decades. The lesson is clear. Wittenland soil must never again fall beneath foreign hooves."

#Communist (Death of pro-preasant leaders leads to conservative noble rule and then commoner uprising)
WIT_Chaos_Ensues:0 "The Uprising"
WIT_Chaos_Ensues_desc:0 "In a supreme irony, the two champions of the people lie dead. The nobles rush to oppress ponies once more and take away our hard won freedoms. We shall not make the same mistake again - no more compromise, no more duels, no more unicorn traditions. The workers shall rule, and all shall be equal."

WIT_New_Leaders:0 "Officers of the People"
WIT_New_Leaders_desc:0 "Wittenland armies were led by noble unicorn mages, most of who lie dead or fight for the enemy. We must recruit new officers at once from the people."

WIT_Revenge_Incoming:0 "Enemies on All Sides"
WIT_Revenge_Incoming_desc:0 "We have finally thrown off the chains of oppression - no kings, no aristocracy. We must fortify the borders with to the north, lest others try to take our newfound freedoms."

WIT_Lessons_Of_The_Civil_War:0 "Parties for the People"
WIT_Lessons_Of_The_Civil_War_desc:0 "Stalliongrad Communism is a bit grim. What is the point of work if not to enjoy the fruit of its labour? Wittenland Communism shall replace the wasteful extravaganzas of the nobility with regular festivals and parties for the people. The food and decorations may be cheap and mass produced, but friendship, relaxation and cheer come from ponies, not production lines."

WIT_Coltstream_Is_Ours:0 "Liberate our Brethren"
WIT_Coltstream_Is_Ours_desc:0 "Now that we have united the country, the workers of Coltstream cry out for liberation. Queen White Star bowed to foreign companies and monarchs in her endless aristocratic games, leaving this injustice to stand. We shall take back what is ours."
#wittenland.29

WIT_Renewed_Fervour:0 "A People's Army"
WIT_Renewed_Fervour_desc:0 "Factory workers. Farmers. Non-unicorns. All suffered under the tyranny of a unicorn elite. Those who find equality under our new nation rush to protect it. "

WIT_Fuel_For_The_Fire_desc:0 "Honoraria and the revolutionaries who followed have shown us the path - we must stand for our beliefs. Where others bicker and deliberate over injustice, we must march.\n\n Ponies of the revolution, forwards!"


### Military
 
 WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military:0 "Review the Wittenland Military"
 WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military_desc:0 "A brief assessment of our armed forces leads to the conclusion that our grand military is not only outdated, but woefully inequipped. The military is in dire need of a reform, as it follows a wildly innefficent and old structure.\n\nA study into how we can adapt our military is the only course of action."
 
 # Motorised
 WIT_Choose_Motorised:0 "A Motorised Military"
 WIT_Choose_Motorised_desc:0 "The old ways of warfare will not serve us anymore, gone will be the days of line infantry.

 WIT_Tank_Buff:0 "The Queen's Armour"

 WIT_Motorised_Buff:0 "The Nobles' Chariot"
 WIT_Motorised_Buff_desc:0 "The nobles of the court were interested in what they call 'mechanical chariots'. They believe that if we focus on their development, they will prove to be a valuable asset on the battlefield."
 
 WIT_Tank_Research_Buff:0 "Royal Armour Initiative"
 WIT_Tank_Research_Buff_desc:0 "To begin our development of armoured forces, we must secure a working tank blueprint. While we cannot hope to produce our own model in the near future, there is a number of foreign models which we can base our own prototype on."
 
 WIT_Motorised_Research_Buff:0 "Royal Motorized Initiative"
 WIT_Motorised_Research_Buff_desc:0 "The nobles, being slaves to the newest trends, have agreed to put their wealth together and secure rights for 'mechnical chariot' production. Everypony will wish for one, and as a beneficial side effect, this will bolster our motorisation efforts."
 
 WIT_Motorised_Factories:0 "Wittenland Motorized Production Drive"
 WIT_Motorised_Factories_desc:0 "Our efforts to harness the power of the tank will require more factories than we currently have. As such, we have set aside funds for the construction of new military workshops."
 
 WIT_Signal_Company_Bonus:0 "Motorized Communications Project"

 # Artilery
 WIT_Choose_Artillery:0 "The Great Cannons of Wittenland"
 WIT_Choose_Artillery_desc:0 "The ponies of Wittenland were always reluctant fighters. With the invention of new, more devastating and longer ranged artillery, our high command believes that we can force our enemies to submit to our incredible firepower, ending the fight before it even begins."
 
 WIT_Artillery_Buff:0 "Enchanted Shells"
 WIT_Artillery_Buff_desc:0 "If we enchant our artillery shells with magic, they will be much more devastating. Some of our finest sorcerers have already proposed various enchantments, they only require our approval."
 
 WIT_Support_Buff:0 "Improved Supply Line Logistics"
 WIT_Support_Buff_desc:0 "If we intend to boost artillery usage in our army, we must improve our logistical capabilities. Our ponies can't lack any supplies, our artillery corps must have plenty of shells."

 # Battleplan
 WIT_Choose_Battleplan:0 "No Scenario Unplanned"
 WIT_Choose_Battleplan_desc:0 "Our old ways of warfare are obsolete, but some of its ideas can still be applied to modern warfare. Namely, extensive planning and heavy fortifications - our mountain homeland is more than suited to become a fortress upon which we will bleed our enemy dry."
 
 WIT_Entrench_Buff:0 "The Long Game"
 WIT_Entrench_Buff_desc:0 "Our high command believes that extensive training in raising temporary fortifications and digging trenches is the right approach. Our enemy will not make any decisive gains, and every inch they take will be a costly one."

 WIT_Infantry_Tech_Battleplan:0 "Better Guns, Better Plans"
 WIT_Infantry_Tech_Battleplan_desc:0 "The musket has served the Wittenland military well for centuries. Now, they are more fitting for a museum exhibit.

 WIT_Population_Assualt_Buff_2:0 "Drill the Masses"
 WIT_Population_Assualt_Buff_2_desc:0 "Our small population means we cannot effectively throw ponies at the problem contrary to our larger neighbours. However, if we encourage marriages with tax breaks for families and provide monetary benefits for high amount of foals, we will slowly gain higher population count for the future wars."
 
 WIT_Infantry_Tech_Assualt:0 "Higher Standard Small Arms"

#### EVENTS ####
wittenland.1.t:0 "The Springfield Festival"
wittenland.1.d:0 "Queen Whitestar cut the banner announcing the start of the Springfield Festival and the festival season in Wittenland. Hooves stomped in approval, whilst conservative nobles picked through the lower classes, barely masking their distaste.\n\nWhite Star smiled. Attending a smaller festival in Ivanhorn, instead of the lavish square of Wittenburgh, has been an inspired choice. Lord Wulfric was furious. He had already been grumbling about the burdens placed upon him by granting additional peasant rights, and now he was forced to stand with serfs and new money to attend alongside the Queen.\n\nShe briefly frowned, considering the problems it might cause, and then brightened. The River Artificers Guildmaster was drinking wine, standing by a table laden with some of the finest produce of the harvest season. A little suggestion here and there, a trade concession or two, and Wulfric would find himself difficulty in getting priority shipping over some of the newer merchants from the lower classes. Wulfric would understand immediately. He knew the game as well as anypony.\n\nQueen White Star took a sip of wine as she approached the Guildmaster. This would be a long, but productive day..."
wittenland.1.a:0 "A strong start to the season."

wittenland.2.t:0 "The Gallant Gala"
wittenland.2.d:0 "Violins played as exquisitely dressed nobility crossed the marble floors of the Wittenburgh Gala Hall. Centuries old silverware sat alongside exotic foods from Equestria, Olenia and even Griffenheim.\n\nWhispers followed Queen White Star as she entered. There would be hell to pay for her little stunt in Ivanhorn, and here, surrounded by the most elite of Wittenland at the most exclusive ball of the season, she would find little support from her new friends amongst the middle classes.\n\nHer mareservant returned with a wine, taking an opportunity to lean close "My Queen, Steel Little has expressed openness to leaving the Count of Papalia to work with you, but I've urgent news. Lord Wulfric and two of the Counts from Buckthorn have secured exclusive trading rights with one of the new electronics manufacturers in River City."\n\nWhite Star turned in shock, before smiling as if she had mistakenly thought she had recognised someone as she hissed "What?! How? Those contracts were supposed to be open bid!"\n\nShe calculated, her heart racing. Despite her previous successes, with the extra wealth and influence generated by these contacts, the conservative factions would be strengthened for years to come. Maintaining her existing reforms would be a battle, much less passing new reforms.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted as a smiling Lord Wulfric held out his hoof. "May I have the pleasure of a dance, Your Highness?" White Star worked to keep her composure. With Wulfric hosting this year's Gala, it would be an egregious breach of courtesy to refuse the invitation..."
wittenland.2.a:0 "This is going to be a long evening."

wittenland.3.t:0 "The Great Debate"
wittenland.3.d:0 "The galleries of the Great Library listened attentively as Queen White Star outlined her plans for the year, with various nobles standing to make objections, comments and agreements. As usual, it was the topic of class reform that attracted the most attention. Drawing on the recent economic successes, orthodox Wittenland thought, and even the newer ideas of mavericks from Aquileia, Stalliongrad and New Mareland, she spoke at some length on the topic.\n\nLord Wulfric predictably rose, "Your Highness, these arguments are fine ones, but irrelevant. These societies are not magical ones like we are. These systems, though they may generate meagre prosperity among those who dig by hoof, are inferior to our ancient traditions where magical accomplishment and learning are wielded for the good of all. You yourself rose to power on this principle, yet now you would deny the very basis of your own rule?"\n\nWhite Star paused, choosing her words carefully. "We are not the only magical society, Lord Wulfric. Have you forgotten the magical rule of the Equestrian princesses? They find great value in equality and -" Wulfric's horn glowed angrily as he thumped the table. "Those deluded alicorns who prance around and declare themselves Gods of Sun and Moon? They are neither a society of unicorns nor are they outstandingly magical. You put too much stock in the exaggerations of superstitious foreigners.""
wittenland.3.a:0 "The audience murmurs..."

wittenland.45.t:0 "The Great Debate"
wittenland.45.d:0 "The crowd murmured in agreement. A society as magical as Wittenland? At the very least, it was not something a Queen should publicly admit. \n\nWhite Star pursed her lips, persisting. "You may think so, but I have here a research paper, arrived last month from Canterlot University, reporting on the magical effects of a confrontation between Twilight Sparkle, the Element of Magic...." she paused to let it sink in "...and Lord Tirek, a Centaur who had stolen much of Equestria's magic."\n\nLord Wulfric snorted "Which merely proves my point! Element of Magic? Beams of energy larger than this very building?! No! This is the theocratic ramblings of a people who revere their alicorns as gods! You would devise policy not on wisdom, but fairy tale!"\n\nWhite Star made a crisp smile levitating a second scroll out "Indeed? Then perhaps you should speak with your staff. The modelling and measurements from Canterlot perfectly match the magigraph readings published by your very own magic monitoring station in Wittenburgh. Are the publications of your scholars also "theocratic ramblings", Lord Wulfric?"\n\nWhite Star allowed herself a rare grin as several nobles sniggered. "Perhaps if you spent less time defending your magical merit and more time staying abreast of recent magical developments, these "ramblings" would be less of an issue, hmmmm?""
wittenland.45.a:0 "I believe my case stands, Lord Wulfric."

wittenland.4.t:0 "The Derby"
wittenland.4.d:0 "Ponies laughed, cheered and roared as athletes raced, leaped and posed in displays of roller skating athleticism. Bets were made whilst nobles proudly posed for photographs with athletes from their territories and Wittenland's newest import - the radio - broadcast breathless commentary to ponies who eagerly huddled around display units in electronics stores.\n\nQueen White Star made her usual rounds, soothing egos, making promises and twisting legs as necessary. She was in an especially good mood, having convinced Thunder Amethyst, one of Witterburgh's finest tacticians, to consider employment with her.\n\nThe wine flowed freely (as it always did), and with the conclusion of the events of the day, the rinks were opened to the nobility. The children and more open minded grabbed at the opportunity eagerly whilst the older nobles looked on tolerantly.\n\nThen, to the surprise of everyone, White Star's nephew managed to tempt her out onto the rink as well, where she alternated between graceful twirls and giggling sprawls, with an infectiousness that soon spread, as others dragged parents, friends, and colleagues onto the rink. Even Lord Wulfric grinned patiently whilst his young granddaughter haltingly attempted to guide him on how to roller skate, despite her own obvious inability to make it more than a meter without slipping over.\n\nWhite Star paused to take in the scene, feeling a twinge of sadness."
wittenland.4.a:0 "This is how things should be."

wittenland.5.t:0 "Reclamation Day"
wittenland.5.d:0 "White Star adorned herself in the formal battle regalia of a Wittenland Spell-General, groaning as she did so. The land of festivals would not be complete without a celebration of the military, of course.\n\nBut did it really have to revolve around Coltstream? Like any politician, it was often her job to promise the impossible. And no promise was more impossible than the return of Coltstream. It was something in the water, she thought, nodding to herself. There was something that made the ponies of the Riverlands unusually stubborn.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, River City managed to take Coltstream from Wittenland. And two hundred years later, here they were, still having a holiday to demand it be given back. She wondered if the last two hundred years of speeches had changed one bit, and briefly considered sending a request to the Great Library to check.\n\nTo her eternal annoyance,  it was the commonfolk who felt most strongly. The nobility understood power, understood the reality of politics. Yet every reform she made, every gift to the common pony, only served to increase their influence in demanding war. Fools! Who do they think would be charging into machine gun fire over this silly city? Certainly not the nobles!\n\nWhite Star sighed, and stepped up onto the podium."
wittenland.5.a:0 "Let's get this over with..."

wittenland.6.t:0 "The Grand Fair"
wittenland.6.d:0 "The Grand Fair overflowed with abundance. This year's highlights included: a magical self filling wine fountain, a demonstration gladiatorial round where veterans sparred and re-enacted great battles with griffon raiders (inevitably, some poor pegasi servants were roped into playing the Griffons), and a travelling troupe of Hippogriffon performers from across the seas.\n\nIn the middle of it all, White Star sat glumly. Despite her success in the debate, Lord Wulfric had capitalised on his new trading rights to cement several alliances and increase his influence amongst the nobility. She would undoubtedly face a choice between abandoning her reforms or facing a leadership challenge.\n\nSo when a runner delivered notes on the morning's trade, White Star did not look up until the usually taciturn Lord Wulfric uttered a curse and hurriedly excused himself from the festivities. Despite their propriety, the assembled nobles, White Star herself included, could not help but curiously crowd around the runner. Even the Hippogriffon doing a surprisingly sophisticated double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the Wittenland national anthem failed to distract.\n\nWhite Star impatiently summoned a copy, reading. A successful venture led by Merchant Captain Honoraria had returned from Equestria laden with high quality, competitively priced electronics, and with a Guarantee from a New Mareland bank underwriting further deliveries. \n\nShe began to laugh. Wulfric's monopolies on obsolete equipment were now an expensive disaster, another victim of the new money in a new world. \n\nSo distracted in her glee, she didn't notice the letter until her mareservant politely, but determinedly, levitated a letter inches from her face."
wittenland.6.a:0 "A letter?"

wittenland.46.t:0 "The Letter"
wittenland.46.d:0""My Queen,\n\nMy debt of freedom is repaid, and I hope the  success of my recent venture gives you the same deep satisfaction it has given to me. \n\nAs a former serf of Lord Wulfric's, I deeply hope his impending loss inspires him to stick his horn into one of his overpriced River City toasters and turn it on.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMerchant Captain Honoraria"
wittenland.46.a:0 "I must thank this "Honoraria" in person."

wittenland.7.t:0 "Proving Day"
wittenland.7.d:0 "Queen White Star moved through the various podiums, as unicorns competed and demonstrated a variety of skills, from enchanting, multitasking, to brute telekinetic strength, displayed alongside examples of papers and scholarly endorsements.\n\nUnfortunately, savvy nobles, anticipating her visit, had already snapped up the best candidates. She took the opportunity to instead peruse recent imports of spellbooks, discovering a shopkeeper with some rather valuable trade connections.\n\nBest not to let such opportunities go to waste, she thought."
wittenland.7.a:0 "A quiet proving season."

wittenland.8.t:0 "New Mage Generals"
wittenland.8.d:0 "We have managed to poach several promising generals from the castles of High Mane and Wintershorn, both frontier areas that are known for their regular Griffon incursions. Unlike our recent work in magical proving, this has gone off without a hitch."
wittenland.8.a:0 "A magical army needs magical generals. "

wittenland.9.t:0 "Magic Tank"
wittenland.9.d:0 "Queen White Star walked through the spotless workshop, as nervous workers ensured her way was clear in their usually messy workspaces. The company representative continued "As you know, armour enchanting is an extremely labour-intensive investment - the typical Wittenland pony is best served by a personal shield spell instead."\n\nHe smiled. "However, this does offer up opportunities for heavier armour enchanting,” He pointed to the prototype, a training model with newly welded plates of highly durable enchanted steel. "Just imagine, your majesty, a column of Griffon Knights expecting an easy battle and finding that even their vaunted heavy weapons simple do not dent our vehicles!"\n\nWhite Star nodded. "We will let you know if we have need of such a model.""
wittenland.9.a:0 "Magitek - Wittenland's future."

wittenland.10.t:0 "The Peasant Reformation Act"
wittenland.10.d:0 "Although it does not handle many broader fundamental questions of culture, role, and rights, the Peasant Reformation Act has been hailed by progressive scholars as a wide ranging economic reform, with careful attention to the details needed to empower peasants as part of a modern, skilled economy. Improvements are already being experienced, and further development is expected over the next two years."
wittenland.10.a:0 "Wittenland's greatest shackles loosen."

wittenland.11.t:0 "Completion of Peasant Reforms"
wittenland.11.d:0 "Contrary to the negative predictions of conservatives, the reforms have been a rousing success. The most recent quarterly report indicates that the reforms have continued to drive dramatic improvement, and Wittenland now ranks competitively with other industrialised nations on many metrics."
wittenland.11.a:0 "Magic and Modernity Together."

wittenland.12.t:0 "Military Review Commission Report"
wittenland.12.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader],\n\nThe work of the Review Commission has identified two critical issues with Wittenland military capabilities.\n\n1. Our equipment is obsolete compared to many modern nations.\n2. Our military doctrine, based around castles and defence from Griffon raiders possessing more traditional weaponry, is ill equipped to the needs of the current era.\n\nOn this basis, our Great Library has reviewed our current knowledge on various military theories around the world, and suggested approaches for integrating these with a unicorn army and an accelerated technology program matched to it. The doctrines, and further data about the commission’s work, are attached for review within.\n\nWittenland Military Review Commission"
wittenland.12.a:0 "The points are well argued."

wittenland.13.t:0 "Queening"
wittenland.13.d:0 "The doors of the Royal Palace opened as Wittenland's most powerful unicorns strode into the Great Hall. The formal hearing of the challenges was a sacred Wittenland tradition - the foundation of their meritocracy, where anyone of magical skill and learning could become the new monarch.\n\nAnd on it's throne, White Star sat, calming her nerves. No amount of skill could make a duel safe for either side, and her safety relied more on expedience than skill - a defeat would be politically devastating for Wulfric, and even should he win, the nobility might ignore his demands. Perhaps even worse for Wulfric, she could simply step down and grant him the throne, assemble her supporters, and return in strength later.\n\nHer mareservant addressed the crowd "The Queen issues a call - let any who feel they have the backing of the nobility and the magical skill to take the Crown step forward." There was a small commotion at the back of the crowd, but no one spoke. White Star relaxed. Likely a young hothead mage who had just been restrained by his peers. "Let it be noted that the Queen continues her rule as the legitimate, unconte-"\n\n"I accept the call!"\n\nWhite Star looked to Lord Wulfric, who appeared just as surprised as she was.\n\nA mare pushed out of the crowd "I, Honoraria, Merchant Captain of the Honoraria Trading Concern, challenge Queen White Star for the throne!""
wittenland.13.a:0 "Lord Wulfric began to laugh."

wittenland.40.t:0 "Advanced Pawn"
wittenland.40.d:0 "Lord Wulfric laughed, long and loud, his bitterness spilling out "The serf challenges the very Queen who freed her? I warned of the consequences of such a radical change, but even I could not imagine such a poetic demonstration of your folly!"\n\nHonoraria cut Wulfric a glare, before speaking "My Queen. Wulfric is a parasite. I am proof of the truth of your words, of the strength bound in every unicorn. Years ago, when you first passed your reforms, I stood in the crowds. You told us that any unicorn could become great, be they noble or commoner.\n\nI stand here, having risen from serfdom to a wealthy merchant, having outcompeted the very noble who once controlled my chains. How much did his vaunted education and bloodline help him against a mere serf? I owe you everything." she bowed deeply before White Star, a sincere gesture of supplication. "And now, having destroyed Wulfric's wealth, your reforms are safe, my debt is paid, and I come to prove the truth of your words." Her horn began to crackle with brilliant display of light, her voice rising "You are wise, but weak! You could not defeat Wulfric without me! You allow the ponies of River City to rule our lands and offer nothing but empty promises! For all your opposition to the rights of the nobility, you beg for their favour! I shall bring about a land where all unicorns live as they were meant to - free to achieve their rightful mastery over this world!"\n\nWhite Star, now calm, spoke "Bold words, Captain, but there is more to rulership than bold ambition and financial talent. I have no need to hear the challenge of someone who cannot unite others behind her." She gestured to her guards, who moved forward to apprehend Honoraria. Instead, they found a small group of merchants blocking their way.\n\n"I do not stand alone, White Star. A new generation of unicorns stand with me!"
wittenland.40.a:0 "What idiocy."

wittenland.41.t:0 "Double Check" 
wittenland.41.d:0 ""White Star paused briefly, and then motioned her guards continue. By dismissing the importance of the very classes she fought for, she embarrassed her cause, but such was politics.\n\n And yet again, the guards stopped, risking White Star's wrath. For Lord Wulfric blocked them, flanked by several members of the conservative nobility. "I will support Honoraria's claim to the throne!" Shocked gasps rippled through the crowd quickly followed by awe at his cleverness.\n\nShould Honoraria ascend the throne, the nobility would quickly depose her, and with the scandal of Queen White Star defeated by her own freed serf, her cause would collapse, leaving Wulfric to ascend the throne.\n\n And should Honoraria lose, White Star would prove the supremacy of the nobility even as her actions to dismiss the challenge branded her a hypocrite."
wittenland.41.a:0 "He dares!"

wittenland.42.t:0 "Forced Move"
wittenland.42.d:0 "White Star froze in shock, her politician's mask fell away. Her entire work, undone by this... this... insanity? Lord Wulfric smiled, and a fury rose up in her. A righteousness, that had been crushed under years of fake smiles, insincere promises and slimy compromises. Her mane began to swirl, glowing with tongues of flame, and her silks began to smoke as a vortex of flame crept up her horn.\n\n The crowd began to back away. This would be no civilised duel of safe formality, but a violent conflict of magical prodigies.\n\nHonoraria hesitated, then set her jaw. "I wish it were otherwise, My Queen, but know this! When I win, I shall see your legacy of equality made real!"\n\n White Star merely screamed in fury, leapt from the throne, a swirling vortex of flaming marshmallow and finery"
wittenland.42.a:0 "Ponies began to flee"

wittenland.15.t:0 "Coltstream or War"
wittenland.15.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader] reviewed the plans laid out before her, smiling. Finally, the day to reclaim Coltstream had arrived! No longer would the nobility bargain away the rightful lands of the unicorn race, lost due to incompetence 200 years ago. Coltstream will be great once more, and with one of the jewels of River City in her hands, its wealth would be returned to its rightful, magical, owners."

wittenland.16.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader], the nationalistic leader of Wittenland and their deluded posse of unicorn supremacists, demand the return of Coltstream, taken from them 200 years ago.\n\nNaturally, the demand is absurd.

They will end all claims to the territory in exchange for a cut of our trading revenue - "reparations", they call it.

Terrified Griffons were gunned down en masse. and our troops melted back into the mountains as quickly as they emerged.\n\nWhilst our generals expect the Gryphian Host to quickly adapt, celebrations have erupted across the border towns.

Wittenland has protested the occupation of Coltstream for so long that even the nobility of Wittenland did not tend to take such requests seriously.\n\nHowever the new monarch [WIT.GetLeader] has led a nationalist campaign of transformation, tearing down the ancient power structures of the nobility, and creating a state based around the "natural superiority of unicorns".

wittenland.29.t:0 "The War for Coltstream"
wittenland.29.d:0 "Wittenland diplomats today announced the declaration of war over the city of Coltstream, lost 200 years ago to Rijekogard. Given the ancient nature of the claim, and the fact the Wittenland Communist government rejects the very concept of noble title, it is generally agreed that this is merely a flimsy, populist justification for Communist expansion.\n\nThe change springs from the recent death of reformist leaders Honoraria and Queen White Star, an event that saw Communist revolutionaries overthrow the new conservative nobility."
wittenland.29.a:0 "Simple warmongering."

wittenland.30.t:0 "Coup in Wittenland"
wittenland.30.d:0 "Wittenland's ancient noble society was torn apart today, as in an unexpected twist, Queen White Star, widely regarded as a reformist and counterbalance to the conservative nobility, was defeated in a duel by Honoraria, a merchant captain who had recently ascended from serfdom thanks to White Star's very own reforms.\n\nHonoraria, who lacked noble backing, rushed to seize the palace and take families and nobles hostage, quickly securing military control.\n\nHonoraria has announced that the existing noble order will be torn down and replaced by "A society where any unicorn can become great!" Honoraria's nationalist rhetoric and focus on unicorn superiority seems to spell hard times for non-unicorns in Wittenland."

wittenland.31.t:0 "Civil War in Wittenland"
wittenland.31.d:0 "Chaos has erupted in the ancient unicorn society of Wittenland, as two powerful reformists, Queen White Star of the nobility and Honoraria of the novaeu rich, were killed in a duel for the crown. Conservative Lord Wulfric ascended to the throne shortly after, announcing the repeal of all new rights granted to the serfs of Wittenland. The serfs have responded with mass uprisings, led by former farmer Vollare.\n\nDenouncing the duels and power struggles as a tool of oppression, the uprising has called for a society where all races and all classes shall be equal as workers."

wittenland.32.t:0 "Queen White Star Triumphs"
wittenland.32.d:0 "In a dramatic end to the political manoeuvrings of Wittenland's unicorn elite, reformist Queen White Star was a favourite against potential conservative challenger Lord Wulfric. Wulfric however, refrained from making a challenge, and White Star was challenged instead by Honoraria, a newly wealthy merchant freed from serfdom by White Star's own reforms.\n\nDespite this twist, White Star was victorious, and Honoraria swore loyalty to the Queen and her cause of class reform. With White Star's power secured, observers expect continued modernisation and peace among the Riverlands."
wittenland.32.a:0 "Stability for us all."
wittenland.32.b:0 "What an odd monarchy."

#LEADER Desc
POLITICS_HONORIA_DESC:0 "Honoria was a serf bound to the land until she was freed by Queen White Star's reforms, who spoke fateful worlds that Honoria has never forgotten 'Any unicorn can achieve greatness'.\n\n She quickly saw some success in trading products that were unappreciated by the nobility, and invested her entire savings into a trade mission to New Mareland, purchasing modern equipment to resell in Wittenland. Her initial ventures have grown, and she became suddenly wealthy.\n\nHonoria sees greatness in Wittenland's future, if only every unicorn can be freed to achieve their potential just as she has. She fumes over the oppression of the nobility, and her fellow Wittenlanders who suffer in Coltstream, something she blames White Star's passive policies for." 
POLITICS_WHITE_STAR_DESC:0 "Queen White Star gained power the same way as every Wittenland monarch - by gathering the support of the nobility and issuing a challenge to the current monarch, who stepped down rather than face her in a magical duel or face no support from the nobility.\n\n A reformist, White Star is working to improve the antiquated system of serfdom and fixed land titles that have oppressed the common pony and enriched unproductive nobles.\n\n She has already implemented some key reforms, freeing many peasants from serfdom and allowing more productive nobles to expand their titles. However, her greater ambition - a complete package of land reforms, abolition of key rights of the nobility, and curtailing of the extravagant parties that dominant noble life - remain uncomplete."

### Leader Descriptions ###
## Equestria ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "Older than anyone would dare guess, Princess Celestia is an Alicorn, the eldest of the two Royal Sisters, and head ruler of Equestria. Additionally, she is responsible for the raising and lowering the sun, working in tandem with her sister Luna to ensure a stable night and day cycle. She is perhaps the most beloved creature in the world, being a staunch proponent for peace, kindness and cooperation. Very little of her past before Celestia’s victory over Discord is known, except that she and Luna discovered the Elements of Harmony. With these artefacts and their bearers, Princess Celestia has secured a long, relative peace for the nation."
CHANCELLOR_NEIGHSAY_DESC:0 "Neighsay is strict and conservative, preferring to do things by the EEA guidelines. He is also very prejudiced against anyone who is not a pony, openly referring to non-ponies as "creatures" in a dismissive manner."
POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "Daybreaker is the pompous alternate ego of Celestia. Daybreaker is considerably arrogant, power-hungry, and known for being filled with rage. She boasts that she doesn't need Luna or anyone else, claims that she should have destroyed Luna instead of banishing her to the moon. Daybreaker dismisses the notions of balance and harmony in favor of ruling over all, in a single state under her iron hoof. Daybreaker harnesses more of the sun's power than Celestia does, allowing her to breathe fire and generate intense, burning light."
POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "A well educated and accomplished general from the Equestrian military, Prince Blueblood rode his popularity as a hero of Equestria and his traditionally inherited power as a prince through the elections and into his new role as the executive of the nation. His tactics as a general were strict, disciplined, and conservative, not to mention highly effective, and he carries those methodologies into his administration. Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently. Finally, his knowledge as a general gives his pragmatic administration great insight into the military and the defensive needs of the nation, essential in the torn and chaotic modern world."
POLITICS_RICH_DESC:0 "A member of Equestria’s nouveau riche at least by Canterloninan standards, Filthy Rich is a pioneering capitalist and industrialist. Ruthless in his business tactics though perhaps not the sharpest at governmental administration as demonstrated by his first and only term as Mayor of Ponyville, his skills at the trade floor translate well to the negotiations table in economic matters. He entered the new democratic political scene through his financial influence and power, under the simple but to some, sort of unsettling catchphrase “Make Equestria Great Again”, though not exactly specifying how in the face of opponents with more clear motives, goals, and methods."
POLITICS_PANTS_DESC:0 "Fancy Pants is a renowned member of the old Canterlot elite aristocracy, a shrewd businesspony and a clever diplomat.Though uptight as many Canterlonians are, he has occasionally shown a softer side such as his favorable business dealings with Rarity and forgiveness to the aid of Princess Twilight Sparkle after a notable debacle while she was attending other business. With these qualities, he is a natural choice for a leader that the traditional elite are content with, though some ponies may not agree with his strongly orthodox methods and policy."
POLITICS_MARE_DESC:0 "Considered a pioneer in many respects, Mayor Mare, otherwise known as Flitter Flutter, trailblazed many aspects of democratic campaigning at the local level. Despite a few rough patches in her long administration as the Mayor of Ponyville, losing once to Filthy Rich, she has proven to be both a well meaning and effective leader and diplomat, again at the local level. It remains to be seen if she can effectively run a whole nation as well as she can run a city."
POLITICS_GEARHEART_DESC:0 "A selfmade mare, Copper Gearheart came from humble beginnings as a failed magic student and an eccentric engineer/inventor. After her failure in university in Canterlot, she returned to her home city of Manehattan with at least one magical talent, hyperprecise telekinesis that augmented her innovative mind as she joined the rapidly growing industrial revolution, and by 1007, she was the head of a rapidly growing industrial company with technological research at its heart. During the Lunar Civil War, she entered the political scene with a staunch progressive platform focused on scientific progress, redefining the government by democratic principles, and advocated for the disempowerment of the old hereditary elite."
POLITICS_ETERNAL_DESC:0 "Hailing from the wide, warm open plains of southwest Equestria, Maxos Eternal was part of the last generations of rural frontierspony and later a successful landowning rancher. He was a stallion who cared very much about his fellow equine and looked to make his mark helping others, becoming a key figure in maintaining the Equestrian food supply and overall rationing system when the Lunar Civil War broke out. He naturally became part of the political scene in the wake of the democratic movement after the civil war due to his popularity and reputation for fairness, joining the movement on a platform of simply hearing out his fellow ponies and acting on their wishes."
POLITICS_LEAD_DESC:0 "Ledd Metal was an established blacksmith within the traditional medieval guild system of Equestria when the Equestrian Industrial Revolution came full swing in the 980s, he became caught up in the winds of change as many guilds and craftsponies gave way to unskilled labor and unions. Disgruntled by the waves of change, avoiding the draft during the Lunar Civil War as a skilled metalworker, and seeing his fellow ponies striving to determine their own fates, he pulled together the support of the remaining old guilds, he joined the political scene on the platform to preserve the old harmonic order with the new methods of democracy."
POLITICS_SPARK_DESC:0 "Ember Spark was a veteran Pegasus trooper and one of the most decorated enlisted soldiers in the Equestrian Army, having joined as soon as he was eligible in 997. He proved to be a capable and fair leader who turned down promotions to an officer several times. At the behest of many of his fellows in the army, he reluctantly joined the rising democratic movement during an R&R period during the Lunar Civil War. Once it had ended, with the support of his many brothers and sisters in arms, he took up a platform focused on the defense of future peace and harmony in this new, changed Equestria."

## Lunar ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_NIGHTMAREMOON_DESC:0 "Nightmare Moon is the corrupted form of Princess Luna, the younger sister of Princess Celestia. Nightmare Moon was created as an alternate personality during Luna's lunar banishment. In a land under Nightmare Moon, the night reigns supreme and the ideals of Harmony are shattered. The Lunar Empress reigns over all in her lands, wishing to establish a world of law, order and eternal night."

## Olenia ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_KINGJOHAN_DESC:0 "King Johan, the illegitimate son of the King Aldar II seized power after his brother's sudden death."
POLITICS_VELVET_DESC:0 "Queen Velvet, the only child of King Aldar II, is respected and beloved by the deer of Olenia."
POLITICS_JURVA_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_KULLERVO_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_MANNTLERHIM_DESC:0 "Carl Gustaf Manntlerhim is an aging and respected soldier. His position as Commandant of Olenia puts him second only to the King in terms of power. But who’s side will he remain loyal to?"
POLITICS_HAAKON_DESC:0 "Haakon Lurswig, the nephew of Korvensuu founder Carl Lurswig, is a pioneer of mechanized combat. His experiments into tank designs and their usage in combat is revolutionary. But will he have a chance to see them come to fruition?"

## Changeling ##
# Leaders #

POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0  "Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis has been itching for revenge for several years now. Her people have always teetered on the edge of famine, and their unique dietary needs necessitated a hostile takeover of what had appeared to be the easiest target. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadence and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Only by uniting the Hives by force and persuasion will she have the numbers. Now, with the might of the Hives, Chrysalis finally has the opportunity to enact the vengeance that she and her people have longed for so long."


## Dragon Tribe ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CRIMSON_DESC:0 "On the mountain, Crimson "Ruby" Hayden has watched as Dragons fought over wealth, distrscted by materialism. From early fights and violence between her kind being observed by her, she began to grow a hatred to the Dynasty. After a visit to Stalliongrad, her thoughts began to radicalize, forming the DFCP in 1007 with nationalist, Communist principles. Haydenism is now a popular thought contrast to traditional dragon thought."

## Polar Bears ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PWELLINGTON_DESC:0 "Paw Wellington had emerged as the despot of the fractured polar communities in 1002. Under his reign, the polar bears have finally organized into a civil society. He is remarked as being firm but fair, willing to share the fish and having soft paws. Since his rise to power, the bears have seen rather decent success."

## Yakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride."

## Jakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "To the East of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan.' A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks - or Jaks, depending on who you ask - to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position."

## Crystal Empre ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, better known as Cadence, is another Alicorn Princess, though she began life as a Pegasus. After overcoming a jealous sorceress by opening her heart to her, Cadence was elevated into Alicornhood and joined Luna and Celestia in the Equestrian Royal Family as the Princess of Love. There she fell in love with a young Shining Armour, and married him. Unfortunately, their wedding was used by the Changeling Queen, Chrysalis, to overthrow the Royal Family and take over Equestria. With the power of their love, Shining Armour and Cadence managed to thwart the invasion and repelled the Changeling forces out of the country. After some time, Cadence was installed as the leader of the Crystal Empire and has since safekept it along with her husband."
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "Sombra’s origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. Whatever memories of his past have long been forgotten, perhaps even by himself. What is known of him and his rule over the Crystal Empire paints a grim picture: as King, he enslaved and tortured his own subjects to further his powers. He was only stopped when he was banished by Princess Celestia and Luna over a thousand years ago, along with his empire. When he returned, Sombra had become an immaterial creature of shadow, and threatened to take over the Crystal Empire once more were it not for the combined efforts of Princess Cadence and the Bearers of the Elements of Harmony. His form might have been gone, but his essence remained. This pony might not be the Sombra of the past, but he is just as cruel and tyrannical as the tales describe. One thing is sure: the King is back."

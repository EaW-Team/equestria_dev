 gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Inspired by the tales of Griffonian Knights with their heavy armour and equally heavy weaponry, the first tanks were created in 996 during their revolution by Stalliongrad ponies. Slow, mechanically unreliable, and poorly armoured, these rushed conversions of agricultural equipment were nonetheless effective against lightly armed infantry, and thus copied and imitated widely."
 light_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Light tanks are small, agile tanks which are able to both scout and fight lightly armored opponents. Their thin armour makes them vulnerable, however."
 light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Light Tank Mk. I"
 light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Derived from the initial tank models, light tanks deviate from the previous iterations mainly via a reduction in size, crew, and armament in exchange for speed and manoeuvrability. Some models might only have heavy machine guns as their only offensive weapons, but this initial step is essential to advance the evolution of tanks further."
 light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Small calibre cannons dramatically improve the firepower of our light tanks, and as the cheaper alternative, it appears that they have a role in the upcoming era of mechanised warfare. Our newest designs must be made to so as to make better prepare our tank battalions for this upcoming era."
 light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The proliferation of heavier tanks has put into question the role of the light tanks. Experience has improved our light tanks, where the newest models now resemble early medium tanks in terms of armour and offensive capability. However, though they are underwhelming to contemporary medium tanks, they are still the cheaper alternative and make for effective armoured reconnaissance vehicles."
 heavy_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are large, armored monsters which are designed to destroy enemy tanks and fortifications. However, they get stuck in mud easily and are very expensive to manufacture."
 heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Some schools of thought see the tank as a sort of landship that is meant to bring heavy firepower upon the field. Many models adapted the idea of multi-turreted offensive capabilities with increased armour, furthering their offensive and defensive capabilities at the cost of speed and reliability. Though field experiences put to question the notion of multiple turrets on tanks, these early heavy tanks are still a danger to any contemporary enemy forces."
 heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Lessons from the field and elsewhere have resoundly put to bed the idea of the landship tank. However, heavy tanks can still serve as breakthrough and platforms for heavy weapons. Of course, they need to be suitably armoured to sustain most, if not all, fire that they are liable to sustain in battle."
 heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "A continuation of previous ideas, these heavy tanks simply have more of everything: a bigger gun, more armour, and a bigger engine. They are an expensive investment, and there are considerations of diverting our focus to more convenient multi-purpose designs, or, perhaps, to further expand on the concept."
 medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "A direct evolution from light tanks bourne from a desire of a punchier vehicle, medium tanks may seem to be a step back to heavy tanks. However, their speed and manoeuvrability dwarfs that of their heavier analogues while still being more survivable than light tanks. Effectively a compromise between the previous two school of thought regarding armour designs, the medium tank promises to efficiently fulfill a variety of roles."
 medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "There is an evident race in tank development where additional armour, firepower, and speed have spurred new iterations of our designs. With a new generation of heavy tanks comes a new threat that can be somewhat countered by enlargening our existing medium designs to carry more armour and a heavier main gun."
 medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Further refinements upon our medium tanks have yielded in a design that more resembles a heavy tank of old. Still superior in its versatility, this medium tank still lags behind lighter tanks while not capable of going on a one-to-one fight against heavier contemporaries. Though the idea of the medium tank might be reaching a dead-end, this iteration makes for an excellent tank that is capable in its own right."

 amphibious_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The value of a tank designed for amphibious operations is evident but a considerable engineering challenge. Limited by weight and size, amphibious tanks are most similar to other light tank designs but built with integrated pontoons or other flotation devices to allow them to traverse water. Though light in armour and armament, and a relatively slow speed on the water, limit the scope of these tanks, they are an essential step for armoured amphibious operations."

However, they also confirmed the theory: armoured support that can easily cross large rivers or participate in a beachhead has proven invaluable. New developments in water sealing and designs make these amphibious tanks far more capable in land combat."

 infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Machine guns proved to be powerful weapons but lack mobility. However, submachine guns allow soldiers to maintain high rates of fire even on the move.

 infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "Battle rifles are specially designed to improve soldiers' firepower by utilising either semi-automatic or fully automatic fire modes. As such, battle rifles combine the stopping power and range of previous service rifles with the close-quarters efficacy of submachine guns. Meanwhile, personal anti-tank weapons continue to evolve, allowing the infantry to engage enemy tanks effectively."

 support_weapons_desc:0 "The versatility of automatic weapons is hampered by their weight, and the development of lighter machine guns prove just how effective the use of hoof-held support weapons are. Naturally, said development must continue if our armed forces expect to be combat-effective."
 support_weapons2_desc:0 "Armies have used mortars for quite some time, but it is only now that we can miniaturise this indirect fire support weapon so that infantry squads can use them. From high-explosive ammunition, fragmentation rounds, or smoke canisters, infantry mortars increase the effectiveness of any infantry in either offensive or defensive operations."
 support_weapons4_desc:0 "Landmines, or concealed explosives, are not a novel idea. We have been using some form or another to lay ambushes or close off approach angles. However, battlefield experience and innovation have produced far more reliable mines that can be easily be deployed over larger areas, as well as mine specialisation for either anti-vehicle purposes or anti-personnel duties."

The halftrack design is something of a compromise between tracked and wheeled vehicles, meant to combine the versatility of the former and the speed of the latter. Field experience also influenced these halftracks to offer more means of self-defense, from the inclusion of mounted machineguns to gun ports for the passengers to fire out from."

This makes IFVs more suitable for urban combat than tanks, and could possibly revolutionise mechanised warfare."

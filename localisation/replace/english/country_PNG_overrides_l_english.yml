 NE_strengthen_the_army:0 "The Return Of Tambelon"
 NE_strengthen_the_army_desc:0 "The Bell has been rung and the banishment has been undone. Tambelon has returned, and so has the Father. Soon, the rule of the goats shall return as well. This marks the beginning of a new era. The Ouroboros rotates once again."
 NE_rally_troops:0 "Flesh And Bone"
 NE_rally_troops_desc:0 "Goats ruled the world with the might of amalgamated monsters, made by binding the flesh of various animals into superior constructs. The cages and laboratories of Tambelon still hold many of such creatures. Yet more monsters need to be made, to rebuild the might of goatkind..."
 NE_recruit_spies:0 "The All-Seeing Eye"
 NE_recruit_spies_desc:0 "Now that Grogar is once more in possession of his crystal ball, nothing can be hidden from Him. The sphere sees all there is. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. The secrets of the enemy will be unveiled for all goats to see."
 NE_forced_labour:0 "Crack The Whip"
 NE_forced_labour_desc:0 "The Father created a society without work, where all goats were free to pursue the arts of magic. This utopia was built on the backs of an ocean of worthless slaves. The zebras and camels who settled the desolate lands of former Tambelon seem to have forgotten their distant past as slaves of goatkind. They shall receive a grim reminder of their true purpose."
 NE_heavy_units:0 "Awaken The Titan"
 NE_heavy_units_desc:0 "Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters. Only one has survived this primordial age, tamed by Grogar to be the guardian of Tambelon. Ever since the banishment, it has slept beneath the sands, yet now it shall be awakened."
 
 NE_country_roads_take_me_home_to_the_place_where_i_belong:0 "All Roads Lead To Tambelon"
 NE_country_roads_take_me_home_to_the_place_where_i_belong_desc:0 "Long ago, all roads led to Tambelon. Over the millenia, these roads have been buried beneath sand and soil and what was once the heartland of a global dominion became isolated. With fresh slaves acquired, it is time to rebuild some of these lost roads."
 NE_hire_generals:0 "The Slave-Soldiers Of Darkness"
 NE_hire_generals_desc:0 "During His exile to the Realm of Darkness, Grogar enslaved a barbaric race known as Troggles. These savages have proven themselves to be capable warriors, yet are too weak-willed to rebel against their new masters. Grogar is in need of loyal servants to command his monsters, so the Troggles shall fulfill this duty."
 NE_airforce_expansion:0 "When Pigs Fly"
 NE_airforce_expansion_desc:0 "Goats cannot fly and have no desire to do so. In the past, they gifted this ability to some of their creations to fight against inferior races capable of flight. But those races have now developed winged monstrosities of metal to rule the skies. A new kind of creature must be designed to counter this crude mockery."
 NE_its_almost_harvesting_season:0 "Begin The Harvests"
 NE_its_almost_harvesting_season_desc:0 "Easiest way to gain units of biomass is by simply harvesting it from nature. This has always been the way: Goats take imperfect wild animals and turn them into something greater, magnificent monsters that are a sum of their parts. There will be no lack of animals to capture, as they have multiplied greatly since the banishment."
 NE_crystal_mining:0 "Conquering The Desert"
 NE_crystal_mining_desc:0 "As a trial for the bestial army, the southern half of the Zebhara desert shall be conquered. It will provide valuable experience for goat beastmasters, who haven't fought a proper war for millenia. A valuable crystal mine in the Anega Ridge will also be secured and put into good use."
 NE_magic_generators:0 "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
 NE_magic_generators_desc:0 "The Bewitching Bell is an immensely powerful, indestructible artifact forged in the fires of Tartarus countless millenia ago. However, it gains its power from others. The Bell acts like a magical capacitor, being able to store immense amounts of energy that must be drained from external sources... such as the lesser races of the world."
 NE_magical_experiment:0 "Might And Magic"
 NE_magical_experiment_desc:0 "Now that a new generation of biomancers is being trained, goats shall regain their position as the mightiest mages the world has ever known. Great biomantic spells can be cast upon the enemy, to break their resolve and their bodies. The lesser races will be punished for their hubris and taught a lesson of humility which will not be forgotten."
 NE_reign_of_terror:0 "Reign Of Horror"
 NE_reign_of_terror_desc:0 "What made goats so weak and pathetic after Grogar's banishment was the fact that no one feared them any longer. Fear empowers goats and unlocks their true potential. Goatkind can only regain their lost might by waging a war of terror upon the disgusting subgoat races."
 NE_crackdown_on_populace:0 "Unleash The Monsters"
 NE_crackdown_on_populace_desc:0 "In the distant past, goats released countless monsters to prey upon the lesser races. If they wanted to be saved, they had to become slaves to goatkind. Now the Father and his monsters have returned with a vengeance. Those who once looked down upon us will beg to become slaves again."
 NE_crystal_armour:0 "The Power Of Crystals"
 NE_crystal_armour_desc:0 "Magical crystals are raw, concentrated magical energy, often found in nexuses of natural ley lines. Goats were the first race to discover their true potential, and also learned how to artifically create them by condensing the magical essence of sapient creatures."
 
 NE_southern_offensive:0 "The Four Slave-Races"
 NE_southern_offensive_desc:0 "The hyenas, yeti, gargoyles and centaurs once fulfilled important roles in the goatocracy. The hyenas were fine miners, excavating various minerals which other slaves refined. The yeti were fearsome cold-resistant slave-warriors, loyal to their strong masters. Gargoyles were the greatest masons, carving numerous statues depicting Grogar, while the centaurs were used as living magic capacitors."
 NE_western_offensive:0 "Gift Of The Neighle"
 NE_western_offensive_desc:0 "The fertile Neighle river once watered the vast farms that fed not only slaves, but goats as well. Since the banishment, despicable ponies have settled in the region and erected crude and pathetic sandstone pyramids. All scions of ponykind are Grogar's sworn enemies. They will be punished for their arrogance most severely."
 NE_northern_offensive:0 "Across The Wastes"
 NE_northern_offensive_desc:0 "Barbaric zebras have settled in the north, which has for the most part become a desolate and arid wasteland. Yet forward positions for further northern expansion must be established. The nomadic savages will be tamed and turned into obedient, humble and civilized slaves once again."
 NE_eastern_offensive:0 "Sinking Ships Of The Desert"
 NE_eastern_offensive_desc:0 "Camels are well adapted to deserts, and as such were situationally useful haulers during goatocratic rule. Since the banishment, they tried building a kingdom of their own, which was unsurprisingly taken over by another race. Clearly camels are unable to rule themselves and are in dire need of goat oversight."
 NE_attack_lakes:0 "Pacify The Great Lakes"
 NE_attack_lakes_desc:0 "The vast freshwater reservoirs created by goatkind have fallen into disrepair, yet remain the largest lakes on the continent. Zebras have settled on their lush shores, fighting with each other and enslaving their own kind like true barbarians. The entire region is in dire need of pacification and full scale enslavement."
 NE_attack_rivers:0 "Bray's Homeland"
 NE_attack_rivers_desc:0 "Bray, Grogar's most useful servant, originally came from the land of Asstyria. Now it is finally time for him to return home, as a conqueror. Not only shall the donkeys bend the knee like Bray did, but so shall the two-legged felines of Abyssinia. They will all be made equal through slavery to new supreme masters."
 NE_attack_coast:0 "The Northern Shores"
 NE_attack_coast_desc:0 "The vast expanse of the ocean can already be seen on the horizon as reclamation of the north commences. The land is heavily infested with zebras, though there are newcomers as well: Equestrian Ponies. Even thinking of this loathsome, disgusting subgoat race makes Grogar seethe in pure wrath. They deserve... special treatment for their past aggressions."
 NE_attack_miners:0 "Strangers In A Strange Land"
 NE_attack_miners_desc:0 "The last thing the Father expected to find in the Zebrican south-east was griffons. How did these creatures from another continent end up here? Ultimately, it wasn't important. It simply meant these griffons would return to slavery faster than their relatives across the sea. The familiar faces, zebras and giraffes, will swiftly return to servitude as well."
 NE_attack_southwest:0 "Tame The Horses"
 NE_attack_southwest_desc:0 "During the age of goatocracy, horses were widely used as beasts of burden and for non-magical transportation. They are strong creatures and capable of magic as well, similarly to their lesser pony cousins. Somehow, these ponies have appeared in the frigid southwestern lands as well. Both equine races must be subjugated, although one must suffer more than the other."
 NE_attack_northwest:0 "Saddle Arabian Nightmares"
 NE_attack_northwest_desc:0 "It seems the horses of the west have established close ties with their pony kindred and have tamed the nature of their homeland with technology and magic. Yet despite all their misguided "advancement", they are still prone to petty infighting. A strong hoof needs to govern them no less than the other races, who are not as corrupted by this so-called "modernity"."
 NE_attack_northeast:0 "Crossing The Andelayas"
 NE_attack_northeast_desc:0 "The Andelayan mountains are a formidable natural obstacle, but can ultimately be overcome. Beyond them are the lands of the Zebrican deer, though somehow they have intermingled with their distant cousins from Equus. This unholy union will do little to save them from our wrath."
 NE_attack_southeast:0 "Reclaim The Weather Manifold"
 NE_attack_southeast_desc:0 "A great magical structure built by goatkind lies in ruins, malfunctioning and causing untold chaos in the southeast. Its magical powers have devastated the local ecosphere, and the lesser races are too foolish to repair it, instead calling it the "Golden Temple" like the superstitious barbarians they are. It will be our duty to heal the south-east."
 NE_attack_north:0 "Secure The Seas"
 NE_attack_north_desc:0 "The hippogriffs, harpies and deer of the northern islands will be harder to subjugate, but we have no lack of oceanic monsters that can be used. While the overseas invasion will be extraordinarily difficult, our conquests so far prove our superiority and ability to crush any resistance we face."
 NE_attack_east:0 "Extinguish The Flames"
 NE_attack_east_desc:0 "The kirin are an equine race capable of transforming into fearsome nirik by using emotions of anger and hatred. This made them unreliable slaves, but excellent sources of energy and heating. Goats thus consider kirins to be very valuable to own. By reaching the easternmost shores of the continent, we will finish the enslavement of their pathetic race."

 gwtank_chassis_desc:0 "Inspired by the tales of Griffonian Knights with their heavy armour and equally heavy weaponry, the first tanks were created in 996 during their revolution by Stalliongrad ponies. Slow, mechanically unreliable, and poorly armoured, these rushed conversions of agricultural equipment were nonetheless effective against lightly armed infantry, and thus copied and imitated widely."

 armor_tech_1:0 "Welded Armour"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Winter Revolution only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."

 basic_heavy_tank_chassis_desc:0 "A thorough analysis of recent military conflicts has shown that there is a need for a heavy vehicle to break through the enemy trench line and open up the way for lighter forces to exploit the breakthough. Such a vehicle should heavily armed and well armored, but doesn't have to be very fast."

 basic_light_tank_chassis_short:0 "1005 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "Derived from earlier cavalry tank models, light tanks improve the previous iterations mainly by utilising improved speed and manoeuvrability. The smaller platform limits its offensive and defensive capabilities but should still prove to be a cost-effective tanks chassis for reconnaissance and fire-support duties."

 improved_light_tank_chassis_short:0 "1007 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "As the cheaper alternative, light tanks appear to have a role in the upcoming era of mechanised warfare. Our newest chassis are made explicitly to use new drive trains and house more efficient engines while improving their armour, and this should make future light tank designs more effective in their roles."

 advanced_light_tank_chassis_short:0 "1012 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The proliferation of heavier tanks has put into question the role of the light tanks. Experience has improved our light tank chassis, where the newest models can now mount armour and weaponry that would put them on par with earlier medium tanks. Should our industry not be up to the task, we can always rely on this chassis to be the foundation of our armoured forces."

 amphibious_tank_chassis_1:0 "Amphibious Chassis"
 amphibious_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The value of a tank designed for amphibious operations is evident but a considerable engineering challenge. Limited by weight and size, these chasses are most similar to other light tank designs but built with integrated pontoons or other flotation devices to allow them to traverse water. Though other drawbacks, such as light armour and armament, and a relatively slow speed on the water, limit the scope of these tanks, they are an essential step for armoured amphibious operations."

 amphibious_drive_desc:0 "The first generation of amphibious tanks proved unsatisfactory when operating on land due to their unwieldy hulls that often resembled more like those of boats. A possible solution is to create a set of modular flotation devices and a purpose-built screw that we can mount on most chassis, thus keeping their overall performance on land. Though not always reliable, amphibious drives are a versatile module."

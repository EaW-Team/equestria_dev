 ### Electronics ###
 electronic_mechanical_engineering:0 "Early Electromechanics"
 electronic_mechanical_engineering_desc:0 "Much interest and research into non-magical long-distance communication arose with the global increase in production due to the industrial revolution. As telegraphy and automated telephone exchanges enter public service, electromechanics promises a massive technological jump in communication and computing."

 radio:0 "Mass Adoption of FM Radio"
 radio_desc:0 "Since the invention of frequency modulation, radio transceivers with clearer broadcasts have become commonplace among radio enthusiasts. The utility of these FM radios is evident, as unlike with previous AM radios, the broadcasts are relatively free of static caused by outside interference. This, of course, allows for precise and near-instant communication that is invaluable for our military forces."
 improved_radio: "Specialised Radio Bands"
 improved_radio_desc: "There is a fairly large frequency range within the radio spectrum, but there have already been instances of radio channels sharing similar frequency bands that lead to accidental interferences. Selecting certain radio bands for different uses will allow us to use the radio spectrum while preventing interference efficiently. Commercial radio stations will appreciate this, as will our military branches."
 advanced_radio: "Radio Miniaturisation"
 advanced_radio_desc: "Initial forays in making two-way wireless radio sets portable were generally impractical due to the typically fragile nature of the electronic equipment. Early sets could be mounted in vehicles, but a refinement in battery and vacuum tube technology now makes it possible to reduce the size of the radio transceiver to a backpack or saddlebag. This is an invaluable tool for even an infantry squad and is a worthwhile investment."

 mechanical_computing:0 "Modern Analytical Engines"
 mechanical_computing_desc:0 "Differential engines and general-purpose computers have been in use for some time, though most have been relatively limited and straightforward in their function. Early machines were unprogrammable and not computationally universal. Using punch cards as instructions and rods that act as memory, subsequent engines are more versatile and faster than before."
 computing_machine:0 "Motor-Driven Computers"
 computing_machine_desc:0 "Using electrically driven motors to turn rods and axial wheels, this new generation of computers are the first to use an electro-mechanical computing mechanism and a character computation system instead of a decimal numeral system. These features allow the computer to calculate high order equations or quickly calculate equations of lower orders. These will significantly aid the efforts of our researchers."
 improved_computing_machine:0 "Early Automatic Digital Computers"
 improved_computing_machine_desc:0 "The first programmable automatic digital computers are massive machines, even when compared to previous mechanical counting engines, but have many hundreds of relays. These allow the implementation of larger bit word lengths that can operate at faster clock frequencies. The speed and accuracy of these machines permit highly complex calculations that are typical in cryptography and aerodynamics, both growing fields in today's age."
 advanced_computing_machine:0 "Electronic Digital Computers"
 advanced_computing_machine_desc:0 "Initially a minor scientific curiosity, we've found that vacuum tubes can form a purely electronic circuit. Already in use in some electronic data processing systems for telephone exchanges, these all-electronic computers can be upscaled and explicitly programmed for analysis and mathematical processing. Though still prone to mechanical breakdown, the fewer moving pieces offer fewer chances of the latter happening."

 basic_encryption:1 "Mechanical Rotor Cyphers"
 basic_encryption_desc:0 "The introduction of electro-mechanical integral computers has rendered most traditional cyphers based on lingual encryptions vulnerable. However, we can use the same computers and adapt them as cyphering tools for our existing polyalphabetic cyphers. With multiple rotors, these devices scramble the letters of messages that can only be understood with a key. The cypher machines aren't foolproof, but their encoding is solid enough to stop most attackers."
 improved_encryption:1 "Applied Number Theory"
 improved_encryption_desc:0 "All of our codes are structured, and their strength lies in how obscure the structures are. The more cycles of the cypher arrangements we have, the denser our encoding is to cryptanalysts. These permutations can be increased exponentially with a straightforward equation, though we've struggled with integrating factorials of a high order. With computer assistance, our encoders can easily use higher-order factorials to produce stronger cyphers."
 advanced_encryption:1 "Pulse-Code Modulation"
 advanced_encryption_desc:0 "The spread of digital computers has offered an exciting option for our encoders. We can digitally represent samples of analogue radio signals via pulse-code modulation (PCM) and store them in binary. This method adds a new layer of encryption by producing seemingly random sounds that our computers can transcribe and translate. This breakthrough is sure to make our military communications even more secure."
 basic_decryption:1 "Frequency Analysis"
 basic_decryption_desc:0 "Intelligence gathering is increasingly becoming a mathematical problem, as radios and telegrams are encoded in increasingly hidden systems. Machine-assisted decryption is now a possibility with the introduction of cyclometers. With these devices, mathematicians use frequency analysis to 'count' the letters in cyphertexts and aid in exploiting flawed cyphers."
 improved_decryption:1 "Side-Channel Attacks"
 improved_decryption_desc:0 "Traditionally, decrypting hidden messages involves a concentrated effort in decoding the messages themselves. However, we've found that we can gain information from the implementation of computer systems used in cypher machines. We can exploit these additional sources of data to glean the nature of the cyphers. These 'side-channel' attacks require considerable technical knowledge, but decyphering enemy intelligence is crucial to our war efforts."
 advanced_decryption:1 "Automated Deduction Analysis"
 advanced_decryption_desc:0 "As enemy cyphers become more sophisticated, immediate analysis of codes becomes far more challenging. We can detect specific cypher routines with parallelised automated theorem proving run through high clock speed computers. From there, the deductions made by running logic engines offer various clues and traces of the otherwise impenetrable cypher structures."

 atomic_research:0 "Atomic Research"
 atomic_research_desc:0 "In nuclear fission, splitting the atom yields enormous amounts of energy and limitless destructive capability."

 experimental_rockets:0 "National Rocket Program"
 experimental_rockets_desc:0 "Rockets are not a new concept, for they have been a staple vehicle for firework displays. For decades, these have been powered by gunpowder and were not considered viable weapons of war due to their wild inaccuracy. However, with recent pioneers in rocketry, such as liquid-fuel engines, there is renewed military interest in rockets as a form of area-of-effect artillery. We should consider allowing further experimentation with the construction of state-controlled rocket launch pads."
 rocket_engines:0 "Useable Rocket Engines"
 rocket_engines_desc:0 "Our understanding of rockets has advanced to the point where we can adopt them as basic unguided weapons launched from aircraft or land-based artillery systems. Some more ambitious uses involve powering entire planes with a rocket engine. Though these are very fast, rocket-powered aircraft have limited range, and the unguided "flying bombs" don't carry much explosive charge. However, much more can be done to improve our rocket-based weaponry."
 improved_rocket_engines:0 "Improved Rocket Engines"
 improved_rocket_engines_desc:0 "Focusing our efforts on new rocket designs has produced results. A new understanding of how an airframe behaves at high speeds and a refined rocket engine have improved our rocket-powered aircraft. Conversely, returning to a more basic design for unguided missiles has vastly increased the latter's speed and capabilities, abandoning all plane-based flying bomb notions."
 advanced_rocket_engines:0 "Advanced Rocket Engines"
 advanced_rocket_engines_desc:0 "Continued research in rocketry only advances our rocket-based designs. Far more reliable engines allow us to enlarge our warheads and improve our rocket-powered aircraft's capabilities to the point that they make for viable short-range interceptors. As for our missile program, the challenges encountered in making a precision weapon have frustrated our scientists. Many are now looking to missiles as possible vehicles to deliver nuclear warheads..."
 
 rocket_interceptor_equipment:0 "Early Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_desc:0 "Rocket-powered interceptor aircraft based on gliders can, for short periods of time, move faster than any other plane. While volatility of the fuel puts the planes at risk, they can take off and react to attacks faster than any enemy will expect."
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_1:0 "Early Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_short:0 "Early Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc:0 "Short range experimental interceptor powered by an unreliable chemical rocket engine."
 rocket_interceptor:0 "Early Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_desc:0 "Rocket-powered interceptor aircraft based on gliders can, for short periods of time, move faster than any other plane. While volatility of the fuel puts the planes at risk, they can take off and react to attacks faster than any enemy will expect."

 rocket_interceptor_equipment_2:0 "Improved Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short:0 "Imp. Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc:0 "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximize the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."
 rocket_interceptor_2:0 "Improved Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_2_desc:0 "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximize the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."

 rocket_interceptor_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short:0 "Adv. Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc:0 "New landing techniques and safer fuel systems have improved rocket fighters' chance of success and survival significantly, fulfilling the once theoretical potential of these cutting-edge vehicles."
 rocket_interceptor_3:0 "Advanced Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_3_desc:0 "New landing techniques and safer fuel systems have improved rocket fighters' chance of success and survival significantly, fulfilling the once theoretical potential of these cutting-edge vehicles."

 guided_missile_equipment_1:0 "Flying Bomb"
 guided_missile_equipment_1_short:0 "Flying Bomb"
 guided_missile_equipment_1_desc:0 "The objective of delivering an explosive ordinance to a target has been resolved in multiple ways, be it through long-range artillery or by simply dropping it on the target. Each solution bears its own disadvantages, and a new solution has cropped up with our advances in rocketry. Essentially a flying bomb, this is a disposable rocket-powered aircraft aimed at a distant target. Its accuracy leaves much to be desired, and its launch sequences are lengthy and complicated, but its speed and long range make up for the cost and potential for destruction."
 guided_missile_equipment_2:0 "Early Guided Ballistic Missile"
 guided_missile_equipment_2_short:0 "Early Guided Ballistic Missile"
 guided_missile_equipment_2_desc:0 "The performance of our flying bombs has been less than stellar. Though speedy, they can still be intercepted by fast aircraft and AA fire. This has led to calls for improvement. Discarding the more traditional winged aircraft design, these rocket-powered missiles are far larger. Though the warhead is still essentially the same, their enlargened engine and fuel tanks make these missiles far faster than previous flying bombs. They are our enemies' nightmare, who cannot realistically intercept these missiles."
 guided_missile_equipment_3:0 "Improved Guided Missile"
 guided_missile_equipment_3_short:0 "Imp. Guided Missile"
 guided_missile_equipment_3_desc:0 "Additional advances in our rocketry have only refined our early ballistic missiles. This new iteration of missiles burns harder for even longer, extending the range and speed of our missiles. They can carry a larger warhead to compensate for their inaccuracy, making for lethal area weapons. In addition, early experiments in multiple-stage rockets, though unsuccessful for now, do show immense promise for the future of our ballistic missiles."


 ### Industry ###
 basic_machine_tools:0 "National Standards"
 basic_machine_tools_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, numerous different production centres follow their standards that don't mesh with one another, causing difficulties and sluggishness in equipment production. There have already been some efforts to standardise the different processes, but when most factories can't even agree to standard lengths, it is time for the government to take direct action."
 improved_machine_tools:0 "Automatic Turret Lathes"
 improved_machine_tools_desc:0 "Lathes have been in use for millennia, but it is only in recent times that with the power of steam and now electricity, our metalworking lathes' tool-posts can be driven with minimal effort. A new innovative design with turret lathes reduce the worker's input to merely setting the workpiece with a crank. At the same time, a powered mounting moves the word piece against the cutting tool, drastically reducing worker error and effort while maximising their production output. "
 advanced_machine_tools:0 "Proliferation of Servomechanisms"
 advanced_machine_tools_desc:0 "Workstations involve repetitive actions and inputs from workers that involve dangerous equipment if mishandled. To reduce the risk of work accidents or machining malfunctions on the part of the workers, we can install automatic devices called servomechanisms that monitor the machining operation of workstations and, if set up correctly, can correct errors. The job's no less boring but far safer."
 assembly_line_production:0 "Powered Assembly Lines"
 assembly_line_production_desc:0 "The idea of a powered assembly line isn't new, and the Manehattan and Fillydelphian automotive industries are excellent examples of its use. We can adapt the methodology to produce the small and intermediate parts of other vehicles and weaponry, radically increasing the output of our military equipment."
 flexible_line:0 "Adaptive Lines"
 flexible_line_desc:0 "We can implement further automatisation of our assembly lines, but we've found that this can cause issues when switching their production. Machines are not intelligent, and sudden shifts would bring them to a grinding halt. If we only automate some aspects of the production line intelligently, the initial loss of efficiency should be minimal when switching production."
 streamlined_line:0 "Structured Lines"
 streamlined_line_desc:0 "We can improve the efficiency of our production lines by restructuring them to minimise the work time necessary to create our equipment and vehicles. Further division and automation of workstations increase their output which in turn speeds up overall assembly and production. This system is susceptible to massive slow-downs when the factory is forced to change its production, but this is a small price to pay for efficiency."

 improved_equipment_conversion:0 "Improved Equipment Conversion"
 improved_equipment_conversion_desc:0 "Advancements in engineering allow us to fix the issues we found in previous models and update them to fit our current needs."
 advanced_equipment_conversion:0 "Advanced Equipment Conversion"
 advanced_equipment_conversion_desc:0 "Setting up specialized teams and assembly lines for retrofitting our outdated models will keep our war machine deadly at all times."

 concentrated_industry:0 "Larger Workspaces"
 concentrated_industry_desc:0 "Something as simple as larger workspaces for our manufacturers to operate in allows for a concentration of material, work lines, and workers. It will make individual factories more productive but worsen the consequences should something go wrong...\n\n"
 concentrated_industry2:0 "Multiple Integrated Production Lines"
 concentrated_industry2_desc:0 "Should the equipment and products be composed of multiple different parts, it would only stand to reason to set up the necessary production lines in the same facility. This dramatically increases output while keeping costs down."
 concentrated_industry3:0 "Adapted Transportation Links"
 concentrated_industry3_desc:0 "Larger industrial complexes require a far greater input of material to maintain production efficiency. Preparing specialised transportation hubs and integration to allow the greater flow of equipment and material to allow expansion of our existing factories."
 concentrated_industry4:0 "Aggregated Factories"
 concentrated_industry4_desc:0 "Why have different similar factories apart from one another when they could be accrued into one mega-complex? The costs would be diminished, and the overall efficiency and output will increase significantly."
 concentrated_industry5:0 "Redrawn Industrial District Lines"
 concentrated_industry5_desc:0 "In most cases, the layout of the industrial sectors and districts in our cities is very ad hoc. While individual complexes are planned out intelligently, they cannot expand beyond the restrictive delineations of previous city plans. If we prepare entire terrains and districts for future use, new factories and manufacturers can make the most out of the sector laid out for them."

 dispersed_industry:0 "Separated Complexes"
 dispersed_industry_desc:0 "Spreading out the infrastructure of our industry is counter-intuitive if we were aiming for gross output. Still, separating workers, materials, and production lines from one another toughens the overall infrastructure should it be targeted by enemy forces or saboteurs.\n\n"
 dispersed_industry2:0 "Downscaled Lines"
 dispersed_industry2_desc:0 "We have enough machinery, material and workers to build large industrial complexes. However, our efforts would be better spent by making smaller yet more numerous factories to maintain overall production capacity should something go wrong."
 dispersed_industry3:0 "Integrated Long-Distance Transportation"
 dispersed_industry3_desc:0 "Generally, complex products such as rifles or vehicles are composed of multiple parts that need to be manufactured. By keeping these as far apart as possible while connecting them with robust transportation lines, our industrial capacity will grow while keeping it safe."
 dispersed_industry4:0 "Disguised Factories"
 dispersed_industry4_desc:0 "Camouflaging our more critical factories as different, harmless industries helps divert unwanted attention from them, thus further protecting our vital production lines. "
 dispersed_industry5:0 "Underground Facilities"
 dispersed_industry5_desc:0 "To further hide our factories, we can transfer them underground, disguised as hills. A costly and massive undertaking, but necessary to maintain secrecy and to make them resistant against attacks."

 construction_tech_research:0 "Construction Tech Research"
 construction1:0 "Steel and Cement"
 construction1_desc:0 "Since the industrial revolution, there has been a global population boom that outpaced more traditional construction methods. With a greater demand for new buildings and refurbished edifices that can last, wood and stone construction must give way to cement and steel. It is a massive shakeup, but a necessary one."
 construction2:0 "Pneumatic Tools"
 construction2_desc:0 "Hammers, wrenches, and saws will still see their use well into the future. Still, more modern construction methods require tools such as riveters, pneumatic drills, and nail guns, which in turn make for better and more solid buildings that can be erected even faster."
 construction3:0 "Mechanised Construction"
 construction3_desc:0 "For time immemorial, we have used machines for larger constructions. However, with greater and easier access to fuel-powered machines such as trucks and cranes, the same work and tasks necessary for construction are far less labour-intensive and can be done at a fraction of the time. There is a relatively high upfront and recurring cost in acquiring these new machines, but this is massively offset by the savings they bring."
 construction4:0 "The Moment Distribution Method"
 construction4_desc:0 "As beam structures proliferate and grow taller and more ambitious, further structural analysis is required, specifically for the flexural effects upon the joints of structures. Developing fixed-end moments distributed as such as to achieve equilibrium in the overall design. This somewhat math-intensive methodology does require specialised engineers, but it will produce larger and sturdier structures. "
 construction5:0 "Utilitarian Architecture"
 construction5_desc:0 "Much as traditionalists will bemoan current architectural trends, there is no denying that newer structures are far more practical and inexpensive. Adopting these architectural designs as the new standard for concurrent construction may create 'ugly' districts and cities. Still, they shall be monuments of our might, well after we're gone!"

 excavation1:0 "Hydraulic Drills"
 excavation1_desc:0 "A sturdy shovel and pickaxe may be the universal symbol of the miner, but they are labour-intensive tools. With the introduction of hydraulic tools such as presses and drills, we significantly cut down the risk of exhaustion for our miners, even in hot, damp underground mines. With minimal training, a single miner armed with a drill will outperform ten miners with pickaxes and shovels."
 excavation2:0 "Geological Mapping"
 excavation2_desc:0 "Prospecting of and exploration for new common metal reserves is a slow and painstaking process. If done poorly, different mining groups might accidentally hit the same vein! This is why proper geological mapping is essential to help distinguish the various strata of the earth and narrow down potential prospecting spots."
 excavation3:0 "Standardised Mechanisation"
 excavation3_desc:0 "Not all mines have the appropriate machinery, such as mine cages, hoists, skips, and raise borers, that reduce risk and increase output. Ensuring a national standard of equipment and machines to automate as much of the exploration as possible is smart and ethical, making the workplace safer."
 excavation4:0 "Early Open-Pit Mining Operations"
 excavation4_desc:0 "On a wholly different scale from traditional quarries, open-pit mining is a mostly mechanised form of surface mining that uses horizontal benches. Far more suitable for surfaces that prevent tunnelling, open-pit mines allow for easy expansions until the mineral resource is exhausted. This method is relatively expensive, requiring large excavators and trucks to haul the ore and waste material. Still, it makes for a fast and easy method for large mining operations."
 excavation5:0 "Shrinkage Stoping"
 excavation5_desc:0 "Stopes have been created since the beginning of underground mining. However, manual stope systems have been surpassed by shrinkage stoping—the mining proceeds from the bottom up in horizontal slices with the broken ore left in place for miners to work on. This is a far more efficient and safer stoping method, which improves a mine's overall yield."

 fuel_silos:0 "Organised Fuel Storage"
 fuel_silos_desc:0 "As liquid fuels become ever more commonplace and their storage grows, facilities dedicated to safeguard the resource become necessary. Silos and tanks to contain the fuel, pipes to allow easy access and transfer, and valves to secure it. These storage facilities are designed with potential expansion in mind should we need to increase our reserves."

 synth_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Material Experiments"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, the demand for valuable resources outpaces their natural supply. Synthesisation of oil and rubber show promise, with synthetic hydrocarbon oils and isoprene respectively being prime candidates in this effort."

 oil_processing:0 "Initial Hydrocarbon Oils"
 oil_processing_desc:0 "A somewhat poor alternative to conventional petroleum, hydrocarbon oils are based on organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Certain alkanes make for a suitable combustible fuel source that can supplement other more efficient fuels."
 improved_oil_processing:0 "Exploration of Hydrocarbons"
 improved_oil_processing_desc:0 "Growing fuel demands necessitate additional use of all of our fuels, including hydrocarbon oils. More streamlined extraction and storage methods for these will help meet the demand, even though petroleum is still a premium fuel source."
 advanced_oil_processing:0 "New Hydrogenation Processes"
 advanced_oil_processing_desc:0 "A developmental breakthrough in hydrogenation has made possible the production of a synthetic oil from coal dust. With copious amount of coal, this new synthetic oil may prove to be just as plentiful, if not more, than petroleum."
 modern_oil_processing:0 "Liquid Hydrocarbons"
 modern_oil_processing_desc:1 "Converting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to liquid hydrocarbons greatly expand the possibilities for alternative fuel sources. Though still somewhat less efficient than regular fuel, liquid hydrocarbon is just as viable due to the ease of storage compared to other hydrocarbon fuels."

 rubber_processing:0 "Semi-Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 rubber_processing_desc:1 "We know that heating isoprene with hydrochloric acid produces a rubber-like polymer. Though isoprene can only be obtained from distilling natural rubber, this process allows for an increased output from regular distillation and vulcanisation of rubber if we invest in it."
 improved_rubber_processing:0 "Initial Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc:1 "With the discovery of turpentine cracking, we can obtain isoprene without relying on natural rubber, though the process takes several weeks before ready to be turned into the rubber-like polymer."
 advanced_rubber_processing:0 "Sodium-based Polymerisation"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc:1 "The polymerisation of isoprene can be sped up considerably with the use of sodium. Needless to say, this process will greatly increase output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing:0 "Butadiene-based Polymerisation"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc:1 "Previous iterations of synthetic rubber have always been inferior to distilled natural rubber, making them less reliable. Polybutadiene, a butadiene polymer, is significantly more durable than natural rubber, effectively increasing our rubber production."

 fuel_refining:0 "Systemised Naphtha Refineries"
 fuel_refining_desc:0 "Previously, 'stills' could be used to separate the constituents of crude oil and condense the resultant vapours into liquid fractions, primarily kerosene and 'straight run' naphtha. There has been a scramble to produce the necessary naphtha with the invention of the internal combustion engine, leading to erratic and disorganised refining facilities. By organising the refineries with considerations made for all aspects, overall fuel production will improve and grow more efficient."
 fuel_refining2:0 "Improved Thermal Cracking"
 fuel_refining2_desc:0 "Automotive fuel is beginning to outstrip the market requirements for naphtha and kerosene. Thus, we must convert to light fuels such as gasoline. Previously a fraction byproduct from thermal cracking, we can improve distillation methods to favour greater yields of the more valuable gasoline instead of kerosene or naphtha."
 fuel_refining3:0 "Advancements in Naphtha Catalysis"
 fuel_refining3_desc:0 "A byproduct of a typical atmospheric distillation of crude oil is 'heavy' naphtha, which catalysed into a reformate essential for the gasoline blend. Advancements in this process vastly improve the gasoline blending pool's capacity and increase fuel production."
 fuel_refining4:0 "Reclaiming Coker and FCC Gas Oil"
 fuel_refining4_desc:0 "The process of producing coker naphtha and fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) gasoline creates gas oil as a waste byproduct, typically unused in producing fuel. We've discovered that we can make fuel oil by using both the coker and the FCC with the gas oil. This 'heavy' fuel is excellent for marine engines and provides our maritime vessels with a supplement of fuel that doesn't cut into our general fuel reserves."
 fuel_refining5:0 "Supplemental Diesel Production"
 fuel_refining5_desc:0 "We've been creating diesel oil as a side product of our atmospheric distillation and hydrocracking for some time. Though it is louder, 'dirtier', and requires a different ignition process in engines from gasoline, diesel is more efficient. We might not entirely shift over to diesel, but not exploiting this other fuel source would be foolish, as we can produce more fuel overall with it."

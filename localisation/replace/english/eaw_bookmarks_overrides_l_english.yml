Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."

He remembered how this land had once been fertile and green. Now, it was a wasteland. Perhaps one day, flowers would blossom here again.\n\n"M'lord," came a sound from behind him, and He turned. It was Bray, a donkey who had prepared the returning ritual and was His most loyal assistant. "The six goats who aided me wish to speak to you." Grogar nodded, so Bray bowed and left. Soon, the six heroes entered the balcony and knelt before Him. He already knew their names: Gore, Randy, Oskar, Giles, Abram and Rachel.\n"Rise," He commanded, and they did so. "You have proven yourself to be competent and cunning. Therefore, you shall become my advisors. Your first task is to tell me what has happened to the world while I was gone."\n"The world has gone to ruin," Rachel explained. "The lesser races have failed to find unity and squabble amongst themselves. Some of your monsters still roam the land to this day, as nobody has managed to exterminate them yet. The fools are obsessed with technology rather than magic."\n"So are you," said Randy and bleated in amusement.\n"Silence!" Grogar commanded. "If we plan to reclaim our world, then we must be better than the barbarians. I shall tolerate no infighting or tinkering with useless gadgets.

He looked at them and remembered all he had planned to do with them, before that accursed pony, Gusty, had banished him to the Realm of Darkness.\n\nNow, he could finally fulfill those plans.\n\nHe kept walking and entered into the lower levels, where His previous creations were kept. They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature he had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but he was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use. The might of Tambelon would slowly but surely be rebuilt. New terrible monsters would be made, and the world would learn to fear goats again."

There was little they did to resist, and those brave ones who did quickly perished. His people, the folk of Azir, were driven out of their homes and herded like cattle into a vast, dark city which appeared like a desert mirage. There, they were all forced to work, no matter their rank. Chieftains laboured alongside servants. They were all equal in slavery now.\n\nTin Zinan had been a slave once. And he had sworn to never be one again.\n\nDay and night, they all toiled in a workshop, where they were instructed to make large plates of crystal-infused armour for the beasts. They were forced to use the most basic tools and were allowed little rest and few provisions. Tin Zinan couldn't stand for this. He had to show that zebras like him would never accept slavery. Death was preferable to it.\n\nHe stood up on a workbench and proclaimed to all other slaves: "My fellow Azirians! A most terrible fate has befallen us. Yet do not despair! Hope lives on in our hearts. One day, we shall break free from our shackles! We must never fully submit, but always use little acts of resistance to defy our evil masters. Sabotage the armour, work as slowly as possible, go on hunger strike, do anything you can to show that you are free zebras!"\n\nThe other slaves cheered and chanted his name, and a riot started as they began to break tools and dismantle the plates they had made. But it did not last long. Soon, the doors broke open and ravenous chimeras and manticores poured inside. A terrible slaughter began. Zebras screamed as they were torn apart by claws and teeth and eaten alive. Tin Zinan did his best to fight back, but it was all in vain.\n\nOn the following day, Tin Zinan and a dozen other rebellious slaves returned to the workshops. Their bodies had been biomantically modified: Mouths had been replaced with small feeding holes and their rear legs had been removed, forcing them to crawl like maggots.  It was a warning to all slaves that resistance would be punished most severely."

The name was familiar to her, as she had attended his presentation about the mysterious ruins he had studied in Azir. His family was begging for any information about his whereabouts. She felt sorry for them and hoped he would be found soon, alive and well.\n\nWhile the desert of Azir was still fresh on her mind, she spotted another, tiny article talking about it. There was a brief summary of strange rumours coming out of the region with nothing substantial to support them. But it was strange coincidence that these rumours had appeared around the same time when the archaeologist had gone missing. Could there be a connection?\n\nPerhaps she was just being paranoid as always. But a part of her wanted to investigate the matter. If anything, she wanted to bring closure to the archaeologist's family."

She turned to the door of the archaeologist's apartment and unlocked it with a key given by his family. The two ponies entered and looked around. "Hm, nothing seems out of the ordinary," Twilight mumbled.\nRarity took a closer look, narrowing her eyes and inspecting the furniture. "That is because you do not look with the eyes of a detective. Aha!" Her horn glowed and she levitated a strand of white hair. "According to your description, the missing individual did not have a white tail, coat or mane, yet I found this!"\n"That's... strange, but doesn't really prove anything. Let's keep looking, I guess."\n"Yes, the more clues the better!"\nNext they inspected the archaeologist's office table. There were various notes about previous expeditions, but nothing about Azir. "Strange," Twilight said. "I think there's some papers missing, but they're not here."\n"Tsk tsk! Again, think like a detective. What if there's a hidden compartment?"\n"...Why would he hide notes about his studies?"\nRarity leaned closer at the table and knocked at the wood with her hoof, listening closely at the sound. "Quiet, I'm trying to hear a hollow sound." After several knocks, her eyes widened and she rubbed the surface, looking for a seam. Once she found it, she used magic to pull up a lid which revealed concealed papers. "Here they are!"\nTwilight was flabbergasted as Rarity gave the papers to her. "You found them! They're all about his final survey at Azir!" She quickly skimmed over the papers and even found a few drawings. One of them depicted a strange black sphere of crystal."

It was strange, but when Twilight studied the white strand of hair Rarity had found, she deduced that it had indeed belonged to a goat. Something very strange had happened in the apartment.\n\nGoats were few and far between, but not something the Mane Six hadn't seen before. Fluttershy had once met an assertiveness trainer known as Iron Will, who had hired several goat assistants. Because of his personal connections to this elusive race, Twilight decided to send a telegram to Asterion, asking him if he could provide them with any useful information.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nA response soon arrived. One of Iron Will's most important assistants, Randy the Showgoat, had gone missing after meeting a certain pony archaeologist. While Iron Will did not know what had happened to him, he did know that Randy had travelled to Equestria to visit the archeologist. Clearly, Randy had been in the apartment. But why? Why were goats interested in some desert ruins that had recently been found?\n\nTwilight realized that there was only one way to find out. She'd have to visit the ruins in person and uncover their mystery with the help of her friends."

Pinkie said and drank from a comically large flask.\n"Careful with that, we need to save up for the return trip," Applejack warned.\n"How much farther must we continue?" Rarity asked, walking under the shadow of an umbrella that was held by Fluttershy.\nTwilight examined a map and a compass. "We're almost there! If my calculations are correct, that is. But they usually are!"\n"Looks like you're right," Rainbow said and pointed at the distance. "Someone's coming!"\n\nThe six ponies looked ahead and saw a large creature rapidly approaching. It did not look like a mirage.\n"Um... did you mean something?" Fluttershy asked nervously.\nApplejack squinted her eyes. "The heck is that? I don't like the look of it one bit."\n\nAs the creature got close enough, it spread its wings and took flight. It soared above them, covering the sun, and then dived.\n"Well, that, uh... that's a manticore!" Twilight exclaimed, and moments before the beast descended upon them, she created a magical forcefield around the group. The manticore slammed onto it, and immediately started clawing at it, roaring ferociously."

"What if I just-"\n"Everypony, back off. Twilight, lower the shield!" Fluttershy ordered. Somewhat hesitantly, the others obeyed. "Now, mister manticore, I-"\nThe beast immediately swung its claws at her, but she was pushed out of the way by Rainbow Dash. "W-wait, why didn't it listen to me?" Fluttershy asked, visibly shocked. "Maybe it's not in the mood for talking," Rainbow replied. "AJ, you know what to do!"\nApplejack nodded and pulled out a gun. "It's good we're well prepared, eh?" As the beast approached, she loaded it, took aim and fired.\n\nThe manticore was taken aback by the flash of light, grimaced at her, then fell limp and collapsed onto the sand. Rainbow covered Fluttershy's eyes. There was a moment of deafening silence.\n\nIt was broken by Pinkie. "Wow, nice shot!"\n"Heh, thanks, I've had some practice," Applejack said and put the weapon on her back. She turned to the two pegasi. "Dash, tell her I used the magical stun gun."\n"Think that'll help?" she replied sarcastially.\nFluttershy was almost sobbing. "I... I don't understand why it didn't..."\nTwilight examined the unconscious creature. "This isn't right. Manticores have never been seen in deserts."\n"Ahem... what about those creatures?" Rarity said and pointed to the horizon.\n\nDozens of beasts were approaching, creating a dust storm with their paws, claws and wings. It was a terrifying sight, and the ponies' eyes widened when they saw it. Twilight gulped. "Looks like we're going home early, girls. Gallop!""

Rainbow Dash was especially upset about the fact that they had to give up and return home, believing she could defeat all the monsters herself. The unfortunate truth was that they alone could do little to investigate the desert. At least they had learned that something was seriously wrong: the Zebhara desert was usually largely devoid of life, but now it was teeming with all kinds of monsters like the Everfree Forest itself. But if they wanted to find out what had happened, they'd need to go home and devise a new plan.\n\nTwilight was already busy with this while travelling on a ship to Equestria. Just before they arrived at the port of Baltimare, her eyes lit up and she exclaimed "Eureka!". She quickly explained her idea to her friends: as travel by land was so difficult and dangerous, an airplane could be used instead. It was better than flying into the desert alone, and safer from possible flying monsters like manticores, especially if it was armed with weapons. An airplane could fly straight into the desert and find the source of the monsters from above, even taking pictures if necessary. Most of the ponies agreed that it was a good idea, except for Rainbow Dash who claimed she could fly by herself with ease. Twilight replied simply with "Yeah, of course you could" and began to write a letter to the Equestrian Air Force."

Now, however, he had fulfilled his destiny and started a new life in Tambelon, the ancient capital of goatkind. His father had told many myths about it before he had died, yet none of them could quite prepare him to live there. Goats were everywhere, living alongside monsters and slaves who fulfilled all menial jobs and assisted their masters whenever needed. Randy would never again have to be anyone's assistant ever again. This thought made him bleat quite happily.\n\nGoats were free to do whatever they wished, as long as it did not harm other goats (those who broke this fundamental law were turned into biomantically twisted, shapeless abominations, condemned to eternal suffering). Some goats chose a life of leisure and luxury, but usually got bored of it and picked some duty to fulfill like the others did. Some became biomancers, others studied the mysteries of the universe, some became slave- or beastmasters. Randy decided to put his organization skills to use and became a manager. He would assign tasks for slaves to fulfill and helped organize the running of society in Tambelon. While goats saw him as an outsider, they knew he was one of the Six who had participated in the ritual to liberate Tambelon, and was thus deeply respected. He soon proved himself capable, too, helping everything run smoothly. He did not receive wages, as he received everything necessary for a comfortable life for free.

Abram's mother had taught him to speak it as a kid, but he had almost forgotten it. He was now unsure of what to do, wandering the wide streets (constantly kept clean by slaves) aimlessly. One goat took notice of this and approached him.\n"What is wrong, friend?" she asked, speaking in goatish. Abram sighed and bleated sadly. "I feel like I don't belong here. I cannot continue doing my old job that I did while living amongst sub-goat scum."\n"Oh, well, as Grogar says, every goat must take care of each other! Maybe I can help you. I work as an archivist, managing the records in the Great Archive. Maybe you'd like to help out with that?"\n"Is there any paper to eat?"\nThe stranger was taken aback by this. "Well, not really, no. Was that really what you did as a job?"\nHe frowned. "Well, yes, but I had to be very specific about what to eat. I had to thoroughly examine texts and only read articles that contained forbidden words or phrases."\n"Well, sounds like you could put some of your skills to use at the archive! How does that sound?"\nHe smiled. "I... suppose I could try it out. Sorry for my accent, I'm not used to speaking goatish. What's your name? I'm Abram."\n"I'm Mary. You're one of the six?!

It was hard for her to simply abandon all that. So, despite the Father's warning, in the dark of the night she secretly collected scrap metal and began assembling things in her room. Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time before she was discovered.\n\nOne day, a group of goats broke into her room, accompanied by a lumbering Maulwurf.

It is a joyous occasion, and we ought to pay our respects to our Father for all the good things He has done for goatkind. He who led us down the Path of Now And Forever, He who tore down the gates of Tartarus, He who creates new forms of life to serve us, He who taught us the secrets of biomancy. Every day we must remember all this and thank Him. In return, we may receive His blessing, if we remain humble and obedient. Think of all the impure heathens in the world who deny the rule of the Father. They will never have a chance of being blessed. Instead, they shall be cursed and punished, made into slaves, their bodies twisted and broken as needed. For them, we shall feel no pity. This is the Path of Now and Forever: the mastery of goatkind, the goatocracy, to ensure eternal freedom and peace.\n\nMany of you lived for countless generations, for countless millenia, among heathens, myself included. Yet we remained faithful, never losing hope, knowing that one day the Father would return, when the time was right. And our faith has been rewarded, for the Father is back with us. Now the paradise of old shall return. Yet there is much work to be done. Many heathens remain arrogant and unpunished. It is our duty to fulfill the wishes of the Father and go forth to crush them all. With unwavering faith in our victory, we shall one day stand triumphant.

They were watched over by a hungry pack of bugbears and several goats. One of the goats was Oskar, the occultists who had gained fame by participating in the ritual that reverted Grogar's banishment. As the slaves were put to work, he spoke to them in their language: "I hope you all understand the importance of this work you are doing. Our Father requires many monuments dedicated to his eternal glory. You heathens of course think this is nonsense, that your work is unimportant, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The more He is glorified, the stronger He becomes. One day you all will accept Him as your own Father, too, and abandon all thoughts of resistance, sabotage, or rebellion. It is inevitable."\n\nOne of the slaves appeared to be angered by this. She threw her chisel at Oskar and muttered several curses at him. The goat nimbly dodged the flying tool, then narrowed his eyes. His horns began to glow, and the angry slave's body suddenly cracked and twisted. She let out a gurgling screech of agony as the nerves in her body snapped. Her body continued to convulse and change shape even as the screaming ended. Finally, nothing was left of her except a shapeless lump of flesh and bones. The other slaves looked in horror, and when Oskar turned to look at them, they swiftly returned to work.\n\n"Eat what's left of her," Oskar said, and a bugbear grabbed the former slave's corpse and consumed it.

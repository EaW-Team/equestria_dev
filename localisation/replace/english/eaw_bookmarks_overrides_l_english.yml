 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned on Equus. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around herself. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces many internal conflicts and problems. Dark clouds gather over Equus, and friendship alone might not be able to save Equestria."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Choose a nation of your liking on the map."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Fall of The Empire"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned on Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has collapsed, leaving only fear and uncertainty in the minds of the avaricious and power-hungry griffon race. Emperor Grover V has faced secession of his former subjects, republican and socialist revolutions, and the loss of the Idol of Boreas to the cyclops Arimaspi, and few expect him to survive the next few years. As revolutionaries across the continent prepare to challenge the monarchies of old, and the ponies of the East prepare for war - chaos will soon engulf Griffonia once again."
 AFTERMATH_NAME:0 "After the Storm"
 AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned on Zebrica. The conquests of the Storm King, a mad yeti from the southern lands, have left much of the continent of Zebrica in ruins. Nations struggle to pick up the pieces left behind while in the chaos, old political troubles return to the surface. Even beyond the wrath of the Storm, the changing world brings with it danger to the many nations that have long stood the test of time; though the struggle is over, one thing is certain: War is coming."

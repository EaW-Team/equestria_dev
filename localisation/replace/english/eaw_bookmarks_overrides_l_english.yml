Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around herself. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces many internal conflicts and problems. Dark clouds gather over Equus, and friendship alone might not be able to save Equestria."

Emperor Grover V has faced secession of his former subjects, republican and socialist revolutions, and the loss of the Idol of Boreas to the cyclops Arimaspi, and few expect him to survive the next few years. As revolutionaries across the continent prepare to challenge the monarchies of old, and the ponies of the East prepare for war - chaos will soon engulf Griffonia once again."

He remembered how this land had once been fertile and green. Now, it was a wasteland. Perhaps one day, flowers would blossom here again.\n\n"Master," came a sound from behind him, and He turned. It was Bray, a donkey who had prepared the returning ritual and was His most loyal assistant. "The six goats who aided me wish to speak to you." Grogar nodded, so Bray bowed and left. Soon, the six heroes entered the balcony and knelt before Him. He already knew their names: Gore, Randy, Oskar, Giles, Abram and Rachel.\n"Rise," He commanded, and they did so.

Your first task is to tell me what has happened to the world while I was gone."\n"The world has gone to ruin," Rachel explained. "The lesser races have failed to find unity and squabble amongst themselves. Some of your monsters still roam the land to this day, as nobody has managed to exterminate them yet. The fools are obsessed with technology rather than magic."\n"So are you," said Randy and bleated in amusement.\n"Silence!" Grogar commanded.

They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature He had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but He was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use.

There was little they did to resist, and those brave ones who did quickly perished. His people, the folk of Azir, were driven out of their homes and herded like cattle into a vast, dark city which appeared like a desert mirage. There, they were all forced to work, no matter their rank. Chieftains laboured alongside servants. They were all equal in slavery now.\n\nTin Zinan had been a slave once. And he had sworn to never be one again.\n\nDay and night, they all toiled in a workshop, where they were instructed to make large plates of crystal-infused armour for the beasts. They were forced to use the most basic tools and were allowed little rest and few provisions. Tin Zinan couldn't stand for this. He had to show that zebras like him would never accept slavery. Death was preferable to it.\n\nHe stood up on a workbench and proclaimed to all other slaves: "My fellow Azirians! A most terrible fate has befallen us. Yet do not despair! Hope lives on in our hearts. One day, we shall break free from our shackles! We must never fully submit, but always use little acts of resistance to defy our evil masters. Sabotage the armour, work as slowly as possible, go on hunger strike, do anything you can to show that you are free zebras!"\n\nThe other slaves cheered and chanted his name, and a riot started as they began to break tools and dismantle the plates they had made. But it did not last long. Soon, the doors broke open and ravenous chimeras and manticores poured inside. A terrible slaughter began. Zebras screamed as they were torn apart by claws and teeth and eaten alive. Tin Zinan did his best to fight back, but it was all in vain.\n\nOn the following day, Tin Zinan and a dozen other rebellious slaves returned to the workshops. Their bodies had been biomantically modified: Mouths had been replaced with small feeding holes and their rear legs had been removed, forcing them to crawl like maggots. It was a warning to all slaves that resistance would be punished most severely."

She felt sorry for them and hoped he would be found soon, alive and well.\n\nWhile the desert of Azir was still fresh on her mind, she spotted another, tiny article talking about it. There was a brief summary of strange rumours coming out of the region with nothing substantial to support them. But it was an odd coincidence that these rumours had appeared around the same time when the archaeologist had gone missing. Could there be a connection?\n\nPerhaps she was just being paranoid as always. But a part of her wanted to investigate the matter.

She turned to the door of the archaeologist's apartment and unlocked it with a key given by his family. The two ponies entered and looked around. "Hm, nothing seems out of the ordinary," Twilight mumbled.\nRarity took a closer look, narrowing her eyes and inspecting the furniture. "That is because you do not look with the eyes of a detective. Aha!" Her horn glowed and she levitated a strand of white hair. "According to your description, the missing individual did not have a white tail, coat or mane, yet I found this!"\n"That's... strange, but doesn't really prove anything. Let's keep looking, I guess."\n"Yes, the more clues the better!"\nNext they inspected the archaeologist's office table. There were various notes about previous expeditions, but nothing about Azir. "Strange," Twilight said. "I think there's some papers missing, but they're not here."\n"Tsk tsk! Again, think like a detective. What if there's a hidden compartment?"\n"...Why would he hide notes about his studies?"\nRarity leaned closer at the table and knocked at the wood with her hoof, listening closely at the sound. "Quiet, I'm trying to hear a hollow sound." After several knocks, her eyes widened and she rubbed the surface, looking for a seam. Once she found it, she used magic to pull up a lid which revealed concealed notes and a diary book. "Here they are!"\nTwilight was flabbergasted as Rarity gave the items to her. "You found them! They're all about his final survey at Azir!" She quickly skimmed over everything and even saw a few drawings. One of them depicted a strange black sphere of crystal."

It was strange, but when Twilight studied the white strand of hair Rarity had found, she deduced that it had indeed belonged to a goat. Something very strange had happened in the apartment.\n\nGoats were few and far between, but not something the Mane Six hadn't seen before. Fluttershy had once met an assertiveness trainer known as Iron Will, who had hired several goat assistants. Because of his personal connections to this elusive race, Twilight decided to send a telegram to Asterion, asking him if he could provide them with any useful information.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nA response soon arrived. One of Iron Will's most important assistants, Randy the Showgoat, had gone missing after meeting a certain pony archaeologist. While Iron Will did not know what had happened to him, he did know that Randy had travelled to Equestria to visit the archeologist. Clearly, Randy had been in the apartment. But why? Why were goats interested in some desert ruins that had recently been found?\n\nTwilight realized that there was only one way to find out.

Rarity asked, walking under the shadow of an umbrella that was held by Fluttershy.\nTwilight examined a map and a compass. "We're almost there! If my calculations are correct, that is. But they usually are!"\n"Looks like you're right," Rainbow said and pointed at the distance. "Someone's coming!"\n\nThe six ponies looked ahead and saw a large creature rapidly approaching. It did not look like a mirage.\n"Um... did you mean something?" Fluttershy asked nervously.\nApplejack squinted her eyes. "The heck is that? I don't like the look of it one bit."\n\nAs the creature got close enough, it spread its wings and took flight. It soared above them, covering the sun, and then dived.\n"Well, that, uh... that's a manticore!"

As the beast approached, she loaded it, took aim and fired.\n\nThe manticore was taken aback by the flash of light, grimaced at her, then fell limp and collapsed onto the sand. Rainbow covered Fluttershy's eyes. There was a moment of deafening silence.\n\nIt was broken by Pinkie. "Wow, nice shot!"\n"Heh, thanks, I've had some practice," Applejack said and put the weapon on her back. She turned to the two pegasi. "Dash, tell her I used the magical stun gun."\n"Think that'll help?" she replied sarcastially.\nFluttershy was almost sobbing. "I... I don't understand why it didn't..."\nTwilight examined the unconscious creature. "This isn't right. Manticores have never been seen in deserts."\n"Ahem... what about those creatures?" Rarity said and pointed to the horizon.\n\nDozens of beasts were approaching, creating a dust storm with their paws, claws and wings.

The unfortunate truth was that they alone could do little to investigate the desert. At least they had learned that something was seriously wrong: the Zebhara desert was usually largely devoid of life, but now it was teeming with all kinds of monsters like the Everfree Forest itself. But if they wanted to find out what had happened, they'd need to go home and devise a new plan.\n\nTwilight was already busy with this while travelling on a ship to Equestria. Just before they arrived at the port of Baltimare, her eyes lit up and she exclaimed "Eureka!". She quickly explained her idea to her friends: as travel by land was so difficult and dangerous, an airplane could be used instead. It was better than flying into the desert alone, and safer from possible flying monsters like manticores, especially if it was armed with weapons. An airplane could fly straight into the desert and find the source of the monsters from above, even taking pictures if necessary. Most of the ponies agreed that it was a good idea, except for Rainbow Dash who claimed she could fly by herself with ease.

Now, however, he had fulfilled his destiny and started a new life in Tambelon, the ancient capital of goatkind. His father had told many myths about it before he had died, yet none of them could quite prepare him to live there. Goats were everywhere, living alongside monsters and slaves who fulfilled all menial jobs and assisted their masters whenever needed. Randy would never again have to be anyone's assistant ever again. This thought made him bleat quite happily.\n\nGoats were free to do whatever they wished, as long as it did not harm other goats (those who broke this fundamental law were turned into biomantically twisted, shapeless abominations, condemned to eternal suffering). Some goats chose a life of leisure and luxury, but usually got bored of it and picked some duty to fulfill like the others did. Some became biomancers, others studied the mysteries of the universe, some became masters of slaves or beasts. Randy decided to put his organization skills to use and became a manager. He would assign tasks for slaves to fulfill and helped organize the running of society in Tambelon. While goats saw him as an outsider, they knew he was one of the Six who had participated in the ritual to liberate Tambelon, and was thus deeply respected. He soon proved himself capable, too, helping everything run smoothly. He did not receive wages, as he received everything necessary for a comfortable life for free.

One goat took notice of this and approached him.\n"What is wrong, friend?" she asked, speaking in goatish. Abram sighed and bleated sadly. "I feel like I don't belong here. I cannot continue doing my old job that I did while living amongst sub-goat scum."\n"Oh, well, as Grogar says, every goat must take care of each other! Maybe I can help you.

Was that really what you did as a job?"\nHe frowned. "Well, yes, but I had to be very specific about what to eat. I had to thoroughly examine texts and only read articles that contained forbidden words or phrases."\n"Well, sounds like you could put some of your skills to use at the archive! How does that sound?"\nHe smiled. "I... suppose I could try it out. Sorry for my accent, I'm not used to speaking goatish. What's your name? I'm Abram."\n"I'm Mary. You're one of the six?!

He who led us down the Path of Now and Forever, He who tore down the gates of Tartarus, He who creates new forms of life to serve us, He who taught us the secrets of biomancy. Every day we must remember all this and thank Him. In return, we may receive His blessing, if we remain humble and obedient. Think of all the impure heathens in the world who deny the rule of the Father. They will never have a chance of being blessed. Instead, they shall be cursed and punished, made into slaves, their bodies twisted and broken as needed. For them, we shall feel no pity. This is the Path of Now and Forever: the mastery of goatkind, the goatocracy, to ensure eternal freedom and peace.\n\n"Many of you lived for countless generations, for countless millenia, among heathens, myself included. Yet we remained faithful, never losing hope, knowing that one day the Father would return, when the time was right. And our faith has been rewarded, for the Father is back with us. Now the paradise of old shall return. Yet there is much work to be done. Many heathens remain arrogant and unpunished. It is our duty to fulfill the wishes of the Father and go forth to crush them all. With unwavering faith in our victory, we shall one day stand triumphant.

One of the goats was Oskar, the occultist who had gained fame by participating in the ritual that had reverted Grogar's banishment. As the slaves were put to work, he spoke to them in their language: "I hope you all understand the importance of this work you are doing. Our Father requires many monuments dedicated to his eternal glory. You heathens of course think this is nonsense, that your work is unimportant, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The more He is glorified, the stronger He becomes. One day you all will accept Him as your own Father, too, and abandon all thoughts of resistance, sabotage, or rebellion.

The goat nimbly dodged the flying tool, then narrowed his eyes. His horns began to glow, and the angry slave's body suddenly cracked and twisted. She let out a gurgling screech of agony as the nerves in her body snapped. Her body continued to convulse and change shape even as the screaming ended. Finally, nothing was left of her except a shapeless lump of flesh and bones. The other slaves looked in horror, but when Oskar turned to look at them, they swiftly returned to work.\n\n"Eat what's left of her," Oskar said, and a bugbear grabbed the former slave's corpse and consumed it.

I will step back and allow you to sort out your differences with those who follow the 'Path'. You promise to make goats stronger, then do so and defeat those who stand in your way. If you win, I will accept your proposal. If not..." He grinned ominously.

All remaining free races have banded together to stop Grogar before it is too late. While this has not brought peace to the continents of Equus and Griffonia, it does mean the rest of the world now recognizes goatkind as a common threat to their freedom.

Yet His smile disappeared when He looked at the inhabitants of a large island in northern Zebrica. Something was terribly wrong.

Combined with the Elements of Harmony, we may have just enough magical power to defeat Grogar."\n"And why can we all not fight him together?"\n"Because... because it's too dangerous!"

A gargantuan storm formed in an instant, scouring the surrounding golden city with lightning and killing everything in it, destroying and damaging buildings which included the "temple" itself.\n\nWith the waystone facility destroyed, it would take decades or even centuries to conduct proper climate restoration in the region. It is an unfortunate setback, but there is little that even Grogar himself could do about it."

 cityfall.1004.t:0 "Honorary Goats"
 cityfall.1004.d:0 "As the goats with their monsters arrived in the grassy valleys of Zerghana, they met some familiar creatures who were kept as livestock by the local zebras: sheep. Sheep were the closest relatives of goats and the two had a close relationship, both before Tambelon's banishment and after it. Yet sheep were only semi-sapient and content with being livestock, while goats resisted such treatment. Nevertheless, wherever the goats arrived, sheep would welcome them and not complain as their owners were themselves turned into slaves. Grogar soon proclaimed that, like before, sheep would be treated as honorary goats and second-class citizens with all involved rights and protections. Most sheep did not care and just wanted their wool to be sheared regularly while being left alone to graze on the lush grasslands. Yet some sheep volunteered to help goat biomancers and ease their burden by acting as their assistants."

 cityfall.1005.t:0 "March To The Sea"
 cityfall.1005.d:0 "The goats finally saw something that was a very unfamiliar sight to those who had lived in Tambelon for their entire lives: ocean. A vast expanse of shimmering blue water. Goats, of course, are not particularly good at swimming. But the same cannot be said for the many creatures who spend their entire lives underwater. As such, the goats were quick to look for such creatures, eventually finding a live sea serpent.\n\nWith this new creature template, the goats could now claim the seas for themselves. Nothing would be beyond their reach any longer. The lesser races hiding on their islands were doomed."
 cityfall.1005.a:0 "A fine addition to the collection."
 
 cityfall.1006.t:0 "A Magical Forest"
 cityfall.1006.d:0 "There are several places in the world where leylines intersect, creating nexuses of raw magical energy. This has a strong effect on local flora and fauna, creating dense forests teeming with strange creatures. Indeed, goats first learned biomancy by studying how monsters naturally appeared in such places.\n\nOne such place has now been secured by goatocratic forces. It is the only one remaining in its natural state on all of Zebrica, and is likely the largest magical forest in size. Grogar has already visited the place in person to see if the lesser races have caused damage to it. He was relieved to see it is in good condition, with plenty of biomass and magical energy that can be utilized."
 cityfall.1006.a:0 "There are still unspoiled places in the world..."
 
 cityfall.1007.t:0 "Unleashed Magic"
 cityfall.1007.d:0 "Grogar had already learned that the foolish horses of Maretania had stored many unusual and powerful artifacts inside their caverns. He had no particular use for those trinkets, as they were all weaker than His Bewitching Bell. Yet it seems the horses still wanted to keep them from falling into His hooves. Gargantuan explosions rocked the Maretanian mountains as the caverns were blown up from within, burying countless valuable treasures beneath tonnes of rock and stone.\n\nThe damage was so widespread that it was likely the horses had used one of their own artifacts to destroy the rest. Casualties numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Yet they were all worthless sub-goats anyways, so their deaths and injuries mattered little. The entire event did little more than prove how afraid the pathetic lesser races were of goatkind's true might."

 cityfall.1008.t:0 "Donkeykind Is Broken"
 cityfall.1008.d:0 "Bray the donkey entered through iron gates into a garden, located in the center of Tambelon. It was full of life, with greenery and numerous animals. Birds were singing and various goats were strolling around the area, enjoying nature. Bray ignored them and walked past them, looking for someone important.\n\nHe saw Grogar sitting in front of a pond. "Master," he called to Him, "there is important news from the front."\n"Come look!" Grogar replied.\n"...Master?"\n"It was an order, fool!"\nBray hurried next to Him. "What is it, master?"\nGrogar looked down into the water, so Bray did the same. There was a Bufogren in the water, surrounded by tadpoles. There was a rare smile on Grogar's lips. "Is nature not wonderful, Bray?"\nThe donkey blinked in confusion. "But master, what of the news?"\nGrogar rolled his eyes and sighed. "Fine, spit it out!"\n"The donkeys of Asstyria and Anseruk... have been subjugated. You can see it yourself from your crystal ball."\n"You seem troubled," Grogar remarked. "Does the fate of your fellow donkeys bother you?"\n"N-no, master."\n"Don't lie to me! I know it does. I saved you from your cancer and this is how you repay me. With foolish sentimentality! Donkeys are no different from other nature-hating races. All of them kept my kind as livestock! Treated us like animals! And we shall return the favour thousandfold. Be thankful that you were spared, because you are useful to me."\nBray said nothing for a while, then weakly nodded."

 cityfall.1009.t:0 "Did The Stars Lie?"
 cityfall.1009.d:0 "Hiram Zerranid winced as a strange pig-like creature whipped him. He was trying to stray away from the line of fellow chained zebras and approach a nearby goat. She appeared to be in charge, bleating orders to monsters and pig-people alike. Clearly, she'd listen to reason, if she'd understand his language. "You there! Listen to me, there must have been a mistake!"\nThe goat noticed him, nodded to a pig-person, and Hiram was whipped again, this time harder. His striped coat was soon covered in blood. "Please, listen! We hooved creatures do not have to be enemies! We can work together to eliminate the avian threat to the world!"\nHe resisted the urge to scream as he was prodded with a spear. The goat looked at him condescendingly.\n"I beg you, listen to me! We don't have to be enemies!"\nAnother stab with a spear, this time piercing into his flesh. He fell onto his knees.\n"The Godhead... Za'al-Maar... unless... you are... you are crypto-avians!"\nThe goat's horns glowed. He felt something strange around his mouth, which quickly escalated into terrible pain. He writhed on the ground as his face twisted. When the pain suddenly ended, he gasped for air and touched his face with his hoof. To his horror, he realized he now had an avian beak.\nThe goat spoke in a strange language he didn't understand and gestured him to rejoin the other zebras.\nHiram looked at her in horror, his body shaking, unable to say anything anymore."

 cityfall.1010.d:0 "The dominion of goatkind once extended not only above land, but below the sea as well. Most of the world is covered in water after all, so how could one claim to rule the world without ruling the waves as well?\n\nThe seaponies hiding in their underwater homes were taken by shock and surprise as numerous giant sea serpents invaded their towns and cities. While it was clear they had experience from fighting monsters before, they struggled against such a large number of them. They only managed to slay a few before their defences were destroyed and overwhelmed. Soon enough, all resistance in so-called Seaquestria had been crushed.\n\nWhile exerting control over undersea populations is impractical for goats, the monsters will at least ensure they will not be able to fight back against Grogar's rule."

 cityfall.1011.t:0 "A Pet Peeve"
 cityfall.1011.d:0 "While scouring the cold mountains of the Zebrican south, one of the goats spotted a wild bugbear foraging berries in the woods. It was swiftly captured and brought back to Tambelon so its creature template could be reconstructed.\n\nBugbears are extraordinary creatures, a combination of a bear and a wasp. They have impressive strength and size, which, along with their six limbs, allows them to carry other monsters over great distances if necessary. They are far from defenceless, having a sharp stinger as well as claws. With them, nothing will be beyond the Father's reach."

 cityfall.1012.t:0 "The Living Machines"
 cityfall.1012.d:0 "While pacifying the region known as Barrad, the goats came across a truly peculiar discovery. It was not entirely unexpected, as the area had been ravaged by unusually strong magic, yet still took them by surprise.\n\nDeep beneath the surface, they found a strange and powerful magical entity, protected by fanatical cultists and surrounded by machines made out of biomass. With how dangerous the corrupted entity potentially was, the goats summoned Grogar himself to resolve the matter.\n\nLed by Grogar, the goats and their monsters slaughtered the cultists and then confronted the entity. Despite all its power, it could do little against Grogar, who soon realized the entity's nature. He managed to separate it into seven unicorns. After the initial shock, they were killed. Grogar theorized that the seven had attempted to use some kind of spell to merge into one, greater entity, which had clearly not gone according to plan. It was likely they had attempted to use biomancy, which was extremely foolish considering only goats were capable of fully controlling such magic.\n\nThe damage done to the region will take a long time to undo. But with our aid, local nature will slowly but surely recover."
 cityfall.1012.a:0 "Yet more proof of how stupid the lesser races are."
 
 cityfall.1013.t:0 "The Forest of Mud"
 cityfall.1013.d:0 ""They call the forest WHAT?" Grogar demanded from Oskar, who had lived near the forest in question for most of his life.\n"Umm... well, to repeat myself, the name translates roughly to-"\n"It was a rhetorical question," Grogar continued. "No matter how much I look down upon the lesser races, they still manage to disappoint me." He sighed. "Not only did the catbirds give it a humiliating name, but they've devastated the forest, cutting down half of it and massacring the local monster population. It will take decades for the forest to recover, if not centuries!"\n"Please, calm down," Oskar asked. "Anger will not help with any of that."\nGrogar snorted. "True. Well, you know what must be done. Deport the griffon population further away from forested areas, harvest whatever excess biomass can be found and utilize the local leylines for magical energy."\nOskar nodded. "Of course, my master. The Forest of Mud will be restored to its former glory eventually.""

"Not only did the catbirds give it a humiliating name, but they've devastated the forest, cutting down half of it and massacring the local monster population.

 cityfall.1014.t:0 "It Had To Be Done"
 cityfall.1014.d:0 "The Eygsic Forest was well known by the goats, but they were still surprised to find it teeming with giant, sapient spiders. Worse of all, these spiders were extremely protective of the local pony population and seemed to be driven by some magical force. As they stood in the way of Grogar, there was no choice but to exterminate the spiders. However, spiders kept appearing and attacking monsters and goats. Even the forest itself seemed to have turned against goatkind.\n\nGrogar remembered all those millenia ago when He had visited the Eygsic forest and admired its serene beauty. Now, it had been infested by ponies, the race that had once defied and banished him. They had corrupted the forest itself. He had no choice but to destroy the entire ancient wood. A tear flowed from his red eye when he proclaimed the order for flame-breathing chimeras to burn down the entire region.\n\nSoon a gargantuan forest fire engulfed all of Eygsic, burning down trees that had lived for countless centuries alongside spiders who could've been friends of goatkind. In the end, nothing remained but ash and charred, dead trees."

 cityfall.1016.d:0 "Grogar stood upon a hill and looked at the floating cloud-city of Cloudsdale in the distance. Even after centuries, it was still vaguely familiar despite all the changes.\n\nWhile the city had been moved to a completely different location, Grogar still remembered that fateful battle that had happened near it. A foolish pony named Gusty had led an army of unicorn warriors to face Him. He had been confident that He could wipe out the pitiful force by himself. When the unicorns formed a magical beam to bind Him, he used the power of fear to break through the bonds. Yet He had been too arrogant and underestimated his enemy. In the chaos of the battle, Gusty had managed to steal his Bewitching Bell, the source of his power, and use it to banish Him and Tambelon into the Realm of Darkness.\n\nGrogar had learned a lesson of humility. Never again would He underestimate the treacherous and cunning lesser races. And Cloudsdale... it simply had to be destroyed. As the lesson had been learned, He needed no reminder of his defeat all those years ago.\n\nHe snorted and turned away, walking down the hill while hundreds of flying monsters descended upon the cloud-city."

 cityfall.1017.d:0 "Key Lake was not only known for its unique shape on a map, but its magical properties. Similarly to magical forests, it is located above an intersection of leylines filled with magic. As such, the lake acts like a well of power that any capable mage can draw from. Not only that, but the cold waters are full of strange creatures that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nSince Grogar's last visit to Key Lake, its shores had gained a considerable population of changelings. He reminded himself of the need to study the changelings' shapeshifting capabilities in case it would be possible to implement them on a monster. Possibly not, as the ability seemed more magical than biological in nature. Other notable inhabitants near the lake were polar bears, who were strangely sapient. As far as Grogar knew, polar bears were little more than animals, but had apparently gained sapience and even established a crude civilization of their own. He supposed goats could no longer use polar bears for the creation of bugbears, as due to moral reasons live sapient creatures were not used for the creation of monsters. Nevertheless, Key Lake would prove to be very useful as a source of magical power, if nothing else."

 cityfall.1018.t:0 "Secrets Of Life And Death"
 cityfall.1018.d:0 "The goats had reached another location full of magical energy, but found something completely unexpected. A coven of necromancers had established a city for themselves here, on top of an old storage site for failed goatish experiments. Grogar was amused as He remembered the baseless old rumours about Him being a necromancer. He had little respect for that arcane art. In fact, He didn't consider it art at all, unlike biomancy. Necromancy was about puppeting dead and rotten flesh, recycling of the old, rather than creation of the new. And while it was powerful and could be used to gain immortality, the same things were true for biomancy.\n\nThere was little skill involved in using magic to puppeteer corpses, unlike in biomancy, which required extreme precision to ensure organisms would remain functional and alive. Despite this, Grogar still considered necromancers to be a potential threat and ordered them all to be exterminated. Any undead animals recovered in the region could be reused for the creation of live biomass. The large supply of different bones would be especially useful."

The Goatcasus mountains in northeastern Equestria were also inhabited by tens of thousands of goats, who had suffered under Equestrian pony tyranny for millenia. With the return of Grogar, they were seen as a fifth column and were treated as potential enemies, with many of them interned or placed under house arrest. So when the monstrous armies finally arrived, the local goats rejoiced and once again enjoyed the taste of freedom.\n\nA grand celebration was held in the mountains, the music echoing in the valleys. The party lasted long into the night. By the time the sun was raised, the goats were blissfully sleeping, content in their knowledge that they were now safe and free."

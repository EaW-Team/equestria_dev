 disdain_for_the_digging_spirit:0 "Trenches are Scary"
 disdain_for_the_digging_spirit_desc:0 ""What if somepony falls in and gets hurt?"\n\nTrench warfare, perfected as a doctrine during the brutal Falcor War of 985-989 ALB, allows a soldier with a shovel to form a strongpoint that is easy to defend. But in the minds of the Equestrians, warfare consists of rows of warriors in shining armour marching in disciplined ranks on the open field, wielding muskets or even spears. The idea of having to stand in a muddy trench and risk getting trench hoof is appaling to them."
 doctrinal_orthodoxy_spirit:0 "Unfamiliarity with Tanks"
 doctrinal_orthodoxy_spirit_desc:0 ""How do I drive a tank with hooves?"\n\nDuring the Severyanan Winter Revolution in 996 ALB, the Equestrian Royal Guard witnessed the potential of armoured warfare in practice when they faced converted tractors on the battlefield. Princess Celestia was then quick to organize a research program to develop modern fighting vehicles, but despite the advancements, the Equestrians themselves have not yet adapted to this new technology. They find the concept of utilizing vehicles for military purposes to be foreign and strange."
 traditionalism_academy_spirit_desc:0 ""War. War never changes. Wait, it does?"\n\nWhile elsewhere, arms races between rival nations forced constant development and refinement of warfare, in Equestria the military remained stagnated. Even as new innovations were made, Equestria was slow to adopt them, even seeing things such as rifles and artillery guns as unnecessary and excessively violent weapons. Without Princess Celestia's constant efforts to avoid falling behind too much, Equestrian Royal Guard would've continued to use spears as their primary weapon. Despite the recent push for modernizing the military, many ponies still prefer the old and reliable ways of combat."

 air_torpedoe_2:0 "Jettisonable Water-Entry Fins"
 air_torpedoe_2_desc:0 "We have found that a proper torpedo attack from a naval bomber requires careful and low-altitude flying to prevent premature detonations or torpedoes running at deeper depths when entering the water. Experimenting with disposable aerodynamic stabilising fins on the torpedoes' tail significantly impacts the torpedo's performance. With different designs for different circumstances, the versatility of our aerial torpedoes has skyrocketed."

 air_torpedoe_3_desc:0 "Even with the introduction of aerodynamic tail stabilisers, they tend to fail before impacting choppy waves or heavy seas.

Additional refinements to these systems will make for more reliable, if slightly expensive, replacements for the jettisonable fins we have used."

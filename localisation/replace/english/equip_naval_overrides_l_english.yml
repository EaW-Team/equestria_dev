 # Ships #
 submarine_1:0 "Modernised Coastal Submarine"
 submarine_1_desc:0 "Early submersibles and submarines were limited to the coast due to their severely reduced range. More efficient diesel and larger-capacity batteries now allow these dangerous vessels to strike at enemy vessels well beyond our home waters. These submarines are still somewhat fragile boats, but their potential makes them the most cost-effective naval vessel that we can put out to sea."
 submarine_2:0 "Fleet Submarine"
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Unlike previous designs, fleet submarines can carry out a supportive role in the service of regular surface fleets. Though many believe that this is not the ideal role of submarines, the fleet submarines can still act as individual boats or groups separate from fleets. Their improved pre-heated torpedo tubes, streamlined hulls, and fast engines make these submersibles particularly dangerous to unescorted ships."
 submarine_3:0 "Diesel-Electric Submarine"
 submarine_3_desc:0 "Sometimes known as electric boats, these submarines are based on the changeling Type XXI class. These diesel-electric submarines have incredible endurance when submerged with many more high-capacity battery cells and a revolutionary snorkel design. With a mounted radar transmitter array, these boats can detect enemy aircraft and vessels, allowing them to dive well in advance to escape notice."
 submarine_4:0 "Hunter-Killer Submarine"
 submarine_4_desc:0 "The successful actions carried out by individual submarines have shown us that the notion of a fleet submarine is a dead end. Improvements made upon previous diesel-electric boats include better integration of sonar, air-independent propulsion, and wire-guided torpedoes. These hunter-killer submarines are exceptionally good at submerged warfare, so much so that they can reliably engage underwater enemy submarines!"

 destroyer_1:0 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "The prevalence of nimble and hard-hitting torpedo boats threatens larger warships to the point where a dedicated ship class, the torpedo boat 'destroyer', can defeat enemy torpedo boats and supplant them. Larger than traditional corvettes and frigates yet smaller than cruisers, destroyers are an excellent light escort and screen."
 destroyer_2:0 "Enlarged Destroyer"
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Previous destroyer designs were fairly restrictive in overall displacement, which reduced their operational range and weapon mounts. Approaching the size of smaller, older cruisers, even up to 2500 tons of displacement, these new destroyers can mount far many more torpedo launchers, larger calibre guns, and dedicated hydrophone stations and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) equipment."
 destroyer_3:0 "Hunter-Killer Destroyer"
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "The growing threat from enemy submersibles has cemented the destroyer as the dedicated anti-submarine ship. Though smaller and cheaper corvettes are adequate at escorting merchant shipping, the best way to protect ourselves from submarines is by actively hunting them. Destroyers fitted with improved sonar and radar can immediately locate enemy submarines, and destroy them with forward-launched ASW weapons."
 destroyer_4:0 "Battle Destroyer"
 destroyer_4_desc:0 "Destroyers are fragile warships compared to cruisers or larger capital ships, so their staying power during battle is limited. Though fast and evasive, we shouldn't expect them to dodge enemy fire and torpedoes indefinitely. As such, these new designs, better compartmentalised and utilising dual-purpose main armament to allow further torpedo launcher mounts, can deal out far more damage than ever before."
 
 light_cruiser_1:0 "Scout Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Unlike previous cruiser designs such as torpedo cruisers, the scout cruiser design was considerably reduced in overall size and displacement, making it essentially a large destroyer. These cruisers can act as flotilla leaders and are relatively well-armed to engage smaller ships while capable of launching devastating torpedo strikes when armed with torpedo tubes."
 light_cruiser_2:0 "Escort Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Built to have a greater operational range than older cruisers, escort cruisers are suitably armoured and armed to protect commerce shipping from destroyer and torpedo boat raids. Additionally, with the advent of smoke floats, escort cruisers also provide crucial fleet support to larger ships, taking on the roles that other ships are unsuited for."
 light_cruiser_3:0 "Anti-Aircraft Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The subsequent rise of torpedo and naval bombers poses a massive risk to our naval ships. Though most ships can mount additional anti-aircraft batteries, their mounting is generally wasted displacement on most other classes. Light cruisers are the best platform to turn into floating anti-aircraft batteries to protect the fleets that they're attached to. Anti-aircraft cruisers screens aren't impenetrable but will give pause to any enemy pilot."
 light_cruiser_4:0 "Dedicated Escort Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The tactical role of light cruisers has crystallised to that of a screening force against destroyers and enemy aircraft. To reflect this, anew designs liberally employ dual-purpose main armaments to free up available displacement for either more armour, additional guns, or even larger engines. These cruisers can still fulfil scouting and shore bombardment roles, but their place is by the side of vulnerable ships."

 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Late Armoured Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "With the introduction of large-calibre armour-piercing shells, previous ironclad and steam warships necessitated massive up-armouring. The advent of face-hardened armour offered an effective solution to fit additional protection with considerably less weight than previous types. The introduction of a belt armour of thick steel plating protects this evolved form of the 'ship of the line'."
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Upgunned Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are the mainstay of most fleets. However, new well-armoured vessels such as other cruisers and battleships pose a danger to heavy cruisers. Modern designs with higher calibre armaments make our heavier cruisers capable of overmatching enemy cruisers and even go up against battleships. They don't boast the biggest guns or thickest armour, but these cruisers can both deal and take plenty of damage in naval engagements."
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Commerce Raider Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are capable enough to act as a chiefly independent ship that, if given the opportunity, can wreak havoc upon enemy shipping lines. Strong enough to fight off and sink the typical destroyer and light cruiser escorts, modern commerce raiders are powerful vessels that are fast enough to avoid battleships. These heavy cruisers are still more than suitable to participate in large surface engagements but far more versatile."
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Cruiser Killer"
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Aircraft are a growing menace against larger ships. Though we can and should equip our heavy cruisers with better anti-aircraft defences, they should be refined to eliminate the enemy's cruiser screens. This would reduce the enemy's anti-aircraft shield and offer more and better strike opportunities for our own aircraft. As such, these 'cruiser killers' are designed accordingly with improved engines, more accurate weaponry, and better protective schemes."

 battle_cruiser_1:0 "Fast Battleship"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Something of a departure from the more traditional Macawian battleships, these smaller warships trade armour for speed while keeping their array of large-calibre weaponry. The thought behind this particular battleship evolutionary line envisions a fast, hard-hitting capital ship that can devastate enemy shipping and smaller cruisers while avoiding enemy capital ships. In addition, the reduced structure and armour costs make for a cheaper alternative to traditional dreadnought designs."
 battle_cruiser_2:0 "Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Officially reclassified as battlecruisers, we have found that fast battleships are especially apt for their intended commerce raider and light fleet killer roles, and new designs should encourage this. These ships scale differently from the modernised dreadnoughts, focusing on improved anti-aircraft capabilities and speed at the cost of less armour and smaller main armaments."
 battle_cruiser_3:0 "Modern Battlecruiser"

 battleship_1:0 "Late Dreadnought"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "An improved and refined version of the original Macawian Dreadnought design, this new form of the battleship utilises superimposed main turrets to vastly increase firepower while maintaining hull stability. Secondary batteries of casemates supplement the battleship to defend it against lightly armoured vessels. However, some ship designers are experimenting with turreted secondaries to save on space and improve their firing arcs."
 battleship_2:0 "Long-Range Battleship"
 battleship_2_desc:0 "Battleships are a powerful statement of a country's hard power, and they can exert it well beyond national waters. However, as the world grows ever smaller metaphorically, it becomes evident that our massive warships must have as extensive a range as possible to respond against distant threats. Streamlined designs with more efficient hulls, engines, and, of course, heavier armaments make our battleships more dangerous."
 battleship_3:0 "Radar Battleship"
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Innovations in radar technology have miniaturised radar arrays to the point that we can mount them on ships, and our battleships, being the largest of our vessels, have the largest radar arrays. This device not only allows battleships to find and locate enemy vessels more reliably than search aircraft but also for them to fire from beyond sight. With such massive calibres, battleship guns can now engage targets beyond the horizon."
 battleship_4:0 "'Fortress' Battleship"
 battleship_4_desc:0 "The growing threat of airstrikes and carriers is forcing our designers to rethink the role of battleships. They are too slow and sluggish to escape attacks from aircraft, and their size makes battleships an enticing target. For now, adding a plethora of anti-aircraft weapons will dissuade most attackers. Despite this, the battleship remains a fearsome warship and the latest ones are bristling with heavy artillery, making them veritable floating fortresses."
 battleship_5:0 "Modern All-Gun Battleship"
 battleship_6:0 "Guided-Missile Battleship"

 carrier_1:0 "Hippogriffian-Style Carrier"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "Pioneered by Hippogriffia, aircraft carriers are purpose-built hulls meant to act as floating airbases. While most of the old guard in our admiralty remain unconvinced by the efficacy of aircraft in naval operations, there is growing support in integrating a naval air arm to bolster our fleets. With specialised aircraft designed for carrier use, aircraft carriers are the first ship to strike well beyond the range of enemy ships."
 carrier_2:0 "Escort Carrier"
 carrier_2_desc:0 "A significant improvement from earlier carriers, the consequent aircraft carrier designs have more extensive aircraft stowages within the hull and an extended flight deck. As a result, we can launch additional heavy aircraft that can strike farther away and with a heavier ordinance. In addition, dedicated batteries of anti-aircraft guns and low-calibre guns have been mounted, in case of a sudden strike against the ship before it can launch aircraft."
 carrier_3:0 "Fleet Carrier"
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Previously, aircraft carriers acted in a primarily supportive role in service to heavier battleships and battlecruisers. Successes observed in the seas have contributed to the development of an independent aircraft carrier equivalent to battleship task forces. Well stocked for long voyages and capable of launching multiple air wings within minutes, fleet carriers are the primary warships capable of taking on enemy capital ships; they might even surpass the battleship."
 carrier_4:0 "Strike Carrier"
 carrier_4_desc:0 "Larger, leaner, and with a seamlessly integrated radar array, these strike carriers are excellent in carrying out rapid and devastating attacks against naval and land targets. Prepared to carry dozens of modern aircraft, the strike carrier has unparalleled reach and firepower. It is now clear that the aircraft carrier has supplanted the battleship as the queen of the seas."
 carrier_5:0 "Jet Aircraft Carrier"
 carrier_6:0 "Early Supercarrier"

 SH_battleship_1:0 "Battleship Killer"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts and battleships are the ultimate statements of naval power, and the only way to make a more prominent statement would be to build even larger battleships. Incredibly well armoured, astoundingly large, boasting gigantic guns, and terrifyingly expensive, even the hulls of these ships dwarf other battleships, making them true battleship killers. However, unless our shipwrights are up to the task, we can realistically only commission a few of these battleship killers."
 SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The newer design of previous battleship killers is not necessarily larger than those of before. These new hulls are specially made to carry more armaments, dedicated radar arrays, and faster engines. Their overall armour schematics remain the same, but these super heavy battleships are an even greater force multiplier in the seas. The only concern is the exuberant build costs, lengthy build times, and, perhaps, the possibility of diminishing returns."

 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 panzerschiffe:0 "Pocket Battleship"
 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, engineers succeeded in mating battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armored."
 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:1 "An older design decades past, coastal defense ships combine the guns of a battleship with the hull of a cruiser, resulting in a powerful, but slow, cruiser, aimed at deterrence and local defense."
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_desc:0 "These larger submarines can patrol a longer range and hold more firepower or support equipment than their smaller cousins. However, their vulnerability and expense is making them obsolete."

 ship_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "A large-caliber cannon dating from before the fall of the Griffonian Empire."

 ship_hull_submarine_desc:0 "Many submarine designs have cropped up after the introduction of the Hippogriffian submersible hull concept. However, none of these is capable of actual naval combat. The first true war-submersible, also known as the coastal submarine, can carry torpedoes and limited naval strikes against enemy sea targets."

 ship_hull_cruiser_3:1 "Commerce Raider Cruiser Hulls"
 ship_hull_cruiser_3_short:1 "Commerce Raider Cruisers"
 ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "New ideas regarding the possibility of new cruiser designs have led to the development of hulls designed explicitly for long-range solo raiding operations or the mounting of anti-aircraft batteries and their gun directors, respectively.

 basic_fire_control_system:0 "Central Fire Control"
 basic_fire_control_system_desc:0 "In the past, naval gunners ranged, calculated, and fired from their action station. This local fire control becomes unreliable as the size and number of cannons grow and seriously reduce a ship's effectiveness. A centralised fire director, usually near the bridge or somewhere in the central superstructure, can coordinate barrages, calculate firing solutions, and track targets for each gun. With specialised optical sights, a dedicated team of gunnery officers handle the ship's fire-control system."
 improved_fire_control_system:0 "Electro-Mechanical Fire Control Computer"
 improved_fire_control_system_desc:0 "In the heat of battle, accurate firing solutions are crucial for victory in the seas, and manual measures are prone to be incorrect.

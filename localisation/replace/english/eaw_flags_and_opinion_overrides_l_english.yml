FRN_donkey_chief_desc:0 "§gBray is a faithful servant of Grogar and the architect of his return. He is an Asstyrian donkey who was born as a lowly commoner. Much of his adult life was spent as a caravan guard, but everything changed when he discovered a crystal ball buried in the sands of Zebhara.\n\nThe ball spoke to him, and after initial hesitation, Bray spoke back to it. He was tempted to throw it away, but the magical power of the ball compelled him to keep it. Soon enough, Bray revealed his secrets to it, and the ball offered a deal. Grogar needed a loyal servant to aid with the summoning ritual, and in return, Bray would be rewarded. The donkey accepted the offer.\n\nBray followed the instructions closely and allowed himself to become a mere extension of Grogar's will. Now, he shall receive his reward.§!"

zebra_spy_bonus_idea:0 "The All-Seeing Eye"

biomancy_decisions_desc:0 "Biomancy as an art has been forgotten by the disgusting lesser races, and even the goats have to relearn its secrets. Yet the Overgoat remembers. He is the greatest teacher one could pray to have. In His presence, there are no such things as secrets.\n\nCurrently, we have §P[?ouroboros]§! units of living biomass. £biomass_texticon"
WIT_make_manticores_desc:0 "Manticores are medium-sized creatures. The template is primarily based on a lion, with the addition of leathery wings, sensitive bat ears and a large scorpion tail. They have oversized paws for improved close combat efficiency. The wings allow it to rapidly approach enemies, and its large mouth allows it to swallow smaller creatures whole. Its sting is highly venomous, capable of killing the victim within seconds."
WIT_make_chimeras_desc:0 "Chimeras are medium-sized creatures. They are one of the oldest ones designed by goatkind, being a shining example of biomantic amalgamation. The frontal section comes from a saber-toothed tiger, the rear section comes from a goat, and the tail is constructed out of a snake. Therefore the chimera has three heads, allowing it greater vision and cognitive power. The inclusion of a goat's head means the creature is fully sapient. Furthermore, it is enhanced with an ability to breathe fire, a feature made possible thanks to close study of dragon cadavers. The only notable design flaw of the creature is the fact that its three heads sometimes fail to cooperate."
WIT_make_hydras_desc:0 "Hydras are large creatures. The design of the template is based on dragons, the primordial enemies of goatkind. A hydra is a reptilian beast that has two legs, four heads with elongated necks and sharp snapping jaws. The creature also has the ability of rapid regeneration, enabling it to regrow lost heads and other body parts. While it lacks the ability to fly like a dragon, it has been designed to use methods of ambush to surprise the foe. Marshes with their murky water are ideal hiding places for a hydra. Like with the chimera, the heads do not always work together. It was the last and greatest example of multi-headed creature design."
WIT_make_pigs_desc:0 "Pigasi are small creatures. The template is an upgraded version of an older, pre-banishment design developed to fight against flying races. The original design was abandoned for being too ineffective, but the new one is specifically developed to counter aircraft. The template is simple, merging avian wings into a pig. A pigasus is too small and agile to be easily hit by large flying machines, while its enhanced metal-piercing tusks and hooves can cause significant damage to planes. Nevertheless, pigasi are primarily effective in large numbers due to their size and lack of ranged offensive abilities."
WIT_make_tatzlwurms_desc:0 "Tatzlwurms are large creatures. The design resembles a huge worm or snake. However, the bright pink, red and purple scales make the creature almost resemble some kind of exotic flower. In addition, the head is a completely unique design, as the mouth separates into three parts and reveals extremely long black tentacles, which the Tatzlwurm uses to catch its prey. It has three pairs of black eyes and as a result has a wide range of vision. Lacking limbs, it is slow, but can burrow in sand or soft soil to traverse terrain faster. It can leap high above the ground to catch airborne prey as well. It can also transmit a virulent disease known as tatzl-flu by sneezing upon other creatures. The Tatzlwurm was designed to excel in deserts and arid regions, and can survive for a long time without water. It is one of the more unique creature designs to the point where it is not even clear what animals were combined to create it. The artist refuses to reveal His secrets."
WIT_make_slingtails_desc:0 "Slingtails are medium-sized creatures. They are four-legged reptiles with greyish-green scales and a fur-covered back. Their most distinctive feature is the long and powerful tail with spikes. Slingtails use this tail to throw large and heavy boulders at their prey. This is why they primarily inhabit rocky areas in the wild. Slingtails were designed as a weapon against dragons and proved to be very effective at shooting down flying enemies. It is very likely that Slingtails can be used effectively against armoured enemy units, as rocks can crush almost any target if it is hit at high enough velocity."
WIT_make_rocs_desc:0 "Rocs are large creatures. On first glance, they appear like enlarged birds of prey, appearing similar to falcons or hawks. Upon closer examination, one will notice the extremely sharp claws and the enlarged, pointed beak which are made out of harder material than bone or keratin. Rocs also have distinguishable plumes on their heads and their feathers are shades of grey and brown. Their yellow eyes gleam with intelligence. Rocs are capable of flying at extremely high velocities despite their enormous size, especially when diving down to catch prey on the ground. In the wild, the roc seems to prefer living in mountainous terrain. The rocs are exclusively carnivorous, and were designed to detect the smell of a dragon going through "molting", a phenomenon which occurs in adolescent dragons. Young dragons can do little to defend themselves and were thus easy prey for rocs. Alongside hydras and slingtails, they were the primary creatures used to exterminate most of dragonkind."
WIT_make_bugbears_desc:0 "Bugbears are medium-sized creatures. The design is based on an unorthodox combination of a bear and a bee. They appear like pandas with insectoid features, such as translucent wings, antennae, a large stinger and six limbs. Their glowing red eyes have a wide range of vision, and their sense of smell is sharp. They are solitary, territorial beasts with the combined ferocity of wasps and wild bears. They are omnivorous and thus excel at surviving on their own. Bugbear musculature is well-developed, which means they can use their limbs to carry other monsters over great distances if necessary."
WIT_make_sea_serpents_desc:0 "Sea serpents are large creatures. They are amphibian creatures, but are unable to move on land and thus live most of their lives underwater. As their name implies, they are shaped like snakes and are covered in scales, but they do have long arms with sharp claws. They have magnificent manes and male specimens tend to have long moustaches. Sea serpents are very intelligent to the point of being sapient, which allows them to outsmart their enemies on the ocean. Their size makes them a threat to most ships used by the lesser races."
WIT_make_leviathans_desc:0 "Leviathans are extremely large creatures. Unlike sea serpents, they are entirely aquatic. This allowed their creators to make them the largest monsters ever made by goatkind. They have seven heads, numerous fins as well as sharp and large teeth and claws. They resemble a mix of a fish, a whale and a shark. Leviathans are capable of surviving extreme pressure and can likely dive several kilometers deep. They have diminished intelligence compared to sea serpents, making them more easy to control. They can devour entire ships whole, though are unable to fully digest them."
WIT_make_titan_desc:0 "Titans are extremely large creatures. They are bipedal beings with two arms. Metallic crystal-infused plating is embedded into their flesh. They are taller than the tallest buildings in Tambelon. In their mouths, they have organic proton accelerator cannons capable of eviscerating almost any target in sight. Due to their size, they are slow to move. The original titan design had a small control chamber inside the brain which was not replicated in new titans. It is not known who created the first titan."
WIT_train_biomancers_desc:0 "Grogar cannot yet be everywhere at once, so lesser goats are needed to direct monsters towards our enemies. However, being on the frontline is a dangerous duty. Because most goats have forgotten their abilities, the only way to replenish casualties is by training them. It takes time, and apprentices need an ample supply of biomass for practice, but it is the only way to restore the ancient knowledge of the goats."
WIT_multiply_biomass_desc:0 "Units of biomass have the natural ability to reproduce. Through biomantic acceleration, the growth speed of new units can be greatly increased, even if it is a painful experience for the targets. While inefficient, it remains the most reliable method of producing additional units of biomass."
WIT_harvest_biomass_desc:0 "Areas of untamed wilderness are ideal for gathering biomass which can be used for the creation of monsters. The lesser races have also domesticated some animal species and tainted them, but such livestock can still be considered usable biomass. Inhospitable regions, such as large urban areas, provide lower harvest yields while rural regions provide higher ones."

crystal_related_decisions_desc:0 "Crystals are magic in its purest and most raw form. They grow naturally in places where magical ley lines of the earth overlap, and are most commonly found in underground caves. However, this growth is very slow, so goats invented a new, faster method of creating crystals."
WIT_mana_batteries_desc:0 "The goats learned long ago that the innate magical energy of sapient beings could be condensed into crystals. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do so without killing the target. Of course, as long as there are enough non-goats to spare, it is a small price to pay for a powerful container of raw energy."
WIT_mana_batteries_2_desc:0 "The goats learned long ago that the innate magical energy of sapient beings could be condensed into crystals. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do so without killing the target. Of course, as long as there are enough non-goats to spare, it is a small price to pay for a powerful container of raw energy."
WIT_craft_armour_desc:0 "The lesser races have been thoroughly corrupted by technology, and have created new and terrible weapons of steel and sulphur. While they are powerful, they cannot rival the power of crystals. Slaves shall be put to work to create crystal-infused plates of armour to protect beasts from the pathetic toys of subgoats."
WIT_craft_armour_2_desc:0 "The lesser races have been thoroughly corrupted by technology, and have created new and terrible weapons of steel and sulphur. While they are powerful, they cannot rival the power of crystals. Goats shall be put to work to create crystal-infused plates of armour to protect beasts from the pathetic toys of subgoats."

biomancy_decisions_2_desc:0 "Biomancy can be used for more than mere artistry of the flesh. It can be used as a weapon against the savage, sub-goat races. Their bodies will bend to the will of Grogar, or they will break.\n\nCurrently, we have §C[?magical_power]§! units of §Cmagical power§! £magic_power_texticon and the §LFear Factor§! £fear_texticon is [Root.fear_factor_dynamic_loc]."
WIT_harvest_magic_desc:0 "Every sapient creature on the planet has inherent magical power. Some, like unicorns, can channel it efficiently and use it to cast spells, while others may have more passive magical abilities. The end result remains the same: All creatures provide an excellent source of magical energy. With the Bewitching Bell, Grogar can drain it on a massive scale and ascend closer to godhood."
WIT_blood_rain_desc:0 "Turning water into blood is one of the simplest biomantic cantrips. With multiple casters combining their power, it can be applied on a massive scale. This can be used to turn the vapor in rainclouds into blood, resulting in a crimson torrent below the clouds. Blood rain has a strongly demoralizing effect on the lesser races who are likely to be horrified by it due to their barbaric superstitions."
WIT_cancer_desc:0 "The effect of any spell weakens the further away the target is. But even at a long distance, biomancy can be used to cause significant damage to the living tissue of a single target. If this target happens to be a commander of frontline soldiers of the enemy, then they can be picked off with relative ease. And thanks to Grogar's crystal ball, they cannot hide anywhere."
WIT_weakness_desc:0 "While it is practically impossible to directly control the bodies of thousands of living beings with biomancy alone (psychic spells are far better suited for this purpose), it can still be used to cause widespread albeit weak effects on biological structures. One example of this is the "Weakness of the Flesh" spell, causing widespread rapid muscle atrophy which greatly weakens the targets."
WIT_parasprites_desc:0 "Despite their small size, parasprites are some of Grogar's most effective creations. Derived from insects and purposefully designed to look visually appealing, parasprites are often easily adopted as pets by foolish sub-goats who feed them. They can then quickly reproduce asexually via mitosis and form entire swarms which consume everything edible. Famine often follows parasprite infestations."
WIT_strength_desc:0 "Fear gives goats power. The lesser races fear them enough now that their biomantic abilities are enhanced. This magical power can be channeled directly into their creations. The muscles of monsters become stronger, they get tired less easily and can move faster. Fear sharpens their senses and fills their bodies with power."
WIT_polymorph_desc:0 "Using biomantic magic usually requires precision and patiance, if the biomancer desires to create functional creatures. But if the biomancer wishes to simply crudely twist the bodies of countless living beings, a raw blast of biomantic energy will fulfill this goal. With a single powerful spell, thousands of organisms can be haphazardly morphed into unrecognizable shapes that are unable to sustain life for any period of time."
WIT_the_bell_tolls_desc:0 "A pathetic pony called Gusty managed to steal the Father's bell and use it against him. She utilized the ability of the bell to tear the fabric of reality itself when it is charged to full capacity to banish Tambelon into the Realm of Darkness. Grogar is, of course, perfectly capable of using this horrifying ability himself. In the ancient days, He refused to do so, but perhaps the rebellious slave-races need a taste of the suffering they imposed upon Tambelon."
WIT_mass_disease_desc:0 "Fear factor has reached a stage where biomancy can be used to manipulate microscopic organisms such as bacteria and viruses. A disease will be engineered with sufficient virulency, adaptivity and lethality to spread across the world. Several times, if necessary."
WIT_mass_cancer_desc:0 "Every time a cell divides, there is the possibility of a mutation. Sometimes, this mutation is harmful and leads to the cell multiplying uncontrollably. Usually, immune systems are capable of handling this problem. By destabilizing cell formation and greatly accelerating mutations, immune systems of creatures worldwide will be overwhelmed rapidly."
WIT_reality_destabilization_desc:0 "The fabric of reality is less firm than most creatures think. The strings that make up quarks can be torn asunder, unraveling the foundation of existence. Dimensions will collapse into one another and time itself will cease to function properly. Antimatter will leak into the primary dimension and cause uncontrollable reactions. These are all good things, as long as we do not go too far and ensure the damage is limited to territories controlled by our enemies."

WIT_disease_idea_desc:0 "If you had not committed great sins, this would not have happened to you."
WIT_strength_idea_desc:0 "Fear empowers the biomancers, and this power is directly channeled into monsters, making them stronger and more resilient."

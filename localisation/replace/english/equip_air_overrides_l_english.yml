 fighter_equipment_0_short:0 "Early Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The past century was a gallant age of airships and Pegasi and Griffon sky knights. The original Griffon biplane was thus mocked by the old guard for being a "commoner's tool" of war. It was not until a token garrison of Hippogriff fighter wings inflicted heavy casualties on the Storm King's air fleet in 1005 that even critics finally conceded that the era of airships had ended."

 ##BBA PLANES (techs)##
 early_bombs:0 "Aerial Bombs"
 early_bombs_desc:0 "Bombs dropped from planes isn't a novel idea, but it has previously consisted of the plane crew dropping petards over the side of their aircraft. Designing dedicated bombs with stabilisation fins and bomb locks and bays to deliver the ordinance are necessary steps for specialised "bomber" aircraft."
 photo_reconnaisance:0 "Aerial Photo Reconnaissance"
 photo_reconnaisance_desc:0 "Previously, most aerial reconnaissance was done personally by winged creatures such as griffons and pegasi flying high. This, however, required incredibly fit and well-trained scouts. Planes can fly considerably higher and mount specially designed high-quality cameras that can take detailed photos while being substantially more survivable."
 aa_lmg:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Machine Guns"
 aa_lmg_desc:0 "Early air-to-air combat in aircraft consisted of pilots using personal firearms to shoot at enemy combatants. Needless to say, new weapons have been devised both for primary and secondary armaments for aircraft. A good compromise between lethality and weight, rifle-calibre machine guns can serve that purpose."
 survivability_studies_desc:0 "Battle-damaged aircraft that return provide instrumental case studies for improving the survivability of our planes. We've found that pilots and the crew are vulnerable, as are our aircraft's fuel tanks and engines. We can add steel plating to protect the crew and the more vulnerable components and use self-sealing fuel tanks to prevent leaks from perforations."
 aircraft_construction:0 "Applied Wartime Construction Experience"
 aircraft_construction_desc:0 "All-metal fuselage construction has opened up new possibilities to improve aircraft designs and suit them in their dedicated combat roles. Some ideas have surged forward, such as dive brakes for dive bombers, floatation devices for floatplanes, or even turning airframes into flying boats for maritime use. New applied knowledge also allows us to use specially treated wood or fabrics where possible to save on valuable aluminium!"
 range_improvements:0 "Studies in Range Extension"
 range_improvements_desc:0 "The operational range of aircraft is primarily decided by its fuel capacity. Careful thought must be put into how fuel capacity can be increased. Of course, the natural option is to increase the number and size of the fuel tanks, but it's easier said than done without turning our aircraft into flying fire hazards. A somewhat simple, if inelegant, solution for smaller aircraft is a fuel drop tank that doesn't impede their flight characteristics."
 aa_hmg:0 "Heavy Machine Guns"
 aa_hmg_desc:0 "Newer all-metal planes, while not impervious to rifle-calibre weaponry, can prove difficult to down. Previous machine guns calibres simply don't do enough damage. This problem is more noticeable with larger aircrafts such as heavy fighters and bombers. As such, higher calibre machine guns that use larger cartridges are the natural evolution for most forms of primary and defensive armaments for aircraft."
 aa_cannon_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_1_desc:0 "Sometimes, machine guns are not enough. Their small cartridges cannot carry enough explosive mass. A forward-facing automatic cannon is, in essence, an upscaled machine gun. Though notably heavy enough to impact the agility of an aircraft, their damage output can make mincemeat of even armoured planes. In some cases, these cannons can even punch through tanks in strafing runs!"
 aa_cannon_2:0 "Improved Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_2_desc:0 "Further refinements in automatic cannons and the introduction of dedicated anti-aircraft ammunition belts have significantly improved their performance. This allows us to mount the new iterations of these cannons in turreted positions, providing a deadly deterrent against even determined attackers. Though their weight can still be problematic for smaller aircraft, the weapons more than compensate with their devastating firepower."

 engines_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Engines"
 engines_1_desc:0 "A powerful yet lightweight engine is essential to power a propeller's rotations enough to lift a heavier-than-air aircraft. The first generation of these "aero engines" are not dissimilar in shape to most concurrent engines in ground vehicles. There are many engine configuration, from simple piston engines to radial engines. However, great care has been taken to make these engines as robust as possible while keeping their weight low."
 engines_2:0 "Aircraft Inline Engines"
 engines_2_desc:0 "The term "inline engine" covers different configurations, all different from the radial configuration, with banks of cylinders instead of rows. Its most significant advantage is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimise drag and for a gun to be incorporated within the engine and the propeller in most configurations."
 engines_3:0 "Water-Injected Aircraft Engines"
 engines_3_desc:0 "Adding water increases the mass being accelerated out of combustion engines, increasing thrust and cooling. Since temperature is usually the limiting factor in engine performance at low altitudes, the cooling effect lets the engine run at higher rotations with more fuel injected and more thrust created without overheating. The cooling effects from water injection also enable greater compression ratios by reducing engine knocking."
 engines_4:0 "Turboprop Engines"
 engines_4_desc:0 "Turboprops share many components and principles with turbojet engines, except the exhaust gases do not provide enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller. This makes turboprops more fuel efficient and overall more reliable than jet engines. Its excellent power-to-weight ratio and reliability are enough to offset the high initial cost, maintenance, and fuel economy compared to regular piston engines."

 fighter_equipment_0:0 "Early Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_0_short:0 "Early Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The past century was a gallant age of airships and Pegasi and Griffon sky knights. The original Griffon biplane was thus mocked by the old guard for being a "commoner's tool" of war. It was not until a token garrison of Hippogriff fighter wings inflicted heavy casualties on the Storm King's air fleet in 1005 that even critics finally conceded that the era of airships had ended."
 fighter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Shifting away from the biplane design principle to that of the monoplane does make the aircraft less agile overall but gains considerable speed. This, along with the first truly all-metal fuselage and dedicated aero engine, make these fighters speedy and capable of climbing far faster than previous fighters while being more survivable."
 fighter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "We have found that our fighter aircraft are generally lacking in firepower. Either the armament is too low-calibre, lacks ammunition, or there simply isn't enough. Too often, our pilots run out of ammo or waste time pouring lead into larger or armoured aircraft. Reliable automatic cannons, enlarged magazines, or even additional weapons can be enough to solve this deficiency. Of course, the airframe and engine are updated accordingly."
 fighter_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Hard-fought lessons learned in the last years have demonstrated that, in general, the fighter operating at a higher altitude has a distinct advantage over the one at a lower altitude. Refinements in the fighter's weaponry keep it competitive against contemporary designs and deadly to older ones, while the early adoption of turboprops helps bring the aircraft to unprecedented heights beyond what normal creatures are meant to reach."

 cv_fighter_equipment_0:0 "Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "Used to the long range and flying time of the airship, militaries have searched for ways to extend the range of the powerful, but limited fighter craft. Just as airships were once hubs for griffons and pegasi soldiers, aircraft carriers became new hubs for these aircraft, much to the delight of unemployed airship crews seeking new homes."
 cv_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The relative low stall speed of biplanes has made the introduction of heavier carrier monoplane aircraft challenging. In addition, their larger size also poses an engineering challenge in stowing the aircraft in the limited hangar space of aircraft carriers. Designing carrier fighters around weight and folding wings goes a long way to addressing these primary issues."
 cv_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "In general, carrier fighters don't require much of an upgrade in firepower like their land-based counterparts. However, lessons learned in improving the overall flight characteristics of the latter can be implemented in the former. Redesigning our fuselages to enhance the agility and speed of our carrier fighters makes it more likely that our carrier-based fighters will come out on top when fighting the enemy."
 cv_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced Carrier Fighter"
 cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The greatest asset of carrier-based aircraft is their range. We've extended their operational range in previous iterations via additional integrated fuel or drop tanks. However, this is both inefficient and costly in fuel. Air resistance at low altitudes is a significant limiter of our carrier fighters' range. By cruising at higher altitudes, our fighters use less fuel and can go farther than ever."

 CAS_equipment_1:0 "Basic Close Air Support"
 CAS_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic CAS"
 CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "The impact of aircraft on the battlefield has already been felt by bombers unloading their payload on enemy positions. However, even the smaller tactical bombers are only effective at striking large, mostly immobile targets. A novel idea is making the rounds: light aircraft that provide close air support by hitting smaller targets, such as tanks or large unit formations with smaller but more precise bombs, by diving unto the enemy. Such craft will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies on the ground."
 CAS_equipment_2:0 "Improved Close Air Support"
 CAS_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved CAS"
 CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Early CAS have been designed deliberately to fly at low speeds to allow more precise dive bombing, but this has turned into a liability, leaving them vulnerable to enemy ground fire and pursuing fighters. We've tuned the airframe where possible to make these CAS bombers more manoeuvrable and speedier when not on attack runs and made it possible to mount larger payloads. Some experiments in anti-tank cannons and rocket rails also show great promise."
 CAS_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Close Air Support"
 CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced CAS"
 CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Should a CAS bomber be caught while unescorted, it is doubtful it'll make it back to base in one piece. This is why we should move away from yesteryear's fragile aircraft and instead focus on making them more survivable while still reasonably fast. Embracing the concept of rockets and anti-tank cannons allows this new generation of CAS to forego the dangerous dive bomb. It will still carry bombs to keep it versatile against many targets."

 cv_CAS_equipment_1:0 "Basic Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Our carriers require an aircraft that can strike land targets beyond the range of the guns of our larger ships. A dive bomber may not carry the same ordinance as larger bombers, but it is a viable choice, being suitably small and having a low stall speed. Additionally, carrier-based CAS can also prove to be effective against enemy ships when armed with armour-piercing bombs."
 cv_CAS_equipment_2:0 "Improved Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "The same vulnerability in land-based CAS bombers has also cropped up in our carrier CAS. Their slow and clunky flight characteristics make them easy prey to enemy fighters and the AA batteries of their target ships. We can increase the speed of our aircraft while allowing them to dive bomb with less risk with the use of dive breaks. This is still a difficult and dangerous procedure, but at least our pilots have a better chance of hitting their targets and getting away with it."
 cv_CAS_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced Carrier Close Air Support"
 cv_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Dive bombing has become unfeasible when attacking ships bristling with AA batteries. A CAS squadron may be able to run the gauntlet to score a hit, but the endeavour will inevitably be costly. As such, a new concept has taken shape: skip bombing. Between the rocket rails and heavier skip bombs, our carrier-based CAS can strike upon their targets without being as exposed to enemy counterfire as they would have been if dive bombing. "

 nav_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Basic Naval Bomber"
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic NAV"
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "An unexpected torpedo hit is one of the greatest threats to ships, while the depth charge is the perfect weapon against submarines. Planes designed to mount and deploy these weapons make them very cost-effective anti-shipping vehicles. What are a few downed bombers to a sunk dreadnought?"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Improved Naval Bomber"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved NAV"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The vast oceans require a great operational range for our naval bombers to effectively cover our territorial waters. Their sluggishness is still a concern, but refinements in naval targeting equipment give our pilots a fighting chance against the defences they're bound to run into. More capable flight characteristics make newer models fly further and faster while carrying additional and heavier ordinance to sink the enemy ships."
 nav_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Naval Bomber"
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced NAV"
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "There's only so much we can do to improve the ordinance our naval bombers can unleash upon their targets. Only the bombers have room for improvement: greater operational range, higher speeds, enhanced agility, air-mounted RADAR, and more defensive armaments. With such aircraft, we will establish a domineering position that naval bombers enjoy over fleets unlike any other."

 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Basic Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The limitations imposed on carrier-based aircraft make torpedo bombers the ideal choice for a capable anti-shipping craft. The air-dropped torpedo is smaller than those launched from ships, but their close range makes it hard to dodge, especially if the target is a large, sluggish ship. This allows the aircraft carrier to pose a significant threat against the supposed 'Queens' of the seas, the dreadnoughts and battleships. "
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Improved Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The strength of our carrier torpedo bombers is their capacity to strike hard from seemingly nowhere. With improved engines, they can come in faster and carry enhanced torpedo loads, giving less time for the enemy targets to react and boring larger holes in their hulls. These bombers give our aircraft carriers the bite they need to make them competitive on the high seas."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced Carrier Naval Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "While our new carrier naval bombers are more capable than previous designs, the most significant breakthrough has been faster aerial torpedoes. Their higher speeds enable our bomber pilots to drop off their loads from further away without significantly improving the chances of the enemy target evading the strike. This increases the survivability of our precious aircraft and invaluable pilots while maintaining our aircraft carriers' effectiveness. "

 jet_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Jet Fighter"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Jet Fighter"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Jet engines are a revolutionary step forward in the world of aviation, and it would be foolish of us not to take advantage of them in our fighter aircraft. However, our understanding of aerodynamics still has to catch up to these incredible speeds. Our contemporary designs are notably sluggish in aerial combat but make excellent boom-and-zoom fighters, deadly against bomber squadrons."
 jet_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Jet Fighter"
 jet_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Imp. Jet Fighter"
 jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Lessons learned with our early forays in jet aircraft have manifested themselves in the design of our newest jet fighters. Improvements to our turbine engines' lifespans diminish the costs in maintenance, the installation of ejection seats increase the survival rate of our pilots, and the implementation of swept wings and all-moving tailplanes makes the fighters far more responsive."

#Heavy Planes#
 tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Basic Tactical Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Tac Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Considered an offshoot from strategic bombers, the tactical bomber is meant to fit in a versatile role of striking many different targets, be they on land or sea. Their medium-sized airframe keeps these tactical bombers somewhat agile and speedy enough to carry reasonably heavy ordinances to the enemy while being sufficiently survivable, capable of shrugging off enemy fire."
 tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Improved Tactical Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Tac Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Enlargening the airframe of our medium bombers allows for improved engines for speed, heavier ordinance, more fuel for greater range, and more defensive armaments to keep enemies at bay. Their flexibility keeps these bombers relevant for any mission role we may require when dedicated aircraft are unavailable."
 tac_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Tactical Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Advanced Tac Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Improved aerodynamic fuselages and material use to increase our tactical bombers' flight characteristics. In addition, implementing rockets and dedicated skip bombs opens up new attack angles and opportunities for the bombers. Finally, more intelligent placements of our defensive weapons make any potential pursuer think twice about engaging an armed bomber."

 heavy_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Though our bombers are relatively large and armed with an array of defensive weaponry, they are still vulnerable to nimbler interceptors. Where they can, fighters escort our bombers to their targets, but the operational range of bombers far outstrips that of our regular fighters. Heavy fighters are the answer to this challenge. Armed with heavy weapons and generally twin-engined, heavy fighters trade agility and speed for range and killing power."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Imp. Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Military observers have noted that heavy fighters, though able to keep up with their bombers, are not effective escorts against smaller fighters. However, their large airframes make for an excellent bomber interceptor. Adding on heavier aircraft cannons while keeping their speed and operational range keep these new heavy fighters competitive in contested skies."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "Adv. Heavy Fighter"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters risk falling by the wayside as modern fighters begin to cover greater and greater ranges, and the latter's combat performance outstrips the former's. We can enhance their survivability by adding armour plating and heavier defensive weapons, but it is becoming evident that even as interceptors, heavy fighters are a dead-end. However, this line of new models is the pinnacle of heavy fighter design."

 strategic_bomber1:0 "Basic Strategic Bomber"
 strategic_bomber1_short:0 "Basic Strat Bomber"
 strategic_bomber1_desc:0 "Infrastructure destruction is recognised for its efficacy, and it has long been theorised that it could be carried out by air. Despite the flight capacity of many races, attacks deep behind enemy lines were previously impossible. Fliers could not safely carry full combat gear long distances, and sluggish airships met swift responses. Strategic bombers have changed this, able to deliver quick, long-range destruction anywhere, anytime."
 strategic_bomber2:0 "Improved Strategic Bomber"
 strategic_bomber2_short:0 "Impr. Strat Bomber"
 strategic_bomber2_desc:0 "Strategic bombing of enemy infrastructure and logistics has yielded great, yet costly, results. Bombers capable of carrying out such missions are slow, lumbering targets that can easily fall prey to enemy interceptors and AA fire. Breakthroughs in bombsight technology and fuselages capable of reaching higher altitudes enable high-altitude level bombing, keeping our bombers at safe heights from most threats. Should the enemy come for them, the heavy defensive armament should be more than a match."
 strategic_bomber3:0 "Advanced Strategic Bomber"
 strategic_bomber3_short:0 "Adv. Strat Bomber"
 strategic_bomber3_desc:0 "There is a relatively simple solution for our strategic bombers to be more effective: enlargen the airframe further. The added space allows for more and larger bomb bays to devastate even the hardiest targets while additional fuel storage gives them incredible range. As for the threats posed by interceptors, where escorts cannot be present, the addition of several more heavy gunnery positions and armour plating will make our newest bombers veritable flying fortresses."

 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Basic Jet Tactical Bomber"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Jet Tac Bomber"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The prospect of transonic bombers is a tantalising one, but there are some drawbacks in most contemporary designs. Specifically, the ordinance is relatively limited compared to heavier strategic bombers, and current understandings of aerodynamics make it challenging to mount many, if any, defensive weapons. Therefore, speed will be the primary defence of our jet bombers."
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Improved Jet Tactical Bomber"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Imp. Jet Tac Bomber"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Our understanding of jet-based aviation has advanced enough to allow new tactical bombers to carry greater loads and even mount some turreted positions for self-defence. Their main form of defence remains their high speeds, and their capacity to rapidly strike the target area and leave it just as quickly makes them deadly."

 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Jet Strategic Bomber"
 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Jet Strat Bomber"
 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "A new opportunity to develop a specially designed long-range penetration bomber has appeared. With new understandings of supersonic aviation and aerodynamics, strategic bombers equipped with high-performance jets enable them to fly high and far to deliver their deadly payloads. Along with modern air-to-ground RADAR, the accuracy of these strikes is nothing to scoff at."

 transport_plane_equipment_desc:0 "To landbound races, the ubiquity of air transport amongst flying races may seem odd. However, kitted out fliers cannot travel long distances without exhaustion. Modern fliers travel most of the distance by plane, jump out, and safely glide to the landing zone."

 scout_plane_equipment_1_short:0 "Basic Scout Plane"
 scout_plane_equipment_1_desc:0 "Previously, most aerial reconnaissance was done personally by winged creatures such as griffons and pegasi flying high. This, however, required incredibly fit and well-trained scouts. Planes can fly considerably higher and mount specially designed high-quality cameras that can take detailed photos while being substantially more survivable."
 scout_plane_equipment_2:0 "Improved Scout Plane"
 scout_plane_equipment_2_short:0 "Improved Scout Plane"
 scout_plane_equipment_2_desc:0 "Aerial reconnaissance has grown in importance, and the information a scout plane can obtain is vital to the enemy. This is why dedicated reconnaissance aircraft should strive for stealth to keep attention off just long enough to carry out their mission, be it by mounting a quieter engine, achieving a higher operational ceiling, or by something as simple as disguising the plane as a civilian aircraft."



##BBA PLANES (airframes)##
 small_plane_airframe_0:0 "Early Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "The past century was a gallant age of airships and Pegasi and Griffon sky knights. The original Griffon biplane was thus mocked by the old guard for being a "commoner's tool" of war. It was not until a token garrison of Hippogriff fighter wings inflicted heavy casualties on the Storm King's air fleet in 1005 that even critics finally conceded that the era of airships had ended. This particular range of airframes is mostly a continuation of those first biplanes, though it is evident that these are a dead-end for our military aviation."
 small_plane_airframe_1:0 "Basic Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Though the first wave of light aircraft managed to prove themselves successors to the airships of old, they were not without a variety of faults and shortcomings. Technological developments have now allowed for the use of light metals across the entire fuselage, allowing for more robust designs that are both drastically more versatile and less easily damaged. Further improvements will surely come, but these new airframes are nevertheless a huge step forward."
 small_plane_airframe_2:0 "Improved Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "As our aviation industry continues to develop and our pilots continue to provide feedback to designers, so too have our small aircraft gradually improved. Whilst the previous generation of fuselages were very capable, they lacked many important features and were not as deadly as was originally imagined. This new line of airframes has been built with a focus on ‘boom-and-zoom’ capability, allowing our pilots to climb high in order to then dive down and safely destroy both air and ground targets."
 small_plane_airframe_3:0 "Advanced Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "As time goes on, altitude and the element of surprise are becoming gradually less effective in providing guaranteed kills on enemy light aircraft and ground targets. Maximised agility —be it through impressively tight turning circles or capacity for complex manoeuvres—  is absolutely required to escape concentrated anti-air fire and enemy light aircraft. With this in mind, our new light airframes are now pushing the envelope of feasible designs in order to optimise flight characteristics and give us the edge over foreign designs."
 small_plane_airframe_4:0 "Semi-Modern Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "With the advent of modern engine technology that surpasses previous piston-based designs, speed and altitude have once again become dominant in air combat and air support doctrines. However, unlike the original ‘boom-and-zoom’ aircraft, such are the speeds achieved by these new aircraft that many new innovations have been made in order to keep them structurally sound during flight. New materials, innovative wing designs and dedicated air intakes have finally made them safe to use; though the rapid acceleration still makes our pilots uncomfortable."

 medium_plane_airframe_0:0 "Early Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "Having merely been adapted from civilian aircraft, this airframe makes up for its shocking lack of speed and manoeuvrability with considerable versatility. Once the seats and luggage compartments are removed it’s easy to turn these relatively primitive airliners into heavy fighters, reconnaissance aircraft or even tactical bombers. Preliminary testing indicates that they will perform with some efficacy, though we will advise the pilots to avoid being shot at all the same; even rifle fire can cause problems for these machines."
 medium_plane_airframe_1:0 "Basic Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Though the previous generation of medium airframes were far from useless, they left much to be desired in every aspect bar operational range. Particularly distressing to pilots was the casualty rate when unescorted which was unsurprisingly high, considering the origins of the converted aircraft they were flying. They will be relieved to know that the next generation of similarly sized aircraft will now be much less flimsy, faster and better armed thanks to our new dedicated fuselage designs."
 medium_plane_airframe_2:0 "Improved Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "Though the idea of a heavy fighter has become less and less appealing as smaller air superiority fighters continue to prove the importance of agility in dogfights, other aircraft based upon these moderately sized airframes have shown incredible promise. With improved wing designs to improve lift and more efficient use of internal space these aircraft can now travel further and with larger payloads than ever before."
 medium_plane_airframe_3:0 "Advanced Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "By now it is apparent that the versatility of these intermediately sized aircraft comes with limitations, particularly in regards to the extent of their capability in any one field in comparison to dedicated aircraft operating in those fields. Despite this they continue to be of great developmental interest as iterative designs continually improve their defining feature of relative agility in spite of their large payload capacity. Proponents of heavy fighters meanwhile have been very quiet, though they haven’t disappeared entirely."
 medium_plane_airframe_4:0 "Semi-Modern Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "Out of all possible machines, our moderately sized airframes have been the most difficult to adapt with the advent of jet technology. Light aircraft have been rickety and larger machines have been difficult to design, but intermediate aeroplanes have proven to suffer dramatically in the development stage as a result of their wide range of use cases. All the same, the possibilities for payloads delivered from high altitudes and at incredible speeds make these aircraft a worthwhile investment."

 large_plane_airframe_0:0 "Early Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "Thanks to the sudden obsolescence of airships at the advent of biplanes and anti-air weaponry, dropping a large explosive payload from above became suddenly rather difficult. Needless to say, something was expected to fill the technological gap and these large aircraft are the solution to that very problem. It took some convincing to have our pilots test many of the earlier iterations of these designs, but we have successfully created a number of functional heavy aircraft."
 large_plane_airframe_1:0 "Basic Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Our initial heavy airframe project was mediocre at best, spawning designs that had little in the way of survivability to deliver payloads with an explosive yield that made them only barely a worthwhile investment. New generations of fuselages and mounted weapons technology looks to drastically improve upon our original series of large aircraft with effective mountings for defence against enemy aircraft and an improved munitions capacity. Widespread use of metal in the hulls of these new aircraft will also decrease crew mortality rates considerably."
 large_plane_airframe_2:0 "Improved Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "Now that the strategic bomber has proven its worth as a cost effective method of waging war, the next step is to further specialise their designs. Whilst the previous iterations of heavy aircraft were robust and their crews perished less frequently, they were far from perfect. With the design principles sound, our engineers can now focus on substantially improving the range of these aircraft with efficient arrangement of fuel tanks, creating yet more space for munitions in the process."
 large_plane_airframe_3:0 "Advanced Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "Building upon previous improvements to our designs, the next stage is to optimise the altitude which our largest airframes can reach. Smaller aircraft may have a speed advantage, but their size limits the lift their engines and wings can produce which makes altitude the best defence that our strategic bombers can leverage over other aircraft and ground defences alike. To many it would seem as though the development of aircraft this size is reaching its zenith, though that hasn’t stopped our engineers from attempting further improvements."
 large_plane_airframe_4:0 "Semi-Modern Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "Thanks to the timely arrival of jet technology, the previously slowing development of large aircraft has once again begun to rapidly advance forward. The increased thrust and subsequently increased lift has allowed our engineers to create vastly quicker and more fuel efficient designs, further increasing the already staggering range of aircraft this size without compromising the large payload of our largest piston engine bombers from the previous generation."

 ##BBA PLANES (techs)##
 early_bombs:0 "Aerial Bombs"
 early_bombs_desc:0 "Bombs dropped from planes isn't a novel idea, but it has previously consisted of the plane crew dropping petards over the side of their aircraft. Designing dedicated bombs with stabilisation fins and bomb locks and bays to deliver the ordinance are necessary steps for specialised "bomber" aircraft."
 photo_reconnaisance:0 "Aerial Photo Reconnaissance"
 photo_reconnaisance_desc:0 "Previously, most aerial reconnaissance was done personally by winged creatures such as griffons and pegasi flying high. This, however, required incredibly fit and well-trained scouts. Planes can fly considerably higher and mount specially designed high-quality cameras that can take detailed photos while being substantially more survivable."
 aa_lmg:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Machine Guns"
 aa_lmg_desc:0 "Early air-to-air combat in aircraft consisted of pilots using personal firearms to shoot at enemy combatants. Needless to say, new weapons have been devised both for primary and secondary armaments for aircraft. A good compromise between lethality and weight, rifle-calibre machine guns can serve that purpose."
 survivability_studies_desc:0 "Battle-damaged aircraft that return provide instrumental case studies for improving the survivability of our planes. We've found that pilots and the crew are vulnerable, as are our aircraft's fuel tanks and engines. We can add steel plating to protect the crew and the more vulnerable components and use self-sealing fuel tanks to prevent leaks from perforations."
 aircraft_construction:0 "Applied Wartime Construction Experience"
 aircraft_construction_desc:0 "All-metal fuselage construction has opened up new possibilities to improve aircraft designs and suit them in their dedicated combat roles. Some ideas have surged forward, such as dive brakes for dive bombers, floatation devices for floatplanes, or even turning airframes into flying boats for maritime use. New applied knowledge also allows us to use specially treated wood or fabrics where possible to save on valuable aluminium!"
 range_improvements:0 "Studies in Range Extension"
 range_improvements_desc:0 "The operational range of aircraft is primarily decided by its fuel capacity. Careful thought must be put into how fuel capacity can be increased. Of course, the natural option is to increase the number and size of the fuel tanks, but it's easier said than done without turning our aircraft into flying fire hazards. A somewhat simple, if inelegant, solution for smaller aircraft is a fuel drop tank that doesn't impede their flight characteristics."
 aa_hmg:0 "Heavy Machine Guns"
 aa_hmg_desc:0 "Newer all-metal planes, while not impervious to rifle-calibre weaponry, can prove difficult to down. Previous machine guns calibres simply don't do enough damage. This problem is more noticeable with larger aircrafts such as heavy fighters and bombers. As such, higher calibre machine guns that use larger cartridges are the natural evolution for most forms of primary and defensive armaments for aircraft."
 aa_cannon_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_1_desc:0 "Sometimes, machine guns are not enough. Their small cartridges cannot carry enough explosive mass. A forward-facing automatic cannon is, in essence, an upscaled machine gun. Though notably heavy enough to impact the agility of an aircraft, their damage output can make mincemeat of even armoured planes. In some cases, these cannons can even punch through tanks in strafing runs!"
 aa_cannon_2:0 "Large Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_2_desc:0 "Simply upsizing the cannons allows for ferocious firepower to be unleashed, though it does inhibit aerial performance in dogfighting."
 aa_cannon_3:0 "Improved Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_3_desc:0 "Further refinements in automatic cannons and the introduction of dedicated anti-aircraft ammunition belts have significantly improved their performance. This allows us to mount the new iterations of these cannons in turreted positions, providing a deadly deterrent against even determined attackers. Though their weight can still be problematic for smaller aircraft, the weapons more than compensate with their devastating firepower."

 engines_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Engines"
 engines_1_desc:0 "A powerful yet lightweight engine is essential to power a propeller's rotations enough to lift a heavier-than-air aircraft. The first generation of these "aero engines" are not dissimilar in shape to most concurrent engines in ground vehicles. There are many engine configuration, from simple piston engines to radial engines. However, great care has been taken to make these engines as robust as possible while keeping their weight low."
 engines_2:0 "Aircraft Inline Engines"
 engines_2_desc:0 "The term "inline engine" covers different configurations, all different from the radial configuration, with banks of cylinders instead of rows. Its most significant advantage is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimise drag and for a gun to be incorporated within the engine and the propeller in most configurations."
 engines_3:0 "Water-Injected Aircraft Engines"
 engines_3_desc:0 "Adding water increases the mass being accelerated out of combustion engines, increasing thrust and cooling. Since temperature is usually the limiting factor in engine performance at low altitudes, the cooling effect lets the engine run at higher rotations with more fuel injected and more thrust created without overheating. The cooling effects from water injection also enable greater compression ratios by reducing engine knocking."
 engines_4:0 "Turboprop Engines"
 engines_4_desc:0 "Turboprops share many components and principles with turbojet engines, except the exhaust gases do not provide enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller. This makes turboprops more fuel efficient and overall more reliable than jet engines. Its excellent power-to-weight ratio and reliability are enough to offset the high initial cost, maintenance, and fuel economy compared to regular piston engines."

However, with recent miniaturisation efforts, it has now become possible to install such equipment; rudimentary as it may be."

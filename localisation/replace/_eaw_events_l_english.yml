civwar.12.d:0 "A representative from the central government of Equestria has arrived today to request our reintegration into Equestria.

civwar.15.t:0 "The Hoof and Hammer Against the Moon?"

civwar.15.a:0 "We shall convince our revolutionary brothers of this goal!"
civwar.15.b:0 "We're better off fighting for the true revolution here in the south."

Although the royal couple has pledged to fight the emerging darkness, they have sent their daughter, the royal heir Flurry Heart, to Equestria in case the worst will come to pass.

His return caused chaos in the streets of the capital as some of the citizenry, apparently supporting the Dark King’s return, rose up and turned on the revolutionary guards. A fight for the old palace, which had been repurposed as the headquarters for the ruling party, soon ensued, which the overwhelmed and surprised communists stood little chance of winning. Arctic Lily and much of the communist party leadership were rushed out of the city, pledging to continue the fight against all forms of tyranny.\nThe Situation looks grim, however, as Sombra now appears to have regained his body, seemingly delighted to take the fight to the ‘peasants’ of the Crystal Ponies’ Republic.

The disappearance of them both roughly dates back to the beginning of the current Era, a thousand years ago. Some ponies assume that the two were not allowed to be together by Luna's elder sister, Celestia, and after they rebelled she banished them both.

The low temperatures of the region brought many soldiers and milita ponies to their limits. The end of the civil war is welcomed by many crystal ponies, though some wonder if it was worth the price, and if the new regime will somehow make up for this terrible loss of life."

 conspiracy.3.d:0 "It seems that our new ties to Equestria have brought some good to us after all, as several industrialists from Canterlot have decided to invest in new factories on our soil, while some may call letting the bourgeoisie operate factories on our soil a betrayal to the revolution eventually they shall learn that it is merely but a means to an end."
 conspiracy.3.a:0 "We thank our Equestrian "friends" for their generosity."
 conspiracy.4.t:0 "New Railroads"
 conspiracy.4.d:0 "With our new ties to Equestria the Princess has deemed it fit to build a new set of railways in our domain, and while we have been provided both the funds and resources to actually construct the railroads it makes the government look like Celestia's stooges."
 conspiracy.4.a:0 "A connected nation is a united nation!"
 conspiracy.5.t:0 "Armouries"
 conspiracy.5.d:0 "It seems that despite our former secession from Equestria that the Royal Army has decided to open up several new armouries in our land to ensure our "safety", needless to say while it does provide us with a source of military equipment it also achieves the effect of confirming Stalliongrad's status as an Equestrian subject."
 conspiracy.5.a:0 "I'm glad that Equestria is ensuring our "safety""
 conspiracy.6.t:0 "Industrialisation"
 conspiracy.6.d:0 "After many years of hard work, and with a bit of funding from Equestria, we've finally managed to completely industrialise our nation, and we've got our own General Secretary to thank for that."
 conspiracy.6.a:0 "That's nice."
 conspiracy.7.t:0 "A Great Tragedy"
 conspiracy.7.d:0 "Disaster has struck Stalliongrad. On the morning of March 17th, an explosion rocked the palace of the Grand Soviet, setting off a small fires and killing a number of council officials. An investigation is currently underway, but there is nothing that could lead to a culprit, and authorities are not confident of finding such evidence any time soon. Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony’s not pleased with the current administration."
 conspiracy.7.a:0 "We will not be cowed by terrorists!"
 conspiracy.8.t:0 "A Nation United"
 conspiracy.8.d:0 "It has been several days since the Grand Soviet bombing, and life in Stalliongrad has returned to normal. Surprisingly enough, despite coming up short with any credible suspects, the current administration has seen a surge of support in the aftermath of the attack. While the act was clearly motivated by politics, most civilians see it as a national tragedy as indicated by the vigils held in honour of the victims. General Secretary Dark Wing was quick to seize on this wave of solidarity and participated in the vigils as well. This has been received positively by the nation, and it is expected to increase support for the current party."
 conspiracy.8.a:0 "What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!"
 conspiracy.9.t:0 "Responsibility"
 conspiracy.9.d:0 "Any hopes that the attack was merely Changeling sabotage or some outside force was quickly dashed today as group calling themselves "Red Dawn" claimed responsibility for the attack on the Grand Soviet. Hijacking several radio broadcasts across the nation they proceeded to denounce General Secretary Dark Wing as a "bourgeoisie puppet" and a "traitor to the revolution", even more worrisome however is their declaration that they will fight our government until a true dictatorship of the proletariat is restored to Stalliongrad. Unfortunately what they failed to account for was the sheer amount of loved ones lost making the ponies rally behind Dark Wing and his government in these dark times."
 conspiracy.9.a:0 "The game is on..."
 conspiracy.10.t:0 "The Hunt"
 conspiracy.10.d:0 "Needless to say nopony is happy with the recent turn of events. Ponies have lost their loved ones, the Supreme Soviet is in ruins and to make it all worse we have traitors within our midst. However the General Secretary has recently received several anonymous tips that could lead us to the traitor's hiding place..."
 conspiracy.10.a:0 "The first tip said to investigate the forests around Sovenok."
 conspiracy.10.b:0 "The second tip said to investigate Downtown St. Petershoof."
 conspiracy.10.c:0 "The third tip said to investigate the Mountains around Zayatsk."
 conspiracy.11.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.11.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving trough the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.11.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.12.t:0 "Petershoof"
 conspiracy.12.d:0 "It seems that the Petershoof tip was in fact either a red herring or completely false as after two months of investigation all we've managed to accomplish is waste some ponypower and embarrass the government."
 conspiracy.12.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.13.d:0 "Following the second tip our troops searched trough the mountains around Zayatsk for nearly a month, and after nearly a month of searching had almost given up hope until they managed to find a small rebel camp not in the mountains but the forests a bit south of Zayatsk. The evidence acquired from this camp is pointing towards the town of Sovenok."

 conspiracy.16.t:0 "The Celebration"
 conspiracy.16.d:0 "There was much fanfare today on the streets of Stalliongrad as General Secretary Dark Wing proclaimed our victory over the vicious terrorist organisation known as the Red Dawn. The celebration lasted for nearly as even Dark Wing's staunchest critics partook in the revelry. The celebration and was concluded by a speech from the General Secretary himself promising a new age for Stalliongrad, an age of prosperity, freedom and most importantly friendship..."
 conspiracy.16.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad!"

 conspiracy.18.t:0 "The General Secretary's Plan"
 conspiracy.18.d:0 "No one really expected it, but as the citizens of Stalliongrad woke up today beneath the old red flag of Stalliongrad one thing was for certain, something had happened. As if one our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, soon enough the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by our beloved General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to our fair land, but to all of Equestria..."
 conspiracy.18.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad! Long live Dark Wing!"
 conspiracy.21.t:0 "The Grand Speech"
 conspiracy.21.d:0 "In a speech today, Stalliongrad's General Secretary, Dark Wing has officially declared himself Supreme Leader of The Greater Equestrian Union and has announced the nation's transition into what he called National Communism, a new, radical take on the already widely-regarded as radical ideology that is communism, following Dark Wing's specific and pragmatic views on the world. Furthermore, he spoke out against Equestria, vowing to liberate the oppressed workers throughout their territory, as well as vowing to put down the fascist Changelings for the good of everypony."

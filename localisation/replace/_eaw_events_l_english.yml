civwar.16.d:0 "After a long trek through the south, a representative from the central government has arrived demanding that we officially reintegrate into Equestria. Although the Ponies of the Southern States are proud of their nation, the fact of the matter is that we would stand little chance against the massive might of the central government, what should we do?"

civwar.12.t:0 "Equestria Requests Reintegration"
civwar.12.d:0 "A representative from the central government of Equestria has arrived today to request our reintegration into Equestria.

civwar.12.b:0 "Retirement sounds like a good idea."

civwar.13.t:0 "Equestria Requests Reintegration"
civwar.13.d:0 "Earlier today a representative of Equestria arrived in the harbor via rowboat. They came bearing a request from the central government that we go and have ourselves be reintegrated into Equestria now that the civil war is over. This would mean we would cease to exist as a nation, but also that further bloodshed would be avoided. Many would seek to reintegrate with Equestria, but on the other hoof we did build all these forts."
civwar.13.a:0 "We can take 'em, eh?"
civwar.13.b:0 "This was never aboot fighting to the last..."

civwar.14.t:0 "Help From the Rogue Province"
civwar.14.d:0 "As Equestria's war against us ramps up some in the government have proposed that we request for help from the original revolutionaries in Stalliongrad. It would mean that they could get a spot at the table when the peace deal eventually comes, but on the other hoof we need every warm body we can muster to fight against the Equestrians and they do have a lovely spot for a second front."
civwar.14.a:0 "We need Equestria's troops there not here, send the request."
civwar.14.b:0 "We don't need their interference."

civwar.15.t:0 "The Hoof and Hammer Against the Moon?"
civwar.15.d:0 "When the civil war first began Stalliongrad seized large amounts of territory from the Lunar Empire. Now that Nightmare Moon has turned her guns against us we could reach out to them diplomatically to see if they are willing to seize even more territory for the revolution. The fact that this will take pressure off of us is just a side benefit, we will assure them."
civwar.15.a:0 "We shall convince our revolutionary brothers of this goal!"
civwar.15.b:0 "We're better off fighting for the true revolution here in the south."

Some ponies who managed to save themselves and flee Crystal City report that his followers attacked en masse, turning against the guards. A fight for the city and its palace quickly ensued, which the Crystal ponies stood little chance at winning. Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Prince Shining Armor were evacuated shortly before the palace, and with it the city, fell to Sombra and his followers. Although the royal couple has pledged to fight the emerging darkness, they have sent their daughter, the royal heir Flurry Heart, to Equestria in case the worst will come to pass. Rumours are spreading that the Crystal Heart is shattered, but there is no confirmation on this yet. What will this mean for Equestria and the world?"
 news.35.d_com:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The young Crystal Ponies' Republic was thrown in turmoil once again today, as King Sombra returned from exile to retake the throne of the Crystal Empire. Eyewitnesses report that the Monarch returned in the form of a black cloud of smoke, as dark as the night. His return caused chaos in the streets of the capital as some of the citizenry, apparently supporting the Dark King's return, rose up and turned on the revolutionary guards. A fight for the old palace, which had been repurposed as the headquarters for the ruling party, soon ensued, which the overwhelmed and surprised communists stood little chance of winning. Arctic Lily and much of the communist party leadership were rushed out of the city, pledging to continue the fight against all forms of tyranny.\nThe Situation looks grim, however, as Sombra now appears to have regained his body, seemingly delighted to take the fight to the 'peasants' of the Crystal Ponies' Republic. As the battle for the fate of the Crystal lands rages, all wonder what this will mean for Equestria and the world."

On his public speech yesterday he announced that he wishes to become a spouse of Nightmare Moon of Equestria. Legends go that before King Sombra was banished into the abyss, he supposedly had a romance with Princess Luna. The disappearance of them both roughly dates back to the beginning of the current Era, a thousand years ago. Some ponies assume that the two were not allowed to be together by Luna's elder sister, Celestia, and after they rebelled she banished them both. These are, of course, only legends, but these two ponies are the ones who know those events best. We are yet to hear Nightmare Moon's reply."

The marriage has raised concerns, with observers seeing as really dangerous this union, which surely has made stronger both monarchs, who are one an historical enemy of Celestia, and the other her Sister, who revolted against her in a bloody civil war. Will this reverse the balance of the war?"

 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the [Root.GetRaceMembers] who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretence of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marksist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what [Root.GetRaceMembers] identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labour unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organised enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the millennium.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defence. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."

 political.9.t:0 "Supremacist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of supremacy and those who extolled it as the saviour of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumoured to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Supremacy"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the supremacist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the [Root.GetRaceMembers] first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Supremacist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in Supremacy. In parallel with its growing political movement, supremacist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furore has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of Supremacy are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see citizens having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the supremacist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss Supremacy as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbours and a supremacist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organised, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains sceptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."

 political.15.t:0 "Harmonic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organised demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While [Root.GetRaceMembers] gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 political.16.a:0 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 political.16.b:0 "Let the [Root.GetRaceMembers] be heard."
 political.17.t:0 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favour of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a:0 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b:0 "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t:0 "Supremacists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] supremacist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many supremacists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the supremacists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"

 political.18.c:0 "If the [Root.GetRaceMembers] want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.19.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Marksist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.19.a:0 "Un-[Root.GetAdjective] activities must be stopped!"

 political.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the [Root.GetRaceMembers] ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of harmony as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"

The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.21.a:0 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 political.21.b:0 "The supremacists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 political.22.t:0 "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."

 political.23.d:0 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the [Root.GetRaceMembers] behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."

A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] Supremacy is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."

Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [Root.GetName] long held by the [From.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility.

It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. Students who just became of age are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen these [Root.GetRaceMembers] are caught and interrogated, they point their [Root.GetHands] at the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on [Root.GetRaceMembers] avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Even the number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and to make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."

Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Moving these formations to the affected cities proved a lot more difficult than expected, however, as the strikers blocked railway lines and forced the troops to come the old-fashioned way, giving them ample time to prepare. When our troops reached the barricaded factories, they found the strikers ready for them. Attempts to clear roads were met with furious attacks by the workers throwing stones and bottles at the soldiers. \n\nIn several instances, the troops opened fire to defend themselves, killing a number of strikers and wounding scores more. This only enraged the mob even further, with bystanders screamingf "Murderers!" The mood in the capital turned in favour of the strikers. At nightfall, the soldiers retreated, leaving the barricades intact.\n\nThere have been no further attempts to force the situation. The strikers remain in control of the factories, and no work is being done."
 strikes_event.2.a:0 "Not as planned."
 strikes_event.3.t:0 "Heroes on the Production Front"
 strikes_event.3.desc:0 ""Industrial war is more than just divisions marching and planes bombing. It is more than just the duty of a soldier to fight and die for their country. An industrial war is won, first and foremost, in the factories and foundries. To abandon the battle on the assembly line is no better than abandoning it on the front line. And the victories of the assembly line should be celebrated just as much as the ones won by the front line."\n\nAll available propaganda resources have been rerouted to show the work of the armaments workers in the best possible light. [Root.GetLeader] has personally approved a new award for workers who have exceeded their quota by more than 100%, and the first recipients have been sent on tours around the country to instruct other workers in their methods.\n\nIt appears that this has made a lot of the strikers reconsider their stance. Work has resumed in all previously affected factories."

 strikes_event.4.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] announced some small changes to the draft today. While skilled workers were previously exempted from the military draft, this exception has now been removed and all exempt [Root.GetRaceMembers] drafted immediately. At the same time, the War Office has been authorised to take direct control of any factory that produces goods relevant to the war effort if the leadership of those factories has shown a lack of ability.\n\nThe announcement was met with silent resignation in the affected cities, especially once it was announced that all who resisted would be treated the same as a soldier who refused to follow orders. While morale amongst the workers in the factories is at rock-bottom, production has restarted."
 strikes_event.4.a:0 "Should have done that from the start."

At the same time, the War Office has been authorised to take direct control of any factory that produces goods relevant to the war effort if the leadership of those factories has shown a lack of ability.\n\nThe announcement was met with great laughter in the affected cities, especially once it was announced that all who resisted would be treated the same as a soldier who refused to follow orders. Police officers sent to deliver draft notices to workers were told to come back with more than ink on paper."
 strikes_event.5.a:0 "Perhaps we should."
 strikes_event.6.t:0 "Useful Eaters"
 strikes_event.6.desc:0 "Without mentioning the strikes taking place, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that workers in war-relevant industries will get extra rations of sugar, coffee and chocolate to maintain their strength. Sadly, the rumours that the government was willing to hoof out cake turned out to be false.\n\nWhile the ringleaders of the strike try to keep the workers from returning to work, most seem to have accepted that "Peace and Bread" were never going to happen and are happy with just the bread."
 strikes_event.6.a:0 "They better earn their keep."
 strikes_event.7.t:0 "Operation Black Oak"
 strikes_event.7.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, maintaining noise and light discipline to keep the element of surprise. As the sun crept over the horizon and the workers manning the barricades at the factories looked forward to relief by the day shift, the assault columns moved in. The tired workers were sluggish in organising their resistance and quickly overcome. Leaving a small detachment to guard the prisoners, the troops swept the town, arresting all [Root.GetRaceMembers] on the list of known factory workers. By noon, the military had taken full control of the cities and instituted a curfew. No further resistance is expected. The majority of workers will soon be released on the condition that they return to work, while the ringleaders will be held and put on trial with the prosecution demanding the death sentence for endangering the country."
 strikes_event.7.a:0 "Order has been restored."
 strikes_event.8.t:0 "The Battle of Oak Street"
 strikes_event.8.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, but poor light and noise discipline gave the surprise away. As the troops moved in, they found the workers alert and ready for them. The first assault broke down in hails of thrown stones. A second assault with fixed bayonets was repulsed in brutal [Root.GetHand]-to-[Root.GetHand] fighting, leaving dozens of dead and dying in the streets.\n\nThe officers in charge have pulled back to consolidate their forces, while the workers are extending their fortifications and arming themselves with the weapons left behind in the retreat. A second day of fighting is expected tomorrow, but Military High Command does no longer believe that victory is likely."

 strikes_event.9.t:0 "The Worker's Rights Protection Act"
 strikes_event.9.desc:0 "With tensions running high across the capital, [Root.GetLeader] announced a new law to protect the rights of workers, even in times of war. The sweeping legislation mandates paid sick leave without limits, mandatory accident insurance for every worker and the right to join any union, even those critical of the war effort.\n\nWhile many in the government consider this nothing less than a complete surrender to the strikers, the results are conclusive: work has resumed in all factories."
 strikes_event.9.a:0 "Hopefully this will be enough."
 mutiny_event.1.t:0 "Mutiny Crushed"
 mutiny_event.1.desc:0 "After a few hours of tense negotiations at barracks gates and in frontline dugouts, the mutiny in our army is over. Faced with the prospect of a fight they could not win, the mutineers quickly decided to stand down. \n\nThe primary issue then became the fate of those that had refused orders. Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."
 mutiny_event.1.a:0 "Let's hope that is the last of it."
 mutiny_event.2.t:0 "An Empty Threat"
 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to supress them. Using skills honed on the frontlines, they quickly organized a defence of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly. \n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."
 mutiny_event.2.a:0 "We could not have predicted this."
 mutiny_event.3.t:0 ""What ARE we fighting for?""
 mutiny_event.3.desc:0 ""It's not uncommon for a soldier to doubt whether what he or she is doing is really worth it. Can anything justify the sacrifices we ask of you? Can we really demand of you to potentially die in pursuit of a goal that you would never see?\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that we must live in the times we were born in. Fate has decreed that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war; it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."
 mutiny_event.3.a:0 "Good speech."
 mutiny_event.4.t:0 "The Treason In War Act"
 mutiny_event.4.desc:0 "While the War Office is doing its best to keep the current mutiny in the army from becoming widely known, censoring letters can only go so far. Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nWithout mentioning the mutiny specifically, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that the government would now consider any act that reflected a lack of commitment to the war to be treason.\n\nThe punishment for treason is well known, and public support for the mutineers has all but evaporated. News of this was, of course, widely spread. Seeing little support from the general population, the soldiers have quietly resumed their duties."

Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nAttempts by the government to stem the tide have completely failed. Reports from the Secret Police indicate that the mutineers have a strong backing from the general public, making it unlikely that we can isolate and suppress them."

 mutiny_event.6.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] announced to the press today that his latest peace offer has failed. While the causes for this unfortunate turn of events are very complex, the [Root.GetAdjective] demand that the other side pay for all damages caused, disarm completely and publicly acknowledge that they started the war may have been the final straw.\n\nOur enemies have responded in kind, calling our reasonable requests a demand for unconditional surrender. They have promised that they will prosecute this war until the bitter end. \n\nWith our enemies evidently unwilling to see reason and promising to fight on, attempts by the mutineers to force a peace settlement have collapsed."
 mutiny_event.6.a:0 "Terrible shame."
 mutiny_event.7.t:0 "Military Crackdown succeeds."
 mutiny_event.7.desc:0 "Despite a few instances in which small groups of mutineers decided to make a fight out of it, our operation to crush the rebellion has been a stunning success. Relying on numbers rather than skill, loyalist militias surrounded the mutineers' strongholds and demanded their surrender. Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own and surrendered peacefully. \n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent the mutineers from forming new cells."
 mutiny_event.7.a:0 "Well done."
 mutiny_event.8.t:0 "Fighting Our Own"
 mutiny_event.8.desc:0 "Our attempts to prevent the elections for the Worker and Soldier Councils have escalated the situation beyond even the most pessimistic estimation. Rather than surrendering, the mutineers have formed provisional Councils, elected field commanders and set up defences in the streets. It is clear that they aim to make a fight out of this.\n\nThe rifts in the army now run through every unit and often even between members of the same family. [Root.GetNameDefCap] may soon be a battleground."

 mutiny_event.9.t:0 "A New Breed of Officer"
 mutiny_event.9.desc:0 "Despite strong objections from the military, every unit in the [Root.GetAdjective] Army carried out elections to select their commander. The results have been very surprising, as most of the newly elected officers are accomplished soldiers with plenty of experience in the field. While many career officers still consider this to be a personal insult, there can be little doubt that most soldiers dramatically prefer this situation."

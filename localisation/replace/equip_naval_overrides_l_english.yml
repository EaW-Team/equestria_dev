 submarine_1:0 "Early Submarine"
 submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 submarine_2:0 "1007 Submarine"
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 submarine_3:0 "1011 Submarine"
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 submarine_4:0 "1015 Submarine"
 submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."

 destroyer_1:0 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "The prevalence of nimble and hard-hitting torpedo boats threatens larger warships to the point where a dedicated ship class, the torpedo boat 'destroyer', can defeat enemy torpedo boats and supplant them. Larger than traditional corvettes and frigates yet smaller than cruisers, destroyers are an excellent light escort and screen."
 destroyer_2:0 "Enlarged Destroyer"
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Previous destroyer designs were fairly restrictive in overall displacement, which reduced their operational range and weapon mounts. Approaching the size of smaller, older cruisers, even up to 2500 tons of displacement, these new destroyers can mount far many more torpedo launchers, larger calibre guns, and dedicated hydrophone stations and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) equipment."
 destroyer_3:0 "Hunter-Killer Destroyer"
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "The growing threat from enemy submersibles has cemented the destroyer as the dedicated anti-submarine ship. Though smaller and cheaper corvettes are adequate at escorting merchant shipping, the best way to protect ourselves from submarines is by actively hunting them. Destroyers fitted with improved sonar and radar can immediately locate enemy submarines, and destroy them with forward-launched ASW weapons."
 destroyer_4:0 "Battle Destroyer"
 destroyer_4_desc:0 "Destroyers are fragile warships compared to cruisers or larger capital ships, so their staying power during battle is limited. Though fast and evasive, we shouldn't expect them to dodge enemy fire and torpedoes indefinitely. As such, these new designs, better compartmentalised and utilising dual-purpose main armament to allow further torpedo launcher mounts, can deal out far more damage than ever before."
 
 light_cruiser_1:0 "Early Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_2:0 "1007 Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_3:0 "1011 Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Larger and more heavily armored cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 light_cruiser_4:0 "1015 Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks."

 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Early Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "As navies across the world expand, a naval arms race seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "1007 Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "1011 Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "More balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "1015 Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."

 battle_cruiser_1:0 "Early Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The recent battlecruiser arms race resulted in several heavily armed designs, sacrificing armor for speed compared to battleships."
 battle_cruiser_2:0 "1011 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Rebuilt and repurposed battlecruisers continue to outrun even modern battleship designs by lighter protection, but have developed better systems for fire control, detection and aerial defenses."

 battleship_1:0 "Dreadnought Battleship"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 battleship_2:0 "1007 Battleship"
 battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 battleship_3:0 "1011 Battleship"
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 battleship_4:0 "1015 Battleship"
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."

 carrier_1:0 "Early Carrier"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 carrier_2:0 "1007 Carrier"
 carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy."
 carrier_3:0 "1011 Carrier"
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 carrier_4:0 "1015 Carrier"
 carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."

 SH_battleship_1:0 "1007 Super-Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "We can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2:0 "1015 Super-Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."

 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, engineers succeeded in mating battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armored."
 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:1 "An older design decades past, coastal defense ships combine the guns of a battleship with the hull of a cruiser, resulting in a powerful, but slow, cruiser, aimed at deterrence and local defense."
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_desc:0 "These larger submarines can patrol a longer range and hold more firepower or support equipment than their smaller cousins. However, their vulnerability and expense is making them obsolete."

 ship_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "A large-caliber cannon dating from before the fall of the Griffonian Empire."

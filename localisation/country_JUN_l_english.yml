### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventures... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_natives:0 "Work With the Natives"
JUN_natives_desc:0 "The natives of this land aren't all that bad and we'll gain nothing by alienating them. Who knows maybe we'll even turn a profit by the end of this?"
JUN_ancap:0 "The Pursuit of Profit"
JUN_ancap_desc:0 "We shouldn't look at this war as a bad thing, on the contrary it will allow us to expand our operations here even more."
JUN_merc_manpower:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
JUN_merc_manpower_desc:0 "If we intend to survive this mess we've gotten ourselves into we need soldiers... and a lot of them, and since convincing the natives to join our armies at the moment is out of the question, we should really hire some mercenaries."
JUN_merc_guns:0 "Import Weapons"
JUN_merc_guns_desc:0 "The complete and utter lack of any form of industrial capacity in this land has left us with no choice but to smuggle some old Griffonian rifles into our lands to arm our troops, let's hope the guns work long enough for us to set up some industry."
JUN_labour:0 ""Convince" The Natives"
JUN_labour_desc:0 "We've got no ponies to actually run our mines, factories and plantations, but what we do have is a lot of shiny guns and brute force. Perhaps we should put two and two together and "convince" the natives to help us."
JUN_plants:0 "Cash Crops"
JUN_plants_desc:0 "This land is abundant in everything from coffee to sugar to even the ever coveted coca, we should be able to fairly easily set up a couple of plantations in the jungle, and use some of the local and more isolated tribes as a cheap workforce."
JUN_indoctrination:0 "Indoctrination"
JUN_indoctrination_desc:0 "The truth is we'll eventually run out of mercenaries, and once that happens... well it won't be pleasant. However we can take steps to prevent our grisly demise by well giving them a proper education, with some minor adjustments of course to make sure they remain loyal to us."
JUN_research:0 "An R&D Department of Our Own"
JUN_research_desc:0 "Seeing as we are for all intents and purposes a company with a nation at this point, we really should consider opening up a R&D department. Unfortunately mercenaries and tribals with grade school level education aren't the most scientifically minded individuals, on the other hoof however, we've got two things every scientist needs; money and a near complete lack of morals. "
JUN_industry:0 "Manufacturers"
JUN_industry_desc:0 "While we're not the most benevolent overlords at least we managed to modernize the farms around Tenochititlan thus no longer making it a necessity for the natives to toil in the fields all day any night. Thus creating an influx of extra workers we could put to better use producing industrial goods."
JUN_arms:0 "An Arms Industry"
JUN_arms_desc:0 "Through some miracle we've actually managed to get some factories running in this Princess forsaken country, but we should probably invest some of our profits into creating some gun manufacturers seeing as we are still in fact at war."
JUN_mining:0 "The Riches of Tenochititlan"
JUN_mining_desc:0 "The local jungle is practically filled to the brim with resources and none of them are being used! This is simply criminal, and must not be allowed to continue."
JUN_infrastructure:0 "Paving the Road to Success"
JUN_infrastructure_desc:0 "The jungles around Tenochititlan are deep and filled with a lot of dangerous fauna and flora, to make the situation even worse there are barely any roads running through them, we must fix this."
JUN_conscripts:0 "Native Conscription"
JUN_conscripts_desc:0 "Now that we can actually extend our reach over the countryside we should probably start conscripting the natives into our armed forces."
JUN_merc_win:0 "Total Control"
JUN_merc_win_desc:0 "We've actually done it, we've managed to secure the Southeast for ourselves, think of all the money we can make now!"
JUN_gold_mining:0 "The Gold of Tenochititlan"
JUN_gold_mining_desc:0 "Gold... we've struck gold! We need to capitalize on this opportunity as soon as possible and start funneling our excess workers into these mines."
JUN_industry_tech:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
JUN_industry_tech_desc:0 "The machines and manufacturing methods of our nation are incredibly outdated. Our nation must modernise its industry if it is to survive!"
JUN_n_indus:0 "Industrial Development"
JUN_n_indus_desc:0 "Who says you can’t build factories in deep jungle?"
JUN_army_inds:0 "The Tenochititlan Arsenal"
JUN_army_inds_desc:0 "Our troops require more arms and ammunition if they are to be of any use. Constructing an Arsenal within our capital should greatly improve our situation."
JUN_n_recruits:0 "The Xiopilli"
JUN_n_recruits_desc:0 "The native warriors of the Xiopilli tribe in the southwest of our nation are renown for being loyal, cunning fighters. With our nation finally free from Equestria, we could try and approach them and use their skills for the common good."
JUN_n_recruits_2:0 "The Neneuhal"
JUN_n_recruits_2_desc:0 "The Neneuhal, a band of fierce, savage warriors located in the south-east, have long been a thorn in Equestria’s side, contesting their control over the region. With Equestrian influence removed, we should try and recruit these skilled warriors for our cause."
JUN_n_recruits_3:0 "The Zolin"
JUN_n_recruits_3_desc:0 "The largest and most influential tribe of natives, the Zolin, located in the north of our nation, consists of battle-hardened, merciless fighters. Several times they ambushed equestrian forces in the region, pretty much claiming the region for themselves. Now, it is time to pacify these brave fighters. They could be a perfect addition to our armed forces…"
JUN_n_mines:0 "Homemade Steelworks"
JUN_n_mines_desc:0 "Steel is essential to any modern army, and we cannot rely on foreigners to supply us with this important resource. Our industry must be independent from that of others!"
JUN_houses:0 "Housing Projects"
JUN_houses_desc:0 "With improved and well-funded urban planning, we can use even the smallest bit of land to great effect."
JUN_n_industry:0 "Jobs for the Natives"
JUN_n_industry_desc:0 "The natives make up a fair part of our population, and it’s time to integrate them into society."
JUN_farming:0 "Feeding the Ponies"
JUN_farming_desc:0 "Our ponies are hungry, and our nation lacks fertile soil. It would be wise to invest in agriculture: keeping our ponies healthy and well-fed will greatly increase productivity overall."
JUN_schooling:0 "Organize an Education System"
JUN_schooling_desc:0 "A nation is built upon its ponies, and a nation built upon uneducated ponies is doomed to fail. It’s time to handle education and organise a national education system."
JUN_academy:0 "Hire Foreign Scientists"
JUN_academy_desc:0 "In the light of our new education effort, we should try and attract foreign scientists. Their skill and knowledge will bring our nation forward."
JUN_native_win:0 "Freedom!"
JUN_native_win_desc:0 "At long last, the freedom and liberty of our nation and its ponies is secure! Let us celebrate these values, for they shall shape the path ahead."
JUN_federation:0 "The Federation"
JUN_federation_desc:0 "Our recent, new policies have brought ponies, native or not, much closer together. It is time to rebrand our nation as a federal state, in which all ponies are free."
JUN_federation_farms:0 "Subsidize Agriculture"
JUN_federation_farms_desc:0 "Our recent investment in agriculture has had great effect, but food is still expensive, too expensive for some. Modernised agriculture will ensure that food prices stay moderate, and that ponies, poor and rich alike, must hunger no more."
JUN_sciences:0 "The Stableside Academy of Practical Sciences"
JUN_sciences_desc:0 "Our brand-new education system has worked wonders, and some of our ponies have already shown great intellect and skill. Let us further invest in education!"
JUN_oil_synth:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
JUN_oil_synth_desc:0 "Oil is scarce, and yet so very important at the same time. The scientists within Stableside Academy have come up with an idea that could help us out, however…"
JUN_oil:0 "Oil in the Deep Jungle"
JUN_oil_desc:0 "Rejoice! We’ve found Oil, at last! This is just what our growing, ever hungry industry needed."
JUN_industry_technology:0 "Fund the Engineering Wing"
JUN_industry_technology_desc:0 "Our industry requires constant improvement and development if it is to keep up with those of other nations. Let us use the newly established Stableside Academy to attract experts on this field."
JUN_electronics_technology:0 "Fund the Electronic-Engineering Wing"
JUN_electronics_technology_desc:0 "With such skilled experts and scientists now living within our borders, we should consider branching out towards Electronic-Engineering, as to further expand our knowledge."
JUN_federation_roads:0 "Connecting the Nation"
JUN_federation_roads_desc:0 "Our ponies have rightfully complained that transportation is abysmal at the time. Worry not, however! New roads and railways will effectively connect our nation."
JUN_federation_industrial:0 "Industrializing the South-East"
JUN_federation_industrial_desc:0 "With the local tribes now fully integrated into society, we can go forward and industrialise the south-east of the nation, an area that was previously unaccessible."
JUN_federation_arms:0 "Arming the Nation"
JUN_federation_arms_desc:0 "While the rights and well-being of our ponies are a big priority of ours, we mustn’t let our guard down. We must prepare for whatever struggle we may face and arm ourselves appropriately."
JUN_nuclear_research:0 "Nuclear Physics"
JUN_nuclear_research_desc:0 "The scent of a new age is in the air. A team of scientists has just recently drawn up first prototypes and schemes for a weapon that could very well change the world forever. Let us hope such weaponry doesn’t fall into the wrong hooves..."
JUN_EQS_win:0 "South Equestrian Trading Company"
JUN_EQS_win_desc:0 "Equestria may not be too happy with our victory, but we need not worry them. Our plans for this land go far beyond the backwater that they left it. Founding ourselves as an official Trading Company is but the first step to securing our rule."
JUN_EQS_cores:0 "Land Reorganization"
JUN_EQS_cores_desc:0 "We have requested a charter to oversee all the lands in the South, and her majesty has thoughtfully agreed to such terms."
JUN_EQS_roads:0 "Connecting the Colonies"
JUN_EQS_roads_desc:0 "In order to civilize these lands we first need to connect each mine, plantation and outpost. Railways will cut through the trees and nothing will stand in their path."
JUN_EQS_industrial:0 "Colonial Manufactories"
JUN_EQS_industrial_desc:0 "These jungles are full of ponies and resources. They can be put to use in the factories, providing riches to us and the region."
JUN_CHN_win:0 "The South Equestrian Changeling Authority"
JUN_CHN_win_desc:0 "Changelings our untrustworthy, but as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. We can be off use to their Queen."
JUN_CHN_cores:0 "Crush Any Resistance"
JUN_CHN_cores_desc:0 "These jungles and swamps are full of hidden treasures, and they all belong to us"
JUN_CHN_roads:0 "Paving the Roads"
JUN_CHN_roads_desc:0 "It’s impossible to move in this jungle, the are too many trees and natives in the way. With the industrial backing of our Changeling friends, we can pave over them, ending our logistical woes."
JUN_CHN_arms_inds:0 "Changelings Military Assistance"
JUN_CHN_arms_inds_desc:0 "No one can deny the skill and experience the Changelings have when it comes to the battlefield. While it would hurt our pride, should ask for assistance in such matters to give us the upper hand in this conflict."
JUN_alone:0 "King of the Jungle"
JUN_alone_desc:0 "This is our Jungle. We took it with our blood. It’s riches are our own. We will keep it that way."
JUN_tlatoni:0 "God Amongst mere Mortals"
JUN_tlatoni_desc:0 "I suppose they must see us as divine beings. We came here lost and we found an empire of iron and blood. We shaped this jungle in our own image and have brought civilisation to where there was none. And it was all me. It was my plan. I did it. I did it all. I am a god among these savages, and through me they have ascended. It was all me. And those who oppose me? They must be exterminated."
JUN_cores:0 "Integrate the Conquered Land"
JUN_cores_desc:0 "We took this land with the blood of its natives. It is ours by that right. It’s ponies and resources are now the property of the King."
JUN_unity:0 "Destroy Any Resistance"
JUN_unity_desc:0 "Some Natives still haven't learned their place. We’ll soon put a stop to that."
JUN_trade:0 "Exporting the Riches of the Jungle"
JUN_trade_desc:0 "There’s gold around every corner in this place and precious gems and crystals beneath our hooves. Unfortunately, we don’t have enough ships to transport our goods to our customers… yet."
JUN_roads:0 "The Skull Road"
JUN_roads_desc:0 "Just because a few natives die in the path of the road and we pave over them doesn’t mean it has to have such a dreary name. It’s not like they were worth anything in the first place."
JUN_industrial:0 "Industrialization"
JUN_industrial_desc:0 "With so much free labour around we should employ them in our factories to make the high desired goods of the world. Think of the markup!"
JUN_arms_inds:0 "The Fires of War"
JUN_arms_inds_desc:0 "It worked so well for us the first time round, we might as well prepare for another one. War is a profitable venture after all."
JUN_merc_armies:0 "An Army of Mercenaries"
JUN_merc_armies_desc:0 "We can’t trust these natives, they could turn on us at any moment. Instead, we’ll look for anyone willing to fight for a share of the gold. While they’ll be a ragtag bunch, they’ll more then make up for it with their experience and will to fight."
JUN_motorized:0 "Motorization"
JUN_motorized_desc:0 "While you can’t drive trucks through threes, our enemies are managing to do so. We should acquire more vehicles, better than the others. We’ll find a use for them."
JUN_tanks:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Drivers"
JUN_tanks_desc:0 "Stalliongrad likes their tanks and fortunately not all of them are so happy to have given up their wealth for equal poverty. The promise of gold is more than enough to invite them into our employment."
JUN_native_armies:0 "An Army of Natives"
JUN_native_armies_desc:0 "As we’ve often found out, these natives can be fierce in battle. They are also masters of the jungles and there are more of them then we can count. With the right supervision we can arm them and turn them against our enemies."
JUN_native_soldiers:0 "Tribal Volunteers"
JUN_native_soldiers_desc:0 "Some of the natives have taken issue with some other natives fighting for Daring Do. They actually want to help us fight the other tribes! Of course, we will accept their offer."
JUN_native_troops:0 "Organize Native Regiments"
JUN_native_troops_desc:0 "This native idea is working out great. Fortunately, there’s always more from where they come from. Now we just need to find some weapons for them."
JUN_weapons:0 "Modern Firearms"
JUN_weapons_desc:0 "Everyone has new and fancy firearms in development while all we have is second hand junk. It’s time to procure for ourselves some of the latest and greatest designs to ensure we don’t find ourselves falling behind."
JUN_support:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
JUN_support_desc:0 "Mortals, machine guns, flamethrowers, shields. We need to make sure that every company has enough of them. Who knows when we need to burn some natives out?"
JUN_doctrine:0 "Develop Our Doctrine"
JUN_doctrine_desc:0 "Better equipment can only do so much if we don’t know how to use it. We should spend some time thinking about our strategy."
JUN_a_research:0 "A Proper Officer Corp"
JUN_a_research_desc:0 "We should pool our officers together into a professional body. Doing so will help them share ideas and come up with new, better ways to fight."
JUN_federation_unity:0 "Unite the Federation"
JUN_federation_unity_desc:0 "Our nation, our new federation, is a sovereign one. From this day forward, our ponies will unite, hoof in hoof, to achieve the common goal. Freedom and Liberty for all!"
JUN_naval_bases:0 "Expand Shipping Capacity"
JUN_naval_bases_desc:0 "The sea is the only access to the outside world and vital for our supplies. Expanding our ship building capacity is a must to protect our investments."
JUN_destroyers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_destroyers_desc:0 "We need fast ships that pack a punch to protect our transports. Destroyers and cruisers fit this role perfectly."
JUN_a_fleet:0 "A Proper Fleet"
JUN_a_fleet_desc:0 "As we build bigger ships, it’s only right we think of a plan on how best to use them."
JUN_sub_doctrine:0 "Hide Beneath the Waves"
JUN_sub_doctrine_desc:0 "Submarines are useful for smuggling. Fitting them with torpedoes will make them even more useful."
JUN_subs:0 "Underwater Privateers"
JUN_subs_desc:0 "Some may call it piracy. But it’s their fault for leaving valuable cargo undefended."
JUN_naval_bases_2:0 "The Jungle Navy"
JUN_naval_bases_2_desc:0 "With our sea-based activities going so well it’s time to ramp up our capacity."
JUN_naval_doctrine:0 "Finish Building the Aztlan Navy"
JUN_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "With so many promising captains and admirals it’s time to real in control and formalise the navy."
JUN_airbase:0 "Tenochtitlan Airport"
JUN_airbase_desc:0 "It’s difficult to hull ponies and supplies to the heart of the Jungle. By building an air base we can improve our logistics and provide a base for aircraft to assist our troops."
JUN_n_pilots:0 "Coerce Native Pilots"
JUN_n_pilots_desc:0 "While these Natives probably haven't seen a aircraft before, they can be trained to fly them. And they will do so whether they want to or not."
JUN_air_support:0 "Air Support"
JUN_air_support_desc:0 "It’s difficult to hit targets hiding under the thick canopy of the trees. We should focus our training and procurement efforts on improving our air support capabilities."
JUN_cas:0 "Balefire Bombs"
JUN_cas_desc:0 "We should capture the plans to these deadly new weapons. Daring Do and those night lovers cannot hide if we burn them out."
JUN_tatical_b:0 "No Tree Left Standing"
JUN_tatical_b_desc:0 "Drop the bombs. Exterminate them all!"
JUN_m_pilots:0 "Hire Mercenary Pilots"
JUN_m_pilots_desc:0 "They may be expensive, but having experienced, dedicated pilots will give us the upper hand in the air war."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
jungle.0.t:0 "The Long Road Ahead"
 jungle.0.d:0 "Truth be told one of the things keeping us back from properly exploting the jungle is the lack of actual infrastructure to transport both resources and ponies. While we've managed to somewhat mitigate this issue by using the natives to pave some roads one of our advisors has proposed we seperate some funds... and natives to construct a proper railroad in Tenochtitlan."
 jungle.0.a:0 "This is unnecessary"
 jungle.0.b:0 "Why not, every little bit helps"
 jungle.1.t:0 "The Riches of Tenochtitlan"
 jungle.1.d:0 "With the recent discovery of gold around of Tenochtitlan some of our advisors have proposed that we begin resettling any natives living on known gold nodes or better yet outright enslave those natives to dig the gold for us. While this would undoubtedly increase production it would to say the least make the natives despise us."
 jungle.1.a:0 "Just resettle the savages"
 jungle.1.b:0 "Make sure every foal, mare and stallion is working in those mines"
 jungle.0.c:0 "This is a great idea! Shoot anyone who complains about it."
 jungle.2.t:0 "The Issue of Native Conscription"
 jungle.2.d:0 "As our current conscription policy towars the Natives stands every family with three or more foals must give their firstborn son into our military, however some of our advisors have argued that this is simply not enough to win the war. They've proposed that we conscript the firstborn foal of every two foal family."
 jungle.2.a:0 "We've got enough soldiers as is."
 jungle.2.b:0 "Why not, make sure anypony whom complains is never seen again."
 jungle.3.t:0 "Working in the Jungle"
 jungle.3.d:0 "Their bodies lie lazily under the sweltering heat of the canopy. Flies already set to work on them before they had wheezed their final breath. Another village, left fit only for ghosts. Their now former overseer assures us that they had finished their work. The railroad had been laid, the factory doors are open and feeding the mechanisms of war, and the golden idols, which once adorned the chief’s hut, now cover the walls of the his office."
 jungle.3.a:0 "Hopefully this won't be too much of a net loss."
 jungle.4.t:0 "Natives Flock to the Army"
 jungle.4.d:0 "While mercenaries, adventurers and bandits make up out officer corps, we need the natives to fill our ranks. Fortunately, after much persuasion and some concessions a local officer, a local native chief was persuaded over to our cause."
 jungle.4.a:0 "Maybe not all of them are idiots."
 jungle.5.t:0 "Natives Desert"
 jungle.5.d:0 "A platoon of native troops has rebelled against their officers. The Companyponies were found with their heads stacked into a small pyramid. Horns and wings were removed and have yet to be found. Worse of all, the natives took off with all their supplies and equipment and their villages have been deserted, what they couldn’t take with them was burned."
 jungle.5.a:0 "Hunt down those savages!"
 jungle.6.t:0 "Gold Mine Collapses"
 jungle.6.d:0 "A goldmine collapsed today. The overseers are safe and sound, but many natives are still trapped deep inside with many tons of gold. Some miners attempted to dig the trapped comrades out, but were quickly put back to actual work by the overseers. Those few individuals that bothered to protest were swiftly arrested for disobedience and punished. On the bright side The mine’s foreman predicts production should return to normal in a month or two."
 jungle.6.a:0 "At least nothing of value was lost"
 jungle.7.t:0 "Our Future"
 jungle.7.d:0 "Trough sheer will, cruelty and determination we've managed to win the war in the South-East, however to do so we've brutalized the natives and alienated the few proper Equestrians living along the coast thus making our control tenuous at best. If we intend to survive we must find a sponsor and find one soon."
 jungle.7.a:0 "The Equestrians will keep us safe"
 jungle.7.b:0 "Let's negotiate with the Changelings, I'm sure we can come to an agreement"
 jungle.7.c:0 "We've conquered the jungle alone... and we shall rule it alone"
 jungle.8.t:0 "The Changelings Refuse"
 jungle.8.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the Changelings actually refused our offer, what shall we do?"
 jungle.8.a:0 "Make an offer to the Equestrians"
 jungle.8.b:0 "We'll rule the jungles alone"
 jungle.9.t:0 "Well and Truly Alone"
 jungle.9.d:0 "The Changelings refused, the Equestrians refused... we are truly alone in the jungle, with all the dangers that bears."
 jungle.9.a:0 "We don't need either of them anyway!"
 jungle.10.t:0 "The Equestrians Turn Down out Offer"
 jungle.10.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the Equestrians refused our offer! What shall we do?"
 jungle.10.a:0 "Let's see if the Changelings are more reasonable"
 jungle.10.b:0 "No we conquered the jungle! And we shall rule it ourselves!"
 jungle.11.t:0 "Unrest Amongst the Tribes"
 jungle.11.d:0 "An old stallion once said: "You can't break a pony like you can an animal"; while we don't particularly care for whom said that nor should we it seems that some of the more outlying jungle tribes have taken the saying to heart and started getting somewhat uppity."
 jungle.11.a:0 "Send somepony to deal with them"
 jungle.12.t:0 "Back to Business"
 jungle.12.d:0 "What little rebelliousness the local tribes had in them has finally been crushed by our troops."
 jungle.12.a:0 "Hopefully this will serve as a warning to the other savages"
 jungle.13.t:0 "Destroyed Outposts"
 jungle.13.d:0 "It seems that the Tribals are no longer merely voicing their discontent as several of our outposts and camps were found burned to the ground with their garrisons slaugthered, to make it worse no natives were caught in the act. The fact that no natives were caught makes our advisors think that we have a full fledged guerilla force fighting us now."
 jungle.13.a:0 "Damn it! Hunt down those savages before they do anymore harm"
 jungle.14.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
 jungle.14.d:0 "After long weeks spent in the jungles our troops have finally managed to hunt down the savages that have been destroying our outposts and butchering our ponies."
 jungle.14.a:0 "That will teach them to mess with us!"
 jungle.15.t:0 "Rumble in the Jungle"
 jungle.15.d:0 "It seems that the guerilla issue we've been having for some time now has escelated even further, as several outlying communities, villages and tribes are now in open rebellion against us. While they pose no real threat putting down the rebels will take time and resources."
 jungle.15.a:0 "Oh come one! They're just a bunch of spear chucking savages!"
 jungle.16.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 jungle.16.d:0 "We've finally managed to put down the rebellions against our rules, however there are still Tribal Guerillas attacking us from the jungle."
 jungle.16.a:0 "We'll get 'em all eventually"
 jungle.17.t:0 "Caballeron question"
 jungle.17.d:0 "In accordance with the recent treaty our troops have installed a puppet government in the small jungle nation in Southeast Equestria. The country’s leader, Doctor Caballeron, has shown himself willing to work with our forces. So a question been raised whether to install our own governor, or to keep the good doctor in his former position - under our command, of course."
 jungle.17.a:0 "Install one of our own"
 jungle.17.b:0 "Dr. Caballeron can keep his jungle command for now."


temple_spawn_tlp:0 "Ahuizotl will assume power in §Ythe Temple§W."

### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Repurpose Saltmane"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a useful territory, but we require more than simply jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from seas as well."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. The means of combat is a small favour to ask in order to achieve control. "
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "And Then Some"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "The dangers are always afoot, if we intend to stand a chance, more weapons are required. It's time we further increase our stockpile of armaments. Guns, grenades, ammunition, anything a soldier can need."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. Quarries will be developed, lands will be razed, the resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, that will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, but they're still a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land, there will be a stronghold raised here in no time."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old Canals, so that the water will provide resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress we've made to develop the framework here, the time has come for the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up progressive manufacturing, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better groundwork to support the gathering. Build the sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, we shall never run out of wood again."
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, there is a chance that they will listen."
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the natives. A fight for survival can unite anyone. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. Our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one, odd, but has its uses. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only to our enemies that see them as such. The natives and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

### Events ###
jungle.1.t:0 "The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.1.d:0 "One is never sure what to expect when they meet the local tribes whose lands you come into. Are they savage? Will they ambush us? Will they want to work together with us? Though it gives us hope that they agreed to this meeting. We're not in the best position to bargain right now.\n\nYet still, despite the possible issues, the Chiefs were friendly to us. Perhaps, they too realise that the war closing in around them can threaten their peace as well as their stability, or even their well-being. The summit was a success, and they will aid us find our place in these jungles, while we will offer them protection.\n\nBut they made themselves clear, they will cooperate, on the condition that we respect their customs, their tradition and their culture. A small price to pay for the shelter of a powerful ally who know the landscape better than any one us can."
jungle.1.a:0 "I'm glad we are working together"

jungle.2.t:0 "Hearts And Minds"
jungle.2.d:0 "It seems that both of us came to the same conclusion, a misfortune united us, but it is us who will turn it into our fortune. Same as us, they see the great benefit of our cooperation, we provide them with a barrier, better infrastructure and the possibility to rebuild their structures that were long beaten by the time, the weather and the previous occupants. While they give is insight on the landscape, the safe paths, the dangerous glades and the hidden treasures.\n\nIt was an underestimation from our side, what they're capable of. A frail mistake, to doubt them, but that doesn't matter now, for our hearts and minds are focused on the same purpose, survival.\n\nWe shall see how our mutual future will turn out, but for now, this alliance proves itself to be promising."
jungle.2.a:0 "Aztlan shall be free!"

jungle.3.t:0 "Conflicts of Interest"
jungle.3.d:0 "It appears that our local friends are not happy with the recent expansion of our logging efforts. Soon after the new mills started toppling the glades and piling the wood, the chiefs called us for an emergency meeting.\n\nThey were adamant about the value of land for them, the resources it provided, a relationship that should not be overstepped. But still, their dissatisfaction finished with only puffs and grunts, as they did not take any major actions about it.\n\nWe can only hope that they can understand the purpose of our actions, the enormous war effort that we carry, and forgive us for it. But we shall yet rebuild this jungle sweep."
jungle.3.a:0 "Rather unfortunate"

jungle.4.t:0 "Squatter Troubles"
jungle.4.d:0 "Our continued effort to gather more resources has attracted new interest in our territories. However, a problem arose out of it, the squatters started taking up more and more of our space.\n\nThe surrounding areas of our panties is more like slums for poor and adventurers alike. They don't seem to have the intention to leave, either.\n\nThough we need to focus on our own kind first, they do not seem to be all that harmful, other than our supplies and reputation, yet we cannot ignore them."
jungle.4.a:0 "At least we can put them to work..."

jungle.5.t:0 "The Wonders of Irrigation"
jungle.5.d:0 "Water is a crucial resource for any civilisation, and these jungles are abundant with it. By taming the flow of the river, we can utilise it in order for it to suit our every need.\n\nOur fields bloom, our citizens thrive, all thanks to the improved infrastructure. Truly a display of our power and a victory for our well-being. The influence we exert on this realm only grows.\n\nAhh, the wonders of irrigation. "
jungle.5.a:0 "Ain't it beautiful?"

jungle.6.t:0 "An Amazing Discovery"
jungle.6.d:0 "Reusing the old ruins was no easy task. The stones, old, crude, uneven, hard to work with. It seemed that this whole operation could be more woeful than it would be profitable.\n\nUntil, one day, we hit upon a secret chamber in one of the ruins' catacombs. It was filled with riches beyond imagination. The locals were right when they told us to investigate this place. Perhaps, they wanted us to find these?\n\nNevertheless, the discovery raised the spirits of the ponies, and it seemed as if all the previous inconveniences simply vanished and the work continued without interruptions.\n\nWith the new structures in place, and the fresh treasures in our vaults, this province starts looking all the more promising."
jungle.6.a:0 "Gold, gems, and more!"

jungle.7.t:0 "Native Complaints"
jungle.7.d:0 "The war is looming on us all, but we are in no way having an advantageous predicament in it. The fight has weakened us, drained us of our resources, hit our morale. Seems like it is time for more desperate measures.\n\nWe have resorted to calling in a few favours with the natives, which allowed us to gather more equipment for the war machine that we must guide now. Weapons, supplies, anything goes, so long that it helps us take an edge in the conflict we face.\n\nUnfortunately, the natives were not satisfied with our actions."

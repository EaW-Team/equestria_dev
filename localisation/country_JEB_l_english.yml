 rila.1.d:0 "placeholder: a representative from Société Justice (Michel supporters club - ps: michel is a representative in the committee, try to insert that in if possible) will ask what should the government be like once the committee ends, the Cocardiers respond by saying that the committee will never end and that it is permanent since it is the most democratic thing it can be, Club Patriote (extremist too) will proceed to say that it has to end one day since Rila needs a strong executive president, the two extremist clubs (Cocardier and Patriote) will start a heated argument against eachother, which has never happened before on account of their similar ideology, shocking all the representatives, end the event with two representatives from both Cocardiers and Patriote approaching eachother on the speaking ground"
 rila.1.a:0 "How is this happening?"
 rila.2.t:0 "Chandeliers and Carnage"
 rila.2.d:0 "placeholder: direct follow-up to the event above: Cocardier guy and Patriote guy jumps at eachother and fights eachother in the middle of the speaking ground, both Cocardiers and Patriote members start fighting eachother in the committee, some members of the committee quickly rushes to the exit while others from the extremist and moderate socialist clubs join the brawl"
 rila.2.a:0 "Are you trying to ruin the Revolution?!"
 rila.3.t:0 "The Frame Game"
 rila.3.d:0 "placeholder: this event fires 3 hours after the one above: club members from the Verbe Vrai (aka Progressives print owners and newspapers men) print and talk about the brawl in order to discredit the extremists, population is shocked and there's a loss of faith in the extremists for a few, severe talks about how griffons believe that this might make the revolution fail, heated arguments between griffons in the streets, even a few brawls concerning politics in bars, cafés and other places (this part is very important)"
 rila.3.a:0 "Absolute morons!"
 
 rila.4.t:0 "The Duke Criticized"
 rila.4.d:0 "placeholder: newspapers called 'Nouveau Demain' criticises the Duke horribly"
 rila.4.a:0 "Imprison the writers."
 rila.4.b:0 "And?"
 rila.5.t:0 "What is Has Always Been"
 rila.5.d:0 "placeholder: imprisoning the writers made the newspapers correct, griffons are angry at the duke, extremist enragés gained more support"
 rila.5.a:0 "Alright."
 rila.6.t:0 "Inflame or Enlighten"
 rila.6.d:0 "placeholder: original newspapers writers received large backlash from the common griff, calling the writers enragés, foolish and just power-hungry themselves"
 rila.6.a:0 "Outplayed."
 
 rila.7.t:0 "The Duke is a Buffoon!" #placeholder: a play is getting popular in Rila, mocking the nobility and the duke in an exaggerated fashion, calls Michel a buffoon, Moriset a nitwit, Dennis a debaucher, Gadiffer callow and Vivienne a whore (oof), how will Michel react?
 rila.7.d:0 "Michel sat at his desk in the royal palace, reading over the script in front of him. It was a scathing mockery of him and his family, but more than anything something stuck out.\n\n"They called my niece a what?" Michel said.\n\n"A wench, sir." replied the head of the Chouette in Rila, Arnaud Zéopolde. "Or more specifically," he points to the part in the script, "A lusty Fezeran maid."\n\nMichel sat stupified. He didn't mind the criticism of himself, he had tougher skin than that. Nor did he really mind the criticism of his brother. But Vivienne and Gadiffier also? Why would they go after those who didn't even play a stake in their lives? Michel stood up and paced around the room, he had to respond in some way to this, did he not? It would probably be better to let it die off, but how dare they insult his niece!\n\n"Michel," Arnaud said. Michel looked up from his pacing and turned to the Intelligence chief, "Why don't you speak to it? Your gift with words is strong, and I'm sure you could use this to your advantage." Michel nodded, "I will need to think about this further, but I think I shall...""
 rila.7.a:0 "Ignore it, the trend will die off."
 rila.7.b:0 "Open up a few reservations at the Bastille."
 rila.7.c:0 "Speak to the masses."
 rila.8.t:0 "The Duke, Still a Buffoon"
 rila.8.d:0 "placeholder: the play is stil circulating, griffons enjoy it, though most griffons don't associate it with the Discrets anymore, some still do"
 rila.8.a:0 "Mhm."
 rila.9.t:0 "Actually, the Duke is a Tyrant"
 rila.9.d:0 "placeholder: michel imprisoned the writers and players of the play, griffons see it as censorship and a declaration of war on free speech"
 rila.9.a:0 "Play stupid games, get stupid rewards."
 rila.10.t:0 "Duke Michel 'the Flamboyant' Discret" #placeholder: Michel speaks to the common griff, laughing at the play, though only to mock how badly it is written, how it lacks finesse, talent, skill, etc... basically, he roasts the writers and players and he becomes wildly popular for the moment while the extremists reeee in silence
 rila.10.d:0 "Early in the morning, nearby the Royal Palace in Rila, a crowd of citizens watched a professional performance of "La moquerie des discrets", "The mocking of the Discrets". The play that insulted the ruling dynasty of Aquelia, and specifically the Duc de Rila. This performance, however, was much larger than most that had come before it, and featured a more complete cast and set. As the play went on griffons laughed and hooted as they normally would, and the play ended as many had before it. But as the crowd finished clapping, one griffon kept going. And he began to walk to the front of the ramshackle "theatre".\n\n"Merveilleux! Merveilleux!" Michel called out as he went before the assembled griffons. "This play made my day quite a lot brighter!" The gathered griffons began to look about nervously, unsure what was happening. "I know it's a surprise to see me here. But I just had to see this play for my own eyes. And I can tell you, it was every bit as badly written as I thought." Michel began to laugh lightheartedly, and some in the crowd joined in. "I mean, did you see how fat they tried to make me look? They aren't even trying to write a good play here. It's just "corruption" this, "debauchery" that. I could write something more entertaining in my sleep! The characters were just boring, there was no drama whatsoever, and they didn't even care enough to write accompanying music!"\n\nBy now most of the crowd was laughing with his impromptu comedy bit, and they had forgotten most of the play they had just seen. Michel continued on, "I could go on for a while about how whoever wrote this lacks finesse, talent, skill, and all other manner of things, but I think if I talk for any longer, I'll get something thrown at me by some radical."\n\nMichel takes off upon his wings and says to the crowd, "Bonne journée, everyone! And I hope next time you have better taste in plays!""
 rila.10.a:0 "Oops, was I too harsh?"
 
 rila.11.t:0 "Do You Hear the People Sing?"
 rila.11.d:0 "placeholder: young griffons get to the street and break into songs, singing songs about tomorrow, freedom and prosperity (instead of the usual kill the fat ones, death to tyrants, republican blood songs), the entire afternoon until late evening they sing, marching towards the palace, once arrived they keep on singing, Michel gets out on his balcony to watch the crowd sing, he applauds everytime they finish a song. It keeps going until everyone's tired and go home"
 rila.11.a:0 "What a cheerful moment amidst these chaotic times."
 
 rila.12.t:0 "Sir Michel, is the Revolution Good or Bad?"
 rila.12.d:0 "placeholder: riverlands mare travelled to Aquileia to write about the politics and revolutions of Griffonia, she wants to personally see Michel so when Michel heard about that he said yes, they meet at the palace that she remarked as grandiose and ask him questions, one of the questions is basically how does Michel see the revolution: good or bad? Saying good will reward the player though will enrage the nobles and his court"
 rila.12.a:0 "It's the correct step we all need to take."
 rila.12.b:0 "...I'd rather not comment on it."
 rila.13.t:0 "The Duke Supports It"
 rila.13.d:0 "placeholder: it's confirmed, the Duke is in favor of the revolution, basically say how his interactions will the mare has made it to the press a week later and is published, this brought the duke more support from the people but his court is angry at him"
 rila.13.a:0 "Interesting mare, why does she care about us, though?"
 rila.14.t:0 "The Duke Remains Silent"
 rila.14.d:0 "placeholder: duke remains silent on the idea of revolution, some take it as his disdain for freedom and civil rights, he is disappointed and regrets not saying that he supports the revolution, but his court and nobles make him feel better"
 rila.14.a:0 "Damn it."
 
 rila.15.t:0 "Minister Gaudroit's Act"
 rila.15.d:0 "placeholder: Gaudroit is the Minister of Finances, he didn't tell Michel anything, but he passed an act without his consent to Michel's outrage, until he learns that it benefited the lives of many griffons and that he said Michel was responsible for the act, making the Duke incredibility popular for a moment. Please make sure to tell that Gaudroit and Michel are close childhood friends and that he was Minister since Michel ruled Rila"
 rila.15.a:0 "Gaudroit, you have my thanks."
 
 rila.16.t:0 "Legerdemain"
 rila.16.d:0 "Change was in the air... and Michel could see it. The steam that rose off of the breaths of the intellectuals that debated in the saloons of Rila, the fires where radicals burned pictures of the King, and some of him as well, and lastly his own tea cup, as he stood overlooking his city. It had snowed the previous night, and when it snowed he was able to get out of his palace. He loved the building dearly, and all the statues of himself were very flattering of course, but he had to understand how his people thought and lived. But last night was different, he saw seething anger amongst many of the people in the streets. This would not just be a season of discontent for the land, it may well turn into a season of revolution. He glanced over to the portrait of his brother the King hanging on the wall, eyes of steel stared down at him and he grimaced. He knew his brother could never handle what was to come, he had too much of a wrothful claw when it came to dissent. Berthelot may have reclaimed the Kingdom following the first revolution, but he could not reclaim the hearts and minds of the people.\n\nMichel took another look at his teacup and drank. If the King could not calm the hearts of the people then who would? Those revolutionaries have some competent leaders, Théodore Vérany, and that bloke Queymar even... but they also had the likes of Adrien Desnaux. They could never be the calm wing needed to nurture Aquileia through this crisis.\n\nPutting down his cup Michel began to pace. The King’s men had failed to restore order in Rila, he decided, revolution would come to his city. Now he just needed to know what side he wished to be on. Michel deeply cared for his people, and he knew many cared just as deeply for him.\n\nAnd then he made his choice\n\nMichel went to his daughter Agnès’ bedroom, a gentle soul of thirteen years, whom Michel loved dearly. When her father entered Agnès looked up from the drawing she was making and smiled. Michel hugged the girl and then asked, “Darling, could you show me some of your amazing sewing?” Agnès was more than happy at this request, but the paused and asked, “Of course! But umm... what would you want me to make?” At this Michel scratched his beak and then made his choice.\n\”I would like a new flag, to go along with my new nation.""
 rila.16.a:0 "To a new tomorrow."
 
 rila.17.t:0 "Café Tourné's Boils"
 rila.17.d:0 "placeholder: café tourné is one of the main places of debate in all of rila, today there were alot of important figures debating in it, moderates, extremists and progressives all debated in a flashy but reserved fashion, the crowd was mostly impressed by the arguments from...(pick and answer here)"
 rila.17.a:0 "...the radicals are gonna make Aquileia whole."
 rila.17.b:0 "...the moderates know the line between sanity and fury."
 rila.17.c:0 "...the progressives are the future."
 rila.17.e:0 "...What? These revolutionaries are crazy!"
 
 rila.18.t:0 "A Basket of Solitude"
 rila.18.d:0 "placeholder: less food is present at the market, a group starts arguing against a merchant, saying he hoards food and hides them, attracting a large crowd (see some kind of pattern here?), crowd starts meddling in, and it turns into a political debate, some saying that markets should be abolished, instead making sure that the state provides for everyone... etc, each side gets something to say"
 rila.18.a:0 "We grow tired of this, we must support Adrien Desnaux!"
 rila.18.b:0 "In time, the state will make sure we are all taken care of."
 rila.18.c:0 "We can achieve prosperity once everyone knows what's at stake, the Progressives are the only sane!"
 rila.18.e:0 "...I'm just going to leave these fools alone."
 
 rila.19.t:0 "Ballet of the Bread"
 rila.19.d:0 "placeholder: price of bread goes up, many of the poor have trouble even affording it, this evolves into a large protest (largest of the month so far) of people demanding rights and food, while crying out loud that the richest are still stuffing themselves with meat, the rallying cry of the march so far has been..."

 rila.20.d:0 "placeholder: Pélis protests with their biggest protest yet, they march towards the gate of the city, planning on to march all the way up to Rila to have their voices heard by the Committee, but they're stopped by Revolutionary Guards at the gate of the city, the crowd grows restless, they wish to pass, the guards ready their cannons, they're scared, shaky, and fear the crowd, but knowing they have orders, they're unsure of what to do next..."
 rila.20.a:0 "They fire their cannons at the crowd."

 rila.22.a:0 "Disaster Avoided."
 
 rila.23.t:0 "Silk and Destroy"
 rila.23.d:0 "placeholder: lack of funds, idols, whatever, basically there's nothing supporting Rila's silk industry located in Meshorio, and especially since it's literally right next to the Aquileian border. The people there are scared, paranoid even, they dump crates of materials into the river, burn lots of royalist clothings and silk (yeah they're pretty stupid) in huge bonfires."
 rila.23.a:0 "Send them funds, and guns for the police there too."
 rila.23.b:0 "Send them funds, that's it."
 rila.23.c:0 "Their paranoia will die down."
 rila.24.t:0 "Meshorio Calms Down"
 rila.24.d:0 "placeholder: the city's people calms down, they've been put at ease and the funds aided the local industry, try not to mention the guns since this is an event for both the first and second option"
 rila.24.a:0 "Good."
 rila.25.t:0 "Meshorio Grumbles"
 rila.25.d:0 "The city's not very happy, but so far the crowd calmed down, no more bonfires in the streets and the people there are trying to find a way to continue the silk industry"
 rila.25.a:0 "We're all needy in this trying times, but we'll all make it."
 
 rila.26.t:0 "The Attainted One"
 rila.26.d:0 "placeholder: the extremist from the café debate event, he's won that aforementioned debate and impressed the crowd, now a few weeks (maybe months?) later he is currently in the street talking to crowds, using his charisma to push the radical mindset so to get the people to support the cocardiers, however while he is finishing his speech, he is shot in plain sight by a cloaked griffon, and he falls down on the ground, dead.

 rila.29.t:0 "The Attainted One"
 rila.29.d:0 "placeholder: café tourné is bombed by unknown griffons in the night, morning came and nearby griffons witnessed the destroyed and notwithstanding café, as if it was stormed by an angry mob of exploding birds (angry birds, heh), some citizens check out inside and find the owner of the café with the neck slit while sleeping"

 rila.30.t:0 "”We're feasting on a lord~ today!”"
 rila.30.d:0 "placeholder: the lack of good, fresh produce in Rila is angering the easily infuriated peeps, they sing songs about how they're gonna eat the rich, and show that anyone who's eating fresh produce is a traitor to the revolution, they've already stormed a few houses under this reasoning"

 rila.32.t:0 "A Hymn For Our Revolution"
 rila.32.d:0 "placeholder: we must choose a hymn/anthem for the revolution, there are four very popular chants that people sing everyday, but they all have a little bit of bias in them, divide the rest of the event into different paragraphs for each hymn: La Marseillaise (Le Pélisier) is a very popular chant amongst everyone, but is favoured by the extremists due to its violent and triumphant nature, but lots of people adore it nonetheless - Ah ça ira (Ah, it'll be gone/Ah, it'll be alright (multiple interpretations)) is also popular and is favoured by the moderate socialists, seeing as how in the chant it calls for hanging aristocrats on lamps, it's energetic and very popular amongst those that work hard and is commonly used as a song to pass the time - La Prise de la Bastille (The Takeover of the Bastille) is popular amongst Progressives, but is lesser known than the rest, it commemorates one of the revolutionaries' greatest victory without being too violent or distasteful, in fact, the rythm is very cheery and joyful - Le Chant du Départ (Song of Departure) is a song commonly associated with Michel's supporters, it talks of victory and triumph, without going down the violence hole, it calls Aquileia invincible and their neighbors (wingbardy and herzlanders) oppressors and tyrants"
 rila.32.a:0 "Le Pélisier is the incarnation of Rilan spirit."
 rila.32.b:0 "Ah ça ira, it's the embodiment of how everyone should be."
 rila.32.c:0 "The Bastille one, we don't want our descendants to see us as bloodthirsty murderers."

 rila.33.t:0 "Empty Docks in Empty Cities"
 rila.33.d:0 "placeholder: the docks of pélis are more empty than usual, it's because the crowd that was shot infront of the gate either returned home, barricaded themselves in narrow streets or simply died, there's an eerie atmosphere in the city, some griffons from Rila even calling it a 'ghost city'"
 rila.33.a:0 "Our Darkest Hour."
 rila.34.t:0 "Empty Docks in Empty Cities"
 rila.34.d:0 "placeholder: the docks of pélis were empty, now not anymore, the pélis crowd that just went to Rila returned with answers, gifts and many more things, yeah they're happy and the city is full of life again"

 rila.37.d:0 "placeholder: too lazy to finish: Born out of spite for the nobility and famine. This violent brand of revolutionary activism first became popular in 978, mere months after the defeat of Herzlander Republicans. Encouraged by the unequality and hardship the common people suffered, many griffons came together and founded one of the most influential political clubs in this region of Griffonia: the Club Patriote. United in their beliefs of anti-monarchism and staunch republicanism with what some people would call 'radical extremist' characteristics, the Club Patriote quickly dominated both the political and military scene in Rila and its surrounding countryside with their charismatic leaders and the help of revolutionary militiagriffs, commonly known as the 'sans-culottes'.\n\nWhen the Revolution of 980 rolled out, the Club Patriote, by now a significant portion of the Committee of Public Safety, rapidly attempted to cement its place as the leading club in Rila, but with the rapid expansion of republican and liberal ideals the Revolution caused, other non-extremist clubs came together in an attempt to oppose the violent and 'Enragé' regime the Club Patriote wanted to put in place, leading to a turbulent tug of war between dozens of different revolutionary clubs. The continuity of the local Rilan Revolution was only saved by the arrival of nearby revolutionary armies from Aquila, who defeated a rapidly-growing royalist army in the outskirt of Rila. Entering the city and parading through the streets, the Aquilan armies were instantly considered as the legitimate revolutionary government by the city's people.\n\nWith the Rilan revolutionary clubs humiliated and the legitimacy of the Aquilan republicans cemented, the Club Patriote's influence quickly diminished, allowing the rise of other school of thoughts and revolutionary clubs in Rila, such as the Club des Progressistes or the Moderate Socialist ones. Over time, the Club Patriote, the indisputed flagship of Rilan radicalism, had its eroding influence even overshadowed by the ones of other formerly smaller clubs, such as the Fanal or Club des Haies, though the most important one to rise out of the Club Patriote's ashes would be the Cocardiers.\n\nMore violent, more radical and much more open about their thoughts and plans for the Aquileian Republic, the Cocardiers attracted many similarly-minded griffons over the course of the First Aquileian Republic, though their growing influence was kept in check by Vérany's central government, they looked like they were about to get a significant supporter base until Maréchal Berthelot's counter-revolution.\n\nWith the revolutionaries' main organisation in flames, the Cocardiers were the ones that rallied the local Rilan revolutionaries (too lazy to finish, better things to do, ping NCBlizzard for more info)"

 ### leader descriptions ###
 committee_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Committee of Public Safety, originally founded in 979 by several radical and moderate clubs as a local political council supposed to guide the Aquileian revolution, was the main governing body of what used to be the Rilan Revolutionary Front before its eventual downfall at the hands of both internal unrest, and the royalists; badly beaten and humiliated, those revolutionaries that managed to flee the royalist reign of terror eventually went into hiding and scattered themselves in the countryside, but those rare few that stayed behind to uphold the legacy of the Rilan Revolutionary spirit eventually managed to regroup and reform the committee as an underground, clandestine group.\n\nThanks to the efforts of the more resourceful members of this group, the Committee has managed to reorganize itself and even set up a secret assembly in the mansion of a noble who has republican leanings, with its policies and activities spearheaded by the radical enragés known as the Cocardiers, the newly reformed Committee of Public Safety quickly attracted many political activists hailing from all types of backgrounds.\n\nHowever, the Committee still includes many of the problems that previously plagued it during the Revolution, such as intense disagreements between the more radical and progressive clubs of the Committee."

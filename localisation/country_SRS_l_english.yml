#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be re-elected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are responsible for representing the opinions of their electorates they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by preventing the formation of a politican caste.\n\nAlthough the General Congress is sometimes inefficient due to its delegates all being amateurs at statecraft, the Congress can proudly lay claim to being one of the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and perhaps in the entire world as well."
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
PROUDPONE_NAME_DESC:0 "Pierre Ponehon was born in Prance, Equestria, but left his overbearing family at an early age to travel the world. In Griffonia, he got tangled up with the revolutionaries and while initially a mercenary, he adopted the ideals of socialism swiftly and eagerly, even publishing some writings about an own more radical form of anarchist socialism.\n\nHe'll ask Maar for help before he asks Boreas and would serve Nightmare Moon before Celestia: whoever fights the powers that be in the world he will gladly support. After the failed revolution and the flight north he departed to aid other socialist movements around the world. These have included Stalliongrad, Longsword and the Brodfeld Revolutionaries and no matter where he has gone, he has only been more convinced of the need to send the old order crashing down."
GOLDGRIFF_NAME_DESC:0 "Born in Nova Griffonia in 946 as the daughter of a dockworker, Emma Goldgriff was introduced to the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion at an early age and spent some time in Stalliongrad during her younger years. During the revolution of 978 she was already a published author and participated eagerly in the struggle, as well as the retreat.\n\nInstead of remaining in Skynavia, however, she departed after the founding of the socialist republic as she felt she could not sit idly in the north and just write. Since then, she had travelled the world - often undercover - as an author and agitator. She especially has taken an interest in the social aspects of the revolution and is as comfortable leading partisans as she is arguing for revised social norms. "
BEAKUNIN_NAME_DESC:0 "Beakunin is one of the oldest and most influential of the griffonian revolutionaries, called a "father of the revolution" by many of his supporters. Born in the Heartlands of the Griffonian empire, Beakunin was in Equestria on a business trip during the early 950s when he met the legendary Caramel Marks. The sharp-witted young griffon caught Caramel Marks' attention and Beakunin was a quick and attentive learner. He was, however, not a very orthodox student and clashed ceaselessly with the old pony on matters of ideology and method. During the griffonian revolution he was one of the most important leaders and, along with Sickleclaw, was the leader during the retreat north.\n\nHe departed when it was clear the Skynavian Socialist Republic would focus on rebuilding and recovering rather than pursue the expansion of the Socialist Revolution worldwide, and has since then helped train and organize revolutionaries wherever needed. He may be in his eighties, but he will not stop as long as he can move."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

#### IDEAS ####
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

They may care little about the Congress, but we must care for them as our kin. We must further liberalise the Congress, and Skynavian society in general, so that all may participate."
SRS_war_tree:0 "The War in the North"
SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the backwards Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters. Something must be done to put an end to this meaningless conflict."
SRS_war_1:0 "Galvanise Our Soldiers"
SRS_war_1_desc:0 "We need to rally our friends and family on the home front in order to support our fighters slugging it out with the backwards ponies in the frozen wastes."
SRS_war_2:0 "Galvanise Our Enemies"
SRS_war_2_desc:0 "The ponies we are fighting against are members of an oppressed social group, misled into dying for their tribal leaders. We should send a delegation to try and negotiate an end to the conflict with the Northern Tribes, or failing that, instigate the commoner ponies into rebellion."
SRS_war_3:0 "Ending the Conflict"
SRS_war_3_desc:0 "The Northern Tribes are no more. Having freed the tribesponies from their shackles, we must now allow them their freedom to rebuild and remould their society in the socialist image. Of course, we will be there to help them through this difficult transition."
SRS_war_4:0 "From the Ashes of Tribalism..."
SRS_war_4_desc:0 "We have the responsibility to share with our comrades up north all our technological prowess, so they too may benefit, as our brothers and sisters in the revolutionary cause, from the fruits of socialist progress."
SRS_war_5:0 "The Sister Republic Arises!"
SRS_war_5_desc:0 "At the culmination of a great deal of hard work, perseverance, and sacrifice, both on our part and by our pony brethren up north, we have succeeded in developing the territories of the former Northern Tribes through the doctrine of socialism. By democratic vote, the Far Northern Republic shall be established to herald a new era of socialism in the North!"
SRS_military_tree:0 "The Skynavian People's Army"
SRS_military_tree_desc:0 "That the army of Skynavia belongs to the people is indisputable. Already, the most talented commanders of our volunteer militias have developed various tactics suited for the decentralised light-infantry formations of the People's Army for guerrilla fighting in arctic weather conditions."
SRS_military_1:0 "Autonomous People's Militias"
SRS_military_1_desc:0 "Further doctrinal and organisational development of the system of autonomous communal militias will best serve the interests of the Skynavian people."
SRS_military_2:0 "Proletarian Revolutionary Guard"
SRS_military_2_desc:0 "How will we be able to export the revolution when we lack the military means to do so? The Proletarian Revolutionary Guard will be formed in order to protect and advance the interests of the International Socialist Revolution, at home and abroad."
SRS_military_3:0 "Armouries of the People"
SRS_military_3_desc:0 "We must cement the control of the people over the means of self-defence, so they will be able to protect their homes against foreign invasion should the occasion arise."
SRS_military_4:0 "Popular Control of the Military"
SRS_military_4_desc:0 "The military must remain subordinate to the will of the people if the ideals of democratic socialism are to be preserved throughout all aspects of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia. A horizontalised command structure will be integral to preserving democracy both within and outside of the military."
SRS_military_5:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
SRS_military_5_desc:0 "Discipline is the glue that holds the military together. The militias of the communes can enjoy their autonomy, but the powers of the military high command must be strengthened if we want to fight and win in the revolutionary struggle to come."
SRS_military_a:0 "The Strong Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_a_desc:0 "The advent of armoured tank combat taking place on Equus and Griffonia heralds the beginning of a new age of warfare. The potency of this new aspect of war should not be overlooked, and hence we must pursue development immediately."
SRS_military_b:0 "The Long Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_b_desc:0 "Socialism on the High Seas! The socialist revolution shall take to the waves in order to liberate the proletariat of the nations across the ocean in Equus. More importantly, a navy allows us to keep our coastline safe and defend our home from seaborne invasion."
SRS_industry_tree:0 "Consolidate the Means of Production"
SRS_industry_tree_desc:0 "In Skynavia, there are no bosses or capitalists, and the people work for the betterment of society, and of each other, under no coercion or forced labour. The means of production are already in the possession of the proletariat, and so we can now focus on a measured and sustainable industrialisation that centres the wellbeing of the people as the goal of progress."
SRS_industry_1:0 "Autonomous Cooperatives"
SRS_industry_1_desc:0 "The first thing we should do is to formalise the status of the many autonomous cooperatives found all across Skynavia. While the management structure, scope, and scale of these cooperatives vary greatly, they are all united in their egalitarian approach to producing value out of their labour."
SRS_industry_2:0 "Independent Workers' Councils"
SRS_industry_2_desc:0 "The concept of workers' councils may be a holdover from when labour was still controlled by the capitalists, but these councils still serve an invaluable function to Skynavian democracy by allowing for an independent grassroots organisation of the masses."
SRS_industry_3:0 "By the People, For the People, Of the People"
SRS_industry_3_desc:0 "There is little sense to maintain the concept of private ownership over land, considering the lack of capitalist predation on the livelihoods of the proletariat in Skynavian society. We should encourage and propagate the idea of the public's shared responsibility to maintain and make use of the land in the communities, for the common good."
SRS_industry_4:0 "Feeding the People"
SRS_industry_4_desc:0 "The icy tundras making up most of Skynavia are hardly suited to agriculture. But by working together and applying agrarian socialist concepts to the development of arable land, the spirit of solidarity and perseverance shall soon allow us to achieve a hard-earned autarky."
SRS_industry_5:0 "Educating the People"
SRS_industry_5_desc:0 "By creating a network of communal schools, forming an organisation of travelling specialists, and writing up new school curriculums that allow for greater freedom and personal development, we will soon be able to bring education to the people of Skynavia efficiently and on a large scale."
SRS_industry_a:0 "Arming the People"
SRS_industry_a_desc:0 "Attention should be paid to the construction of communal armouries and gunsmiths, so each community, collective, and commune within Skynavia will each be capable of protecting their homes themselves."
SRS_industry_b:0 "Nurturing the People"
SRS_industry_b_desc:0 "The development gap between the urbanised areas of New Skynavia and the independent communes filling up the rest of Skynavia must be addressed. Groups of volunteers from the city, bringing with them their expertise, as well as all sorts of machinery and raw material, shall pursue intensive development within the communes dotting the banks of the Skynavia river delta."
SRS_diplomacy_tree:0 "Socialism In Our Time"
SRS_diplomacy_tree_desc:0 "It is essential for all the socialist nations of the world to be united in our shared fight for the international revolution and the liberation of our oppressed comrades abroad. By sending delegates to socialist nations abroad, we will take the first step in creating the bonds of brotherhood between the free nations of the world."
SRS_diplomacy_1:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
SRS_diplomacy_1_desc:0 "The benevolence of the monarchist rule in Vedina does not hide the fact that it is still an instrument of class oppression that has created and actively maintains an unjust status quo. We must decide now on how to intervene in Vedina to liberate its proletariat from the shackles of feudalism and monarchism."
SRS_diplomacy_2:0 "Our Comrades in Need"
SRS_diplomacy_2_desc:0 "Decades ago, we had split with the Republicans in Cloudbury over their refusal to share power with the people they profess to be liberating. Their centralisation of power within an exclusive cadre of the military cost them the support of the people, contributing to the failure of the First Griffonian Revolution. We must reclaim the revolutionary ideal for the proletariat!"
SRS_diplomacy_3:0 "Internationalist Brigades"
SRS_diplomacy_3_desc:0 "Both sides of the Congress have agreed on a policy where foreign fighters for the revolutionary socialist cause are to be welcomed to Skynavia as fellow comrades and brothers in arms. These volunteers will fight in our Internationalist Brigades. The first of these Brigades to be created will be the Lions of Skynavia, formed by the hardened veterans of many a socialist insurrection abroad."
SRS_diplomacy_4:0 "Friendship of Species"
SRS_diplomacy_4_desc:0 "Taking the concept of the Internationalist Brigades to the next level, we will now start recruiting revolutionaries of different races from Equus and Griffonia, allowing them to fight in specialist units that make the best out of the physical advantages of their respective races."
SRS_diplomacy_5:0 "Welcome the Exiles"
SRS_diplomacy_5_desc:0 "Three prominent revolutionaries - Emma Goldgriff, Mikhail Beakunin, and Pierre Ponehon - once departed from the Socialist Republic of Skynavia a long time ago, citing the lack of action to liberate the oppressed of our neighbouring countries. Now that we have accomplished what seemed impossible a few decades ago, we can invite our exiled comrades back home."

SRS_peace_and_plenty:0 "§HThe Land of Peace And Plenty§!"
SRS_peace_and_plenty_desc:0 "With the culmination of our democratically-driven industrialisation, our Skynavia is slowly and surely transitioning into a socialist utopia. The internationalists and communalists may have their differences, but in the end we have learnt to work together in the spirit of true socialist solidarity and brotherhood. In Skynavia, we are all brothers and sisters in our great socialist family."
SRS_look_to_the_stars:0 "§HLooking to the Stars§!"
SRS_look_to_the_stars_desc:0 "For millennia, griffons have looked up at the night sky, admiring the beauty of the stars. The ponies in Equus may worship the Sun and Moon with a quasi-religious fervour, but to the atheistic griffons of Skynavia, it is the prospect of reaching the distant stars that resonates most deeply with the revolutionaries; after all, this too is but another fantastical dream waiting to be realised."
SRS_a_united_griffonia:0 "§HOne Griffonia Under Socialism§!"
SRS_a_united_griffonia_desc:0 "Our recent successes in promoting the socialist cause abroad have proved that our revolutionary ideal of international socialism is bearing fruit. We must take this concept further, aiming to finally bring closure to the long-held fixation shared by griffon socialists all around the world - §Yone Pan-Griffonia, united under the socialist banner§!."
SRS_the_magic_of_socialism:0 "Socialist Magic"
SRS_the_magic_of_socialism_desc:0 "For most of history, magic has been the preserve of the bourgeoisie. In ancient Equus, the unicorns were the ruling class for centuries, dominating other races through their magic. Even today, the fruits of enchantment magic remain available only to the richest of Griffonia. Now, we shall free the supernatural forces of magic from the machinery of capitalism, making it accessible to all who desire it."

SRS_purge_1:0 "§RSocialism has Failed us§!"
SRS_purge_1_desc:0 "The failure of the socialist leadership to guide our nation through the hardships of war has left the population thoroughly disillusioned with the Republic's founding dream of a socialist utopia. This gives us breathing space to consolidate our power. However, the much of the nation's youth have only known a life under socialism, and our power grab may soon backfire if we fail to pacify the people..."
SRS_purge_2a:0 "Learning to live as Individuals"
SRS_purge_2a_desc:0 "For too long the spirit of the Skynavian individual has been suppressed by the stifling collectivism of socialist ideology. The people of our nation need to be retaught how to live as individuals, freed from the rigid conformism of such false concepts as "solidarity" and "mutual aid"."
SRS_purge_2b:0 "Work Camps"
SRS_purge_2b_desc:0 "For the most vocal of the dissidents against our regime, as well as those irrevocably tainted by their association with the socialist ruling apparatus - activists, Congressional delegates, teachers, philosophers, and community leaders - there is no option but to resign their fates to the work camps, where they may perhaps see the error of their ways through the virtues of hard labour."
SRS_purge_2c:0 "Labour Units"
SRS_purge_2c_desc:0 "To supplant the failed socialist system of workers' cooperatives and collectives, a system will be implement where individuals are grouped, according to their physical ability, geographical proximity, and other factors, into Labour Units where the social functions of work, sustenance, and community all take place within the Unit."
SRS_purge_3a:0 "Army Decimations"
SRS_purge_3a_desc:0 "The infusion of political ideology into military doctrine enforced by the socialist regime has led to the stagnation of our armed forces. To break free from the spinelessness of the old military, we will unfortunately have to rid ourselves of the officers and theorists, as well as those rank-and-file, clinging onto the old ways. A tenth of all personnel will be liquidated."
SRS_purge_3b:0 "Decentralised Fear"
SRS_purge_3b_desc:0 "To further hammer in the finality of our split from socialism into the public consciousness, we will initiate an extensive program of undercover policing and surveilance. Furthermore, various incentives will be introduced for those who inform on their neighours and acquaintances for socialist behaviour. The populace shall redeem themselves from the socialist scourge forthwith."
SRS_purge_4a:0 "Martial Law in Perpetuality"
SRS_purge_4a_desc:0 "The linchpin of our plan to consolidate power is the indefinite extension of the current state of martial law. The most ideologically-pure sections of the armed forces shall be given extensive judicial and governmental authority over civil society, which will hopefully keep the degenerates, thought-traitors, and subversives within our nation in line."
SRS_purge_4b:0 "Overhaul the Education System"
SRS_purge_4b_desc:0 "Education is the tool through which we nurture the next generation of Skynavians. A complete overhaul of our nation's curriculum to excise all socialist influences is imperative to the survival of the regime. Emphasis will be placed on the infusion of values such as order, discipline, and obedience to the state in our students."
SRS_purge_4c:0 "Destroy Subversive Literature"
SRS_purge_4c_desc:0 "The tools through which socialism has infected the minds of the populace is through the media. Censorship will be applied to radio and newspaper, but our attention will mainly be focused on the destruction of subversive and degenerate literature. We shall start by emptying out all the libraries of Skynavia and purging all reading material and associated media compromised by socialist thought."

SRS_commune_1:0 "Picking up the Pieces"
SRS_commune_1_desc:0 "The dream of a socialist utopia in Skynavia was shattered with the persecution and decimation its chief progenitor, the United Socialist Revolutionary Front, by the military junta. But although they once stood idly by as the socialism that nurtured them was trodden into the dirt, the people of Skynavia rallied and reclaimed their home from the forces of reaction. Now, we rebuild what we have lost."
SRS_commune_2a:0 "Dissolving the Army"
SRS_commune_2a_desc:0 "It was the so-called People's Army that aided and abetted Sickleclaw's power grab. They have betrayed the Skynavian people and the international Socialist cause. Traitors that they are, the Army shall be disbanded, the battalions dissolved and their weapons and equipment redistributed, with the Skynavian communes all responsible for their own self-defence. Militarism's taint shall exist no more."
SRS_commune_2b:0 "Exiling the Commanders"
SRS_commune_2b_desc:0 "The Army may have been the main tool of Sickleclaw's oppression, but the fact remains that it was under the leadership of their commanders that they were turned to serve the forces of reaction. The moral culpability for the Army's wrongdoing thus lies with their commanders as well. They shall be exiled for their treacherous crimes, never again allowed to set their paws on Skynavian soil."
SRS_commune_2c:0 "Swords into Ploughshares"
SRS_commune_2c_desc:0 "Life under martial law and military oppression has left Skynavia with a bitter distaste towards all militarism. It is inherently undemocratic and unjust for any creature to have control over the life and death of their neighbour through force of arms. Therefore we will seek to demilitarise Skynavia, so that we may live in peace."
SRS_commune_3a:0 "To Each Their Own"
SRS_commune_3a_desc:0 "Who are we, and what right do we have, as the General Congress, to tell the people of Skynavia what do do, which goods to manufacture, who they should die for? Decrees from the Congress are no longer binding to the autonomous communes of Skynavia, who are free to pursue their own policies. The democracy of the people shall be secure!"
SRS_commune_3b:0 "Laws Unto Themselves"
SRS_commune_3b_desc:0 "No longer can we consciously expropriate the hard-earned fruits of the labour of our people, not even in the name of collectivism. Our workers shall have a greatly expanded say in the use of the goods they produce. Of course, basic necessities shall remain free and available to all who desire them, and this is understood by everyone."
SRS_the_final_focus:0 "Finally, Peace"
SRS_the_final_focus_desc:0 "The traumas of military rule has left Skynavian society scarred and battered, but we have emerged from that dark period stronger and more united than ever. Having had our rights taken from us, we now know to cherish our freedoms and liberties more than ever, and shall protect them so that all may thrive under a new and freer age of Skynavian libertarian socialism."

SRS_commonwealth_final:0 "A Better World in Birth"
SRS_commonwealth_final_desc:0 "We have done it.\n\nAll of Griffonkind, finally, will be able to live as free creatures under the banner of Socialism. It may had taken us decades of unending struggle, but the final triumph of Socialism was never in doubt. The future of our Utopia has been secured. And now - we celebrate!"
SRS_commonwealth_2a:0 "The Soldiers' Revolution"
SRS_commonwealth_2a_desc:0 "Ponehon has - somewhat forcefully - reminded the congress of the need for more democracy even within the armed forces. None is saying that votes should be cast in the heat of battle, but the soldiers who fight alongside each other deserve a say in who leads them and in where they are sent; our soldiers are comrades, not tools."
SRS_commonwealth_2b:0 "The Scientists' Revolution"
SRS_commonwealth_2b_desc:0 "The Capitalists, given the chance, would have preferred to have the great minds of our world locked up in their laboratories to obediently produce results to be monetized. No longer! It is time to let the scientists and scholars be heard!"
SRS_commonwealth_2c:0 "The Peasants' Revolution"
SRS_commonwealth_2c_desc:0 "The peasants have been oppressed since before even the founding of socialism. It will behoove us to remember them and to usher in a new age for them as well. It is time to let land be owned by those who work it, and as we all own together, we all work together."
SRS_commonwealth_2d:0 "The Workers' Revolution"
SRS_commonwealth_2d_desc:0 "To the song of pistons and engines our society marches forward not by whipping and breaking those who stand on the factory floor, or in the dockyards, or among the smelters, but by making sure they are provided for and never lose their voice or ability to stand; neither physically nor figuratively." 
SRS_commonwealth_starting:0 "A Pan-Griffonian Constitution"
SRS_commonwealth_starting_desc:0 "The peoples of Griffonia are diverse and varied, all with their own unique languages, culture, and traditions. A single one-size-fits-all constitution would be restrictive and inherently inegalitarian as a result, but we can still create a loose set of rules, under which all of Griffonkind can live in socialism and harmony."

SRS_commonwealth_special_1_a_desc:0 "We've built the nation ever since its birth\nWe prepare its plots and we plow its earth\nWe reap the bounties from the golden fields\nFrom forests and seas we harvest their yields."
SRS_commonwealth_special_1_b:0 "The Engines of Progress"
SRS_commonwealth_special_1_b_desc:0 "One of the classic hypocrisies of capitalism is the claim of equal opportunity. How does a fisherpony in the far north have the same chances as an Aquileian businessgriff? One of the greatest challenges for our union will be to eradicate these differences as we bind the Commonwealth together by railroad, by schools and by prosperity."
SRS_commonwealth_special_1_c:0 "Socialism and the World Around Us"
SRS_commonwealth_special_1_c_desc:0 "Until this point, we have had to make distasteful choices to be able to carry on the struggle. Now, however, we are freed of this burden. It is time to take a good long look at how we have treated the world around us and what damages may have been caused. We do not own the world after all, we borrow it from our children."
SRS_commonwealth_special_2_a:0 "Scientific Socialism for a Scientific Society"
SRS_commonwealth_special_2_a_desc:0 "We are attempting something never before seen; the construction of a new type of society. In doing so, we must be open to new ideas. Everycreature, no matter who, shall be given the chance at higher education and we shall leave room in our constitution for new ideas and experiments. Let us make our society a steadily advancing clockwork, not a behemoth frozen in time "
SRS_commonwealth_special_2_b:0 "A New Culture for a New Age"
SRS_commonwealth_special_2_b_desc:0 "Goldgriff has stated her intent to begin a new phase of the revolution; a cultural revolution, against the divisive and reactionary cultural norms that offer comfort to those who never knew anything else. We cannot - must not - coerce anycreature, but if we build a common tradition and culture, we can unite behind the universal truths that bind all creatures."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_a:0 "The New Socialist Creature"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_a_desc:0 "Internationalism needs nationalism as its antithesis. If we wish to truly shake the old imperialist dogmas we must go one step further. The divisive concept of the "nation" must be transformed into an "intercommunalism" that treats all groups of people as brothers and sisters. There will be no nations, only communities big or small that will work to live in harmony."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_b:0 "The Abolition of Borders"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_b_desc:0 "Now that most of Griffonia lives free under the aegis of Socialism, it is quite absurd that we continue to uphold the concept of national borders, since we are all citizens of our Socialist Commonwealth; the pre-Commonwealth borders were usually nonsensical and arbitrary anyways. Introducing a Pan-Griffonian passport for all citizens will be the first step in our eradication of nationalism."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c:0 "In the Defense of Freedom"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c_desc:0 "Ponehon has called, repeatedly, for abolishment of any type of conscription. We cannot build our country on an army of coerced people. Let it instead be built on free creatures who have been taught to fight and who of their own, free volition will fight to protect the people."

SRS_beginning_1:0 "Rally Around the Ideal"
SRS_beginning_1_desc:0 "After we had split from the Republicans in Cloudbury, the constituent factions of the Revolutionary Front have drifted away from each other. We must not forget our founding ideals - liberty, socialism, and revolution - and rekindle the flame of solidarity in the hearts of our people, so we may become great in time."
SRS_beginning_2a:0 "Concessions to the Internationalists"
SRS_beginning_2a_desc:0 "In return for their cooperation, the Internationalists have demanded that the Republic work towards the immediate resolution of the conflict with the Northern Tribes, as well as engagement in future liberatory struggles in neighbouring Vedina and Cloudbury under the leadership of the General Congress."
SRS_beginning_2b:0 "Concessions to the Communalists"
SRS_beginning_2b_desc:0 "Under the terms dictated by the Communalist coalition, the General Congress is obligated to engage in the infrastructural and industrial development of the autonomous Skynavian communes, whilst at the same time respecting their independence from the central government. A rather restrictive arrangement, but we need their support as much as they need ours."
SRS_beginning_3a:0 "Restart Construction"
SRS_beginning_3a_desc:0 "The urbanisation of New Skynavia ground to a halt as the divide between the Internationalists and Communalists grew in the years following the SR Skynavia's establishment. Large swaths of land lie undeveloped, and the city is dotted with incomplete construction projects. A combined effort coordinated by Sickleclaw's staff shall see to the recommencement of development in New Skynavia."
SRS_beginning_3b:0 "Convene the General Congress"
SRS_beginning_3b_desc:0 "It is finally time to make the long-awaited, but never fully realised, concept of a General Congress of the United Socialist Revolutionary Front to the test. With Sickleclaw as interim chairgriffon, the General Congress, staffed by democratically-elected Internationalist and Communalist delegates, will meet in the centre of New Skynavia for their first meeting. Here's to democracy!"
SRS_beginning_3c:0 "Industrial Retooling"
SRS_beginning_3c_desc:0 "Much of Skynavia's industry is based off outdated equipment dating from when the socialists were still allied with Kemerskai. What we have now, whilst subject to enterprising innovation from our scientists and engineers, remains outdated and scattered, and most importantly, woefully meagre. Sickleclaw, with the Revolutionary Front behind him, shall pursue the revitalisation of Skynavian industry."
SRS_beginning_4a:0 "Unite the Communes"
SRS_beginning_4a_desc:0 "A consensus has been reached by the notoriously independent and aloof Communalists that, in order to survive against the reactionary forces massing on our borders, the scattered communes and collectives of Skynavia shall band together for their mutual benefit. The central government is still left with little control over Communalist industry and resources outside of New Skynavia, though."
SRS_beginning_4b:0 "Rein in the Revolutionaries"
SRS_beginning_4b_desc:0 "Ever since we have arrived in Skynavia, the radical Internationalists have been raving to go to war with all our neighbours in the name of the socialist revolution. Their suicidal expansionist tendencies have cooled somewhat since, but with the formation of the General Congress and Sickleclaw's reconciliatory measures, we can finally harness and put their revolutionary ardour to good use."
SRS_beginning_5a:0 "Comradely Cooperation"
SRS_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Although we may not agree with the infuriating indifference displayed by the Hail Forest communes, we recognise that at the end of the day they are still our brothers and sisters. We must seek to work together with them for a nonviolent solution where we will be allowed to conduct troop movements within the forest. This will be a lengthy process but we all trust in the solidarity of the Skynavian people."
SRS_beginning_5b:0 "Reclaiming the Forest"
SRS_beginning_5b_desc:0 "The Hail Forest communes are selfish and individualistic in their refusal to accomodate our defense strategy, to the detriment of the rest of Skynavia. We will tolerate such antisocial behaviour no longer! The ever-decisive Sickleclaw will do the tough thing, and reclaim the forest for the Skynavian people with his loyal soldiers. Many will disagree with our methods, but it is for the greater good."
SRS_beginning_of_the_end:0 "The End of the Beginning"
SRS_beginning_of_the_end_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's reforms are nearing their culmination. Already, the mood in Skynavia is hopeful; with the Revolutionary Front united once more, the Skynavian people can now aspire to greater things. The only thing left to do, then, is for Sickleclaw to step down, formally ceding power to the General Congress. The people of Skynavia shall finally be in full control of their destiny."

SRS_expansion_1a:0 "The Next Generation"
SRS_expansion_1a_desc:0 "The socialist education system that served us in Skynavia so well shall be enjoyed by the children of our neighbour countries as well. We will send volunteer to our neighbours, not only to educate the young griffons and ponies, but to help our friends rebuild their societies in the image of socialism as well. Everyone should take part in this effort, in the spirit of solidarity."
SRS_expansion_1b:0 "Socialist Atomics"
SRS_expansion_1b_desc:0 "Working in concert with scientists from our liberated neighbours, we have begun to unravel the mysteries of the atom, and the power that lie therin. When we finally achieve our breakthroughs, will the godlike power of the split atom be put to use for the good of all creaturekind, or as the hammer of the people against the forces of reaction?"
SRS_expansion_1c:0 "The Crusade Continues"
SRS_expansion_1c_desc:0 "We have consolidated our power sufficiently in the north to plan for the liberation of the Griffonian Heartlands. After decades in exile following the First Griffonian Revolution, the socialists of Skynavia are now faced with the prospect of returning home. Let us set our sights on that penultimate bastion of monarchism, the Imperial City itself, and charge forwards in the name of socialism!"

These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhelming majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

SRS_approach_tingkau_exiles_desc:0 "The deepwater harbour of Dinkau was first occupied by Imperial sailors whose ships had stopped at the harbour seeking refuge from a storm. The harbour's desirable location at the mouth of the Skynavia rier delta led to the creation of an Imperial naval outpost there, which gradually attracted settlement from adventurers, resource prospectors, and all sorts of exiles from the Empire.\n\nThe naval outpost was deserted when the Empire collapsed, but there remains a significant settler community at Dinkau that has remained aloof from the governance of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nIt is time to seek rapprochement with the people of Dinkau, who lead lives of unnecessary hardship, cut off from the solidarity, good-will, and mutual aid networks of the Skynavian communes."

SRS_approach_hail_forest_communes_desc:0 "The sparsely-populated and undeveloped Hail Forest is home to dozens of autonomous communes, detached from the General Congress in New Skynavia and existing in a de-facto state of independence.

socrep_grif.1.d:0 "From all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, both urban centers and rural communities, if such terms can even be used for the frozen north, they gathered. Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new, as the two political factions of the Skynavian Socialist Republic: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed and have spent most of the Skynavian history being more occupied with their own endeavors both within the Socialist Republic and beyond it's borders instead of attempting to implement their ideals across the country.\n\nBut this time seems different from any similar attempts of getting these groups to collaborate which happened before. Due to the efforts of Asper Sickleclaw, however, both these groups have understood that in such a cruel and unforgiving age, coexistence and cooperation is the only way of survival."
socrep_grif.1.a:0 "Let's hope this works out."
socrep_grif.2.t:0 "Socialism and the Way we Live"
socrep_grif.2.d:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has already existed for several decades, yet we posses very few industrial centers and even those are greatly lacking. With our citizens possessing so few factories, our country is in a very dangerous position. Even in our current geographical position we are not only surrounded by more powerful enemies, but most of our history has been spent waging a war against the Northern Tribes for decades. If we wish to survive the coming decades, a large and modern industrial base is a necessity. However the revolutionaries of our republic do not wish to survive, they seek to liberate the all workers of Griffonia, a task which will require even greater industrial capacity. Thus we cannot limit our industrialization and risk not only everything we have achieved till this point, but also the free future of the workers of the world.\n\nWith the members of the Internationalist coalition providing such convincing arguments, the General Congress has decided to support the policies and laws on industrialization proposed by the association. With the enactment of this decision some limitations which were previously placed in order to limit expansion of production facilities will be removed. Furthermore the leadership of the country will invest in acquiring new and advanced machinery in order to improve production of both civilian produce and military equipment.\n\nHowever it seems that quite a few previous supporters of the Internationalists have criticized the, as they claim, rash and short-sighted, decisions and policies which they believe will eventually lead to ecological collapse which will doom the world."
socrep_grif.2.a:0 "There can be no Utopia in the future if one gives away the present."
socrep_grif.3.t:0 "Socialism and the Air we Breathe"
socrep_grif.3.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has only existed for a few decades, one can already easily see the effects that hundreds of thousands of new inhabitants and the expansion and establishment of both new cities and centers of production had on the environment, especially the locations with most urbanization. Already there are some places with extremely fragile local ecosystems where the expansion of production facilities might lead to permanent damage. With such a crisis becoming a potential reality, the General Congress has decided that strict limitations and guidelines on how the process of industrial expansion should be performed in our country must be implemented. Furthermore this set of laws will not only limit industrialization, but will also reduce the amount of chaotic expansion that is currently happening in the few urban centers of our country. After all it's well know, even in the Frozen North, that modern cities have an extremely negative effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nOf course some internationalists opposed such a decision, claiming that by slowing down and limiting our industrialization we are weakening ourselves and thus endangering our freedom and independence. While many share similar fears, it was decided that it's better to risk the present than doom the future."
socrep_grif.3.a:0 "What is the point of Utopia if the future generations can't enjoy it?"
socrep_grif.4.t:0 "Democracy, Unity, Progress"
socrep_grif.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the Communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a system where even the concept of a "political party" is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."

socrep_grif.5.d:0 "While the arguments of the few more statist leaning representatives about the potential factionalism and the weakening of the republic in the event of an even more radical variation of democracy is implemented have been quite convincing and will definitely lead to some communities joining the Internationalist side the moment the new system shows any flaws, the General Congress has decided that such risk is truly worthy as long as each and every citizen of our republic can truly represent their own interests and ideas on the political stage. Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."

socrep_grif.6.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical communalists and anarchists, the General Congress has decided that if we wish to achieve the true socialist goal of world revolution, some compromises need to be made. Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."

socrep_grif.7.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to The People"
socrep_grif.7.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical internationalists and vanguardists, the General Congress has decided that in order to create a truly free and prosperous society, an even more anti-statist stance needs to be taken. While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don't truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies.\n\nHowever, it seems that several of the communities which had previously supported our goal of a Libertarian Socialist Utopia, have been persuaded by the internationalist arguments and have embraced their goal of a world revolution."

However our, the communalist coalitions, understanding of what is this "Permanent Revolution" entails is completely different from the Internationalist one.\n\nA "Permanent Revolution" is not the endless war against capitalist oppression, no, it's the eternal advancement of society and science in order to create the true libertarian socialist utopia!

However, while our more idealistic counterparts within the opposing coalition claim that a "Permanent Revolution" is the eternal march of socialist scientific and societal advancement, their utopian fantasies do not truly match reality.\n\nNo, a "Permanent Revolution" is the eternal struggle or, as some would even call, the eternal war of socialism against the tyranny and oppression of the working class across the world!

The steps leading up to the building where the General Congress was hosted soon became awash with creatures, all involved in one way or another with the Congressional proceedings of the day.\n\nIn a quiet inner-city neighbourhood, a young filly named Starflank awoke and was immediately filled with anticipation for the day ahead, for today would be the first day of the new semester. Already, she was looking forward to school, not only because she would be seeing her friends, but also because classes were always enjoyable and engaging, although she always got splinters during the woodworking sessions, and found the political theory often being the topic of discussion in class complicated and complex.\n\nAlthough she may not have realised it at the time, Starflank would grow up having experienced the new socialist school curriculum implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, being educated into a member of the proletariat conscious and critical of the socialist governance at home, and the importance of the class struggle taking place in nations abroad."

However, as most of the country is comprised of frozen tundra, both communication between the various communities and enacting country-wide policies used to be difficult tasks. However the spreading of radio technology across the country, assisted by the central leadership, has allowed us to eliminate this problem as now every community can properly communicate with New Skynavia. This also allows the People's Councils to indirectly participate in making laws and enacting policies as they can now directly listen to how the General Council comes to it's decisions and how they are justified. One could claim that the entire populace of Socialist Republic of Skynavia is directly present at the debates which determine the future of the country.\n\nProviding every community with at least one radio has also created opportunities which weren't even thought about when the policy was being enacted. The most notable of these applications is using this new network which connects the entire country in order to improve the education of chicks and foals that live in the more remote regions."

socrep_grif.13.d:0 "While the decentralized nature of Socialist Republic of Skynavia gives great amounts of autonomy and self-governance to the various communities that are scattered across the country, providing great amounts of freedom to the citizens of the country, it also leads to a lack of any truly unified and organized system of education. This means that not all communes, collectives and cooperatives posses or lack access to any communal higher institutions of learning, thus thousands of Skynavian citizens lack the chance to access tertiary education. Not only does this limit the life opportunities of our citizens, but also negatively impacts the military, scientific and industrial capabilities of our country. Thus the General Congress, in a rare moment of complete agreement between the Internationalist and Communalist coalitions has decided to establish the greatest institution of higher education within our republic - The People's University of Skynavia. Any citizen of our republic will be allowed to attend this university, for free of course, and they will be provided with living quarters if they don't have a local location to stay. We will gather the best and most qualified specialists from both inside the republic and abroad in order to bring knowledge to the inquisitive citizens from all across the country.

With such a goal in mind it might seem strange for the General Congress, which is currently being comprised of mostly communalists, to decide that a country-wide network of railroads needs to be constructed. After all such a campaign would require great amounts of resources and could potentially result in substantial amounts of pollution being produced. However the benefits from this would greatly help in creating a sustainable and ecological system. Most importantly, this will provide the citizens of Skynavia the ability to traverse the country without having to rely on other, more polluting or dangerous ways of travelling across the frozen tundra. Furthermore it will allow easier transportation of modern equipment and machinery. Which in turn will result in a far faster modernization of these communities and phasing out of outdated equipment which is not only insufficient but produces great amounts of pollutants."

Thus the various collectives, communes and cooperatives scattered across the territories of the republic will be supplied with the most modern and numerous technology and equipment available. This will allow these communities, with some help from the central government in organizing such an endeavor, begin the long and difficult process of expanding the already existing industrial centers and establishment of new ones. However this long struggle will be worth it as it will improve not only the working conditions of native workers, but also the ones suffering abroad as this industry will serve in arming the soldiers who will be the instruments of their liberation."

Our delegation chose to play along with the request. This worked out splendidly for everyone involved. Their parents, while initially shocked and afraid for their foals as they found out, became much more positive towards them when finding out the delegation had not only left them without a single bruise, but also played along with them.

Demanding an end to Sickleclaw's dictatorial rule, the crowd was allowed to proceed unchallenged by sympathetic military units who had had enough of the authoritarian military regime. They successfully and safely reached the headquarters of Sickleclaw's regime, but were fired upon in an ambush by a cadre of officers loyal to Sickleclaw.

Despite this, however, there is neither time nor reason to relax. Socialism is an insidious thing and it can grow where you least expect it. Therefore, martial law will be extended indefinitely, until such a time that Sickleclaw deems it no longer necessary.\n\nAll is quiet in Skynavia. The military patrols pass unharassed through the capital city's neighbourhoods, even those which had once been hotbeds of radical socialist movements.

Did he resent his superior for it? Not really, if he had faith in nothing else, he had faith in Asper. The griffon had led them this far and would lead them further, it was just so... tedious!\n\nHe remembered the march north, the struggle to get Skynavia secured and and the battles against the Northern Tribes. There had been a purpose to work for, hopes and dreams to fufill. He had been part of a greater cause and built something new. And yet it was all gone now, swept away and declared a huge mistake.

Unnerved, she hurried up to get home, not wanting to remain outside and longer than needed.\n\nScenes like these were everywhere nowadays, ever since the new laws on reporting dissident activity, people had realized that anyone could be an informant. Only after a few months, almost every creature in Skynavia knew someone who had been snatched up by the secret police, and in too many cases, these people were never seen again. Was the pony a dissident trying to avoid detection? Was the griffon behind the curtain an informant? Nobody knew for sure, and bit by bit, people realized just how vulnerable they were.

In the frontier commune of Old Dragon, an elderly librarian, after putting up an armed resistance with an old revolver against the soldiers defiling the library, was bayoneted and left to perish in the flames.\n\nThe confiscated books reached New Skynavia by train, ferry, balloon, and muscle transport. There, they were piled in a great heap at the centre of the city square in a pile reaching ten meters high. In the presence of a large part of the city's populace, the books were doused in gasoline, before being set aflame.\n\nThose in the crowd who were angered or otherwise upset by this act of cultural, literary, and political censorship were obliged to keep their subversive thoughts to themselves, because of the armed guards and machine-gun emplacements watching over the crowd.\n\nThe great bonfire continued to burn well into the evening, the great licks of smoke and flame rising from the burning books combining with the last rays of sunlight that painted the evening sky a fiery amber."

None in the unit moved a single muscle as the old griffon was tied to the post, struggling and emitting muffled protests as his arms were bound behind the post and the MPs stepped back.

Tossing it over his shoulder, he walked out to the door where two militiagriffs waited for him. Without a word, they escorted him through the streets towards the docks and as he walked, he could see faces, familiar faces, that looked towards him with suspicion and even hatred. He didn't really blame them.\n\nWhen on the ship, he got below deck and sat down, staring listlessly out of the window as the ship started to slowly depart from what for so many years had been his home now.

Although quite spartan in furnishing and appearance, these new housing units will provide shelter for the Communalist and Internationalist cadres streaming into the city from all over Skynavia to participate in the formation of the General Congress. People are coming together to make New Skynavia flourish, and for this newfound unity we all have Sickleclaw to thank. His methods may be unyielding and he brooks no argument, but he gets things done!"
socrep_grif.85.a:0 "Now we are all neighbours."
socrep_grif.86.t:0 "The First Session of the General Congress"
socrep_grif.86.d:0 "The General Congress — set up as the soon-to-be governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, after Sickleclaw steps down — has become almost instantaneously divided between the Communalists, who desire an introspective development of libertarian socialism at home, and the Internationalists, who have not forgotten their heritage as the harbingers of socialist revolution. But both factions remain resolute in their shared mission — that is, to strive for the full realisation of socialism wherever possible, and in achieving this goal they will work together in peace and harmony. Everyone hopes that the nascent General Congress will be up to the quite momentous task of providing genuine democratic governance to the people of Skynavia; the first session of the Congress was chaotic and raucous, as Internationalist and Communalist delegates orated, shouted, cheered and booed in a tumult of political discussion yet to be restricted by protocols and decorum.\n\nOf course, all this idealism is premised on the notion that Sickleclaw, when the time comes, will gracefully cede his authority to the General Congress. Surely, someone as steadfast in the socialist cause like him will have no hesitation to cedeing power to the people."
socrep_grif.86.a:0 "Democracy of the masses."
socrep_grif.87.t:0 "Back to Work"
socrep_grif.87.d:0 "Skynavian industry has suffered in the indecisive years between the formation of the Republic and the current day, where the Internationalists and Communalists have squabbled and refused to work with each other, to the detriment of Skynavian industry. Now that Sickleclaw is making an effort to reconcile the two sides, industrial development has picked up the pace. Internationalist expertise mingles with the raw materials and griffonpower of the Communalists to produce consumer goods and rifles in the newly-retooled factories of New Skynavia and elsewhere."
socrep_grif.87.a:0 "The Gears of Progress are turning."
socrep_grif.88.t:0 "All Power to the Congress!"
socrep_grif.88.d:0 ""All Power to the Congress!" "Democracy for the Masses!" "Elections and Suffrage for All!"\n\nThese were only a few of the slogans being chanted by the procession heading down the wide boulevard towards Sickleclaw's headquarters, where the interim government of Skynavia had its offices. The mood was amiable and cheerful, and the procession was a festive occasion rather than a restive one; after all, everyone expected Sickleclaw to cede power to the General Congress. To the people in the crowd, Skynavia seemed to be on the verge of greatness, where the newly-reconciled Internationalists and Communalists would work together in the General Congress towards a new era.\n\nFrom his office, Sickleclaw watches the procession. Surveying the fruits of his labour to revive the socialist dream in Skynavia, his expression is seemingly content. But the slight smile he wears does not reach his eyes, which harbour some unfathomable expression.\n\nWhat does Sickleclaw do?"
socrep_grif.88.a:0 "Yes, all Power to the Congress!"
socrep_grif.88.b:0 "I should stay in power a bit longer."
socrep_grif.89.t:0 "The Delegates' Ultimatum"
socrep_grif.89.d:0 "Following the surprise announcement by Sickleclaw that he would be staying in power for some time longer, the delegates of the General Congress have banded together to draft an request to Sickleclaw formally requesting his cecession of power to the Congress. Surely, his peculiar decision the other day was just a fluke, and Sickleclaw would assent?"
socrep_grif.89.a:0 "Alright, I'll step down."
socrep_grif.89.b:0 "Those upstarts in the Congress know nothing!"
socrep_grif.90.t:0 "The Congress Revolts!"
socrep_grif.90.d:0 "Sickleclaw's declaration that he would remain as ruler of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia came as a shock to all, and perhaps to himself as well. Proclaiming his long years in service of the socialist cause, Sickleclaw assented that under his rule, Skynavia would be brought into a new era of prosperity, free from the petty squabbles of the Internationalists and Socialists.\n\nHis decision was at total odds with the direction Skynavia had been taking over the past few months. The masses are out on the streets, and the army's loyalty is already proving untrustworthy.\n\nSickleclaw has mobilised his most loyal supporters, whilst the rebels rally around the banner of the General Congress. The dream of utopia in Skynavia has diverged, and both sides shall fight for their ideals."
socrep_grif.90.a:0 "Side with the Commune."
socrep_grif.90.b:0 "Side with Sickleclaw."
socrep_grif.91.t:0 "The Government of Skynavia"
socrep_grif.91.d:0 ""Greetings, friends. On this day, I, Asper Sickleclaw, have decided that the doctrine of Socialism have failed the people of Skynavia. Henceforth, authority over our territories will be transferred unto a reorganised Government of Skynavia, so that under my leadership we may all one day break free from the shackles of primitivism."\n\nThe crowd, most of whom were still largely in shock from the recent civil war, could only muster weak applause for Sickleclaw's proclamation."
socrep_grif.91.a:0 "We'll see what happens."
socrep_grif.92.t:0 "Integration into the [From.GetName]"
socrep_grif.92.d:0 "Our allies and friends in the [From.GetName] have requested a union between our country and theirs. This will allow us to share our military and industrial might, and work even closer together to further the revolutionary cause. However, this will result in our loss of soverignty."
socrep_grif.92.a:0 "Yes, they are our friends."
socrep_grif.92.b:0 "Perhaps not now."
socrep_grif.93.t:0 "Our Ally's Response"
socrep_grif.93.d:0 "Our friends and comrades in the [From.GetName] have accepted our request for their integration into the [Root.GetName]. We stand together now closer than ever as allies in the socialist cause!"

socrep_grif.94.t:0 "Our Ally's Response"
socrep_grif.94.d:0 "The leaders of the [From.GetName] have decided to reject our request for their integration into the [Root.GetName]. This is alright."
socrep_grif.94.a:0 "We can always ask again."
socrep_grif.95.t:0 "Teaching Expedition"
socrep_grif.95.d:0 ""So what is this?" the old griffon asked, holding the loaf of bread aloft in front of the children who all were eating at the moment. One of them answered "food" and the old griffon grinned. "Food indeed. Bread actually. Black bread. I like black bread, what do you like?" he passed the question on, some of the kids beginning to talk and deciding white bread was better.\n\n"This is the important thing," the old griffon told them, cutting up pieces of the bread to give out to the children. "You all must eat, right? You need it as much as you need to breathe. If you do not get it, you will die. Can you imagine if someone sold you air to breathe, and if you did not get it you would die. You can't do that, so why do we do it with food? How many of you have starved, even when there was food, just because you didn't have money?" Too many of the children raised their claws at this and the old griffon nodded. "Food is a right, not a commodity. Remember this children, because as long as we're here, you will not starve if we can help it.""
socrep_grif.95.a:0 "A full belly is the right of any creature."
socrep_grif.96.t:0 "Out of the Forest"
socrep_grif.96.d:0 "They come out of the forest almost like wraiths, moving amidst the snowy branches without even disturbing them. At first it seemed just like one, but it turned out to be dozens and even hundreds coming out of the woods, many of them loaded with heavy backpacks or bundles. Below, in the river valley, the local farmers didn't even see the griffons and ponies above until they were right in front of them.\n\nInitially, fear and surprise made the villagers flee or scramble after whatever weapons they had, but a call from the large group of creatures stilled the worst worries. "We have food!" the newcomers called as they came closer, some of the villagers recognizing the figures as members of the reclusive Hail Forest peoples. What did they do here more than one griffon asked, but when the newcomers showed that they indeed had not only food but also brought tools and indeed warm winter tents, the questions became less important.\n\nThe dour forest folk began work directly, helping the villagers rebuild their homes, restocking larders and granaries and making sure to help those weakened by famine or disease after the war that had raged.\n\n"Why are you doing this?" one villager asked as he watched the foresters repair the roof of his home."We... we've been enemies for centuries..."\n\n "Well, we're siblings now," one of the foresters answered." 
socrep_grif.96.a:0 "The winter is cold, so help them rebuild"
socrep_grif.97.t:0 "Rebuilding Turhamn"
socrep_grif.97.d:0 ""So... what do you make of this?" Hasse asked his friend as they watched the rebuilding, handing him a bottle of alcohol. After the war, it seemed like the socialists had come pouring in by the thousands and the only recently devastated Turhamn was being rebuilt at immense speed.\n\n"I 'unno... " Tage answered slowly, taking a drink before handing it back. "I guess it's nice of them to help? 'specially since they caused it?"\n\n"Was it?" Tage asked as he took the bottle. "I heard we started shooting first and they fought back..."\n\n"Hey! Haysacks!" a worker yelled from further away. "Are you going to work or what?"\n\n"Yeah yeah..." Hasse said, he and Tage both getting up and get back to work bringing up the logs to the rebuilding.\n\n"Think they'll rebuild Ellens bakery?" Tage asked as they put down one of the logs. "I liked that place."\n\n"Honestly," Hasse said, "I wouldn't be surprised if they made it even better. They ain't half-assing things here...\n\n"No but you are," the worker who had told them to get back to work said. "Come on, we gotta get the rubble cleared." 
socrep_grif.97.a:0 "The bakery will be open again before you know it."

socrep_grif.98.t:0 "The [From.GetName] Proposes Union"
socrep_grif.98.d:0 "Our allies in the socialist cause of the [From.GetName] have proposed a union between our two peoples, so that we may both flourish together, pooling our resources, griffonpower, and expertise together in a union that epitomises the concept of socialist solidarity.\n\nTheir proposal is not to be taken lightly, though. Should we agree, we will become a lesser partner in such a Union, where the [From.GetName] will have control over our resources and military, and much more besides. By agreeing to the union, we will thus be giving up our soverignty over the [Root.GetName]. The leadership as well as the people are divided over how to respond to such a request."
socrep_grif.98.a:0 "Socialists have to stick together."
socrep_grif.98.b:0 "We will not be their puppets."
socrep_grif.98.c:0 "Can we think about this some more?"
socrep_grif.99.t:0 "Our Proposal Accepted"
socrep_grif.99.d:0 "Our friends in the [From.GetName] have accepted our proposal for a Union between our peoples. Together we shall strive towards the full realisation of socialism in Griffonia."
socrep_grif.99.a:0 "They are our Comrades and Kin."
socrep_grif.100.t:0 "Our Proposal Refused"
socrep_grif.100.d:0 "The leadership of the [From.GetName] has refused our proposal for a Union. One of the reasons for their decision that stands out most prominently was that such a Union would result is a gross loss of autonomy for the people of the [From.GetName], which they found unacceptable. Most of the General Congress considers this an understandable and wholly logical line of reasoning."
socrep_grif.100.a:0 "Unfortunate, but ultimately understandable."
socrep_grif.101.t:0 "Our Proposal Delayed"
socrep_grif.101.d:0 "The diplomats of the [From.GetName] have asked for two weeks' time to consider our proposal. After all, accepting the proposed Union between our two peoples, with all the drastic changes that entail, is no small matter."
socrep_grif.101.a:0 "We eagerly await their response."
socrep_grif.102.t:0 "Sickleclaw's Speech"
socrep_grif.102.d:0 ""I speak to you today reluctantly, my fellow socialists, but fate has deemed it necessary to push us all to this point. What I am about to say and do will not be popular, but it will be necessary all the same. For decades, we have been locked in war with the tribes to the east as they seek to destroy us and have from the very start.  This war has bled us for too long, and every year more brave revolutionaries die, with no hope of an ending anywhere."\n\n"This state of affairs cannot, must not, stand any longer! If we are to hope for anything beyond an eternity of slowly bleeding out on the tundras, we must act now, and act decisively! We shall strike fast and we shall strike hard, and all the fury and dedication that carried us through the First Revolution shall once again make the mountains tremble. We will march east, sweeping aside these tribal warriors and their barbarian chieftans, breaking their hold over their subjects and shattering the chains that bind these slaves to primitivism."\n\n"People of Skynavia! We march to war! A war of liberation and socialist triumph!""

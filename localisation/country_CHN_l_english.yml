CHN_develop_ditrysium_desc:0 "The Queen decrees that the northern naval port-city, Ditrysium, must be developed. She has ordered the construction of two naval dockyards and financing of the production of naval supplies. New railroads will be built as well, along with expanded fisheries."

offer_puppet:0 "Peaceful Integration of Olenia"
offer_puppet_desc:0 "While we could easily crush Olenia, it might be more worthwhile to propose [OLE.GetLeader] a peaceful alternative to war. By offering our 'protection' and allowing Olenians limited autonomy, we can focus our forces elsewhere. Should they refuse our generous offer, we can still have our war."
conquest:0 "Conquest of Olenia"
conquest_desc:0 "Olenia has never had any respect for us. There is no doubt that they will turn against the Changeling Lands once they are finished their internal struggles.

prepare_for_war3_desc:0 "Ensuring we have the means to keep our armies supplied is a priority in a time of war. Building up is our only option.

death_or_dishonour_desc:0 "For some reason we have not instantly toppled the Equestrians in the opening months of the war. Clearly, the stakes must become higher.

army_research3_desc:0 "Mechanised infantry is distinguished from motorised infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for motorised infantry.

operationariettesphasetwo:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase Two"
operationariettesphasetwo_desc:0 "With our infiltrators in place, we can now enact our plans proper. First, we must spread our ideology among the Olenian masses and gain as much support for an eventual civil uprising. It will take time, but the outcome will be worth it!"

operationariettesphasefour:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase Four"
operationariettesphasefour_desc:0 "Both the partitioning of Olenia and the settlement of changelings within the new partitions show that we can openly lead other people under the right circumstances. Both Olenians and Changelings prove that a greater syndicalist state is possible, but it will never exist if our old nemesis, Equestria, still stands."
chncolonization:0 "Establish The Commissariats"
chncolonization_desc:0 "As legal as the new Olenian government is, the war has left the country in a state of disarray.

Perhaps this is the start of something greater..."
chncomshowtrials:0 "The Vaverfront Trials"

CHN_olenian_factories_desc:0 "Luckily for us, some Olenian businessdeers and factory owners are cowards and are willing to make deals and work for us, as long as we allow them to keep their social status. There's no need to nationalize their facilities if they willingly cooperate with the Queen."
CHN_olenian_volunteers:0 "Olenian Collaborators"
CHN_olenian_volunteers_desc:0 "Propaganda can do wonders. Brainwashed Olenian youth will join our ranks to fight in the name of Changeling Lands and the Queen, for she is their saviour and protector.

CHN_study_olenian_magic:0 "Olenian Application of Magic"
CHN_study_olenian_magic_desc:0 "An Olenian seer once said: "Magic makes a warrior into a berserker".

CHN_modern_cities:0 "Modern Changeling Hives"
CHN_modern_cities_desc:0 "Most of the changeling hives will finally have modern architecture with concrete spires, highrises, metro and automobile roads.

CHN_great_war_beginning_desc:0 "The time to regain our lost honour is finally coming. The changelings will take their rightful place as the lords of Equus.

The twilight of the gods is about to begin."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_1:0 "Restructure the Command System"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_1_desc:0 "To establish a clear and orderly hierarchy, changes have to be made. Needless positions will be abolished and we will ensure every officer has a single superior, to prevent conflicting orders.

CHN_high_command_cabinet_2:0 "Officers and Communications"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_2_desc:0 "To fill in gaps created by the recent reorganization of the ranks, promising officers will be promoted to higher positions. Not only that, but the importance of rapid and clear communication has been realized. Commands cannot be interpreted in more than one way, and they cannot get lost on the way. Dedicated signallers will be added to all units."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3:0 "Order and Discipline"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3_desc:0 "Dissent among the ranks will not be tolerated. We must fight as one, and deviancy from rules and commands must be punished severely. Cowardice and desertion shall become punishable by death. It will be the iron discipline of the Changeling Army that will bring us victory, not shiny tanks or big guns alone."
CHN_changeling_school_of_war:0 "Changeling School of War"
CHN_changeling_school_of_war_desc:0 "Our race has waged war with itself for countless centuries before Queen Chrysalis united us. Rapid decisive attacks by mobile swarms led by competent commanders were always the key to victory. If it is not broken, why fix it? All we have to do is update our doctrine to modern times."
CHN_griffon_school_of_war:0 "Griffon School of War"
CHN_griffon_school_of_war_desc:0 "Before its collapse from within, the Griffonian Empire had the largest army in the world. Its units were drilled with defence in mind, to hold on to vast swathes of land and to repel aggressive uprisings and raids. Perhaps defence is best offence, as with bite-and-hold tactics we will slowly but surely advance. We have much to learn from our feathered friends."
CHN_modern_cities2:0 "Marsh Railroad"
CHN_modern_cities2_desc:0 "The Great Marsh is a giant obstacle for the changelings to travel across the country to such cities as Volistad and Equestrian border. Construction of modern railroads will allow for international and domestic tourism and will aid southern businesses to reach the central region easily."
CHN_demand_yak:0 "Invade the Yaks"
CHN_demand_yak_desc:0 "The yaks are a proud warrior race, and they will not be subdued easily. They only respect strength, so if we wish them to recognize Chrysalis as the overlord of Equus, we must prove our strength to them. Their tall mountains and frozen forests won't be an obstacle for our mighty army!"
CHN_demand_png:0 "Secure the North"
CHN_demand_png_desc:0 "The penguins control the strategically vital northern sea passage and have so far refused to recognize Chrysalis as their master. Clearly, they must be taught a violent lesson in humility. The pathetic flightless birds will be easy prey."

CHN_Fighter_2_desc:0 "More advanced fighters are the stuff of dreams, but what if we decide to turn them from dreams, to reality?"
CHN_Fighter_3:0 "Long Ranged Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters which escort strategic bombers are not only beneficial for the bombers, but they can also be stationed at airfields further from the front line and still be effective."
CHN_Rocketry:0 "Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_desc:0 "An engine powered by a fuel and oxidiser is not only something out of legend, but it's right around the corner in reality, too."
CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "Wunderwaffe"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two:0 "Continued Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulse jets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "Jet Engines"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "Jet Fighters"
CHN_Jet_Fighter_desc:0 "With our engine ready for production, we need to develop a plane purpose built for the purpose of flying at high speeds, while under high thrust numbers."
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "Jet Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A mid range tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventionally propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber:0 "Jet Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber_desc:0 "Not only could cargo and freight make use of a large aircraft that can carry heavier loads, but the power of the jet engine would allow us to carry heavier bomb loads."
CHN_defend_the_north:0 "Northern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."
CHN_central_hives:0 "Central Defences"
CHN_central_hives_desc:0 "Ensuring that our capital is a suitable area to fall back to and hold will give us an edge against any hypothetical foe."
CHN_defend_the_south:0 "Southern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_south_desc:0 "While the ponies of Equestria helped King Thorax learn the magic of friendship, as of late the situation in Equestria has become uncertain. A backup plan may be required."
CHN_fortress:0 "Fortress Vesalipolis"
CHN_fortress_desc:0 "While Vesalipolis is already heavily defended, the loss of the heart of our hives would result in our downfall, and we might not bounce back this time."
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "Naval Purchase"
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbours."
CHN_carrier_navy:0 "Carrier Dominance"
CHN_carrier_navy_desc:0 "A focus on carriers, and naval air warfare, will ensure that even the heaviest armoured ship will no longer be a threat."
CHN_battleship_navy:0 "Battleship Dominance"
CHN_battleship_navy_desc:0 "Battleships embody the same things a changeling does. A heavily armoured fighting force that's not to be reckoned with."
CHN_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Designs"
CHN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "All forms of navy benefit from submarines. Not only can they strike slow, lumbering ships, but they can be used to raid enemy convoys and keep their troops from being supplied."
CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CHN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
CHN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."
CHN_Destroyers:0 "Improved Destroyers"
CHN_Destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers are part of the backbone of every navy, without them, the larger ships are vulnerable to submarines and other destroyers."
CHN_Light_Cruisers:0 "Modernised Cruisers"
CHN_Light_Cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers serve as the other part of the backbone. Without them, those same ships are easy prey for air forces."
CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Escort Carrier Designs"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "Swarms In The Sky"
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky_desc:0 "Filling the skies fighters from both the Air Force and the Naval Air Force will guarantee our victory, as no hostiles planes will remain up to strike us."
CHN_Bomber_Command:0 "Bomber Command"
CHN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."
CHN_Hive_Factories:0 "Lyctida Wood Industry"
CHN_Hive_Factories_desc:0 "Lyctida is one of the five biggest hives of the Changeling Lands. Historically it is known for massive lumber production. Wood is strategically important resource for the nation. Creation of new lumber factories will open us an opportunity to increase our furtniture and paper industry."
CHN_polar_bear_envoy:0 "Envoy to Polar Bears"
CHN_polar_bear_envoy_desc:0 "To the east, the Polar Bears hold dominion. While they are, as a species, definitely dangerous, that does not apply to their nation as a whole; their military is far behind ours. It should be an easy matter to extort gold from them"
CHN_threaten_PLB:0 "Threaten the Bear"
CHN_threaten_PLB_desc:0 "It seems words alone will not get us what we want. We will have to show them that we are serious and fully capable of following up on our threats."
CHN_attack_PLB:0 "Strike the Bear"
CHN_attack_PLB_desc:0 "Even after our threats, the bears continue to defy us. It is time to teach them a lesson! We are changelings and we do not back down!."
CHN_resources_of_PLB:0 "Polar Resources"
CHN_resources_of_PLB_desc:0 "With the additition of the Polar Bear territories we have conquered, even more potential resources has fallen into our grasp. None of them will go to waste."
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB:0 "Infrastructure Improvements for Bears"
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB_desc:0 "The Polar territories are in a pitiful state. There are few roads, and even fewer of those are suitable for our heavy industry and military manuevers. We must put effort in where they have not."
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB:0 "Key Lake Thermonuclear Research"
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB_desc:0 "Key Lake is an ideal test site, or at least, the eastern side of it is. Sparsely populated and in an isolated area, it would make a perfect site for testing our more...dangerous weapons."

CHN_force_ponies_to_work:0 "Pony-Workers Resettlement"
CHN_force_ponies_to_work_desc:0 "Our conquest only began, but we can already reap the benefits of it. The new resettlement program "Plan West" will help us develop the lands of our nation with hooves of the ponies. 300 thousand ponies will be moved from their homes to Changeling Lands to work for the benefit of the Queen and her nation."
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair:0 "Form Pony Work Battallions"
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair_desc:0 "As the invasion progresses, it desolates the rich lands of Equestria. Creating work groups from the locals will help us keep the infrastructure and industry intact on the newly taken territories."

chn_queen_helvia_desc:0 "The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in commercial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The debacle of 1002 eventually led to communist sailors rioting in Ditrysium and Chrysalis crushed the resistance personally without asking Helvia. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing."

chn_queen_aurantia_desc:0 "The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis lead her alliance to save Lyctida from marauding deer zealots, she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favour, but she in turn sees Aurantia as a useful and reliable pawn until she eventually dies from old age."

chn_queen_argynnis_desc:0 "The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 971 Chrysalis struck back with an expanded alliance and crushed Vraks, whose Queen committed suicide rather than face Chrysalis' wrath. Her oldest hatchling, Argynnis, thus became Queen. She holds no grudge against Chrysalis and recognizes her might, but never skips an opportunity to make a mocking, sarcastic comment if she fails."

Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."

changelings.1.t:0 "Olenian Question"
changelings.1.d:0 "Chrysalis is preparing to send a communique to Olenia regarding two of their northern states. Before the modern borders between the Changeling Queendom and the Kingdom of Olenia were formalized, these resource-rich lands had changelings living in them, before they were pushed out by the deer. The border treaty signed with King Aldar II in return for an official recognition of the Changeling Nation has not been renewed since his death, and his successor King Johan is considered by many to be illegitimate. Clearly, it is time to revise the treaty, and regain rightful changeling land.\n\nThis is exactly what the Queen needs. She will send an ultimatum to [OLE.GetLeader], demanding they cede these states immediately. If they agree, she will gain deposits of valuable strategic resources. If they refuse, she has an excuse to invade and force the deer into submission. She chuckles to herself, satisfied with her own cunning."
changelings.1.a:0 "Send it."
changelings.2.t:0 "Protectorate over Olenia"
changelings.2.d:0 "We're bound to offer Olenia to become our protectorate. Harmonic influence from Equestria and communist influence from Stalliongrad have destabilized the country and continue to threaten its sovereignty. Clearly, if we do not intervene, our rivals will expand their spheres of influence at our expense. Queen Chrysalis is generous and voluntarily proposes to save Olenia by making it a protectorate of the Changeling Queendom. They would be foolish to not accept the offer."
changelings.2.a:0 "Send it."
changelings.3.t:0 "Conquest"
changelings.4.t:0 "States Ceded"
changelings.4.d:0 "[OLE.GetLeader] has given in to Chrysalis' ultimatum and ceded the demanded lands over to our control. They were clearly intimidated by our might, which proves what easy prey they are. While Chrysalis hoped they would've rejected her demand, she is satisfied with the outcome nonetheless."
changelings.4.a:0 "Good."
changelings.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejects our Demands!"
changelings.5.d:0 "Our demand of ceding Solgud Bergskedja and Feer Dalar has been rejected by the Olenian government. It is clear they have deluded themselves and think their military might is somehow comparable to ours. Chrysalis is pleased with this news however, as she now has an excuse to invade Olenia in the future to safeguard the interests of the changeling hives."
changelings.5.a:0 "What do they think of themselves?"
changelings.6.t:0 "Olenia agrees to be our protectorate"
changelings.6.d:0 "We received a message from [OLE.GetLeader] and he agrees to accept our proposal of establishing a protectorate over Olenia. Chrysalis will prove to be a most benevolent guardian of the deer, defending them from dangerous and wicked Equestrian influence."
changelings.6.a:0 "Excellent!"
changelings.7.t:0 "Olenia rejects our protectorate"
changelings.7.d:0 "[OLE.GetLeader] has sent us a rude rejection for our latest proposal.

changelings.16.t:0 "Espionage in Equestria"
changelings.16.d:0 "The outstanding ability of changelings is to take form of somepony else. This is extremely helpful in case of confrontation against Equestria. We must send specially trained agents into Equestria to spy, sabotage, and steal technology."
changelings.16.a:0 "That's right!"
changelings.17.t:0 "[EQS.GetName] has Destroyed our Spy Network!"
changelings.17.d:0 "It seems that [EQS.GetName] have managed to detect our infiltration into their ranks, and the majority of our infiltrators have either been arrested or killed in battle. This news has greatly angered the Queen, who has demanded to know who is responsible for his blunder."
changelings.17.a:0 "Damn it."
changelings.18.t:0 "Sombra Demands our Subjugation"
changelings.18.d:0 "King Sombra has made it clear that he intends to make us kneel to his rule, one way or another. He has officially demanded that we become a protectorate under his rule, refusing many have drastic consequences."

The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

changelingattache.1.d:0 "’Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.’\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that [GRI.GetLeader] overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

Some argued for, some against this plead for asylum. At the end, however, the choice was entirely up to the ruling griffon themselves.\n\nAs Thranx broke down in tears before them, a choice had to be made."

changelingattache.6.t:0 "Chrysalis Demands Thranx to be Returned Home"

She now calls for us to return him home at once, so that she, as his rightful Queen, can deal with him and his treacherous dealings, accordingly.\n\nThranx has proven to be a good, valuable friend to us, and he appreciates our help and support. But... is he worth the trouble we risk in continuing to shelter him?"

He was escorted through the grand hive, taunted and insulted by many of the other changelings along the way. When he was brought to the Queen, the disgust on her face sealed the fate of the young General. No less than 20 minutes after his arrival at Vesalipolis, he was blindfolded, and Field Marshal Trimmel himself commanded the firing squad. A loud bang echoed throughout the hive, and Thranx was no more."
changelingattache.7.a:0 "Serves him right."

changelingattache.8.d:0 "To our great shock, the imperial nobility, including [GRI.GetLeader], have declined our demand to return General Thranx to us. This is unbelievable, and will not go unpunished!\n\nHowever, first we must let the Queen know of this..."
changelingattache.8.a:0 "The queen will be most displeased..."

changelingattache.9.t:0 "Chrysalis Swears Revenge"
changelingattache.9.d:0 "The Queen gnarled aloud as she listened to the changeling in front of her who relayed the Griffonian response to her. With a swift stroke and blast from her crooked horn, the small and unimportant minion was obliterated, and only a black, dusty crater remained where he had stood.\n\n"Listen to me when I say this: the wicked and disgusting griffons within the Empire have today made the biggest mistake in their sorry, petty lives! Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to! None shall stand in my way!"\n\nThe other changelings present applauded and cheered for their Queen."
changelingattache.9.a:0 "We will strike them soon enough."

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\n\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\n\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\n\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\n\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."
changelingattache.10.a:0 "Rest in peace, friend."

changelingattache.11.t:0 "Best Served With Wine"
changelingattache.11.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us from Griffonia today, my Queen! The devilish traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\n\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."
changelingattache.11.a:0 "The Traitor is dead, at last."

changelingattache.12.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Sends Volunteers"
changelingattache.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our contribution to the CGEM returned home with thousands of griffon soldiers in tow. Their commander says that they are volunteers from the Empire, here to return the favour and foster the bonds of friendship that bind our two nations.\n\nQueen Chrysalis seemed visibly disgusted at the news, all but gagging at the mere mention of the word friendship. Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel’s fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."
changelingattache.12.a:0 "At least they're a good bullet sponge."
changelingattache.12.a_tt:0 "Spawns §YTwo Imperial Volunteers Divisions§!\n"

changelingattache.13.t:0 "Orders from the Queen"
changelingattache.13.d:0 "The Queen has issued the return of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission, including the two commanders, General Thranx and Marshal Synovial. She believes there is no need for the mission anymore, seeing as how changeling efforts would best be off directed entirely on Equestria."
changelingattache.13.a:0 "At once my queen!"

changelingattache.14.t:0 "The Fatherland Calls"
changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \n\nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\n\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n\n "Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\n\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\n\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\n\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\n\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\n\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."

changelings.58.t:0 "Time to Act!"
changelings.58.d:0 "The changelings are losing! What is their protection worth if they cannot even protect themselves? We have an opportunity to betray them and secure ourselves a place on the winning side! Do we take it?"

changelings.61.d:0 "Today the streets of the hive-city of Vesalipolis were filled to the brim with changelings, with many buzzing above in the air. They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even hive Queens were there.\n\nThe square columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarschall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite jäger squadrons, death squads, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was in awe and convinced of the might of their nation.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun."

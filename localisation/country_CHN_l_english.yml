#NEWSTUFF

CHN_Army:0 "Revitalise The Military"
CHN_Army_desc:0 "While our army has routes in the highly trained army of the Changeling Empire, it still would do us good to enact stricter training regimes, and experiment in new doctrines."
CHN_Infantry_2:0 "Infantry Equipment"
CHN_Infantry_2_desc:0 "A well trained army is nothing without the firearms to back it up. Ensuring that our equipment is not only up to international standard, but surpassing it, will give our troops an edge in battle."
CHN_Infantry_1:0 "Infantry Equipment"
CHN_Infantry_1_desc:0 "Without the support companies to back it up, any military will crack and fall under the weight of its own logistics and necessary specialised backup."
CHN_Chemical_Weapons:0 "Establish RCAMICD"
CHN_Chemical_Weapons_desc:0 "The Royal Changeling Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence will ensure that our artillery can flush out any potential hostiles by denying them access to key areas without specialised forces equipped to deal with chemical warfare."
CHN_Jager_1:0 "Improved Jager Tactics"
CHN_Jager_1_desc:0 "While the jagers that us changelings employ are amongst the most well trained special forces, ensuring that they are kept up to date on modern doctrine and asymmetrical warfare will give them an advantage."
CHN_Motorized_1:0 "Motorised Equipment"
CHN_Motorized_1_desc:0 "More modern and reliable trucks and other vehicles are a necessity for any army that relies on fast movements of its forces."
CHN_Blitzkrieg_1:0 "Panzer Modernisation"
CHN_Blitzkrieg_1_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies with tanks and the effective use of their combined anti-infantry and anti-fortification capabilities, in addition to the speed that they can respond to new threats."
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2:0 "Continued Panzer Modernisation"
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2_desc:0 "Continued modernisation of tank forces will guarantee that they will remain effectively impervious to all future threats."
CHN_Magical_Infantry:0 "Magical Infantry"
CHN_Magical_Infantry_desc:0 "Giving our infiltrator units specialised, yet harder to produce equipment will ensure that not only can they more easily take out important targets, but if they get detected can stay alive too."
CHN_Infiltrators:0 "Infiltration Tactics"
CHN_Infiltrators_desc:0 "Giving our infiltrator units better tactics and training will increase their chances of fitting in with any hostile entity."
CHN_Support_Companies_1:0 "Support Equipment"
CHN_Support_Companies_1_desc:0 "Investing in better support equipment, such as medicine, will not only keep our forces on the field, but as few changeling lives are lost."
CHN_Motorized_2:0 "Mechanised Infantry"

CHN_Dedicated_Panzer_Production:0 "Dedicated Panzer Production"
CHN_Dedicated_Panzer_Production_desc:0 "Training entire factories to produce nothing but panzers for our army will invariably speed up the process, and keep any materials from going to waste on failed tanks."
CHN_Dedicated_Motorized_Production:0 "Dedicated Motorised Production"
CHN_Dedicated_Motorized_Production_desc:0 "Dedicating most of our industry to producing cars and trucks for our motorised forces will speed up our army overall and get them to the front faster."

CHN_Renewed_Militarization:0 "Renew Militarisation"
CHN_Renewed_Militarization_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has been defeated, and all thanks to the soldiers that fought for friendship. It's time to focus on bringing the Changeling militias from an emergency force to something professional, that any changelings can be proud to serve in."
CHN_Air_Force:0 "Revitalise The Luftwaffe"

CHN_Air_Doctrine_2:0 "Fighter Doctrine"

CHN_Bomber_1:0 "Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_1_desc:0 "Tactical bombers, while not as specialised as ground attack planes, nor strategic bombers, fulfil an important middle ground. Being able to not only strike ground targets, but also performing long range bombing runs."
CHN_Bomber_2:0 "Close Air Support"
CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than conventional fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."
CHN_Paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers"
CHN_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Using the wings of changeling soldiers allows us to drop more elite units behind enemy lines and take keypoints to, say, encircle them, or to secure ports for a larger invasion."
CHN_Fighter_1:0 "Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_1_desc:0 "Development of fighter aircraft in general is something that would help not only the air force, but also the civilian recreational sector too."
CHN_Fighter_2:0 "Advanced Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_2_desc:0 "More advanced fighters are the stuff of dreams, but what if we decide to turn them from dreams, to reality?"
CHN_Fighter_3:0 "Long Ranged Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters which escort strategic bombers are not only beneficial for the bombers, but they can also be stationed at airfields further from the front line and still be effective."
CHN_Rocketry:0 "Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_desc:0 "An engine powered by a fuel and oxidiser is not only something out of legend, but it's right around the corner in reality, too."
CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "Wunderwaffe"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two:0 "Continued Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulse jets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "Jet Engines"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "Jet Fighters"
CHN_Jet_Fighter_desc:0 "With our engine ready for production, we need to develop a plane purpose built for the purpose of flying at high speeds, while under high thrust numbers."
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "Jet Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A mid range tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventionally propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber:0 "Jet Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber_desc:0 "Not only could cargo and freight make use of a large aircraft that can carry heavier loads, but the power of the jet engine would allow us to carry heavier bomb loads."
CHN_defend_the_north:0 "Northern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."
CHN_central_hives:0 "Central Defences"
CHN_central_hives_desc:0 "Ensuring that our capital is a suitable area to fall back to and hold will give us an edge against any hypothetical foe."
CHN_defend_the_south:0 "Southern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_south_desc:0 "While the ponies of Equestria helped King Thorax learn the magic of friendship, as of late the situation in Equestria has become uncertain. A backup plan may be required."
CHN_fortress:0 "Fortress Vesalipolis"
CHN_fortress_desc:0 "While Vesalipolis is already heavily defended, the loss of the heart of our hives would result in our downfall, and we might not bounce back this time."
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "Naval Purchase"
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbours."

CHN_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Designs"
CHN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "All forms of navy benefit from submarines. Not only can they strike slow, lumbering ships, but they can be used to raid enemy convoys and keep their troops from being supplied."
CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CHN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
CHN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."
CHN_Destroyers:0 "Improved Destroyers"
CHN_Destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers are part of the backbone of every navy, without them, the larger ships are vulnerable to submarines and other destroyers."
CHN_Light_Cruisers:0 "Modernised Cruisers"
CHN_Light_Cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers serve as the other part of the backbone. Without them, those same ships are easy prey for air forces."
CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Escort Carrier Designs"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "Swarms In The Sky"
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky_desc:0 "Filling the skies fighters from both the Air Force and the Naval Air Force will guarantee our victory, as no hostiles planes will remain up to strike us."
CHN_Bomber_Command:0 "Bomber Command"
CHN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."
CHN_Hive_Factories:0 "Chunchi Lumber Industry"
CHN_Hive_Factories_desc:0 "Our main source of wood comes from Chunchi. Expanding and developing in the region will allow us to better take care of, and harvest, the forests."

In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

changelingattache.1.d:0 "’Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.’\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

There are hundreds of them, and hundreds more griffons that seek to attend the party as well. Luckily for all those involved, when the capital was first moved from Griffinstone to Griffenheim the designers of the new Imperial Palace’s grand ballroom had capacity first in mind.\n\nThe party ends up lasting well into the early dawn hours, with many an event to be seen. Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A griffon noblewoman actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that the young emperor snuck in, and overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling Lander friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

Some argued for, some against this plead for asylum. At the end, however, the choice was entirely up to the young royal griffon himself.\n\nAs Thranx broke down in tears before Grover, and a choice had to be made."

We must see this traitor punished!"

changelingattache.6.t:0 "Chrysalis demands Thranx to be returned home"
changelingattache.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis of the changelings has issued a very vocal diplomatic protest on our decision to shelter General Thranx within the Empire. She now calls for us to return him home at once, so that she, as his rightful Queen, can deal with him and his treacherous dealings, accordingly.\n\nThranx has proven to be a good, valuable friend to us, and he appreciates our help and support. But... is he worth the trouble we risk in continuing to shelter him?"

changelingattache.7.t:0 "The Firing Squad"
changelingattache.7.d:0 "Today, just as the sun began to rise, General Thranx arrived at Vesalipolis. In chains, naturally. He was escorted through the grand hive, taunted and insulted by many of the other changelings along the way. When he was brought to the Queen, the disgust on her face sealed the fate of the young General. No less than 20 minutes after his arrival at Vesalipolis, he was blindfolded, and Field Marshal Trimmel himself commanded the firing squad. A loud bang echoed throughout the hive, and Thranx was no more."
changelingattache.7.a:0 "Serves him right."

changelingattache.8.t:0 "Griffonian Response"
changelingattache.8.d:0 "To our great shock, the imperial nobility, including the young Emperor himself, has declined our demand to return General Thranx to us. This is unbelievable, and will not go unpunished!\n\nHowever, first we must let the Queen know of this..."
changelingattache.8.a:0 "The queen will be most displeased..."

changelingattache.9.t:0 "Chrysalis swears revenge"
changelingattache.9.d:0 "The Queen gnarled aloud as she listened to the changeling in front of her who relayed the Griffonian response to her. With a swift stroke and blast from her crooked horn, the small and unimportant minion was obliterated, and only a black, dusty crater remained where he had stood.\n\n"Listen to me when I say this: the wicked and disgusting griffons within the Empire have today made the biggest mistake in their sorry, petty lives! Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to! None shall stand in my way!"\n\nThe other changelings present applauded and cheered for their Queen."
changelingattache.9.a:0 "We will strike them soon enough."

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\n\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\n\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\n\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\n\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."
changelingattache.10.a:0 "Rest in peace, friend."

changelingattache.11.t:0 "Best served with Wine"
changelingattache.11.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us from Griffonia today, my Queen! The devilish traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\n\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."
changelingattache.11.a:0 "The Traitor is dead, at last"

changelingattache.12.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Sends Volunteers"
changelingattache.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our contribution to the CGEM returned home with thousands of griffon soldiers in tow. Their commander says that they are volunteers from the Empire, here to return the favour and foster the bonds of friendship that bind our two nations.\n\nQueen Chrysalis seemed visibly disgusted at the news, all but gagging at the mere mention of the word friendship. Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel’s fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."
changelingattache.12.a:0 "At least they're a good bullet sponge."

changelingattache.13.t:0 "Orders from the Queen"
changelingattache.13.d:0 "The Queen has issued the return of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission, including the two commanders, General Thranx and Marshal Synovial. She believes there is no need for the mission anymore, seeing as how changeling efforts would best be off directed entirely on Equestria."
changelingattache.13.a:0 "At once my queen!"

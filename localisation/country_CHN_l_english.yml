It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."

CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB_desc:0 "The Polar territories are in a pitiful state. There are few roads, and even fewer of those are suitable for our heavy industry and military manuevers.

CHN_rehire_recina_desc:0 "The current state of the Kriegsmarine is unsatisfactory. Our Admiralität is lacking proper leadership, and its pool of admirals are not nearly as capable as we'd like them to be. Queen Helvia of Ditrysium has raised a possible solution, though it is not one that enthuses Chrysalis. Former Admiral Recina, Helvia's sister, is currently languishing under house arrest, but could perhaps be convinced to return to service as a Generaladmiral.\n\nRecina's reinstatement would upset the current Admiralität, and buying Recina's service will likely prove costly. She has reasons to dislike Queen Chrysalis, and only the offer of a high position in the Kriegsmarine could convince her. The disgraced admiral has proven herself in the past though, and this is perhaps one bullet worth biting if we intend to reinvigorate the Kriegsmarine."
CHN_Secret_Carrier:0 "A Gift from Ditrysium?"

changelings.1.t:0 "The Olenian Question"
changelings.1.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis looked at the draft of the communique she'd spent the past few hours working on. The letter would be sent to [OLE.GetLeader] regarding an awful, ill-fated treaty signed between the Changeling Lands and the long-dead King Aldar II of Olenia. That treaty had bought Queen Chrysalis and the Changeling Lands international recognition at the cost of surrendering two states to the barbaric deer of the south. But now, with Aldar dead and the illegitimate King Johan shaking up Olenian politics, it was perhaps the best opportunity Chrysalis would have to right an ignominious wrong... and the pretense to expand Changeling influence beyond the Hives' borders.\n\nThe communique was a brilliant thing. It demanded renegotiations of the peace treaty King Aldar II had signed before his death, demanding the return of the two northern changeling states to the Hives in exchange for changeling recognition of [OLE.GetLeader] as the true sovereign of Olenia. It was a reversal of the treaty signed with King Aldar, and many of Chrysalis' advisors doubted the Olenian leader would agree to it, as the last thing [OLE.GetLeader] needed to do in the midst of the Olenian civil unrest would be to sign their territory away to a foreign power. But Chrysalis didn't care what option the Olenian leader would do. Either they would return the rightful changeling territory, or they would refuse, and that would be enough pretext to wage war. Either option pleased Chrysalis, but after all the reorganization the Royal Changeling Heer had gone through after the defeat at Canterlot in 1002, she was eager to see her new military at work. No matter which way she looked at it, this communique was a win-win scenario.\n\nIt was time for the weak to fear the strong."
changelings.1.a:0 "Let's see if this prey species can realize when it's being hunted."

changelings.2.t:0 "An Olenian Protectorate?"
changelings.2.d:0 ""The situation in Olenia is favorable," Hivesmarschall Trimmel said, gesturing at a map of the deer nation spread across a table before his queen. "The country is tearing itself apart already. Most think King Johan is illegitimate, and Princess Velvet should be the rightful queen. On top of that, the Equestrians have been pushing their disgusting harmonic ways on the nation, while Stalliongrad thinks that Olenia would be better as a communist puppet in the west to outflank Equestrian advances. All of this together means the deer are at each other's throats, and the true disasters haven't even started. It would just be tragic should a foreign power as strong as the Changeling Hives decided it should swoop in and intervene."\n\n"So what are you suggesting?" Chrysalis asked. "Clearly we cannot afford to let either Equestria or Stalliongrad establish closer ties with the Olenians. They are the first domino that needs to fall to take down Equestria, and it won't do if the domino is twice as heavy."\n\n"It's simple, really," Trimmel said. "Offer the Olenians the once in a lifetime opportunity to bow before you and kiss the dirt beneath your hooves. Say that we in the Changeling Hives are worried about the state of affairs in Olenia, and are merely offering our help. And if they refuse, or rather, when they refuse, we can claim it is in our best interests to see to it that we save the deer from themselves. Either way, Olenia bends to us. It just depends on how stupid they are to tell if we need to send in the tanks or not."\n\nChrysalis thought about it for a moment, then grinned. "I like the way you think, Hivesmarschall," she said."\n\nTrimmel grinned back at her. "I like the way I think too, Your Majesty.""
changelings.2.a:0 "Let's see how the deer react to this one."

changelings.3.t:0 "Conquest" ## Empty Event ##

changelings.4.t:0 "States Ceded"
changelings.4.d:0 ""[OLE.GetLeader] truly is spineless," Chrysalis said, reading the response from Olenia with contempt. "Here I was spoiling for a good fight. And the deer fold like a house of cards. Pathetic!"\n\n"It appears reason won out in the end," Hivesmarschall Trimmel stated, bowing his head as Chrysalis fumed that she wouldn't have her fight anymore. "Still, we can call this a victory. There will be further opportunities to subjugate the deer. I'm sure the right one will surface before long."\n\n"It better," Chrysalis said. "If I settle for only taking two states off of the deer, I'm just a bit player. But if I take all of Olenia..." she rubbed her hooves together and giggled. "The deer may have bought themselves some time, but they will be my first conquest, one way or another. Soon they will submit or they will die, and I don't particularly care which one they choose.""
changelings.4.a:0 "This is good enough for now... but it won't satisfy us forever."

changelings.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejects Our Demands!"
changelings.5.d:0 "Hivesmarschall Trimmel read the response of [OLE.GetLeader] with a pleased smile on his face. "Your demands that we cede Solgud Bergskedja and Feer Dalar are utterly preposterous. These lands were given to the deer by the treaty established by King Aldar II, in case you have forgotten. We will not give them back to you just because you demand them. Olenia does not cower before bullies." Trimmel tossed the response aside and shifted his attention toward Queen Chrysalis. "So, my Queen? What do you think?"\n\n"I think it's the excuse we've wanted," Chrysalis said, rubbing her hooves together. "If the deer think that firm words will be all it takes to save them, they will be disappointed. One way or another, they will fall, and I can't wait to see the look on [OLE.GetLeader]'s face when it all comes crashing down on their pathetic excuse for a nation.""
changelings.5.a:0 "The deer will kneel to us, whether they want to do it covered in their own blood or not."

changelings.6.t:0 "Olenia Yields To Our Might"
changelings.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis scoffed as she read the response from [OLE.GetLeader] to her demands that the entire country submit to the might of the Changeling Hives. "It was that easy? Pathetic," she said, rolling her eyes and passing the response back to an aide to file away safely. "I guess the deer really are frightened prey. I suppose it's a good thing for them we'll be set to look out for them... so long as they give us the love we deserve." She giggled to herself and sat upright on her throne. "Well, fortunately for the deer, the Heer won't get to try out our new toys on them. Those, we'll save for Equestria. The Olenians can rest assured that they have the might of our armies to protect them from Equestrian influence. We will truly be the kindest and most benevolent guardians of the deer we could be, because if any of them say otherwise, they won't be around long enough to say much else." She rubbed her hooves together. "The first domino has fallen...""
changelings.6.a:0 "Onwards to Equestria!"

changelings.7.t:0 "Olenia Refuses To Yield"
changelings.7.d:0 ""The deer have rejected our kind offer to surrender, my Queen," Queen's Guard captain Dieter Heinrich said, tossing the Olenian response on the ground before Queen Chrysalis' throne. "And rather rudely, too. They used language I believe would be improper of me to use in your presence. But, it is just as you expected. The deer are too proud to realize when death is staring them in the face."\n\n"Good," Chrysalis said. "I've been waiting for the opportunity to try out our reorganized Heer. The deer have given me just the excuse to send in the tanks and crush those pathetic creatures beneath their treads. Mobilize the armies. They'll fall before us in moments, crushed under our superior might, and the Olenians will realize what a mistake it was to stand up to us... not that it will save them from what they deserve in the slightest.""
changelings.7.a:0 "They want to do this the hard way? I want to do it the hard way too!"

changelings.8.t:0 "Olenia Surrenders"
changelings.8.d:0 ""Cowards, the lot of them," Hivesmarschall Trimmel said, shaking his head. "I barely started my tanks before the Olenians folded. My Panzers still have half-full tanks of gasoline. The Olenians must be issued white flags with their soldiery kits, because I've never seen so many fly so quickly. I almost shot at them out of frustration. Almost."\n\nQueen Chrysalis frowned down at her Hivesmarschall, though her ire was not for him. "Were they trying to call a bluff? Did [OLE.GetLeader] really not think we would dare to invade Olenia if they refused? How laughable." She shook her head and waved her hoof to dismiss Trimmel. "Very well, if they won't put up a fight, then we have nothing to gain by slaughtering them save for another enemy. The equipment and bugpower we saved from the Olenians surrendering would be best used against Equestria. They will be the real tough nut to crack, and so we must throw everything we have against them. That's where the real fight lies.""
changelings.8.a:0 "Olenia... all that chest pounding and for what? A few dozen dead deer?"

changelings.10.t:0 "War With [VAN.GetName]."
changelings.10.d:0 "A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The city of Vanhoover is one of Equestria's most important naval ports, and not only that, a significant population of changelings lives in and around the city. It's time that we welcome our brothers and sisters back into the fold with open forelegs, and while we're at it, seize the all-important Equestria dockyards in Luna Bay. Not only will these dockyards be put to better use producing ships for our navy, but it will widen the border against Equestria, giving us an opportunity to outflank the Equestrian left and crush their army before the war has even truly begun. We will need every advantage fighting the Equestrian beast, and picking off one of its strongest city-states will benefit us greatly."
changelings.10.a:0 "Vanhoover will fall, and that'll really give Equestria something to worry about."

changelings.11.t:0 "War With [SCS.GetName]."
changelings.11.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [SCS.GetName] have split off from Equestria. Their supplies of crude oil have made them powerful in their own right, but only a valuable prize for us. Seizing their oil supplies will allow us to run our Panzers for longer than we otherwise could have.  We must take control of this oil and grant our army the freedom to drive as far as it can. Yet another piece of Equestria is ready to fall into our hooves!"
changelings.11.a:0 "Their oil shall be ours!"

changelings.12.t:0 "War With [From.GetName]."
changelings.12.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [From.GetName] have split off from Equestria. The fractured state of our greatest enemy shall make them all the easier to conquer. Piece by piece we shall devour Equestria until there is nothing left to conquer. Divided they shall fall to our might!"
changelings.12.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.14.t:0 "War With [STG.GetName]."
changelings.14.d:0 "[STG.GetName] stands in the way of the ambitions of our Glorious Queen. Not only are they ponies that we must conquer, but they are the home of that disgusting ideology called Communism, which stands in direct opposition to the natural hierarchy of the hives and the changeling species. Letting this state fester in continued existence could only be a disaster. They must be crushed immediately, and we shall make them submit by any means necessary!"
changelings.14.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.16.t:0 "Espionage in Equestria"
changelings.16.d:0 "Vaspier Orn Kladisium paced around his desk, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. Held in his magic before him were several plain folders, which he opened and looked through one after the other. Early feelers from the first wave of infiltrators sent into the country had identified several weaknesses within the Equestrian state, ranging from things as simple as factory overseers to levels all the way up to the highest order of government. Though the Equestrians were wary of changeling infiltration owing to the world situation and the failed invasion of Canterlot in 1002, they had yet to close off any ways for VOPS to get a hoof inside of the nation. That would be their undoing.\n\nVaspier set the folders aside and pulled up his roster of agents on standby. The greatest strength of the changeling race was their ability to shapeshift into almost any form, but the average changeling had limits to that ability. Without training, a form could only be assumed for so long, and the impersonation could be imperfect. Those familiar with the individual being impersonated would soon sniff out the falsehood standing before them. But the infiltrators of the VOPS were the best of the best, each extensively trained to perfectly impersonate a target, relentlessly drilled for weeks on every detail and habit of their assumed likeness. These infiltrators, Vaspier would release en masse into Equestria. With perfectly placed spies throughout the Equestrian Army, the resulting chaos and confusion would soon make it impossible for them to resist the swarm.\n\nVaspier let his cigarette burn out, then squashed it in an ashtray. Soon, Equestria, just like that cigarette, would be snuffed out."
changelings.16.a:0 "The Equestrians won't know who to trust when VOPS is through with them."

changelings.17.t:0 "[EQS.GetName] Has Destroyed Our Spy Network!"
changelings.17.d:0 "The Great Imperial Nobody sat at his desk, reviewing the reports coming in from his spies, or at least, the ones that could send reports. The infiltration had worked for a time, and it had worked wonderfully. Noling could deny that. But eventually, the Equestrians developed their own means of detecting changelings, and ever since then, Vaspier had watched as his spy network began to disintegrate. He'd lost two score infiltrators to Equestrian counterespionage, and it wasn't long after that that he had to give the order to stand down and cease operations. Infiltrators were expensive to train, and it took months to complete their training; they were too valuable a resource to squander fruitlessly. Those that could, he'd instructed to continue small-scale espionage and report back any findings he came across, while others he instructed to go to ground or return to changeling lines. Maybe in the future, VOPS would be able to mount another massive infiltration operation, but for now, the Hives would have to be satisfied with what VOPS had managed to accomplish. He only hoped those brutes in the Heer hadn't squandered all the hard work that had gone into gathering intel and exploiting Equestrian weaknesses."
changelings.17.a:0 "Many infiltrators died to bring us this information."

changelings.18.t:0 "Sombra Demands Our Subjugation"
changelings.18.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nTo Chrysalis' surprise, the ambassador refused to do so, and instead cleared his throat. "Queen Chrysalis, I come bearing an ultimatum from His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors. Now that the long-awaited king has finally returned to his throne, it is only right that this continent gives him the respect he deserves. It is the King's command that you bow before him and pledge fealty as a steadfast subject, and in exchange, His Imperial Majesty offers you and your nation his eternal protection."\n\nEvery changeling in the room bristled at the bold demands, and none more so than Chrysalis herself. "Me? Pledge loyalty to a ghost?!" She snarled at the ambassador. "The Queen of the Changelings bows to nobody, least of all a pony!"\n\n"If you do not kneel before His Imperial Majesty, then he will respond with military force, and your pathetic nation will be crushed before his armies, like so many others before you. It is your choice whether you would embrace his friendship, or suffer his wrath.""
changelings.18.a:0 "The only thing Sombra will be getting from the changelings is your body stuffed in a box!"
changelings.18.b:0 "We do not wish to come to blows with King Sombra. We will yield to his rule."

changelings.19.t:0 "Sombra Offers An Alliance!"
changelings.19.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nThe ambassador respectfully dipped his head. It wasn't a full bow, but it was good enough for relations between two monarchies. "His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors, wishes to extend his hoof in an offer of friendship to the Great Queen Chrysalis of the Changeling Hives," the ambassador said. "It is in the benefits of both of our nations to forge an alliance and work in unison to see the destruction of Equestria. Our armies, working together as one, can enslave this continent beneath us. The king eagerly awaits your reply."\n\nChrysalis rubbed her hoof against her chin. An alliance with Sombra? She immediately wanted to reject on the basis that Sombra was little more than a pony, but he was more than that, wasn't he? He had powers that made him more than the average equine, and his military prowess was certainly formidable. Perhaps an alliance would be in the best interest of the Changeling Hives..."
changelings.19.a:0 "Sombra is a pony, and all ponies deserve nothing more than to be subjects of the Changeling Hives!."
changelings.19.b:0 "An alliance will work splendidly! Let us work together to toss Celestia off of her shiny mountain and kick her into the sea!"

changelings.20.t:0 "The War Is Inevitable!"
changelings.20.d:0 ""The time to act is now, my Queen," Hivesmarschall Trimmel said. "The Heer has worked closely with VOPS to analyze the Equestrian defenses, and they are, shall I put it simply, woefully inadequate. We have the soldiers, we have the supplies, and most importantly, we have the willpower to dominate Equestria. All we have to do is storm across the border, give their defenses a solid kick, and the whole rotten structure should come crashing down."\n\nChrysalis frowned, and her wings gave a little flutter. This was the moment she'd been waiting for ever since the disastrous invasion in 1002. She was practically giddy at the chance to have her revenge... but she'd learned lessons from her defeat in Canterlot. It wouldn't do to rush her nation to war before it was ready. "Are you sure that we are prepared? We aren't in need of additional preparations?"\n\nTrimmel resolutely nodded. "We are as ready as we ever will be, my Queen," he assured her. "And now is the time to strike. The longer we wait, the stronger Equestria becomes. They know that war between us inevitable, and every day, they bolster their defenses. An attack can only be readied so much before we see diminishing returns; a defense can be reinforced virtually forever. We must strike now while the iron is hot, or forever miss our chance."\n\nTrimmel's arguments settled it for the Queen. "Then we have no choice but to attack," she said. "Send out the order. The Hives march to war on my command. Not before.""
changelings.20.a:0 "Equestria, your days are numbered!"

changelings.21.t:0 "Lovely Shadows"
changelings.21.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis sighed as she sifted through the stack of papers requiring her attention. This was the part of monarchy she hated: paperwork. No matter what she did, no matter how she tried to escape it, it always found a way to torment her. Perhaps the grunts in her armies had it the best; she much rather would have been fighting in the trenches than scribbling her signature over and over again behind a desk.\n\nAs she shifted a stack of papers, however, a simple envelope fell out. Quirking a brow, Chrysalis picked up the letter and deftly ripped it open with her magic. Inside was a hoofwritten note from King Sombra, and Chrysalis blinked in surprise as she read it over:\n\n"Fairest Queen of the Changeling Hives, I have long had my eye on you. As you surely know, the continuation of a monarchy requires the production of an heir, and only a king is fit to marry a queen of your stature. And you, Chrysalis, are finer than the finest of crystals. Let us bind our two nations together in more ways than one; let us bind them together just as we bind ourselves together as husband and wife. I eagerly await your response.\nSombra"\n\nChrysalis blinked, a fluster beginning to build in her cheeks. Her eyes darted between the letter, the wastebasket, and the pen sitting on her desk. What did she do? Did she toss his letter away and ignore it... or should she instead write a reply?"
changelings.21.a:0 "I never thought I'd settle down and get married, but there's a first for everything."
changelings.21.b:0 "I'm going to pretend I never got this letter and hope that's the end of it."

changelings.22.t:0 "Jungle Nation Wishes to Establish a Protectorate"
changelings.22.d:0 "The pathetic bandits of the jungle know they are no match for our mighty armies. Rather than fighting a sustained guerilla war that would only end in their death, they have offered to surrender to us, in exchange for our protection. It is an arrangement that would benefit both of us, and we could avoid further bloodshed."
changelings.22.a:0 "Sure, why not."
changelings.22.b:0 "Those trees will mark their graves."

changelings.32.d:0 "The radios were alive with covert transmissions from Vaspier's spies. VOPS infiltrators, together with changeling Jaegers, had successfully managed to infiltrate the Equestrian lines. Now, after weeks of preparations and clandestine weapons drops behind the Equestrian army, the infiltrators were ready to strike. Just minutes ago, Vaspier read the confirmation that the saboteurs were ready to strike. And with the Heer already squaring off against the ponies, there was no time like the present. Folding up the report, Vaspier picked up the phone receiver on his desk and spun the dial. He waited until he heard the click of the phone being connected to its destination. "Zero hour is a go," he said into the receiver, and he set it back down. Within seconds, he knew the saboteurs would be moving out to their assignments. All he had to do now was sit back and wait for confirmation of their success."

changelings.36.t:0 "Ditrysium Naval Effort"
changelings.36.d:0 "Building ships is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Unlike a rifle which can be assembled by a single drone, or a tank which is neatly fabricated and welded together by a few changelings in a factory, a ship is practically a town floating on the sea. It takes the efforts of countless dockyards and factories working together to assemble the ship, piece by piece, over weeks of hard work. Ditrysium is the largest of our dockyards and our greatest port, and even it is struggling to keep up with the demands of our navies. Queen Helvia has petitioned Queen Chrysalis for more funding and resources to expand the dockyards and supply the navy with the ships it desperately needs. Unfortunately, the resources we can set aside for Ditrysium cannot do both. We can either expand the dockyards to gain more ships in the long run, or dedicate the resources that could be used to construct those dockyards to instead bolster the construction of our ships, giving us more in the short term. What shall we tell Queen Helvia?"

changelings.37.t:0 "Vraks Factories"
changelings.37.d:0 "Queen Argynnis has recently sent a petition to Vesalipolis, asking for more resources from Queen Chrysalis to bolster the production of equipment greatly needed by our armies. While the industries of Vraks have relentlessly churned out gun after gun and tank after tank, Queen Argynnis argues that Vraks could produce even more were she given the resources she needed to expand its industry. We have a certain amount of funding set aside that we could dedicate to improved military production, and Queen Argynnis will certainly see this money. We, however, have a say in how she uses it. Shall we order the queen to focus on long term investments and use the money to build more factories, or should she focus on the short term and focus on increasing production for as long as the money lasts?"

Among other stipulations it specifies that the Changelings shall have no independent military, all troops shall be under the direct command of the Equestrian generalship, and that their justice system and paramilitary forces will have to take orders from Equestrian advisors hoof selected by Canterlot for their moral character and bureaucratic acumen. It is hoped that these conditions, among others, will prevent another war from ever occurring. However, even now there are those in Canterlot itself who say that this peace treaty will only be remembered the prelude to an even grander and more deadly conflict."

In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

changelingattache.1.d:0 "'Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.'\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer.

Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to!

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."

Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel's fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."

changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n"Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."
changelingattache.14.d_annex:0 "The front pages of newspapers across Griffonia all bore the same headline today, "Changelings issue unconditional surrender, peace in Equestria".\nThe Changeling embassy in Griffenheim confirmed the news, before admitting that their contact with the homeland was now completely cut off. With the Changeling military disintegrating and the future of the entire country up in the air, the question of what to do with the Changeling military mission within the Empire has presented itself. They are now Changelings with no nation, serving under a command that no longer exists.\nThe Changelings of the Expedition have adapted well to Griffonia, with many having absorbed Griffonian customs over the many years they have been present in Griffenheim. Granting them Griffonian citizenship and letting them stay would certainly be an option. Their expertise in warfare has been invaluable in modernizing our military. Thranx, in particular, has made it very clear that he would prefer things to continue as they had before.\nAlternatively, we could simply send them on their way, leaving them whatever fate has in store for them. Whatever our decision, there is no need to worry about attracting the ire of Chrysalis anymore."

They are weak and small, and as such, they should naturally fear us, the strongest nation in the region.\n\nYet diplomacy does not need to fail immediately. What the bears lack in industry, they make up for in other ways. The gold reserves of the bears would go a long way toward strengthening our economy, freeing up funds that could be used elsewhere.

Within hours, the entire resistance network that Thorax had managed to establish across the hives was in ruins, and thousands of changelings had 'disappeared' in the middle of the night. Most Thoraxian supporters are dead, and those that aren't soon will wish they were. Civilian casualties are minimal, and any civilian deaths have been blamed on the actions of the radical Thoraxians as further justification for the need to capture Thorax himself and stop the violence. Civilian awareness of the operation is none. Regrettably, despite our successes, Thorax himself has escaped to one of our eastern neighbours."

changelings.60.d:0 "Every traditional hive-city has a queen as its leader, the highest member of a royal family. The queens of the four most powerful hives accepted Chrysalis as the One Queen of the Changeling Lands, pledging loyalty to her during the era of unification in 980-990s. Queen Argynnis in Vraks, young, snide, yet loyal to Queen Chrysalis, controls the backbone of the changeling armed forces, making them one of the strongest fighting forces in the world. Queen Helvia in Ditrysium, a pragmatic queen and a temperamental ally of Chrysalis, turns the dockyards of her hive toward bolstering the navy to one day wrest control of the seas from the Olenians and Equestrians. Queen Aurantia in Lyctida, Queen Chrysalis' staunchest and most loyal supporter, leads the massive factories of Lyctida in producing equipment and goods for the Hegemony to bolster its capabilities and narrow the gap between the Hives and the industrial powerhouse of Equestria. Queen Yaria in Soryth, a studious queen who believes in the greatness of the changeling species and the glory Queen Chrysalis can give it, devotes her time and effort toward unlocking the magical secrets of her species, with the hopes of one day dominating the world.\n\nAll of these queens together, from disparate regions of the Hegemony, once were at each other's throats. Now, united under Queen Chrysalis, the changeling hives, once bitter enemies, are now staunch allies. Working in unison, who knows what they can accomplish?"
changelings.60.a:0 "They shall remain loyal, or else."

changelings.61.t:0 "Grand Military Parade In Vesalipolis"
changelings.61.d:0 "Today the streets of the hive-city of Vesalipolis were filled to the brim with changelings, with many buzzing above in the air. They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even the other four Hive Queens were present. It was, apart from Queen Chrysalis' coronation as Great Queen of the Changeling Hegemony, the largest parade the city had ever seen.\n\nIn the square, columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarschall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite Jaeger squadrons, Queen's Guard, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was left in awe and convinced of the might of their nation, their belief in the salvation Queen Chrysalis promised them stronger than ever.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun.\n\nThis was just the beginning. Soon, the soldiers and their weapons of war would be turned toward all of the Hegemony's enemies, and one by one, those nations would fall and become nothing more than sources of love for the changeling species."
changelings.61.a:0 "Glory to the Changeling Queendom!"

changelings.63.t:0 "The Hunt for Thorax"
changelings.63.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis stormed into VOPS headquarters in the foulest mood anyling had ever seen her in. She marched past the array of changelings trying desperately to look busy, only briefly pausing to scan them contemptuously before approaching the VOPS head of intelligence, Vaspier Orn Kladisium. She kicked open Vaspier's office and slammed a manila folder onto his desk, snarling with rage as the papers crumpled in her magical grip. Vaspier flinched, but he didn't say anything until his queen had spoken. Interrupting Chrysalis when she was in one of her bouts of fury could be... unwise. "He got away," Chrysalis hissed, her voice deathly quiet. "Thorax escaped."\n\nVaspier slowly nodded, trying to appease his irate queen. "My Queen, I am working hard to locate him right now—"\n\n"Silence," she barked harshly. "You failed, Director. I had half a mind to have you shot as a Thoraxian yourself before I remembered you're just that incompetent. I thought no one was supposed to be able to escape your watch?"\n\n"Forgive my failure," he replied with a wince. It was better to take the Queen's insults on the chin than to try and fight back; defending one's self could easily be misconstrued as treason in the eyes of the furious queen. "We were mounting an operation to capture Thorax, but it appears someling in VOPS tipped him off; he has allies inside the organization as well, it would seem. I am in the middle of reviewing my agents now so that it doesn't happen again."\n\n"There shouldn't BE any Thoraxian spies in MY spy agency in the first place," she replied icily. "That alone doesn't give me any hope that you know what you're doing. Since I want this done right, I'll lay it out for you anyway. He'll flee to a harmonic nation, so send out all the spies we have into Equestria, the Crystal Empire, and Yakyakistan. Disregard any potential political fallout; they will not declare war over apprehending an internal traitor anyway."\n\n"All of them, my Queen?" Vaspier echoed.\n\n"ALL of them!" she nearly roared. "I want him found and dealt with NOW!"\n\nVaspier humbly bowed his head. "Of course, Your Majesty. I'll give the order."\n\nSatisfied, Chrysalis turned to leave. She glanced back over her shoulder, and a hint of a vicious smile crept across her snout. "One more thing, Vaspier." He looked up cautiously. "I want him alive.""
changelings.63.a:0 "As you say, Your Majesty."

changelings.64.t:0 "The Thorax Report"
changelings.64.d:0 "§RTOP SECRET§!\n\n§RVOPS COMMAND EYES ONLY§!\n\nOur intelligence traced Thorax into Yakyakistan. Agents were deployed en masse and equipped with the best recon and signal equipment available, as well as chloroform and other incapacitating chemicals. Infiltration was made difficult by the small sizes of yak communities and the fact that the yaks were already suspicious, so many infiltrators stayed out of inhabited areas and observed from afar. We conjecture Thorax had already spread rumors of changeling action, although it is possible that the yaks near our border have simply become paranoid by nature. We lack any definitive evidence on this point and leave it to further investigation.\n\nRegardless, one of our agents encountered Thorax in Yakistown. Unfortunately, the large number of guards present enabled Thorax to get away before he could be captured. Thorax fled south, pursued by our agents. Miscommunication resulted in his escape into the Crystal Empire, and he arrived in the Crystal City ahead of any of our pursuing agents. We had suspected he would travel there, however, and preemptively stationed spies in the city.\n\nAn assassination would be easy to arrange, but as the mission required him alive, this was not an option. He pled his case in his true form before Princess Cadance, who expressed sympathy with his cause and drew parallels between Chrysalis and Sombra. Another attempt to capture him in the Crystal City went awry as local guards intervened. In a classic display of harmonic weakness, Thorax urged Cadance to show mercy to the spy sent to kidnap him. Our agent has been imprisoned for ten years under espionage charges, and we hope to liberate her soon.\n\nThorax journeyed south to Equestria, where the trail went cold. All attempts to locate him were stymied not by a lack of information, but by a massive amount of contradictory information. Reports flooded in about Thorax's appearance in Baltimare, Las Pegasus, Canterlot, Stalliongrad, Hjortland, and even in Vesalipolis itself. While some of these may be a sign of popular hysteria, it seems more likely that this was deliberately spread in an effort to paralyze VOPS. Regrettably, in this it largely succeeded. At this point we have nowhere to concentrate our investigation on, and it is probable Thorax will flee the continent."
changelings.64.a:0 "Chrysalis isn't going to like this..."

changelings.65.t:0 "Another Option"
changelings.65.d:0 "Chrysalis paced back and forth in her personal quarters. One insolent grub had given the entire Heer and the best agents of VOPS the slip. Incompetents, the lot of them! She was surrounded by idiots, maybe even traitors. While Vaspier was clearly not a traitor, the ease with which Thorax continued to elude him made her suspicious he did have inside help from somewhere in VOPS. With a sigh, she called out to her Queen's Guard captain. "Dieter, please come in."\n\nThe Captain of the Queen's Guard entered with a bow. "What is it, my Queen?"\n\n"You are the only one I can trust for this. I need you to do a top-to-bottom audit of VOPS. No executions, no arrests. Discretion is key; say you're looking through the evidence to try to find Thorax. In truth, your mission will be to find the Thoraxians in VOPS. I don't care about petty corruption, but I will not suffer traitors. Vaspier is above suspicion; he's incompetent but loyal. Consider everyone else a suspect. If you find anything, bring the evidence to me directly. I'll deal with it."\n\nDieter saluted. "At your command."\n\nChrysalis smiled. "Thank you. I did have one other matter to discuss."\n\n Dieter raised an eyebrow quizzically. "What is it, my Queen?"\n\n"As Thorax is currently beyond our reach, I had the idea to hold a trial with a loyal skilled infiltrator masquerading as him. We'll be able to 'charge' him, he'll 'confess', and we'll have him 'executed'."\n\nDieter chose his words carefully. "That would be a useful thing indeed, should we be able to do so successfully. If he is proven to be alive and free, however, the people may be upset at our deception."\n\nChrysalis considered his words. He was right, of course. And yet not doing anything would make the government look weak. What should she do?"
changelings.65.a:0 "We will hold this trial, and broadcast it to the entire nation!"
changelings.65.b:0 "A fake trial isn't worth the potential risks. Just focus on VOPS."

changelings.66.t:0 "The Trial"
changelings.66.d:0 "The infiltrator playing Thorax was marched, chains weighing him down, to the courtroom. In attendance were Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, Hivesmarschall Trimmel, Captain of the Queen's Guard Dieter Heinrich, Director of VOPS Vaspier Orn Kladisium, the accused's brother General Pharynx, and numerous other officers and leaders. A large radio set ensured every word would be transmitted across the nation to countless homes.\n\n"Thorax," Chrysalis called down from her seat. "You stand accused of treason, conspiracy, and terrorism. How do you plead?"\n\n"Guilty," the infiltrator whimpered in Thorax's pathetic voice. "But I was only trying to help our people!"\n\n"And all you had to do was start a conspiracy to overthrow Her Majesty, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of changelings in the process," Dieter replied with a snarl. "My Queen, I urge you, do not let this traitor escape justice!"\n\nChrysalis smiled wickedly. "I wouldn't dream of it, Dieter. Now, Thorax, do you have anything to say to your followers?"\n\n"I never meant to hurt anyone," Not-Thorax pleaded. "I only wanted to bring Harmony to our nation. But it's clear I've failed. So, to any Thoraxians out there, I beg you: stop conspiring. We won't succeed. Our only option is to go into hiding and hope things change someday in the future."\n\nChrysalis nodded her approval. "Good. Then I believe we are done?" When no one spoke up, she nodded. "For his crimes, I sentence Thorax to death by firing squad." The room erupted into cheers. The fake Thorax was escorted out as Chrysalis smiled.\n\nAcross the nation, families of changelings celebrated. Chrysalis had stopped the traitor's schemes and saved the Changeling Lands."
changelings.66.a:0 "For the Queen!"

changelings.67.t:0 "The Response"
changelings.67.d:0 "Last night, a radio message was broadcast across the Changeling Lands, in the voice of someone presumed dead.\n\n"My fellow changelings," Thorax began, "I am pleased to tell you that I am alive and free. Chrysalis failed to capture me, and in her mad rage she decided to fake having done so. I assume she had a Queen's Guard disguise as me and confess to all those crimes. For the record, I deny all charges levied against me. My actions were not treason, but liberation; not terrorism, but resistance. Opposing an unjust regime is the just course of action."\n\n"To all my friends still holding out, I urge you, do NOT give up. Things may be dark now, but I know Harmony isn't doomed. Keep your heads down, and help where you can. Revolution is currently impossible, so we'll have to do good in little ways."\n\nThorax's voice cracked in pain. "Pharynx, I know we have our differences, but please remember that no matter your politics, I still love you. I hope when we meet again, it's as friends and not enemies. Take care of yourself."\n\n"Chrysalis," Thorax continued after a momentary pause, "I will never give up trying to defeat you. But if there is any care left in your black heart for your people, you will not throw away changeling lives because of your own shame over Canterlot. Please, please think of the cost of war. And if you continue to kill and oppress our people... you will meet the same fate all tyrants throughout history have met."\n\n"A state of Free Changeling Hives is still possible. Don't give up hope! Harmony will prevail!"\n\nThough censorship teams were immediately deployed to cover up the address, it seems that the news still managed to slip out into the public consciousness. Today, Chrysalis's government is the laughingstock of the country... at least behind closed doors. While noling would dare mention the incompetence of the Queen and her supporters in broad daylight, many jokes are being held at the expense of the government in private. Even many staunch loyalists are having a good chuckle over the "reanimated traitor," mocking their leaders for their lies and incompetence. "How many Queen's Guards does it take to catch one traitor?" one popular new joke goes. "Two—one to catch him, and one to BE him!""
changelings.67.a:0 "Damn it all."

changelings.68.t:0 "VOPS Audited"
changelings.68.d:0 "Queen's Guard Captain Heinrich reviewed his notes with Vaspier on the recent audit of VOPS. Though Queen Chrysalis had instructed him to go through VOPS by himself to look for Thoraxians, he knew that Vaspier would know what he was up to as soon as he started sniffing around infiltrator files. Instead, he approached Vaspier himself and proposed to work together with The Great Imperial Nobody, knowing that a changeling doesn't get a moniker like that without being more competent than the Queen gave him credit for.\n\n"Four Thoraxians in all," Dieter said, frowning at the notes in front of him. "I'm surprised there were this few."\n\nVaspier only smiled back at him with that insidious smile of his, as if he knew every secret about yourself you knew, and maybe even a few you didn't."I'm surprised there were this many," he said, and Dieter had the suspicion that there were more changelings discreetly removed from VOPS that Vaspier wasn't telling him about. "Though I suppose that's what I get for not handling staff reviews personally. This incident will not happen again."\n\n"It better not," Dieter said, closing his folder of notes and standing up. "Otherwise I don't think you'll be the head of VOPS much longer."\n\n"I'll worry about my head; you worry about yours," Vaspier said with a nod. "After all, calling someling a Thoraxian these days is a very serious allegation. But I think we'll both get through this just fine, so long as we stick together."\n\nThough Vaspier's warning made his shell crawl, Dieter merely gave the head of VOPS a curt salute. "Of course.

He graduated in November 993 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January the following year where he was posted to various locations in Equestria after being assigned to 46th Infiltrator Brigade. Serving with distinction in the Winter Revolution of Stalliongrad along with the rest of the Changelings supporting the nascent communist revolt, his first combat experience was on 22 August 995 as a platoon commander near Severokholm, when – catching the Equestrian Royal Guard garrison unprepared – Hauptmann Trimmel and three of his infiltrators opened fire on them without ordering the rest of his platoon forward. For his actions throughout the Winter Revolution, Trimmel was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class alongside the medals his Severyana persona had acquired such as the Medal "For the Defence of Petershoof" and Medal "For Battle Merit". Shortly before the end of the conflict he falsified his persona's and infiltrator platoon's death in service to Stalliongrad and returned to the Changeling Lands to be promoted to Oberst and quickly being reassigned back to Equestria to take take over another disguise as an agent in the Equestrian General Staff for the invasion of Equestria in 1002. Whilst his actions severely hampered Equestria's capabilities to respond to Chrysalis' lighting assault on the capital, failure was nonetheless tasted that day. Upon the demotion of Hivemarshall Synovial, Trimmel received his position from Chrysalis as one Oberst who had 'not failed her miserably'. Since then he has reformed the military to adopt his and Chrysalis' image of fast and heavy hitting mobile military force capable of crushing all those who oppose the Changelings.\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

He immediately made his way to Vesalipolis to demand an audience with Queen Chrysalis, though what was spoken between the two of them is known only to them.

Hatched a few minutes too late after Queen Helvia, their mother left Recina mostly to fend for herself and focused instead on Helvia. As a result of her upbringing consisting of mostly being surrounded by drones more so than by her siblings and barely loved, Recina's physical status and magical capability are notably reduced for a Royal Changeling; so much so that she is mistaken for a Royal Male at times. Had it not been for Helvia's support and personal friendship, Recina may have wasted away as a nymph.\n\nHowever, Recina's innate knack for leadership is as sharp as that of any queen, and she found her calling in the navy, where she proved to be a very capable admiral. Ditrysium's submission to Queen Chrysalis and the subsequent mutiny of the Ditrysium sailours brought a halt to Recina's rise to fame, as the Vesalipolis Queen saw Recina as a threat, even though she had nothing to do with the mutiny. Recina's forced retirement was both unceremonious and a personal slight against her. Queen Chrysalis even planned to have Recina executed were it not for Helvia's timely intervention.\n\nBringing Recina out of retirement wasn't easy, for she had strong reservations against serving under Chrysalis. However, through Helvia's convincing and respect for her sister, Recina agreed to take on the job once more, this time under the leadership from Vesalipolis.\n\nAn aviation enthusiast, Recina brings to the forefront the importance of air power in naval combat and is the foremost proponent of carrier development, arguing that a naval airforce would be able to strike farther and harder than a conventional fleet.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

CHN_post_war_1:0 "Pax Chrysalia"
CHN_post_war_1_desc:0 "The Changeling Queendom reigns supreme across Equus. The Diarchy has fallen, and with it, the Equestrian nation-state, crushed under the panzer treads and jackboots of the Heer. From the ashes of the Great War, the incipient Pax Chrysalia extends its tendrils across the continent, to usher forth a new era of Changeling domination and prosperity."
CHN_post_war_1_a:0 "Die Dekompression"
CHN_post_war_1_a_desc:0 "Where the fires of rabid militarism had been avidly stoked, to guide the Changeling Hives into becoming a society geared towards the perpetuation of total war, the triumph of the Pax Chrysalia means that the immense burden of the war effort can now be relieved. The industry and socioeconomic system of the Queendom must be retooled, so to facilitate the business of peace as it did the butchery of war."
CHN_post_war_1_b:0 "Harbingers of Peace"
CHN_post_war_1_b_desc:0 "Winning the Great War was but the first step in the realisation of the Pax Chrysalia. Whilst our victorious troops occupy the smouldering ruins of Equestria's cities, the arduous task of asserting Changeling rule over the vast continental interior must begin apace. Every town, village, and hamlet, however inconsequential, must know their place as loyal possessions of their new Queen."
CHN_post_war_2:0 "Minions for the Queen"
CHN_post_war_2_desc:0 "It would take hundreds upon thousands of skilled, well-trained infiltrators to assume every single position of power on every level of Equestrian society. Thus: while the agents of the VOPS focus on the impersonation of a select few ponies of significance, the day-to-day of ruling over our Queen's new Equestrian subjects must, regrettably, be delegated to pony collaborationists of dubious reliability."
CHN_post_war_2_a:0 "Changeling Corpocracy"
CHN_post_war_2_a_desc:0 "The insatiable, ravenous appetite of the military-industrial complex must be sated, if the Changeling war machine is to remain robust and virile. The virgin lands of Equestria, rich in natural resources and other treasures, lie ripe for the extraction of mineral wealth, though the plundering will necessitate increased vigilance on the part of our occupying troops."
CHN_post_war_2_b:0 "With Bark AND Bite"
CHN_post_war_2_b_desc:0 "Equestria was shattered in the Great War, but the ponies refuse to acknowledge defeat. Before the Heer lies the arduous and nigh-impossible task of enforcing the Pax Chrysalia upon a restive, resentful populace. Our approach to the occupation must be one that is flexible and pragmatic, capable of seizing every opportunity to chip away at the Equestrian spirit of defiance."
CHN_post_war_2_c:0 "No Rest for the Wicked"
CHN_post_war_2_c_desc:0 "Sizeable swathes of the Equestrian population languish in prison camps; POWs, dissidents, prominent pony leaders, and other undesirables. The amount of resources and personnel dedicated to their incarceration is quite extortionate. The formation of a penal service corps comprised of such criminals will allow them to work for their rehabilitation by contributing to the economy as unskilled labour."
CHN_post_war_2_d:0 "Friendship is Conditional"
CHN_post_war_2_d_desc:0 "Equestria is a broken and humiliated foe, having ceased to exist as a sovereign entity after the Great War. However, the trappings of diplomacy may prove useful in promoting compliance within the population; sham treaties of so-called "friendship" and "cooperation" will serve to codify the Equestrian defeat and legitimize Changeling governance over their lands — shackles cast in a mummery of legality."
CHN_post_war_2_e:0 "Muzzle All Dissent"
CHN_post_war_2_e_desc:0 "Dissident thought must be weeded out before it can become infectious. The VOPS has a blacklist of outspoken Equestrians who are disproportionately influential. The Queen's Guard want to go further; any who speak out, changeling or pony alike, must be eliminated with maximum prejudice. After all, it only takes one voice to share an idea, and ideas, once shared, become the seeds for revolution..."
CHN_post_war_2_f:0 "Aid the Reconstruction"
CHN_post_war_2_f_desc:0 "While a self-sufficient Equestrian economy is not our goal, we can not be complacent in the impending socioeconomic collapse of our occupied territories. Offering conditional financial support to businesses will hopefully keep ponies employed and capital moving through the recovering economy of Equestria, which will, in the end, bring money back to the Hives."
CHN_post_war_2_g:0 "Revive War Production"
CHN_post_war_2_g_desc:0 "Before the Heer rolled into Equestrian cities, the war economy of the pony nation had been churning out equipment at such a high rate of production that it might have been able to rival our own, given time. While this fact should be hidden from the general public, we can take advantage of the captured Equestrian war industry put to enlarge and enhance our own military production capabilities."
CHN_vraks_looting_concern:0 "Das KuKC Erforschung- und Extraktion Konzern"
CHN_vraks_looting_concern_desc:0 "Having increased the demand for raw resources tenfold through the upscaling of military production, the Hives' capitalists now clamour for the creation of a central resource management agency administered jointly by the Changeling state and its corporations, to streamline the extraction of natural resources from territories across the Hegemony and their delivery to the factories of the Hives."
CHN_post_war_2_h:0 "The Recovery's a Racket!"
CHN_post_war_2_h_desc:0 "The process of rebuilding the Equestrian economy is one rife with business opportunities for the Hives' industrial cartels. Under the aegis of the Equestrian Reconstruction Agency, assets from dismantled Equestrian corporations are sold to their erstwhile Changeling competitors on the cheap, in return for investments in the ERA's reconstruction budget. Peace begets profits."
CHN_post_war_2_i:0 "Seize Equestrian Assets"
CHN_post_war_2_i_desc:0 "The total dissolution of the Equestrian state meant that swathes of industry, previously having been nationalised to contribute to the pony war effort, can now be considered Bona Vacantia and thus up for grabs. The Hives' industrialists and capitalists will have to make some difficult choices, to prioritise what assets to seize and what to leave behind."
CHN_post_war_2_j:0 "Pony Volunteer Corps"
CHN_post_war_2_j_desc:0 "The Pax Chrysalia dictates that Ponies must be subservient to Changelings, as is our birthright. Those compradors who elevate themselves above their race have been duly rewarded, though the Queen is disinterested in her equine subjects in general; she cares not for those who will not love her. Perhaps this can change, if, given a chance, the ponies can prove that they are worth something still."
CHN_post_war_2_k:0 "Aktionsplan Bedeckt"
CHN_post_war_2_k_desc:0 "Coming into possession of Equestrian territory means we have also gained access to many testing sites and vast quantities of valuable research and knowledge, as well as the know-how of Equestrian scientists themselves. The VOPS will be tasked with the consolidation and conscription of all such assets, tangible and intangible, into the service of the Hives and the Heer."
CHN_post_war_2_l:0 "The Queen's Own Thestral Jägers"
CHN_post_war_2_l_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis was rather pleased by the formation of the RPVC; more specifically, with the imagery of pony soldiers serving in Changeling uniform. She has requested the creation of a new personal bodyguard unit comprised of thestral soldiers trained in jaeger tactics, as a symbol of her rulership over Equestria — after all, even Celestia herself could not command the loyalty of the thestrals."
CHN_post_war_2_m:0 "The Seaddle Protocol"
CHN_post_war_2_m_desc:0 "The brainchild of Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio, the Seaddle Protocol is a regulatory and doctrinal manual for the efficient and sustainable extraction of Love from the Equestrian populace. The Queen's Guard view the Protocol's constraints on Love harvesting with apprehension, but Marsilio's allies see it as the only way to achieve a stable working relationship between Changeling dependents and Pony providers."
CHN_post_war_3:0 "Rule of the High Tower"
CHN_post_war_3_desc:0 "Atop the Great Queen's Tower that dominates the Vesalipolis skyline, the Queen holds court, presiding over her empire. Within the lavish offices in the topmost stories, all the way down to the Tower's hive-like subterranean levels, armies of bureaucrats tirelessly toil to carry out the functions of the Changeling state. As the Hegemony grows to engulf Equestria, so too does the Tower's reach."
CHN_post_war_3_a:0 "VOPS Proliferation"
CHN_post_war_3_a_desc:0 "It would not be much of an exaggeration to call the VOPS the most powerful intelligence agency in the world. Certainly, the services of the infiltrator corps have proved indispensable during the Great War. With the dawn of the Pax Chrysalia, the focus of the VOPS now turns from espionage to counterinsurgency, to engage in the unenviable task of seeing that the fragile post-war peace endures across Equestria."
CHN_post_war_3_b:0 "Victor's Justice"
CHN_post_war_3_b_desc:0 "As we have won, it is our luxury to decide what to do with the Equestrian military high command, those monsters responsible for so many war crimes.

CHN_post_war_3_g:0 "Nip it in the Bud!"
CHN_post_war_3_g_desc:0 "The resistance that covers much of Equestria is like a cancer, or like a strangling vine choking the life out of the glory of the Pax Chrysalia.

We must destroy the resistance while it is still small, or suffer the consequences when it grows even larger!"

CHN_post_war_3_h_desc:0 "From its roots in the elite hive-militias of Vesalipolis, to its baptism by fire during the unification of the Changeling Lands, to the conquest of Equestria, the Queen's military has always encouraged flexibility, innovation, and initiative — a culture that, hopefully, shall expedite the Heer's postbellum transition into a capable peacekeeping and counterinsurgency force. Improvisieren, anpassen, überwinden!"
CHN_post_war_3_i:0 "Meritocratic Promotions"
CHN_post_war_3_i_desc:0 "The Queen's Guard expanded hugely in the aftermath of the Great War, and their sycophants are more numerous than ever. The Royal Changeling Heer has not grown quite as fast; instead, we have had to downsize to better ration our Love reserves. With the limited amount of promotions we can give out, we must pick the best candidates not merely by their devotion to the Queen, but by their success in battle."
CHN_post_war_3_j:0 "Learned Helplessness"
CHN_post_war_3_j_desc:0 "The concept of learned helplessness states that the more a creature is exposed to a negative stimulus, the more accepting of the stimulus it becomes as it learns its situation is hopeless and will not change. Repeated punishment of the Equestrian population of a whole must therefore be executed until they realize their situation is hopeless and they cease their resistance."
CHN_post_war_4:0 "Triumph of the Hives"
CHN_post_war_4_desc:0 "With the utter and total defeat of Equestria in the Great War, the humiliation of the Canterlot Defeat in 1002 has been rightfully avenged. Future generations of changelings shall know of the glorious triumph of their forebears over the perfidious Equestrian nation, whose alicorn monarchs were ultimately no match for the masterful cunning and strategic brilliance of the Great Queen Chrysalis."
CHN_post_war_4_a:0 "Military Modernisation"
CHN_post_war_4_a_desc:0 "Emerging battle-hardened from the Great War, the Heer is the sword and shield of the Pax Chrysalia. Where our technological superiority and doctrinal innovation had given us a clear advantage over the Equestrians, the neverending process of modernising the military must continue apace if the Heer is to maintain its edge in the imminent arms race with whatever power arises as hegemon in Griffonia."
CHN_post_war_4_b:0 "Pacify Ponyville"
CHN_post_war_4_b_desc:0 "With the Equestrian heartland under our rule, it is time to mark our territory and impress Changeling sovereignty upon the region. First and foremost of such acts will be the erasure of the Castle of Friendship not only from the physical realm, but in a metaphysical sense as well. We shall purge this symbol of Equestria from existence, and ensure that no pony may heed its call ever again."
CHN_post_war_4_c:0 "Prep the Siedlungsplan"
CHN_post_war_4_c_desc:0 "The colonization of the Equestrian northwest by Changeling settlers has always been an integral part of the expansionist plans of the Great Queen.

CHN_post_war_4_l:0 "Celebrate the Veterans"

CHN_post_war_4_m:0 "Glorify the Heer"
CHN_post_war_4_m_desc:0 "While the Heer is already the single most powerful military institution in all of Equus, its stalwarts believe that the war machine still needs more patronage to achieve its full potential. A documentary film sponsored by Hivesmarschall Trimmel has been produced to show off all the greatest triumphs of the Heer throughout the Great War, and why the military deserves even more of the Queen's attention."
CHN_post_war_4_n:0 "Establish Forward Operating Bases"
CHN_post_war_4_n_desc:0 "The ongoing modernisation of Changeling military operational doctrine necessitates the construction of infrastructure to complement the Heer's new role as the peacekeepers of Equus.

CHN_post_war_A_desc:0 "With the industrial revolution, came railroads — the arteries of any modern nation through which trade and labour flow. Whilst much of Equestria's rail network was put out of commission during the Great War, their revitalisation offers up another avenue for the Heer to enforce its control over the restless countryside — with battalions of armoured locomotives, war-trains akin to fortresses on rails."
CHN_post_war_B:0 "Regional Commissariats"
CHN_post_war_B_desc:0 "Assuming that the Heer is able to put down the worst of the unrest and establish functional and stable governance over occupied Equestrian territory, the next step would be the devolution of military rule to quasi-civilian administrations run by local collaborationists, backed up by downsized but permanent garrison units. Hopefully, such limited autonomy will be a sustainable model for regional stability."

On every battlefield in every theatre, the pony armies have been routed, crushed, and scattered to the winds. The enemy's organized resistance has been put to an end, and its leaders - those who haven't fled into exile, at least - have formally surrendered in Canterlot. The Great War is over.\n\nBut while the changelings back home pour into the streets in celebration from Vraks to Vesalipolis, those 'lings tasked with garrisoning our new gains are far from jovial. For while Equestria's armed forces lie in ruin, the fighting spirit of the ponies now under changeling rule will be much harder to pacify. As former soldiers melt back into their hometowns with fresh scars and painful memories of the bitter fighting on the front, the civilian population is beginning to mobilize in a way it hadn't during the war. There is much work to be done if we want to guarantee our hold over Equestria will stand the test of time.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has proclaimed this new era the "Pax Chrysalia", but those words are as hollow as the bells that toll our victory.\n\nConquering Equestria was the easy part. Holding on to it will be a much harder task."

Presiding over a mountain of captured Equestrian flags  —  many still battle-scarred and bloodstained  —  Queen Chrysalis declared the dawn of a Golden Age for the changeling race, having cast off the shackles of Equestrian "harmony" to assume their birthright as the hegemon of Equus.\n    Whilst the Queen's speech was met with overwhelming popular approval, the future of the Pax Chrysalia remains uncertain. The intense militarism of the hives and the robustness of the changeling military-industrial complex had propelled the Queendom to victory, but with the Equestrian menace vanquished, the transition to peacetime may be harder for some than most."

The victory in the Great War, the Queen proclaimed, has saved the changeling race from starvation and extinction. Furthermore, the Great War showcased the obvious primacy of racial unity over the laggard and wasteful ideals of peace and harmony, with a firm kick to the door being all it took to send the whole rotten structure of Equestria crashing to the ground. Finally, the Queen promised to distribute enough Love for each and every changeling to never have to worry about feeling weak or hungry again."

changelings_paxchrysalia.1.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs scribbled his signature onto yet another directive on his makeshift desk and let out a sigh, the sound echoed a thousand times by the towering and empty walls of the old throne room in Canterlot. Until a new administrative center could be built in the occupied pony capital, Generalmajor Jachs and his staff had set up a temporary headquarters inside of the castle. It might as well have been his new home also; after being installed to oversee the changeling occupation of Canterlot, his life had become nothing but a frantic flurry of paperwork as he tried to build a new governing apparatus from scratch, with little time for sleep, food, or personal hygiene in the meanwhile.\n\nThe doors at the far end of the throne room burst open, and a female 'ling buzzed into the throne room, passing by the half-dozen makeshift desks and tables where other members of Jachs' staff similarly toiled away. She landed in front of Jachs' desk and saluted, her posture picture perfect as ever. "Generalmajor!"\n\nJachs tore his eyes away from the papers on his desk, grateful for the momentary reprieve. "At ease, Oberstleutnant Alcippe. What is it?"\n\n"Missive directly from the Queen, sir," Alcippe said, holding out a piece of paper clutched in a chitinous hoof.\n\nJachs groaned and rubbed his eyes. "Read it for me, would you?

I will be visiting Canterlot in two weeks time, and I expect you to pull out all the stops for my arrival. This parade must be the greatest Equestria, no, the world has ever seen. The procession must last all day, from sunrise to sunset, with flyovers from our proud Luftwaffe heralding the procession of our panzer brigades down Mane Street. The survivors of the Royal Guard must be driven before our forces in chains, and the Canterlonian nobility will personally swear fealty to me in the Plaza of the Sun. Afterwards, there will be a feast to celebrate Equestria's new Pax Chrysalia that I have brought to them. Make it happen.'"\n\nJachs stared blankly at Alcippe as he began to realize the scope of the Queen's demands. After a moment, Alcippe tucked the note away and cleared her throat, smiling apologetically. "I... suppose this means a lot of work for us, doesn't it?"\n\nJachs pushed his chair away from his desk and stood up. "Come on, Oberstleutnant," he called over his shoulder as he passed Alcippe by.

changelings_paxchrysalia.2.t:0 "The Queen's Canterlot Rally"
changelings_paxchrysalia.2.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs struggled to stay awake as the parade rolled into its fifth hour. The past two weeks had seen him collect only a few hours of sleep in total, and he'd become increasingly reliant on refined mother's Love to keep his energy up to plan this nightmare of a parade. But as a formation of changeling fighter-jets swooped over Canterlot with a deafening growl from their engines, he allowed himself a little smile. He'd truly delivered everything Chrysalis had wanted, and then some.\n\nThe Queen herself sat only a few seats away, a giddy — almost crazed — smile on her muzzle. The display of changeling might, juxtaposed with equine humiliation, was as satisfying to her as the purest Love in all the land. It was practically impossible for the Queen to retain her regal air; instead, she was more like a foal on Hearth's Warming Eve, or whatever the stupid Equestrian expression was. At the very least, a happy Chrysalis was infinitely preferable to a disappointed Queen.\n\nWhen it came time for the nobles to swear their fealty to her, however, the cracks in the facade began to show. The assembly of high-society types below the Queen refused to repeat the oath of loyalty until Oberstleutnant Alcippe prompted them with the first sentence twice more, and even then they only did so begrudgingly. And as Generalmajor Jachs looked out on the faces of the ponies who had been driven out of their homes to provide an audience for the spectacle, the only thing he saw was hatred and anger.\n\nJachs swallowed hard and rubbed his eyes. The Queen was enjoying playing with her toys, yes... but it wouldn't be long before the pieces arrayed themselves against their master. And no matter how hard he tried, the Generalmajor knew that all the tanks and planes in the world couldn't help him hold Equestria if the ponies never accepted the Changeling Hives as their new overlord.\n\nThe parade itself was a masterpiece, sure, but the sleepless nights had hardly ended."

Instead of adopting her bombastic (and unrealistic) vision for a victory parade, the Generalmajor and Oberstleutnant Alcippe had sided with caution, cutting the parade down to only a few hours and keeping the citizens of Canterlot inside of their homes for the Queen's safety. While planes roared overhead and tanks rumbled down the streets, Queen Chrysalis' expression remained sour for most of the parade. It was quite obvious this hadn't been what she'd intended.\n\nWhen it came time for the nobles to swear their fealty to the Queen, it was at the end of changeling rifles gathered around the perimeter of the Plaza of the Sun. Though the oath of loyalty went off without a hitch, it was quite obvious to everyling present that there was little honesty carried in the words. It was at that point that the Queen left the parade in disgust and had the feast planned for after the event cancelled. "If these worthless ponies won't feed me their Love, then I won't feed them their bread," she proclaimed, right before flitting back to the castle.\n\nJachs and Alcippe shared worried looks from across the aisle. They'd disappointed Chrysalis, and the Queen did not tolerate disappointments."

That parade was barely worthy of being called a street fair in Soryth! This was supposed to be my grand moment of triumph, my hour of victory, and it was pathetic!"\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe shared nervous looks, the two changelings inching a little further away from their furious queen. "Your majesty, it was for your safety," Jachs began, jumping on the grenade for his inferior. "Canterlot is not yet pacified, and straining our resources like that-!"\n\n"I don't care!" Chrysalis snarled, turning on the two changelings. "These are ponies, Generalmajor. They are weak and pathetic little creatures. And you're telling me that Equestria is a threat to us still?!\n\n"Not to us, of course not," Jachs clarified, attempting to calm the Queen's rage. "Equestria is dead, its army dissolved. It poses no threat to our nation. But the ponies... all it takes is one bullet, your Majesty..."\n\nQueen Chrysalis scowled at him. "Who is in charge of the garrison in this city, Generalmajor? Who kept the ponies trapped in their homes, making it plain to them all that we're so afraid of them we have to keep them locked up?"\n\n"Major Vascen, your Majesty."\n\nChryaslis picked up one of the chairs and crushed it into twigs with her magic before scattering the splinters across the floor. "Tell Major Vascen that his services are no longer required in my army, and put someling that's not afraid of ponies in his place. The ponies must fear us, not the other way around!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.5.d:0 ""Is it everything you need, Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio?"\n\nMarsilio, recently promoted Surgeon-General of the Royal Changeling Heer, looked over his new office in Seaddle. All his papers and books had arrived from Vesalipolis earlier that day, and a few drones had spent the past hour or so putting his office together for him. The room was a little more open than he was used to, given that the building was a repurposed Olenian administrative center, and the deer preferred higher ceilings and deeper walls to accommodate their antlers, but it would do splendidly for his next assignment. Still, it didn't hurt to double check that the mosquito brains that made up the Queen's Guard had actually bothered to read all his instructions for the move. "Have all the reports been collected across Olenia and Equestria?"\n\n"Of course, Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio," the soldier standing by his side assured him. "The binders are on your desk."\n\n"Good." The Surgeon-General waved the soldier away with a hoof. "Then let me get to my work. I shudder to imagine how strained our armies have made our supply lines of Love."\n\nThe changeling saluted, and then he was gone, leaving Marsilio on his own. Slowly shaking his head, the Surgeon-General walked around his desk and sat down in the high-backed chair, pulling the first of many binders closer. Snatching a pad of paper and a pencil, the changeling began to sift through the pages upon pages of Love collections and expenditures all across the Royal Heer, making notes of shortages in the supply lines. Judging by the inefficiencies in the shipments, however, it was becoming all too obvious that the old collection systems were ill-suited for the task at hoof: someway, somehow, supplying all of the Royal Heer, and the citizens of the Changeling Hives themselves, with enough Love to sustain continued changeling occupation of its annexed territories. The Royal Heer and the Queen's Guard had so far been unable to figure things out, and that was why Queen Chrysalis herself had promoted Marsilio to be the nation's new Surgeon-General. If there was any changeling that could solve the deepening crisis, it was him.\n\n"So long as I don't get tied down with red tape," he muttered to himself."
changelings_paxchrysalia.5.a:0 "By the Queen's command, it will be done."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6.t:0 "A Crisis in the Making"
changelings_paxchrysalia.6.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio stared at the black letters on the summary in front of him as if they were a death sentence. From the moment he had arrived in Seaddle and gotten his team situated in their new office, he'd had them crunching numbers and revising projections day and night to solve the growing Love crisis snaring its tendrils around the Heer and grinding its gears to a halt. While old methods of subsistence Love harvesting had worked for the army as it rampaged through Equestria's lands, now that the war was over and the whole of the pony nation needed to be subdued and administered, it had become clear that this informal collection was unsustainable and completely inefficient for the long-term garrisons needed to keep control of the land. As things stood, the army could not be expected to maintain its Love supplies off of harvesting from equine POWs and bleeding entire towns dry. A change was desperately needed.\n\nThankfully, while his team had focused their efforts on understanding the growing Love shortage, Marsilio had dedicated his time to developing a new harvesting system. Dense population centers would be prioritized over sparsely populated villages, and Love would be collected from the populace on a quarterly basis, with only half the population paying their Love tax at a time to leave able bodies still capable of maintaining the necessities of day-to-day living. Importantly, ponies would not be drained to the point of exhaustion and weakness; the less of a hassle it was for them, the less inclined they would be to fight back against the Love collectors. All in all, Marsilio's proposed system would be effective, streamlined, and efficient. But there was only one problem: no matter how hard he crunched the numbers, no matter how much he tweaked a variable here or there, he always came to the same conclusion.\n\nThe Heer could not sustain the army it had conquered Equestria with. It was simply too large and bloated. And if something wasn't done to trim off the fat, the only way to keep it fueled would be to bleed Equestria dry."
changelings_paxchrysalia.6.a:0 "Something has to give."

changelings_paxchrysalia.7.t:0 "Skepticism from the Heer"
changelings_paxchrysalia.7.d:0 ""...and that leaves us with only one viable option for the long term stability of our nation and our army," Marsilio finished, tapping a baton against the graph projected against the screen in the headquarters of the Royal Changeling Heer. "We must curtail the excesses of the Heer and demilitarise. It is the only way to keep sufficient reserves available for our armies in case we must deal with another threat."\n\nMarsilio watched the generals with hawk-like eyes, quickly gauging to see if he'd gotten through to them in the past hour. Judging by the bored faces and sour frowns, however, he had not. That was made all the more apparent when Generaloberst Dieter Heinrich, Captain of the Queen's Guard, dismissively waved his hoof. "Conjecture and worry," he said, rolling his eyes. "The system as it stands now works just fine. After all, it gave us the supplies we needed to win the war. And now you want to scale back the Heer?" He scoffed, collecting snickering from the other officers in the room. "Such a defeatist attitude is unbecoming of you, Generaloberstabsarzt."\n\nMarsilio forced himself to take a breath before rising to Dieter's challenge. "Taking Equestria was one thing, Generaloberst," Marsilio began. "Holding it is another matter entirely. The war is over; there is no more need for the Heer to remain as engorged and bloated as it is. If we do not scale things back, then our glorious Heer will collapse in on itself from Love shortages everywhere." He allowed himself to glare at the vain Queen's Guard captain. "And eventually you will run out of villagers to squeeze for Love until they're withered husks."\n\n"The system will gone on as it always has," Heinrich proclaimed, remaining adamant as always. "Besides that, implying that our treatment of these conquered equines is cruel or harsh also implies that they're even worth caring about. They'll fulfill their purpose like any other livestock."\n\n"They aren't livestock, they are people!" Marsilio shouted back. "And if we don't treat them with some respect, then they will fight back!"\n\n"People?" Generaloberst Dieter had a laugh at that. "I think I prefer my opinion to yours, Generaloberstabsarzt. This meeting is over."\n\nAs the Changeling High Command began to rise from their seats and file out of the room, Marsilio looked down at the binder in his hooves, the words 'PROTOCOL FOR THE SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE COLLECTION OF LOVE' printed across the front. If the High Command wouldn't listen, then he had to somehow convince the Queen herself..."

Somehow, by pulling every favour he had to his name and arranging a few generous gifts that some less scrupulous changelings might call bribes, the Generaloberstabsarzt had arranged for his new protocols for Love extraction to bypass the Changeling High Command and make it directly to the Queen herself. And even more amazingly, the Queen had apparently read through the proposal with interest and ordered it be implemented all across the newly annexed lands. Somehow, for once, reason had triumphed in the upper echelons of the Changeling Hives. It was enough to make Marsilio light a cigarette in celebration — never mind that he'd quit two years ago.\n\nThe Seaddle Protocol, as it had been formally named, would be a radical change of the changeling Love collection system, taking irregular and oftentimes life threatening harvesting and institutionalizing it as a regular part of life for those under changeling rule. Regular harvests every month would drain half of a population center of their Love, leaving the other half to care for those harvested, until the roles would be reversed the following month. The semi-regular and harmless collections would be sufficient to keep the Love flowing into the Hives as much as it was needed, without riling up the anger of those providing it to the collectors. After all, the benefits of stable changeling rule would more than outweigh a slight inconvenience every month when the Love collectors came to town. Given some time, there wouldn't be any fuss about the quarterly harvests at all."

changelings_paxchrysalia.9.d:0 "Disturbing reports have reached us about an Equestrian town that was recently visited by members of the Queen's Guard in western Equestria. The company, upon arriving at the town, immediately rounded up all the civilians present and brought them to the town square under threats of violence. Once there, the ponies were led off one by one into the local doctor's office, where they were forcibly drained of every last ounce of Love in their bodies until they were little but withered husks, like squeezing juice from a lemon.\n\nThe bodies were found in an open pit behind the town, an undignified mass grave from nearly a hundred innocent civilians. Changelings and ponies alike throughout the Hives have been left horrified by the news, with many expressing their outrage against the Queen's Guard itself. Generaloberst Dieter Heinrich, captain of the Queen's Guard, defended the actions of his soldiers, claiming that they needed Love just like any other changelings, and placing the blame on the ponies of Equestria for not being more compliant with ongoing Love harvesting techniques, making regular harvesting more difficult than it needs to be. The Generaloberst then stated that Love harvesting will continue as usual before abruptly ending the interview."

Most watched the changelings gathered around with anxious looks, instinctively huddling closer together as they warily eyed the changelings manning the perimeter with rifles and machine guns. A few soldiers rounded up the stragglers hiding inside of their homes, and within an hour, the entire population of the town had been brought together.\n\nMarsilio kept a keen eye trained on the faces of the ponies as the changelings split the assembled ponies into two groups. Then, leading one group forward, they began to power up the machinery gathered around them. A pink glow surrounded the ponies, causing many to flinch or cry out... but their cries faded away into confused murmuring as nothing drastic or terrible happened. In a few seconds it was all over, leaving the assembled ponies looking a little sluggish and tired, but none the worse for wear. The rest of the assembled changelings dismissed them, packing up the equipment, and politely reminding the other half of the town that they would be back in a month for their turn. As the two groups reunited in the middle of town, surprised whispers bounced back and forth between them, with many ponies watching with disbelief as the changelings readied themselves to move on. There was even a little bit of laughter as the two sides shared a few embraces.\n\nMarsilio allowed himself the tiniest hint of a smile as he climbed back into the passenger seat of the collection truck. Laughter was good. That meant it hadn't been too traumatizing for those involved. And if the ponies were able to laugh about it once it was all over, then the next collection would be even easier. Given enough time, the simple Love harvests would become just another part of life for these ponies."

changelings_paxchrysalia.11.d:0 "Panzerzugkommandant Gossamer watched the rails gleam ahead of her locomotive under the glow of the moonlight above, like two silver lines stretching into nothing beyond the cab's headlamps. Today marked the first test of the new armoured trains that would ferry jägerbrigaden to wherever they would need to be deployed, to suppress the Equestrian resistance cells plaguing the countryside between Ponyville and the occupied pony capital. The narrow mountain passes and steep ascent up to Canterlot necessitated the use of armoured vehicles able to defend themselves, and the small roads limited how much tonnage military trucks could carry to and from the city. But the rail lines were already there, and they were too difficult to access for any creature that couldn't fly, which meant they would be relatively safe from resistance operations.\n\nAt least, that's what Gossamer hoped. The locomotive under her command wasn't much of a war train. Instead, it was an old passenger train covered with armoured plating, protected by a motley armament of obsolete weaponry; mounted atop its carriages were antiquated howitzers, and the tailmost caboose was crowned with a pillbox bristling with machine-guns. Though a far cry from the real war trains still being assembled, Gossamer's ride had speed, armour, and most importantly of all, mass, and while she worried about forcing the armoured train to haul itself up the mountainside to Canterlot, she barely had to do anything except touch the brakes now and then when coasting down to Ponyville. And as the headlamp on the train illuminated a makeshift barricade assembled across the train tracks, and the haggard ponies armed with anti-tank rifles behind it, Gossamer soon realized that an abundance of mass was perhaps the repurposed Friendship Express' greatest strength. No sooner had the ponies began firing did Gossamer release the brakes, hunkering down in the cabin while the armoured plates defeated the anti-tank rounds with deafening booms. A moment later, she faintly heard frightened screams over the sounds of the engine chugging in front of her, and the whole train shook and shuddered as its plow tore through the barricade, scattering pieces of it — and presumably the ponies behind it — across the mountainside. Whatever those ponies had been expecting, it obviously wasn't an armoured train barrelling down the mountainside at them. And though Gossamer kept her eyes open for any more barricades or ambushes along the rest of the tracks, she didn't see anything else out of the ordinary until she coasted to a stop in Ponyville."

It will be ready to receive its appointed governor whenever you should have him or her, your Majesty."\n\nQueen Chrysalis waved away the briefcase with an almost bored expression on her face. "I do not need to read your reports, Generalmajor," she bluntly informed him. "Those are for the governor of the Canterlot Commissariat to bother themselves with. My time is better spent on other things."\n\nJachs slowly nodded and brought the briefcase back to his side. "Well, then, of course, your Majesty. Have you already made a decision on who should oversee Canterlot?"\n\n"I made that decision a while ago, Governor," she said. At Jachs' look of surprise, she frowned and sat up a little straighter in her throne. "Generalmajor, I shall be honest with you. There are a hundred other changelings who have been kissing my hooves for weeks to get appointed governor of Canterlot, but you have been in the city since it fell before us. You and that underling of yours have been instrumental in keeping the city under control. I do not particularly care for your lukewarm disposition toward ponies, and I feel that you are, perhaps, not harsh enough with them. But you have built a decent support structure around you in Canterlot in your time there, and it seems to be it would be nothing short of wasteful or inefficient to remove you from power or place you under another changeling unfamiliar with the situation. Therefore, I am entrusting the Canterlot Commissariat to you."\n\nThe sudden appointment took Jachs by surprise, and it took him a few seconds to find the words to respond. "Your Majesty, you do me a great honour, but I'm not sure if I'm the changeling for the job."\n\n"Of course you are," Chrysalis said, rolling her eyes. "You've been doing the job already. This is just an official extension of your responsibilities. But I do want to make one thing clear." She leaned forward in her throne, somewhat looming over the changeling general before her. "I want Canterlot ready to accept me as soon as you can make it happen. Not only that, but I want them to love me. I will be crowning myself the Empress of Canterlot and Equestria in short time, and it will not do to have a population that does not love its Empress. Do you understand?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.13.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio sighed and flipped through the binder of notes sitting in his lap as he awaited the decision of the Royal Court. Why did he even bring so many papers? He knew the Queen wouldn't read a single one. Ever since Equestria had fallen, she'd been pushing off all her royal duties as queen of the changelings to go play conqueror in Canterlot, and it had taken a not insubstantial amount of effort on behalf of the Court to get her to return to Vesalipolis and attend to her duties back home. But if he could convince the advisors, however... oh, but who was he kidding? The advisors were all from the greater hives, places like Vraks, Ditrysium, Soryth, and even Vesalipolis itself. Surely none of the bugs on the Queen's council had even heard of the no-name hive he was from.\n\nAt the very least, the proposals in his binder gave him something to do while the advisors debated his proposal. He flipped through page after page of notes, each one explaining in detail how the industrial capability of the Changeling Hives could be improved by allowing the workers increased access to Love to make up for longer hours and more demanding work. Sure, it would pull Love away from the military, but wasn't keeping the machines of industry working even more important than supplying a few bugs on patrol? Not only that, but Marsilio's thoughts were set in the future, once the garrisons could be scaled back and Equestria trusted to run itself. The initiatives he set forward today could go a long way toward building up changeling industry in the future...\n\nThe door opening startled him out of his thoughts, and Councillor Commoragh stepped forward, turning toward Marsilio. "Generaloberstabsarzt?"\n\n"Yes?" Marsilio responded.\n\n"Do it," was all the councillor said, before closing the doors and returning to the important business taking place inside.

Ever since his proposed reforms to the Love collection system had begun to be implemented throughout the Hives, the efficiency at which the newly-established Kollektiontruppen could harvest the mandated Love tax from the ponies and deer had only increased. The mandatory taxation, though overseen and enforced by armed soldiers riding into town on trucks, had largely gone off without any difficulties, apart from a few noted cases of exhaustion and dizziness in elderly ponies and deer, as well as among the very young. Marsilio scratched a few notes onto his clipboard as a teenage couple stood up from the collection chairs and staggered away, leaning heavily against each other for support. He'd seen enough collections by now to know that they would have to limit at what ages ponies and deer should be expected to pay the Love tax. Making it mandatory at 18 and then ending it at 58 seemed to be the most reasonable age bracket to work with, as below and above that range, the nasty side effects of collection were more prevalent and often more impactful. Still, that gave the Hives forty years out of each subject to collect their Love taxes, and so long as the worst excesses in the Heer were curbed, it would be sustainable for a long time to come."

Keeping pace beside him was Alcippe, on loan from Jachs for a few days to help straighten out the logistics for the Einquartierung-Schema.\n\n"I say this in the sense that capital-L Love, and the thaumato-emotional energy potential thereof, cannot ever arise out of a vacuum. Maternal or familial love comes close, but ultimately has its roots in biological instinct."\n\n"It, uh, definitely sounds interesting, sir," said Alcippe, absent-mindedly staring hard at the rows of numbers on the thickly-bound dossier held aloft in her magic. "I've cross-referenced our projected gains against all relevant metrics, and the numbers check out. As long as we emphasise the fact that the ponies are not actually expected to put up with our soldiers in their homes for extended periods of time, and present the whole initiative to the higher-ups as a partial return to the old system of decentralised Love collection, we should be able to dispel any lingering concerns from both the Heer and the pony representatives about providing housing for our officers."\n\n"That's very good, Oberstleutnant. This should be the place." Both changelings stood in front of the doorstep of the local mayor's residence, a two-story villa done up in the Canterlonian style. "It's been a delight working with you, Alcippe. Jachs is a very lucky 'ling to have you by his side." Alcippe blushed, and murmured her gratitude. For a moment, they stood awkwardly in front of the door to the villa, poised to part ways before the threshold.\n\n"Before you go," Marsilio said, breaking the lingering silence. "Consider what I said, about there being no unconditional Love. Know that while the mayor and his family may only be your hosts under duress, hospitality reciprocated may make for unexpected—"\n\n"I've think I've gotten the general idea, Generaloberstabsarzt," Alcippe interjected, suddenly tense. "I'm not sure what to think of it, and I'm not sure what Jachs would think either."\n\n"Ah." Momentarily taken aback, Marsilio took a moment to regain his train of thought. "Well, yours is a rational mind, Oberstleutnant. Just bear in mind that Love is a finite resource, and the ponies a fickle source thereof. We reap what we sow, no?"\n\n"I'll see you in Vesalipolis in a few weeks, sir." Alcippe raised a hoof to knock, and Marsilio took it as his cue to leave.

The plant represented the future of changeling Love extraction and harvesting, a modern, industrial approach applied to the ancient nature of the changeling species. The factory, designed to purify and increase the yield potential of raw, extracted Love, had been built with changeling science and manual labor supplied from the occupied territories. It was the first of its kind, and in the coming months, many more just like it would be completed around Equestria.\n\nHe turned his attention to the crowd of changelings gathered in front of him. Those invited to the grand opening ceremony ran the gamut from bureaucrats to industrialists to aristocracy, and almost everything in between. They had all gathered around their little tables, sipping on cocktails made from the first batch of Love refined at the plant during its test trials, and overall enjoying themselves on this first step into a brave new future for the Hegemony. But how many of them knew the true cost of building this plant? The ponies the Equestrian Reconstruction Agency had brought to the plant to provide the labour necessary for its construction were barely more than slaves, POWs and criminals pressed into indentured servitude. The changeling technology that had made the plant possible was in reality stolen and repurposed Equestrian science with a little changeling spin on it. And of course, the Love for the factory had to come from somewhere. The nearby pony towns were suffering greatly under the pressure to provide enough Love to keep the factory running. Under the shiny veneer of the future, the rotten wood of the past provided the foundation.\n\nBut he wasn't here to speak on that. He was here to talk about the future and ignore the cost it took to get there. So, brushing his doubts aside, Marsilio cleared his throat and tapped the microphone.

Several Kollektiontruppen trucks waited next to the large tent, their reservoirs constantly being filled up with the harvested Love of the prisoners as they were taken in for collection. When the prisoners were sapped of their Love, they often had to be hauled out by changeling soldiers, where they were dumped on the ground a few meters away. Most finally mustered the strength to stand up and return to their barracks after a few minutes. Many didn't, and Marsilio couldn't tell from this distance whether they were still breathing or not.\n\n"By the Queens, this is barbaric," he muttered aloud, watching with dismay and disgust as the first truck departed with full tanks, ready to bring the Love squeezed out of the helpless prisoners to where it was needed most.\n\n"Direct order from the Great Queen herself," the camp commander said with a nod of his head. "The Hives aren't getting enough Love, so we're to press the prisoners for as much as they got. Serves them right for taking up arms against the Heer."\n\n"But draining them of so much Love... they won't survive the second or third time, let alone the first," Marsilio protested.\n\nThe commander only shrugged.

Don't break the thing, that machine is worth more than you, your wife, and all the grubs she made last spring!"\n\nFinicus Vesali slapped a hoof against his forehead and grumbled as the idiot drones he'd brought out of Main Hive Industries' factories in Soryth tried to drop a crystal enchanter into the back of a waiting flatbed truck with a crane. The delicate piece of industrial machinery, designed to enchant the crystal receivers of Equestrian magical weaponry, slammed hard against the bed of the truck as the crane operator let it down too quickly. A few bolts popped out of the base, rattling down the asphalt, and Finicus considered how lucky those drones were that he didn't have a pistol on his person at the moment. If he did, he'd shoot them all and then probably himself. Hopefully the afterlife was managed by someling more competent than these louts.\n\nTurning around, Finicus went back to the tent he'd set up outside the magical weapons factory in occupied Whinnyapolis, stepping out of the sun for a bit. As CEO and president of Main Hive Industries, it was his duty (and privilege) to disassemble the Equestrian factories that had been used against them during the Great War and haul their expensive machinery back to Vesalipolis for study. Though changeling science was, quite obviously, the best in the world, the Equestrians had gone down several different paths of their own research and industry, and if there was anything that the ponies had learned from their bumbling buffoonery that could benefit the Hives, then he had to find out. One such thing that they were particularly adept in was the mass-production of enchanted weaponry and supplies, both of which had been used to great effect against the Heer during the war. Hopefully, bringing the heavy machinery of this factory back to Vesalipolis would help unlock a few of their production secrets.\n\n"How much longer, Finicus?" another changeling in a suit asked him. "An hour or two more, and we should be finished," Finicus said, waving his hoof. "Then we can get this packed up and brought back to Vesalipolis for study."\n\n"But Bales is nearby," another bug on his industrial advisory committee said. "We have the trucks, too. We could just rip out whatever they have there and bring it back with us. We should take it as reparations from the ponies."\n\nFinicus sighed and glared at the bug. "Are you stupid or something? What can we possibly learn from a munitions factory? The only thing those factories produced in Bales were bullets, bombs, and shells."\n\nHe glared at the changeling that had dared to speak up and leaned in over the table. "We aren't pirates. We aren't lazy. We are the greatest innovators this planet has ever seen. Nothing is better than changeling science. That spirit of innovation led us to victory in the Great War. We are only bringing these factories back to Vesalipolis because the ponies figured out something we don't know, and I want to learn from it rather than just steal it and pretend it's mine.

Generalmajor Jachs jostled past wakeful stockbrokers attuned to Manehattanite schedules, and military bureaucrats for whom the perpetual task of governing the Hegemony demanded a constant vigilance.\n\nHis destination was the salon's back room; a favourite haunt of VOPS functionaries from the Queen's Tower nearby. It was there that the Great Imperial Nobody — Vaspier Orn Kladisium himself — held court amidst a pall of cigar smoke and indistinct menace.\n\nThe meeting was already in full swing by the time Jachs made his way to the table. On one side sat the Queen's Guard, still wearing their ostentatious uniforms even in the sweltering heat of the room. Opposite them were the VOPS representatives, all sneers and upturned snouts, at ease in the security of their sanctum. Jachs was one of the few Heer personnel in attendance, their presence a formality — the Queen's Guard were the masters of the Pax Chrysalia, with the ascendant VOPS nipping at their heels. The Heer were there to do the grunt work, whilst opaque power struggles played over their heads.\n\nEveryone present is pouring over a densely-written list: the names of ponies, and their prescribed fates. They were teachers, scientists, intellectuals, politicians, and even noted magic users. Most were to be arrested and interned; others, to be summarily executed and made examples of. A select few had the honour of being chosen for replacement, with changeling understudies already in training to assume their identities.\n\nThe Queen's Guard and the VOPS bicker. Vaspier Orn Kladisium, speaking with a smooth, practised ease, expounds the necessity for precision and delicacy in the stifling of dissent; tumours are excised with scalpels, not truncheons. Captain Dieter Heinrich, ethnonationalist zealot and the Queen's enforcer-in-chief, calls for the wholesale suppression of the Equestrian population through mass arrests and public executions.\n\nThe argument, swelling in intensity, erodes at the facade of civility between the two factions.

He and several other changelings from across the Hives' economy and industry had been tasked with organizing a cabinet of valuable Equestrians who could play a critical role in collaborating with the changeling government in administering the newly-conquered provinces, but that had been a headache and a half and much too difficult for how much it was worth. Gathered in the sitting room behind Finicus were: a hoofful of minor Canterlot nobility, most prominent among them the House of Amethyst; a few deserters and former officers of the Equestrian Armed Forces who had pledged loyalty to the Queen; and several of Equestria's richest businessponies, willing to be first in line to serve the new regime if it made them a quick buck. The cabinet, termed 'The Advisory Committee of Equestrian Collaborationists,' or the ACE Collaborationists for short, were to be the changelings' trump card for making the rest of Equestria swiftly fall in line under their new rulers. But judging by the fact that the Lord and Lady of House Amethyst had the gall to complain about being kept waiting before their audience with the Queen, in the capital of Vesalipolis nonetheless, left Finicus doubtful that the collaborationists would solve more problems than they would create. Still, the Queen's orders were the Queen's orders, and getting dirty with the Equestrians from time to time would be worth it for the business opportunities it afforded Main Hive Industries.\n\nThankfully, the doors parted, and all the idle chatter and murmuring in the sitting room stopped. "The Queen will see you now," a soldier of the Queen's Guard said as he stuck his head through the crack. That was all the signal Finicus needed to stop admiring the art and get the show on the road.\n\n"Right! Everypony, follow me this way," he said, moving toward the doors and gesturing for the Equestrians to follow him. "Now, I don't know how you idiots treated your princesses, but Chrysalis is a Queen, and I'm hoping you know a thing or two about how royal titles work. That means behave yourselves, or you'll be going home to your families in a sandwich bag."

With a little pushing and bribery (and maybe a veiled threat or two), he had managed to get Main Hives Industry into a position to make the most out of the fallen pony country. Equestria was rich in resources, materiel, and industry, and the factories and cities it left behind would be excellent spoils to whoever could seize them. Finicus had made sure that Main Hive was first in line, and was able to secure exclusive rights to the newly created economic extraction zone centered around Canterlot and the neighbouring states, as well as control over the important ports in Vanhoover. Other regions of the nation had been split between Mayfly Electronics, Nidhogg Industries, and many of the other changeling concerns, as every bug got their slice of the Equestrian pie. Now that the war was over, the other concerns and corporations were back to being competitors of his, their cooperation with Main Hive Industries no longer needed to beat Equestria down, and the future was ripe with possibility. A changeling with tact and a keen eye for business opportunities could make the most out of this new economic playing field, and no bug had greater tact or a keener eye than Finicus himself.\n\nHe opened a drawer on his desk and pulled out a bottle of cognac aged for forty years that he'd been saving for a special occasion such as this and popped the cork, letting the spirit breathe for the first time in decades.

The newly instituted Aktionsplan Bedeckt seeks to make the most out of the fallen remains of Equestria, gathering up pony scientists from the ruins of their old nation and firmly encouraging them to share their research and discoveries with the Hegemony. To oversee the enforcement of the Aktionsplan, a committee of top changeling scientists, army officers, and industrial leaders has been organized in Vesalipolis to determine where these efforts should be directed first. Named the Hegemony Science and Industry Research Compact, or HSIRC for short, the newly established board of directors has gathered to determine what should take priority in the salvage and recovery operations before the Equestrian scientists go into hiding and their research is lost.\n\nThe board, however, is heavily divided. Representatives from the Queen's Guard have insisted that the HSIRC prioritize military hardware and the recovery of advanced weaponry such as railway artillery and complicated electronics, while the high-ranking officers of the Heer have pushed back that the HSIRC should invest in rocketry and atomic science, as these frontiers will be the future of the battlefields of tomorrow. Still more demands have arisen from the sizeable faction of changeling industrialists and capitalists, who sense great opportunities for the Hegemony (and their businesses) in learning from the ponies and having them teach us their technology instead of scavenging for it like vultures. As the HSIRC bogs down into a stalemate between the three factions, a decision must ultimately be made to prove that the Aktionsplan Bedeckt can be successful."

changelings_paxchrysalia.24.d:0 "With the Great War over, the Heer and the Queen's Guard have been at a loss for what to focus their time and efforts on. After all, these two functions primarily exist to wage war and conquer in the name of the Great Queen, and with Equestria fallen, there is little for them to spend their energy on. Instead, the leaders in the Queen's Guard have taken it upon themselves to create newer, bigger, and more destructive weapons than anything currently in the Heer's arsenal. They argue that as the horrors of war slowly fade from the public consciousness, these new weapons are essential to remind the ponies that we are their masters and could now destroy them in worse ways than in the Great War to prevent them from rising up. To this end, the Queen's Guard have forced plans through the rest of the HSIRC despite the rest of the council's protests, to acquire as many Equestrian scientists, engineers, and technicians to create a massive railway cannon, the likes of which has never been seen before.\n\nTermed the Soryth-Klasse Eisenbahnwaffe, the artillery piece, which will have an effective firing range of over 40km while delivering a shell carrying 700kg of high explosives, will weigh roughly 1,350 tonnes, be 47 meters in length, and require two parallel railway tracks for transportation. Many have bemoaned the extreme waste of resources that are being poured into developing one oversized gun, but the Queen's Guard is adamant that their project will pay off."

changelings_paxchrysalia.25.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio stood a safe distance away from the launch pad as the fueling trucks detached themselves from the rocket and scurried to safety. After spending long hours arguing with the HSIRC, the Heer had finally gotten its way, and pony scientists and engineers had been diverted to the rocketry programs that led by some of Marsilio's closest colleagues. The rocket, a metal tube standing fifteen meters tall with a cone on one end and four rudders on the other, glistened in the midday light. Though he was Surgeon-General, and was hence responsible for overseeing the centralised scientific efforts of the Hives, Marsilio's expertise was in the realm of biochemistry and medicine, and thus some of the finer details of the launch were lost on him. His colleagues did their best to explain how the liquid propellant system worked, and how the powerful engines allowed the rocket to achieve a range further than any artillery system currently in existence.\n\nThen the countdown began, and all eyes turned toward the rocket. Its base began to smoke, the cloud carried away by a slight breeze, and then a guttural roar burst out over the field. For a moment, Marsilio lost sight of the rocket in the cloud of debris, but then he saw its metal cone breach the top of the smoke cloud. It burst forward into the sky, a tail of blindingly white fire pushing it onwards, and soon it rose higher and higher and higher, climbing faster than any plane in the Luftwaffe's arsenal. He watched it disappear into the clear blue skies overhead, where eventually the nose pitched over and it began to descend toward the ocean to the west.\n\nAs the scientists and engineers around him cheered for a successful test, Marsilio's eyes lingered on the sky far above them. Changeling rocketry had come so far ever since getting the HSIRC's approval to fund these projects. One day, the rockets would be able to strike the Riverlands from the outskirts of Vesalipolis. But what if they could go further? What if, one day, those rockets could carry changelings up high above the sky, out to the moon... or even beyond?\n\nIt was little more than a pipe dream for now, but it gave Marsilio some hope that the advances the Heer made to wage war across the world could someday be used for peaceful purposes beyond this world."

Queen Chrysalis was present for a demonstration of the weapon outside of Soryth today, where the cannon shelled targets roughly a few dozen kilometers away, leaving behind craters ten meters deep with nothing left to salvage from the blast zone but steel glitter. Obviously impressed, Queen Chrysalis commended the efforts of the Queen's Guard and the HSIRC in procuring the resources and know-how to create this weapon, and immediately requested that several additional guns be built, one for each of the great hives of the Hegemony."

Waving to them, Marsilio quickly made his way through the diner and sat down in an empty seat at the corner of the table, sharing greetings with his friends. His mouth began to water when he saw that they had already ordered an appetizer, and he helped himself to a few bites. He had to admit, with all the time he'd been in Seaddle since the end of the Great War, Olenian food was really growing on him. Not to mention that there was something a little more filling about deer Love than pony Love...\n\n"Took you long enough, Marsilio," one of the changelings, R&D Lead Dr. Lyciax, said. "Working late again?"\n\n"You know me," Marsilio said with a little laugh. "Don't want to disappoint the Queen."\n\nTheir conversation wandered throughout their meal, the six changelings enjoying the chance to talk about their work and ideas without it being confined under the umbrella of business. If it wasn't for weekend evenings like this to relax and unwind, Marsilio knew he would have gone insane long, long ago. But as the conversation turned inevitably to the methods used to gather Love from the Hives' new subjects, Marsilio frowned into his drink, the wheels in his head turning.\n\n"Marsilio?" Lyciax asked. "What's wrong?"\n\n"I was just thinking to myself..." Marsilio began. "Why is it that we're able to form friendships with each other, discussing ideas freely as we are right now, but not with the creatures we feed Love from? Why do we have to forcefully extract Love from deer and ponies to survive? Would it not be simple enough to work more closely with them, to understand them better, to give and reciprocate what we take from them?"\n\nThe mood around the table shifted to one of unease. "Those are dangerous things to say," said Dr. Legus, sitting to Marsilio's left. "Are you saying that changelings are... parasites? That our nature is inherently flawed?"\n\n"Maybe not so crudely, but that's the basis of the idea," Marsilio said. "And I think the sooner we as a species recognize this, the sooner we can adapt and survive. We must stop being parasites to make it into the future, otherwise we won't have hosts to feed on. We have to become symbiotes, not parasites, and establish some kind of cooperation with the other species. That is our only way into the future.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.29.d:0 "Marsilio hesitated outside of the door to the cafe in Acornage, staring himself down in the reflection of the door's window. Was this really a good idea? He doubted that, but questions demand answers, and it was always a scientist's duty to find them. Hopefully the pony inside still felt the same way.\n\nWorking up the strength to push through the doors, Marsilio stepped inside and spotted his target: a blue stallion with a white mane sitting in a booth in the corner of the cafe. He wasted no time in approaching the booth, though he slowed as he approached so the pony could see him. Recognition sparked in the stallion's eyes, and he stood up, a genuine (if unsure) smile on his muzzle. "Marsilio?" the stallion asked. "Celestia, it's been too long."\n\n"Likewise, Spectrograph," Marsilio said, shaking the stallion's hoof. "Though I'd caution against saying that name in particular too loudly."\n\nSpectrograph seemed to remember himself, and shook his head. "Right, right. Your Queen doesn't want anypony to remember that the princesses even existed."\n\n"Our Queen," Marsilio reiterated, gesturing to Spectrograph as well. "Not just mine, anymore."\n\nSpectrograph's smile turned to a frown. "You know I can't forgive your kind for what they just did to mine. I'm only here because we used to be friends and colleagues before everything went to Tartarus. So, what do you want?"\n\nMarsilio sighed, unhappy that the friendly atmosphere had broken down so quickly, but he nevertheless pulled a small packet of papers out of his bag and put them in front of Spectrograph. "Read it," he said, "and tell me what you think."\n\nSpectrograph looked between the papers and Marsilio for a few moments before he pulled out his reading glasses and set to work. Several minutes of silence passed by as the stallion read through the papers, his brow furrowing ever slightly more with each passing paragraph. Finally, however, he took off his glasses and looked at Marsilio. "What is this? Some kind of manifesto?"\n\n"Changelings and ponies don't have to be parasites and hosts," Marsilio said. "One day, maybe we can be symbiotic. Mutually beneficial. At least, that's what I hope." He took the papers back and tugged them safely inside his bag, then tapped his hooves together. "So? What do you think? Would you be willing to help out?"\n\nSpectrograph struggled with that question for several seconds before fixing Marsilio with a piercing glare. "When Equestria fell, I swore to never help your kind hold my nation," he said, his voice bitter. But then he sighed. "But this would help Equestria too." After a moment to chew on his lip, he nodded to Marsilio. "You're a good scientist, Marsilio, and you've always been mindful of how your research affects those around you. If there was anyling I'd trust to make something better out of this mess, it's you.""

It gives me hope that I can one day run things as smoothly as you do."\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs shook his head and shrugged as he walked with the changeling governor of the Vanhoover region. He'd been recalled to Vesalipolis to handle some administrative things, and decided to detour and see how other areas of fallen Equestria that were out of his purview were dealing with their own issues for comparison. "It's built off of more hard work than you could imagine," Jachs said, "and more sleepless nights than you'd think. Even still, I have problems of my own with keeping the resistance in line, Governor Carapace."\n\n"Funny you should mention that..." Governor Carapace gestured to some anti-changeling graffiti on a nearby building and frowned. "We're having a problem with the resistance spreading propaganda here. It seems like they've mobilized the entire youth population of the city to spread their messages past curfew; it's all but impossible to stop them all. We did manage to arrest some foals that were creating some of it, colts and fillies around thirteen or fourteen years old, and we're having trouble deciding what to do with them. VOPS thinks they're in contact with a resistance handler who's giving them targets and messages."\n\n"And what do you need my assistance with in this matter?" Jachs said, raising an eyebrow. "Well, how should we punish them?" The governor stopped and rubbed one forehoof against the opposite foreleg. "They're kids, Generalmajor, but what they're doing is treason, punishable by hard labour or death. At the same time, I can't just give them a slap on the fetlock and let them go right back to it.

changelings_paxchrysalia.31.t:0 "The Changeling-Equestrian Treaty of Alliance and Friendship"
changelings_paxchrysalia.31.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs observed the approach of the Equestrian High Command with narrowed eyes. These were the ponies he had fought against in the Great War, their strategies that he and the rest of the Heer had to overcome. Or at least, some of them were. Most of the actual Equestrian High Command had fled or gone into hiding when the nation collapsed, and the generals standing before him were barely more than toadies elevated to their posts to be subservient to the Hegemony. Never was that more obvious than today, where Queen Chrysalis had ordered that the Royal Guard and the Equestrian High Command sign a treaty with the Hegemony affirming Equestria's perpetual alliance and friendship toward their conquerors. It was a farce, he knew, about as legitimate as any drone shapeshifting into the Queen herself and proclaiming that the Hegemony was now theirs to rule. But the legitimacy didn't matter much when the same hoof that created the treaty wrote the history books.\n\nJachs' mood didn't improve during the celebration afterwards, if one could call it that. He had important work that he needed to finish, and the last thing he wanted to do was mingle with Chrysalis and her Queen's Guard. All that would accomplish would be straining his patience listening to suckups try to smother the Queen with platitudes and compliments for hours on end. Instead, he hung around the fringes of the party, where he noticed a pony watching him from a few steps away.\n\n"What is it?" Jachs asked, barely even looking at the pony. "Is there something I can help you with?"\n\nThe pony flinched, surprised that Jachs had acknowledged him, and cleared his throat. "I... well, you were present at the signing today, weren't you, sir?"\n\n"I was, unfortunately," Jachs groaned. He turned to face the pony. "What about it?"\n\nAfter looking around as if worried that he was being watched, the pony closed the distance between the two. "Do you really think that there can ever be true friendship between our species?" he asked. "Or was this all just for show with no truth to it?""

"Come in," he said, taking the opportunity to stretch and work some of the stiffness out of his joints. Oberstleutnant Alcippe stepped through the opening door, quickly saluting the Generalmajor. "The representatives from the EPSC are here, Generalmajor," she said. "Shall I send them in?"\n\nJachs sighed and rubbed a hoof to his temple. How he'd been dreading this meeting all day. "I'd rather you didn't, but I don't have much choice in the matter," he said, eventually dismissing her with a wave of his hoof. As Alcippe slipped away to fetch the representatives, Jachs sifted through the papers on his desk until he pulled out the Equestrian Penal Service Corps' recommendations for how to use Equestrian prisoners of war, dissidents, and conscripted civilians in furthering the economic interest of the hives. Once again, even briefly glancing through the callous proposal made his blood boil, but he tried not to let that emotion show as Alcippe knocked on the door again and opened it for the representatives to enter. He was an officer of the Heer first and a person second, and it was best to maintain that decorum.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from chastising the changelings in front of him before they could even sit down. "I've read through your proposal, representatives," he said, tapping the piece of paper on his desk, "and I have to say I'm disappointed in your behavior towards these ponies. Harsh quotas for labor camps enforced with physical violence and torture? No guarantees for necessities like food, water, and shelter? The seizure of any accused's property without trial or due process? If I didn't know any better, representatives, I'd be led to believe that you intend to make slaves out of our prisoners."\n\nThe harsh confrontation stopped the two representatives in their tracks, until the shorter, fatter bug, who Jachs felt looked remarkably like a maggot stuffed full with rotting flesh, put on a disarming smile and rubbed his hooves together. "Is it not what ponies deserve, Generalmajor?" the changeling said. "They dared to stand up to us during the war. Their soldiers killed thousands upon thousands of loyal changeling infantry. They had the audacity to cling to their useless princesses instead of accepting the right of our rule. Why should they deserve anything other than labor and servitude for their defiance?

There was a nervous excitement in the air, like the city itself knew things were changing, and none were more aware of that energy than Jachs. After all, this had been the culmination of his work these past several months. Now, it was time to show the world that changelings and ponies could cooperate.\n\nOberstleutnant Alcippe straightened Jachs' hat with a glow of green magic and grinned at him. "About time you get a parade for your work," she said. "The Queen will be pleased to see what progress you've made in promoting cooperation here in Canterlot."\n\n"Not just me, Oberstleutnant," Jachs said, nodding to her. Alcippe averted her eyes as if she were dodging the compliment, though Jachs reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "Reward yourself with some time off tomorrow, Alcippe. You deserve it."\n\nThere wasn't much more to be said after that, as the tolling of the noon bells in Canterlot meant it was time to set out. Jachs shared one last look with Alcippe before blowing into a whistle and setting the parade of pony volunteers moving, and he made his way to his staff car as the officers and NCOs — the ranks of the latter half-comprised of ponies — took command of the parade from there. It was going to be a long day of parade and ceremony, but for the first time in quite a while, the Generalmajor was looking forward to it. Hopefully the Queen would be pleased with the results as well."

changelings_paxchrysalia.833.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs had been expecting the summons from the Queen ever since he saw that grin on her face at the sending-out ceremony for the volunteers. Chrysalis had seemed thrilled to have ponies genuinely loyal to the Hegemony under her command, even if they weren't loyal to Chrysalis personally. That didn't bother Jachs, however, because he knew the Queen couldn't separate herself from the state in her mind, so she wouldn't recognize the distinction. All she cared about was that she had gotten ponies enrolled in her service without having to threaten them first.\n\nTwo members of the Queen's Guard opened the door as Jachs approached, obviously expecting his arrival, and he spared them a nod before he ventured inside. There, he found the Queen sitting on one of the castle balconies watching the city of Canterlot far below as if she could see her new Royal Pony Volunteer Corps in action from this far up. The guard posted behind her banged the butt of his rifle against the ground, catching the Queen's attention, and Chrysalis turned away from her view to regard Jachs with a smile. "Generalmajor," she said, gesturing for him to sit at a chair by her side. "I must say, I am impressed with what you've accomplished here in Canterlot."\n\nJachs saluted and approached at his Queen's beckons, only sitting down when Chrysalis motioned a second time. "I've taken great pains to make the transition as smooth as possible," he said, back straight and posture stiff and formal. "The liberties and leeway I've afforded much of the population of Canterlot has eased tensions between our species."\n\nChrysalis scoffed at that. "Be careful what you wish for," she said, much to Jachs' surprise. "While I'm sure you've gotten through to the simpletons in these new volunteer corps that the times have changed, there will be plenty of ponies who would take advantage of your leeway. Until you've got more ponies in these ranks, do not take any pressure off of them whatsoever. We need to show Equestria that this is their future, and if they fall in line, it will be glorious for all of us. If they don't, I want them crushed. Destroyed. Preferably by their own kind. That would make it all the better."\n\nChrysalis' words left Jachs surprised, but he didn't dare press her any further — after all, her temper could change notoriously quickly, and she was as pleased as he was likely to get her at the moment. But even still, he didn't know if today's success would finally show the Queen that harsh measures were the least effective way of earning the ponies' trust and loyalty. It seemed she was still too distrustful and hateful of ponies to see things any other way."

The Great Queen had seen fit to summon him along with all the other generals and staff of the High Command to her tower to discuss a matter of great importance. What that matter was, however, the Queen hadn't said in her summons.\n\nFinally, Queen Chrysalis entered the room, causing Dieter and the other changelings to stand up and bow before her. "My Queen," Dieter said, rising from his bow. "How may we be of service?"\n\n"I need a new bodyguard unit," Chrysalis said, pacing in front of them. "I need a unit of thestrals to be added to my detail."\n\nThe request took Dieter aback, and he furrowed his brow as he tried to process it. "Thestrals, my Queen? May I ask why?"\n\n"Because Celestia was never able to gain their loyalty," Chrysalis stated. "Having a company of bats as my elite Night Guards will prove to the ponies of Equestria that I am better than both of their princesses, because I will have the loyalty of ponies and thestrals alike!"\n\nUnnoticed by Chrysalis, the rest of the High Command shared wary looks. "It's... a good thought, my Queen," Dieter began, carefully feeling his way forward. "But the thestrals... there is only one creature in the world that they will ever be loyal to, and that is their night princess. They broke with Equestria to side with her a thousand years ago, and in the millennia since, they've only ever been loyal to her, even as generation after generation was born, lived, and died while she was trapped on the moon. They are too ingrained in their devotion to Luna to ever be loyal to anyone else."\n\n"They will be loyal to me, their one true Queen, before long!" Chrysalis insisted. "When they see that I have a loyal company of bat ponies in my guard detail, then they will realize that I am the mare they should worship, not that dreamwalking lunatic!""

His first thoughts as Queen's Guard Captain were focused on protecting his liege, and instincts honed from years of duty had him collect the pistol he kept in his nightstand and dart out into the hallway in seconds. He could hear gunfire coming from the throne room even as he tried to collect his bearings; whatever this attack was, it was coordinated, and a coordinated attack on the Queen's Tower could only mean one thing: assassination.\n\nDieter wasted no time sprinting to the throne room, where he witnessed a detachment of the Queen's Guard engaging in a brutal firefight with the newly-created Night Jaegers, the bats using the weaponry they'd been given to try and push their way through the Queen's bodyguards. Reflex sent Dieter diving toward cover at the side of the room, and not a moment too soon as bullets pockmarked the wall he'd been standing next to just a second earlier. Chambering the first round of his pistol, Dieter bared his fangs and poked his head out of cover, quickly sighting and dispatching two thestrals approaching his position with two rounds to each of their necks. Ducking back into cover, he took the time to look around and assess the situation. The Queen's Guard still held the advantageous positions in the throne room, and more were rallying to the fight from throughout the tower, but the thestrals had numbers and the element of surprise. He knew from creating and assigning garrisons that it would take five minutes for panzergrenadiers around the Tower to organize and respond to the attack; that meant he only had to keep the Queen safe for a few minutes longer before the thestrals would be outnumbered and crushed by reinforcements.\n\nOf course, that was easier said than done when he saw Queen Chrysalis herself step into the throne room, horn glowing with magic as she took in the carnage around her. "What is the meaning of th-!"\n\nDieter tackled her to the ground before she could finish her question, a hail of bullets ripping through the air around them. Chrysalis grunted and bared her teeth, indignant at being so brusquely knocked aside by a subordinate, but a furious scowl from Dieter silenced her. "Stay down and get out!" he shouted at her. "It's you they're after! Go! We'll cover you!"\n\nSomething in Dieter's voice dissolved any arguments the Queen might otherwise have had, and she scampered out of the room as Dieter and the rest of her bodyguards fell back to provide cover."

The brutal fighting left numerous changelings dead or wounded, and the thestrals, fighting in a defiant last stand in the name of their princess, were decimated almost to the very last. Those that weren't slain in the fighting only survived because their wounds left them too injured to continue fighting, and these survivors were soon rounded up by the Heer and dragged outside to sit in the courtyard until the Queen decided what to do with them.\n\nCaptain Heinrich sat against a wall in the throne room, drinking a cup of coffee someling had given to him while the Heer emptied the room of the bodies of both bats and changelings alike. His hooves still shook from the fight, and he doubted he'd get much sleep the rest of the night. If he could get his hooves on the necks of the thestral officers who organized the revolt, he'd tear their heads from their bodies just for ruining his night's sleep. Oh the things he would do to those damn bats...\n\nIt wasn't long before Queen Chrysalis herself made her way back to the throne room, a little shaken up but uninjured thanks to the swift actions of Dieter's hoof-picked bodyguards. Now, however, Captain Heinrich had no energy left in him to stick to formalities when addressing his Queen. "The survivors are in the courtyard below. What do you want done with them?"\n\nChrysalis angrily scowled. "Kill them all," she said. "Except for the officers. I want them subjected to the cruelest punishment you can think of. Nobody betrays me and gets away with it."\n\n"Is it really treason if they were never loyal to you to begin with?" Dieter wondered aloud.\n\nChrysalis glared at him.

The Equestrian government had borrowed heavily from him throughout the war to keep the economy functioning as the changelings drew closer and closer to Canterlot, but with the government now defunct, Filthy knew he would never see that money again. His only hope was to ask the ERA for money and pray that they wouldn't be too harsh on him.\n\nThe terms of the loan discomforted him, however. Filthy had made, read, and signed countless legal and business contracts throughout his career; the legal jargon on the pages in front of him failed to confuse him in the slightest. But under the veneer of providing Equestrian businesses with aid and support was the real mark of the parasite he was about to borrow from. His businesses would have to provide a 'special tax' to the ERA every quarter, and he would have to put one ERA supervisor on his board of directors for every four ponies on it. Any opportunities for investment he created would have to be disclosed to changeling investors two weeks before they could be made public to pony investors, giving the changelings a head start on selecting the best investments over their pony counterparts. Not only that, but no changeling that entered his employ could make less than 150% of the wages of a pony at a comparable position, and his workforce had to be composed of at least 30% changeling workers because of a 'diversity' clause. It was plain and simple economic bullying, but Filthy Rich had no choice but to accept the conditions. He needed the money to keep his business afloat, and if his company failed, then the changelings would certainly take over his economic niche, and he knew the damn parasites didn't care at all for the ponies in the economy they leeched dry to feed themselves. If he could keep his business going, it would be better for ponies everywhere. That, he knew for certain."

changelings_paxchrysalia.37.d:0 "Finicus Vesali toured the recovering industrial complex in Manehattan, where some of Equestria's largest factories had been situated before the Great War. Bombers and brutal fighting in the city had torn the complex to pieces, with scarcely any building still standing without signs of catastrophic damage, but that was starting to change. As part of the post-war reconstruction of the fallen equine nation, the Hegemony had given its corporations and concerns almost free reign to claim land and rebuild the area as they saw fit. Alongside that, the Hegemony had made the local populations available against their will to the corporations to aid in the reconstruction, calling it a partnership between changelings and ponies in rebuilding the nation. But Finicus saw in Manehattan, however, was anything but. He'd left the supervision of the Main Hives Industries' involvement in the metropolis to a regional director, and the changeling had made ample use of the Hegemony's offer. It seemed like almost every mare and stallion from the nearby boroughs had been dragged out of their homes and forced to perform the hard labor of clearing debris and hauling in new material at gunpoint, with Heer soldiers and the company's own mercenaries stationed around the perimeter, as well as on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Slowdowns were not tolerated, and he could hear exhausted ponies pleading for a break in the labor, only to be whipped back to their work, sometimes quite literally. It didn't take a genius to realize that the ponies here were little more than slaves, disposable tools acquired by the hives to toil and rebuild the nation on a foundation of their bones, all for the benefits of the changelings lording over them.\n\nChewing on his lip, Finicus eventually only shook his head and walked away. Manehattan wasn't under his direct jurisdiction, but perhaps a tactfully worded memo would get the point across to the regional directors that brutal conditions like these would no longer be tolerated in his company."

changelings_paxchrysalia.38.d:0 "The Vesalipolis Office of Public Safety has recently started upscaling recruitment and training efforts to stuff its ranks full of trained infiltrators to disperse on deep cover operations throughout Equestria, with the intent on locating and cracking down on resistance groups and dissenters throughout the nation to tighten changeling grip on the land. What's more interesting is that the VOPS has made this public knowledge and disseminated it far and wide, through channels both conspicuous and discreet. The intended effect has arisen almost immediately: all throughout Equestria, ponies no longer trust their neighbors or POWs returning home from war out of the well-grounded fear that they could be changeling infiltrators. Resistance groups are struggling to grow in size as the knowledge that anypony could be a changeling in disguise makes them more cautious than ever. Pony unity against the Hives is hopelessly fragmented, making it increasingly difficult for Equestrians to come together and resist our rule. With outsiders becoming ostracized within local communities at an ever-increasing rate, informal means of communication across Equestria is beginning to slow down — save for the changeling-controlled newspapers and propaganda broadcasts. All of this is making the nation easier to police and rule.\n\nWhat's more impressive is that this was all achieved with just a few words and not much real action. While the VOPS is indeed increasing recruitment and operations, it has nowhere near the necessary numbers to put deep cover agents in every community throughout Equestria. But word of mouth and the instinctual fear that anypony might be a changeling is proving to be just as effective, if not more so, than actually monitoring the entire nation with thousands of infiltrators. So long as we keep our true numbers hidden from the ponies, they will never be able to trust each other enough to resist us."

"As things start returning to normal, it's time to start organizing a local governing body here in Canterlot and the territory we're administering. After all, we're both military changelings, not political beasts, and I don't think you'd be interested in running the day to day affairs of the regional government."\n\n"I do plenty of that already," Jachs said, pulling the binder closer and flipping through it. There were numerous changelings in the first dossiers, all notable or rising politicians back in the Hives, many with former or ongoing military careers. Then he noticed the pictures on the dossiers behind them. "Ponies?" he asked, turning a wary eye toward his Oberstleutnant. "Are you sure about that?

Queen Chrysalis had returned to Canterlot as if it was a vacation home she couldn't stay away from, and it was his duty to report on his recent progress in administering the Equestrian heartlands while she stayed. He just wished she wouldn't use the throne room all the time. The massive hall was drafty and it echoed so badly it made conversation difficult, but Chrysalis was determined to sit on Celestia's throne whenever she had meetings as if it was hers by rights.\n\n"Generalmajor," Chrysalis said, regarding the approaching changeling. "I've heard interesting things since last time we talked."\n\nJachs hesitated mid-bow, then cautiously stood back up. "Only good things I hope, your Majesty."\n\n"That depends to be seen." Chrysalis raised a brow as she gestured for Jachs to approach. "I've heard that you've gone soft with the ponies here, that you've gone so far as to treat them as equals with us despite their status. What happened to the aspiring general who effectively managed to place infiltrators into the Royal Guard during the battle for this city? You were cutthroat and ruthless then, as I recall. What changed?"\n\nThat was a line of questioning Jachs wasn't prepared for. "I... don't quite understand what you're saying," he began, cautiously feeling his way forward. "I've always been loyal to the Hegemony, to you, your Majesty. All of your orders, I've tirelessly executed. Canterlot is more secure now than it was when I began my posting here."\n\n"Yes, but at what cost?" Chrysalis frowned at him. "Keeping Canterlot secure and compliant is what you were assigned here to do, not play nice with the ponies. They are worthless, they are beneath us, and if you give them the slightest inch of freedom, they'll take a mile. They'll be rioting soon if you keep being lenient with them, and it'll be your head they'll mount on a pike first. You should be pressing them down with your hoof, not helping them stand alongside us. Do you understand?"\n\nJachs had to hide his discomfort and nod as Chrysalis expected.

Using information passed along by infiltrators in the city's main resistance cell, the garrison simultaneously hit dozens of different hideouts and operations centers across the city. The fighting was fierce, often spilling out into the streets and between buildings, as Panzergrenadiers and armored vehicles worked in tandem with the local garrison to level resistance strongholds and flush their Equestrians out of their holes. The resistance fought back with surprising ferocity, leveraging stolen changeling weapons such as anti-tank rifles and panzerfausts to inflict significant damage on the garrison, but by the end of the day, the smoke rising from across the city marked our success. The resistance cell in Whinnyapolis has been crushed, its survivors scattered to the winds, and our grip on the city is more secure than ever.\n\nHowever, the main objective of the operation, the capture of the resistance leader Trixie Lulamoon, ended in failure. The mare was able to evade our forces after a brief skirmish with panzergrenadiers at the main resistance hideout, inflicting numerous casualties in her escape. Though we have searched high and low for her, she is simply nowhere to be found, and has likely escaped the city by this point.

A stallion stood in front of the shattered window, the moonlight glinting off of the sabre held in his mouth. His hind legs were tense, poised to pounce, and Jachs wondered if he could reach the pistol on his bedside table in time. But the door burst open, and there stood Alcippe, backlit against the light from the corridor outside. In the next moment, she shot the pony with the rifle held aloft in her magic. The report deafened and disoriented Jachs, and when he could see straight he saw her sidestepping the body of his would-be assassin to take up a firing position in front of the broken window.\n\n"It's Lulamoon and her thugs," said Alcippe, interrupting Jachs before he could speak.

A mass of soldiers, Heer grey interspersed with Queen's Guard black, had rallied and were rushing towards the fighting. But the charge staggered, the front ranks collapsing under some unseen depredation. Then, leaping from the shadows — Trixie Lulamoon, moving faster than any pony Jachs had ever seen, dodging bullets and explosions to tear through the counterattack with deadly spellwork. Jachs rose to his hooves in alarm; beside him, Alcippe peered down the scope of her rifle with all the cool of a sniper. They needn't have bothered; in an outburst of blue smoke, she'd vanished just as quickly as she appeared, leaving behind her a wake of the brutalised changeling dead.\n\nTrixie had left behind a calling card. The next morning, a janitor found mismatched limbs and jagged chunks of chitin overflowing from the barrack composter.

We'd have to end infiltration operations just to get enough changelings to fulfill this order, and there's no guarantees it will even work."\n\n"Fortune favors the bold, Generalmajor," Heinrich insisted. "And the Heer is nothing if not bold.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.52.t:0 "An Incredible Waste of Resources"
changelings_paxchrysalia.52.d:0 ""We have accomplished nothing, Captain Heinrich. Actually, we have accomplished worse than nothing. We have wasted considerable resources and 'lingpower on this farce." Generalmajor Jachs fought to keep a straight face as he confronted the Queen's Guard captain in his office, where, judging by the lavish decorations hanging on the walls, Dieter Heinrich was more focused on making himself look more accomplished than he actually was than fulfilling his duty to the best of his abilities. "Not only have we crippled the Heer, but the overwhelming saturation of soldiers all throughout Equestria has done nothing but scare the resistance into hiding. We haven't eradicated the problem so much as kicked the can further down the road."\n\n"Yet partisan activities are down, are they not?" Dieter Heinrich countered, one eyebrow raised. "These past three months have seen the lowest attack rates of partisan forces we've seen since occupying the nation. Three months of effective policing have finally chased this problem away."\n\n"We have chased nothing away, Captain. We've only sent the resistance cells to ground." Jachs threw a folder full of reports from his operatives in the field on Dieter's desk. "As soon as the resistance realized what we were doing, they sent all their agents to ground until we relaxed the pressure. We're now in the midst of withdrawing the Heer's troops, and my infiltrators are reporting that the partisans are beginning to gear up for action again. Not only that, but they've spent the time away from their operations to bolster their ranks. As soon as our troops are withdrawn once more, the problem will return, and in greater force than ever before."\n\nCaptain Heinrich took a moment to think on that, the smoke trailing from the end of his cigarette like a thin gray rope. "Is that your opinion, Generalmajor, or objective fact? Because I believe this operation has been nothing short of a complete success."\n\n"It... is my opinion, Captain," Jachs said, narrowing his eyes. "An opinion formed on facts and simple reasoning."\n\n"Well then," Heinrich said with a smile. "I think I prefer my opinion to yours.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.53.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs poured himself a glass of scotch as he settled onto his lounging chair he'd ordered for his office. The day was almost over, and thankfully, things had calmed down a bit around Canterlot, so he didn't have as much work as he usually did. Therefore, it was the perfect time for a glass of scotch and to casually review the files of some changelings recommended for promotion. It was a welcome change of pace from trying to put out fires all over Equestria.\n\nAs he opened up the file at the top of his stack, however, he noticed that the file was earmarked with a letter of approval straight from the Queen's Guard itself. Frowning, Jachs took a closer look at the young lieutenant's file, eyes scanning over the notes compiled for him. At every instance, this young lieutenant, a bug by the name of Glossus Sicarus, was the model changeling officer: patriotic, dashing, bold, and by all accounts, successful and competent. But then there were the other notes included by changelings outside of the Queen's Guard. Lieutenant Sicarus had a reputation for being bold to the point of reckless, and was a noted radical changeling supremacist. What really got Jachs' attention, however, was the dearth of information about Glossus' activites as an infiltrator behind Equestrian lines during the last days of the war. Reports on significant actions were simply missing, and what reports there were had been heavily redacted.\n\nJachs sighed. The missing information was clearly suspicious, but what else did he expect from the Queen's Guard?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.53.a:0 "Put the lieutenant on probation for 90 days before we review this again."

changelings_paxchrysalia.54.d:0 "Reports have reached us of the situation in Salt Lick City this afternoon. For the past months, the Heer has been conducting anti-partisan actions in and around the city. A known Solarist stronghold, full of ponies who see Celestia not only as their princess but their goddess, Salt Lick City has been a hotbed of resistance to our rule ever since it was occupied.\n\nRecently promoted to a command within the Queen's Guard, Oberst Glossus Sicarus had been dispatched to the city to oversee counterinsurgency operations. Pushing a doctrine of no quarter for all those who oppose our Queen's rule, Oberst Sicarus demanded that all partisan leaders inside of the city surrender to the changeling garrison within twelve hours, before declaring the entirety of the city centre to be hostages of the Heer, the lives of which were to be forfeit if the Harmonic Resistance failed to comply.\n\nHis ultimatum refused, General Sicarus withdrew all changeling soldiers from the city center before blockading the main thoroughfares, and immediately began shelling it with heavy artillery stationed in the suburbs. The indiscriminate shelling continued for a several hours straight. Civilian casualties are expected to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, and the damage to the city itself is expected to be immeasurable. The Oberst's shelling only ended when his counterparts in the Heer refused to deliver more ammunition to Sicarus' guns.\n\nMuch of Salt Lick City lies in ruins, with block after block having been systematically leveled by volley after volley of high explosive shelling. Of the partisan forces still remaining inside of the city, some had tried to surrender to the Queen's Guard to spare Salt Lick City more damage, but a number had managed to break through the blockade, aided and abetted by the locals, and the territories around Salt Lick City have now risen up in arms as information about what had transpired spread. Even certain generals inside of the Heer have demanded that Sicarus be immediately demoted or at least face disciplinary review — a motion which the Queen's Guard has stepped in to vehemently oppose, claiming that Sicarus is the epitome of a loyal and zealous changeling soldier. When asked for a comment, General Sicarus only remarked that, "All the ponies inside of that disgusting city are traitors, every last one. My only regret is that the Heer didn't give me enough shells to finish the job.""

He blinked, stretched his back, and grunted as he moved muscles he hadn't been using all day. "Alcippe. I didn't hear you knock." He gestured toward his desk. "Take a look."\n\nAlcippe stepped more directly into Jachs' office and approached the stack of papers, an eyebrow raised. She picked one up in her magic and looked it over. "Jagdkommando-Einsatzgruppen?" she asked, cocking her head at the Generalmajor. "What is this for?"\n\n"With the way that Equestria is being divided and organized into the commissariats, keeping troops stationed along rigid boundaries simply isn't feasible given the partisan threat we're dealing with," Jachs explained. "Therefore, this rapid-response force will be stationed at railway hubs throughout the nation, from which they can rapidly deploy to anywhere that needs their presence. Combatting the resistance requires a faster hoof, not a heavier one." He sighed and picked up his pen, setting it to work on a piece of paper that needed some lines filled in. "Unfortunately, setting something up outside of the bounds of the Heer's conventional structure is time-consuming and tedious, to say the least. I'll likely be working on it all night long."\n\n"Maybe... I can help?" Alcippe said, managing a small smile. "Is there anything I could aid you with, Jachs?"\n\n"I'm sure we can find something," Jachs said, glad for the 'ling's company. "Pull over a chair and we can get started."\n\nAlcippe did as she was asked, and she set her chair down next to Jachs', making the most out of the cramped space on his desk. Jachs gave her some missives to review for grammatical errors and typos, and shoulder to shoulder, the two changelings worked deep into the night.\n\nNot that either minded, of course."

changelings_paxchrysalia.56.d:0 "Mayor Sunny Skies stood behind the podium and waited.\n\nHe had been waiting since earlier that morning. Truth be told, he'd been waiting for much longer than that. Ever since news reached Hope Hollow that the war was lost and Equestria had formally surrendered, he'd been waiting for this day. Not with anticipation and excitement, no, but with dread. Hope Hollow had been so far removed from the front lines that the fighting hadn't touched them. Though a few townsponies went off to fight, the town was too small for the recruitment officers to visit them. For the longest time, the only thing that reminded Hope Hollow of the war being fought far away were the reports on the radio coming out of Canterlot, until even those went silent.\n\nBut not any longer. Now, the changelings were coming to town to collect census information and an oath of loyalty from its mayor — from him. It was his duty to give them a warm welcome, to put on his brightest smile and lick the boots of the conquerors. Obedience was expected, but loyalty would be rewarded. Hopefully, appeasing the changelings would see the ponies of Hope Hollow treated fairly. Tossing away whatever dignity he had left was the least he could do to see them safe.\n\n"Sunny?"\n\nSunny Skies jumped, startled by the sudden voice. He looked over his shoulder to see Petunia Petals anxiously rubbing one hoof along her leg. "Sunny... are they coming still?"\n\n"Yes," he said, sadly nodding. "They'll be here soon. They should be."\n\n"Oh." Petunia fidgeted in place, then cleared her throat. "Well, while you're waiting, do you want to get something to eat, hon? Torque Wrench has been grilling corn for us at the shop, trying to make the most of the good food we have before the bugs come to take it away, and you've been out here since the morning, don'tcha know..."\n\nThe mayor hesitated, not fully willing to abandon his post in case the bugs arrived, but his stomach prodded him otherwise. Had he even had anything to eat for lunch? Maybe a quick break would be for the best. Finally, he gave in and stepped away from the podium. "Okay, Petunia, that sounds good. I could do with some food, now that I think about it.""

"We've got plenty of doom and gloom in front of us, but for tonight, we can pretend we don't. We've got our friends, the ponies of Hope Hollow, all together one last time before the bugs show up. They can't take this from us, don'tcha know?"\n\n"Yeah... yeah, I suppose you're right," Sunny Skies admitted. He did his best to push his worries to the back of his mind, and the smell of grilled corn wafting out of Torque Wrench's shop helped with that as his mouth began to water. "Wow... smells amazing."\n\n"Tastes even better, too," Petunia said, giving him a nuzzle on the cheek before trotting inside ahead of him. Sunny absently smiled as he followed his wife inside of the workshop, just in time to hear her proclaim, "I've got him, everypony!"\n\nA chorus of cheers and chuckling broke out, putting Sunny Skies at ease as he moved into the back of the workshop where many familiar faces had gathered around a long workbench-turned-table. He saw Torque Wrench and Kerfuffle, Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington, Moody Root, and even the two aspiring pegasus speedsters, Barley and Pickle Barrel, and their parents. Their faces and so many more turned toward him as he approached, and happy little smiles decorated their muzzles. If it wasn't for the hushed atmosphere hanging over the meal, it was almost possible to pretend that this wasn't a last gathering of sorts between friends before life changed forever. Almost.\n\n"Hey, everypony," Sunny said, sheepishly letting Petunia lead him to a seat at the center of the table. "Smells good in here."\n\n"Oh, shut up, you," Torque said with a roll of her eyes, dropping a plate of grilled corn and mashed potatoes in front of him. "I may be a handimare, but cooking ain't one of my skills."\n\n"Oh, I beg to differ," Kerfuffle said, snickering. "Maybe you should consider changing careers!"\n\nAnother hearty laugh was had at that, the cheer pushing away the underlying tensions in everypony present. Sunny could see it in the way Torque shuffled from hoof to hoof, the way Kerfuffle kept fluffling up her wings, the way Petunia stayed glued to his side, the way the Barrel twins would stop their play every few minutes to look around as if they'd heard something. Nopony knew what the future would hold for the town of Hope Hollow, and nopony held any delusions that it would be better than Equestrian rule. But they would get through it together. That, Sunny Skies was certain of."

Queen Chrysalis had returned to Canterlot and, of course, had ordered another parade to be thrown to herald her return to the city. Thankfully, Jachs had been able to dump planning off on Oberstleutnant Alcippe, who already had a filing cabinet full of all the preparations the city would need to make every time the Queen returned to bask in (and obsess over) her triumph over Equestria. Jachs had more important things to do than entertain his Queen's ego, anyway, like keep her damn country from falling apart.\n\nThankfully, the changeling Jachs was looking for was already seated in the diner. Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio watched the parade through the window with idle interest, and he slowly turned his gaze to Jachs as the Generalmajor sat down across from him. "Generalmajor," Marsilio said with a nod. "I trust you are doing well?"\n\n"As well as I usually am," Jachs said with a shrug. "I'll survive. Now, what did we need to go over again?"\n\n"The formation of a sixth great hive," Marsilio said, opening his briefcase and laying a folder full of notes in front of Jachs for him to peruse. "As I'm sure you're acutely aware, there are cities near the old border that were heavily colonized by changelings prior to the Great War. Our Great Queen wants us to take that a step further and select one to focus our efforts on. My team and I have winnowed our choices down to the cities of Acornage and Vanhoover. Both have large changeling populations and, with a little more effort, could be 'colonized' to become ethnically changeling.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.857.t:0 "A Tale of Two Cities"
changelings_paxchrysalia.857.d:0 ""The catch is that Vanhoover and Acornage are two very different cities," Marsilio said. "Acornage is a smaller city, but a city nonetheless. It has a large changeling population that's already fairly integrated into the city — or rather, it was before the war, but it was displaced by the pony citizens living there as the war dragged on and on, despite the fact that we swiftly occupied it near the beginning of hostilities. It's spread out with ample room to build up, and I've heard the climate is temperate and tolerable. It would be an ideal place to build a new hive."\n\n"Then why is Vanhoover on the table?" Jachs asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Well, Vanhoover is one of Equestria's largest cities," Marsilio explained. "It has a massive naval complex that makes it incredibly valuable to our navy. It is also the more prestigious of the two cities. Imagine if we could convert Vanhoover, an Equestrian stronghold, into the sixth great hive." But Marsilio's enthusiasm quickly wavered. "However, it's not as simple as that. The changeling population there is larger than in Acornage, yes, but it's smaller percentage-wise. It's also less integrated into the community than the changelings in Acornage. Most changelings live in exclaves and communities surrounding the city rather than in the city itself. Integrating it could prove challenging and expensive, considering the sheer number of ponies living in it. Making it an ethnically changeling city could prove too difficult a task for us... however, these are your lands to control as you see fit. Chrysalis has entrusted you with that duty, not me nor my team. So before I can begin anything, I need your approval, and your decision.""

"I like it," she said, leaning forward and clopping her hooves together. "Vanhoover shall be the sixth great hive of the hegemony. What an impressive way to twist the knife in those blasted princesses' wounds than forcing them to watch from afar as we turn one of their great pony cities into a sprawling and modern hive. It will be like ushering in a new era. An era of the Queen." Chrysalis laughed to herself a little more, then lazily lounged back on her throne. "So, when can we start?"\n\n"Err... your Majesty," one of the royal advisors interjected before Lycitus could respond. "Vanhoover is a massive pony metropolis. The changeling exclaves that lived around it before the war are on the fringes of the city's borders, thoroughly marginalized by its pony populace. We would have to export so many ponies, level so many districts of the city, and then the costs of moving changelings to Vanhoover and rebuilding the city... I don't know if we could reasonably support such an operation."\n\n"Well, you will figure it out," Chrysalis snapped back at him, a harsh frown gripping her features.

"It was... determined to be the most feasible candidate," Jachs ventured, daring to explain himself to his furious queen. "Acornage has a large community of changelings already living in it, making up a significant percentage of the population. It's closer to the border as well, and it would be significantly cheaper to build up and turn into a proper changeling hive. It's the most logical choice."\n\n"It's a useless backwater, is what it is!" Chrysalis exclaimed. "Why not one of Equestria's grand cities? Why not Vanhoover or Bales! Even Ponyville would make a better sixth hive than Acornage!"\n\n"Just trust in us, your Majesty," Marsilio pleaded. "We've figured out the logistics, and we've got plans in place. If you trust in us, we can make Acornage the grandest of all the hives in the Hegemony. We will make it the Hegemony's crown jewel, a hive that will outshine all the others. Even Vesalipolis itself." He bowed his head in supplication. "Give us your trust, your Majesty, and some time. And you will not be disappointed."\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Chrysalis finally sighed and waved her hoof. "Fine, Marsilio. You have my patience and trust... for now.

Our troops are struggling to contain the riots, and there have been reports of extrajudicial killings of changelings and ponies alike throughout the metropolis. We've had to deploy some additional protection to the changeling communities located on the city's fringes." Then, swallowing hard, he nervously continued. "Your Majesty... this is getting out of hoof. We might be better off canceling the project entirely."\n\n"Better off? Are you stupid?" Chrysalis' wings flitted with rage.

There are simply too many ponies in the city, and their resistance to our efforts is too intense to continue. Not only that, but it is actively contributing to the growth of resistance cells in the city and the surrounding countryside. I say we content ourselves with what we've accomplished so far and leave it at that."\n\n"But what about the Queen?" one of the officers of the Queen's Guard asked.

changelings_paxchrysalia.62.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs smiled and admired the parade processing outside his window. It had been almost a year of hard work, but they had done it. With the aid of the Heer and the Wohnungsabteilung, the city of Acornage had been reshaped and molded into the sixth great hive of the Hegemony, and the results were nothing less than outstanding. Entire neighbourhoods had been leveled and rebuilt according to changeling sensibilities, and the call for settlers around the nation had been met with great enthusiasm, especially from within the ranks of the Heer, as the promises of free and spacious housing drew patriotic changelings to the city in droves. Not only that, but the relatively small size of Acornage made the deportation of ponies considered to be risky Equestrian loyalists simple and easy. The city was, by all appearances, a changeling city, a fact only further reinforced when Queen Chrysalis herself rode down the main street at the head of her triumphal parade and assumed official suzerainty over the hive as its queen.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect transformation, Jachs understood; it never could be. Moving half of the city's pony population into the countryside and replacing it with an equal number of changeling settlers would have been next to impossible. At the end of the day, the city was still somewhere around 75% pony, but that was a number Jachs was okay with. The pony population, mostly relegated to the position of second-class citiens, would provide more than enough Love for the changelings living there as to be self-sustaining, and the influx of soldier-settlers meant that there would only be an even more watchful eye kept on the partisan activities transpiring within its borders. Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio has promised the Queen that Acornage would become the brightest of the crown jewels, and through its rebirth into the Hive-Colony of Alvarium, it had become exactly that."

They were all soldiers, much like Murlen himself, but none wore their uniforms.

Instinct snapped Murlen to attention, just like all the other soldiers present, as Filigree addressed the crowd.\n\n"Loyal soldiers of the Heer!" she proclaimed, raising her voice to be easily heard over the trains waiting in the station. "Today, we set forth for the southeast, where the Heer has generously granted us all property of our own to settle the barbaric wilderness of the Equestrian frontier. Many of you certainly see this as a gift or an award, and while your service in the war earned you this land, it is not a gift freely given. We are soldiers of the Heer first and foremost, and citizens of the Hegemony second. We are not being given this land to put down our arms and grow fat off of the Love of the ponies; rather, we have been given this land to police it and to control it. It is the belief of the High Command that only local settlements of experienced and hardened soldiers living among the pony communities can put an end to partisan activity, and so that is why you have all been granted land of your own. We are to build new communities and control the towns where we will now live, and together, our efforts will secure the rule of our queens over Equestria.

To that end, my staff and I have developed a theory of warfare that I feel is key to approaching this task: something I call the doctrine of Balanced Asymmetry."\n\nHe pressed the button on the clicker and the projector advanced to the first slide, with the words 'BALANCED ASYMMETRY' printed in bold letters. "The Hives are not at peace; make no mistakes here, we are still very much at war. Contrary to information disseminated by certain high-profile members of the military and government, the Equestrian populace is far from being docile subjects of our Queen."\n\n"Our struggle against the subversives of the Harmonic Resistance will not be a conventional war. This is the realm of partisans and saboteurs, where any civilian you encounter on the streets could be a member of the resistance. Forget fire support and top cover as you move from building to building. Nine times out of ten, the only things your soldiers will have to rely upon are their wits and the changelings next to them."\n\n"While the Heer was built up to crush the Equestrian armed forces, we must now adapt to continue to thrive in a world without formal armies, but one of slow-burning insurgencies and sporadic uprisings. Make your peace with the fact that the glorious blitzkriegs of the Great War have become a relic of the past, if you haven't already. Before I continue... are there any questions?""

The speaker on the stage was already well into her presentation, and the officers and generals of the Queen's Guard in the front rows gave her their utmost attention. Rather than moving up to the front of the crowd, however, Jachs slipped into one of the back rows, where Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio watched the presentation with a bored look on his face.\n\n"Sorry I'm late," Jachs apologized, sitting down next to the Surgeon-General. "Budgeting concerns with the staff took longer than anticipated."\n\n"Don't apologize; be grateful you've missed this much," Marsilio drawled. He lazily pointed a hoof at the uniformed changeling on stage as she clicked through the slides in her presentation. "This hack psychologist is making a mockery of the whole field of psychology. She's more interested in the Queen's payroll than she is in honest research."\n\n"You don't say?" Jachs frowned at a slide that showed a caricature of a pony cowering under the waving whips of three changelings standing above it. "What's she talking about?"\n\n"'Learned helplessness'," Marsilio said, making air quotes with his hooves. "The Queen's Guard believe that by stepping on the necks of ponies everywhere, eventually they'll give up resisting us, assuming that their helplessness is the natural state of the world. That's why they think the widespread suppression activities they pulled off a few months ago are effective."\n\nJachs scoffed at that. "All they accomplished was sending the resistance cells to ground. They think that was a success, when really it just made things worse."\n\nMarsilio shook his head. "Try telling them that.""

He and Marsilio decided to stop in at a Love bar before going their separate ways for the night and discuss the idiocy they'd both heard.\n\n"'Learned helplessness. Ridiculous," Marsilio bemoaned. "The only reason such a concept exists is because the Queen's Guard and the fanatics believe their own propaganda. They think ponies are little more than livestock that can be cowed into submission. They're incapable of understanding that brutal oppression will never get the ponies to stop fighting us. If given the choice between repeated pain and misery or a chance to end it all one way or another, any rational creature will take the latter option."\n\n"And they are," Jachs said, slowly nodding. "That's why things are this bad. The Queen's Guard and other zealous commanders in the Heer seem to enjoy brutalizing the populace because of their misguided mindsets. All this vicious violence is getting us is dead innocents, dead soldiers, and weakening our grip on Equestria. They haven't learned that a more moderate approach is needed, an understanding approach. And I don't think they ever will."\n\nMarsilio was quite for a moment as he thought that over. "Well, we can't control the entirety of the Heer, or the Queen's Guard, or all the fanatics that our Queen is surrounding herself with, but we can do our own parts in our own ways," he finally said. "You and I, Generalmajor, we're both 'lings with a rational disposition. We understand the plight of the ponies and the soldiers who have to interact with them more than the Queen and her guard do. Perhaps it falls to us to do the best we can to keep the ponies safe and stop the bloodshed."\n\n"Yes," Jachs agreed. "Perhaps you're right about that.""

CHN_event_67_variant_one_loc:0 "Morning Frost yawned and rolled over in bed as her alarm clock began to ring, reaching for it with a lazy hoof before finally shutting it off. She considered going back to sleep — her blankets were so comfortable — but finally managed to drag herself out of bed and to her hooves. It was Saturday, and that meant she had the entire day to herself.\n\nAfter eating breakfast and getting herself ready for the day, Frost stepped outside and took a moment to shiver in the cool air of the morning, her eyes admiring her namesake on the plants in her garden. It was spring, but soon it would be summer, and the morning frost would be gone until autumn. Might as well enjoy it while she could.\n\nThe mare ventured out of her property and set along the sidewalk into town toward the markets, a basket held in her magic as she hummed to herself. She exchanged a few greetings with some of the neighbors she'd come to know ever since moving into town a few months back, and stopped by Lily Lilac's fence to share a few bits of juicy gossip on the way. She loved getting to talk to Lily; the petite earth pony always had a way of making her laugh, and she always found out the most interesting things. But just as she was getting set to leave, Lily frowned and leaned a little closer to the fence. "Did you hear what happened to Carpenter's colt?"\n\n"No," Morning said, tilting her head in concern. "What happened?"\n\n"Carpenter caught him out late last night, after curfew," Lily answered. "He thinks the colt's trying to get in contact with the resistance. Stupid teenager. The buggers'll kill him if they find out!"\n\nMorning's face paled. "Oh no," she said, anxiously shuffling a hoof. "Do you think any know?"\n\n"Not yet," Lily said with a shake of her head. But then she narrowed her eyes at the house on the other side of the street. "But keep an eye out for the Rivers over there," she said. "They've been watching me do my yardwork the past few days. I think they're bug spies.""
CHN_event_67_variant_two_loc:0 "Morning Frost stepped out her front door and rocked back and forth on antsy hooves, feeling a nervous energy running through her body. What she'd seen and heard last night had left her both scared and filled with a righteous energy to strike back at the bugs that had taken her country from her. She doubted she'd ever be able to push the resistance leader's words out of her mind: the only way to take back Equestria was to make the bugs hurt at every step they took, until they had enough and pulled back. Even timberwolves knew not to stick their noses where it hurt; the changelings would learn that lesson in a few days.\n\n"Morning, Morning." The mare jumped at her name, but she soon calmed down when she realized it was just her elderly neighbor, Patches. The old stallion gave her a look as if he knew something was wrong, and he stepped closer to the fence that separated his property from hers. "Something on your mind, Morning? You were out late last night. I hope you're not getting involved in anything those hooligans are planning."\n\nDespite the elderly pony's kind demeanor, Morning Frost felt herself bristle. "They're not hooligans, Patches," she informed him, matter-of-factly. "They're the only ponies trying to make a difference out here. And I'm going to help them stick it to the bugs when they come through town in that big convoy of theirs tomorrow."\n\nPatches frowned at her. "Morning, you're getting caught up in things you'd be best off staying out of. You're going to get yourself killed, you hear?"\n\n"If I die fighting the bugs, then so be it," she said, scowling back at him. "Somepony's gotta be willing to lay down their lives to stop the bugs.

"There's more and more of them everyday," the stallion growled. "And they stop you for anything. You look at 'em funny? That's a stop and frisk, and if you give lip? They're taking you to the station. Chisel said something to them a few days back, and nopony's seen him since. I bet the bugs got him. They had to."\n\n"But, like, they wouldn't kill him, would they?" Morning asked, anxiously crossing a foreleg over her chest. "He hasn't done anything wrong!"\n\n"Tell that to the bugs," Terracotta said, spitting onto the sidewalk as the last changeling car rolled past. "They don't care about us ponies. Not one bit. And they got their spies everywhere, so watch what you say. Especially around the Rivers."\n\n"Lily also said something about the Rivers," Morning Frost said, worrying her lip with her teeth. "Do you really think they're spies?"\n\n"Have to be," Terracotta said. "They just moved in a week ago, and they've already got that big house of theirs looking nice. Nopony gets any of the nice big houses, not since the bugs took over. But the bugs, on the other hoof..."\n\nTerracotta shook his head as the two ponies stood in silence by the edge of the road. "You get any... mail lately?" Terracotta finally asked.\n\n"No... why?" Frost asked him.\n\n"I did. Special discount at the farmer's market on Friday. Think I'm gonna... think I'm gonna check it out. You interested?"\n\nSomething about the way he said it made Morning's hair stand up on end, and his words clicked in her mind. "Terracotta... I... really don't think that's a good idea. Lots of ponies go to those discounts, you know? Somepony could get hurt, especially when the bugs find out."\n\n"Somepony's gotta go," Terracotta said with a harumph. "Might as well be me. You snooze, you lose, Morning. Sometimes you gotta just go out there yourself if you want things to get done.""
CHN_event_867_variant_two_loc:0 "After leaving Patches behind, Morning Frost spent the rest of the day tending to her garden behind her house, doing her best to put on some semblance of normalcy. It wouldn't be good to be acting shifty in case the bugs came patrolling down her street. But she just had to hold on for today, and then get ready to meet with the rest of the resistance at midnight to start planting bombs...\n\n"Afternoon, Frost," came a mare's voice, and Morning looked up to see Lily Lilac, a councilpony from before the bugs moved into town and disbanded the town council, leaning on her fence. "Beautiful day for planting flowers, isn't it?"\n\n"It's a beautiful day alright," Morning said. "It'd be even more beautiful if we could get rid of the damn bugs buzzing around."\n\nLily features slowly turned dour. "You're still worrying about the changelings?" she asked in a soft voice.\n\n"You aren't?" Morning asked, raising an eyebrow at her.\n\nLily shook her head. "I'm upset," she said, "but fighting and struggling isn't going to do anything except make this whole thing worse. Everything that the resistance does leads to changeling reprisals. You haven't forgotten that, have you?"\n\n"No, of course not. But we still have to do something! We can't just sit around here and let them beat us down forever!"\n\n"Some days, doing the best we can do may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn't perfect on any front, and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or anypony else," Lily said. She hopped over the fence and put a hoof on Morning's shoulder. "What are they trying to get you to do, Morning?" she asked.\n\nMorning hesitated, but finally she sighed and bowed her head. "We were going to blow up the bridge over the river when the convoy went through tomorrow," she said. "Something to stick it to the bugs."\n\nLily slowly nodded. "Don't go," she urged Morning. "Radical action doesn't lead to anything except more violence and more death. But if we take a middle ground... maybe work things out peacefully with the changelings... things can be better for all of us.""

CHN_event_967_variant_one_loc:0 "Morning Frost sighed as she finally returned to her house and set her groceries on the kitchen table. The whole town just seemed so tense, especially her neighbors, her close friends she'd made since moving in. It seemed like every day, the changelings invested a heavier and heavier presence in the town, and more and more ponies were joining the ranks of the resistance. It felt like given enough time, everypony would choose a side in the conflict brewing behind closed doors.\n\nAfter taking some time to put away her groceries, Morning Frost went back to her bedroom and shut the door. She lay down on the bed, hooves rubbing tired eyes, and groaned as her spine decompressed. Her mind kept wandering back to what Terracotta and Lily had said. The Rivers seemed like such a nice couple. It was odd that her friends had immediately marked them as changeling spies. She felt a pang of remorse that the new couple was already ostracized from society and they'd only been in town a few days. And she couldn't do anything nice for them, lest even her friends think that she was a changeling sympathizer...\n\nThe alarm by her bedside rang again for three o'clock sharp. Grunting, Morning Frost stood up and reached under her bed, dragging out a suitcase. When she opened it, however, she was greeted by a mass of wires, a microphone, and an antenna. Propping it up and pointing the antenna toward her window, Morning Frost drew the curtains closed and shifted her weight from hoof to hoof as she waited for the signal to arrive.\n\n"Operative Frost, come in. It's time for your report."\n\nA flash of green magic, and Morning Frost's disguise fell away, revealing fangs and black chitin. "I'm here," she tiredly replied. "And I found out a couple of interesting things today.""
CHN_event_967_variant_two_loc:0 "The shooting started just before dawn, waking Morning Frost from her sleep. A staccato cacophony rang out over the town, coupled with distant screams and the thump of heavy munitions. But it was over almost as soon as it started, and it wasn't long before she saw the changeling vehicles rolling down the road, all intact save for a few fresh bullet holes added to the sheet metal here and there.\n\nWhen she went into town, the news of a failed partisan action was on everypony's lips. As luck would have it, a changeling patrol stumbled across the resistance as they were wiring explosives to the bridge across the river, and a fierce firefight broke out between the two sides. The partisans had been slaughtered almost to the last, and the few prisoners the changelings took certainly didn't have anything to look forward to. But thanks to the actions of the garrison, the bridge had been saved from destruction, and that meant the town could still trade with the rest of Equestria and the Hegemony. Life could continue as normal.\n\nWhen Morning Frost came home that afternoon, she shut the door behind her and slumped down against the wall. If it hadn't been for Lily Lilac's cautioning words, she would have been amongst the ponies massacred at the bridge. She'd narrowly escaped a brush with death and didn't know it until after the fact, and now she was grateful for her neighbors.\n\nForget the resistance. It was a doomed cause. But at least now, she'd escaped with her life. And maybe should could make a difference in another way, just as Lily had recommended, and make her neighborhood a peaceful and happy place in these troubling times."

She moved from her bed in one small corner of the house to the sink in the other and combed out her hair, making her messy mane presentable for the day. Once that was done and her teeth were clean, the pegasus slipped into her suit and shrugged her wings through the slits in the back. Just as she always did every morning, the mare spread her wings in front of the mirror and frowned at where the taper of her feathers ended in a blunt and stubby end. With her wings clipped as they were, she struggled to fly further than twenty or thirty meters in a single bound, but that was part of her agreement with Herr Kader. She was his bodyguard, supposed to stay close by his side when touring Equestria, not flying away and leaving him behind.\n\nTucking her pistol into its holster with her chopped feathers, Cloudchaser left her bedroom and started her morning routine of walking around the perimeter of Herr Kader's estate. The changeling industrialist had amassed a fortune off of providing material for war with Equestria, and the bug had put it to good use by erecting a massive manor on his hundred acre plot of land, and bringing in ponies as indentured servants to maintain it for him. Cloudchaser paused by a window looking out over the garden, where earth ponies laboring in leaden horseshoes tended to the plants, the extra weights around their hooves making sure that they wouldn't get very far if they broke their contracts and ran. Further out in the driveway, a pair of unicorns tended to Herr Halter's antique automobile, their coats covered in grease and the chips on the ends of their weakened horns flaring up every so often. All the ponies on Herr Kader's estate had been granted to the changeling by the Hegemony in recognition for the services he provided to the hives during the war, and Cloudchaser, an ex-soldier who fought in the Great War, had been bound to his service for ten years to atone for her 'crimes' of standing up to the bugs on the battlefield. It was humiliating and degrading, but at least she had things better than the earth ponies or the unicorns on the estate. And, given what she'd heard about the changeling POW camps, it was certainly better than the alternatives. So she'd carry on, just as she always had.\n\nOnly nine years, ten months, and seventeen days left to go."

The changelings he'd hired to document the war in all its glory had truly lived up to their expensive price tags. Sweeping shots of shell-cratered battlefields, burning Equestrian flags, long lines of pony POWs, and the gutted remains of Equestrian tanks greeted the two changelings one after the other, while bombastic fanfare played over it all. A massive grin adorned Chrysalis' muzzle, and she even let out a cheer and a giggle as a platoon of jaegers dynamited a massive golden sun hanging over an archway leading into the Canterlot Castle. It was just as Trimmel had hoped; she was greatly enjoying the film.\n\n"So, my Queen," Trimmel began, sensing that Chrysalis was in a jovial enough mood to be agreeable to what he was about to ask of her. "I have been thinking lately about the state of the Heer. The Great War was truly our greatest achievement. I think the film speaks to that. But now I need to talk to you about what comes after."\n\n"After?" Chrysalis absent-mindedly asked, but her focus immediately shifted back to an Equestrian battleship's keel breaking in two as a volley of torpedoes ripped through the hull, with scores of pony sailors falling off the decks and into the oil fire burning on top of the water.\n\n"Yes, after," Trimmel said. "See, the Heer's task now is larger than ever before. We need more resources, more changelings, more competent officers to operate at peak effectiveness... I was hoping, my Queen, that you would be able to provide such things for us."\n\n"More... officers?" Chrysalis asked, her attention only catching the last thing Trimmel said. "Yes, sure, ummm..." She looked over her shoulder to where a page stood in the back of the room, always ready to receive orders from the Queen. "Have all the generals in the Heer promoted to field marshals," she said, dismissively waving her hoof. "That should be reward enough for it."\n\nTrimmel blinked in surprise as the page bowed and stepped away, and Chrysalis turned her attention back to the film.

Ever since Chrysalis had decided to promote every general to field marshal because she thought that was what Trimmel wanted, the Heer had been in a state of anarchy and confusion. Suddenly, there were too many high commanders and not enough subordinates directly under them, and that made figuring out the chain of command from the top to the bottom almost impossible. Trimmel had started working overtime to find suitable candidates to raise up to generals and re-establish some semblance of structure back into the Heer, but he knew his efforts were a stopgap at the most for the time being. The changelings he was promoting weren't always the best or the most deserving, but they would at least hold things over for now.\n\nBut worst of all, even worse than the chaos in the Heer, was that all the new field marshals suddenly had a louder voice and a bigger platform to share their opinions from. All of the clutter at the highest ranks of the Heer meant that Trimmel's own voice had been diminished in turn. He was still the Hegemony's Hivesmarschall, its one and only, but where before there had only been a couple of field marshals below him, there were now many, many more. And all the chatter was making his own voice harder to hear.\n\nFrustrated, Trimmel pulled a sheet of paper over and began to scribble an order onto it. "All I need to do is create a few worthless ranks between me and the field marshals, and everything will be back to normal," he thought aloud. It was truly a brilliant idea, one that would declutter the highest ranks of the Heer and give him his all-important influence back. So long as the marshals were pushed further down the chain of command, then they wouldn't be able to compete with his authority anymore.\n\nGrinning, Hivesmarschall Trimmel pulled a bottle of Stalliongradian vodka out of a drawer in his desk, pulled off the cap, and took several deep swigs straight from the source.

Sitting by his side was his good friend, General Arcus Venn, and between them was a piping hot pot of tea. For once, the two officers and friends had aligned their schedules to enjoy some afternoon tea together and simply talk about whatever came to mind. One such topic was the slow evolution of the Heer through the infusion of young blood beginning to climb its ranks. "The days of blitzkrieg and shock and awe are over with," Jachs said with a slow nod. "The officers of tomorrow have to dedicate their time to counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare. It pales compared to the glory of the Great War, but it is so much more important."\n\n"Indeed," Venn said. "Taking Equestria was the easy part, but keeping it is the hard part. I suppose you're to thank for helping us keep it. It seemed like you alone had the clout to stand up to all those sycophants in the Queen's Guard. They would have burned the nation down and called it a success because it killed a few ponies."\n\n"Oh, I was hardly alone. I had many good bugs working with me to make sure we pulled through." A knock on the open doorframe alerted the two generals to a visitor, and Jachs turned his head back to see an aide holding a piece of paper out to Arcus for him to sign. The general took it in his magic, scanned it over, then took the offered pen and scribbled his signature on it. When the aide disappeared, Jachs raised his eyebrow. "What was that about?"\n\n"Oh, that? Nothing glorious, like you were saying," Venn said with a small smirk. "That was a directive for expanding the armament of the pony collaborationists. It's about time we started getting some Equestrians to fall under our hoof and turn on their comrades."\n\nJachs nodded in thought. "Divide and conquer," he said.

The executioner read their crimes to the crowd, that of harboring a resistance agent in their home for a few days, before the platform the two stood on collapsed at the pull of a lever. The crowd gasped as the two ponies fell with one last frightened cry, and somewhere, an older mare started weeping.\n\n"They're getting rowdy," Oberstleutnant Alcippe uncomfortably noted, pointing to the crowd. "We should disperse them."\n\n"Yes," Jachs dully said. He vaguely gesticulated with a hoof. "Use tear gas. That should be enough to get them to scatter. Arrest those that don't run."\n\nAlcippe wordlessly nodded and disappeared from the gallery, and within minutes, clouds of smoke began to rise amongst the protestors as ponies cried out and began to flee.

And, if you're fighting ponies, how much fun you have doing it."\n\nJachs watched the ponies being loaded into trucks in front of him, the effects of the tear gas finally beginning to wear off. They'd been defeated, but they'd hardly been broken. The gas attack only seemed to remind them that their only options were to revolt or die trying. They couldn't keep living under the brutalities the changelings inflicted on them every day. Sooner or later, Equestria would come to a breaking point, and there would be nothing the Heer could do to hold onto an entire nation in revolt. He wondered if he'd get a war tribunal at the end of it all to assess his guilt in terrorizing the ponies of Canterlot, or if he'd be lynched from the castle's tallest flagpole when Canterlot finally fell.\n\nJachs sighed and stood up, wanting to put as much distance between Dieter and himself as he could. "Do what you like, Dieter," he muttered. "I'm not interested in fighting you over this."\n\nHe could have stopped the Queen's Guard captain, he realized. He had enough leverage with the Heer and Queen Chrysalis herself to block Dieter's plans, if he just tried hard enough. But what was the point? Nothing would change. The ponies would still rise up, and eventually every officer in the Heer would be dead, punished for their crimes. Jachs had already let things get this far out of hoof. What was a little more cruelty at the end of the day?\n\nThe only thing on Jachs' mind as he returned to his office was the bottle of vodka in his desk. He pulled it out and broke the seal, putting the bottle directly to his lips. Maybe if he was lucky, the vodka would kill him before the ponies did."

changelings_paxchrysalia.72.d:0 "The billboard over the farm was the first thing Jachs noticed as his car came to a stop. Stepping out of the shiny black staff car, Jachs squinted at the billboard. 'SWEET APPLE ACRES', the sign read, placed above a grinning orange earth pony wrapping her forelegs around the shoulders of two famous changeling film actors, all three grinning from ear to ear. 'HOME TO THE SWEETEST FRUIT IN ALL THE HIVES; EACH APPLE PICKED WITH LOVE', read the message below it. Jachs frowned. Had one of the infamous Elements of Harmony really gone turncoat? He had to find out.\n\nHe thought back to the Great War as he made his way up toward the farmhouse at the top of the hill, his contingent of bodyguards staying close by his side. He had come across the Element Bearers once in the field during the Great War. Those damn ponies had rallied the soldiers under their command and repelled wave after wave of Jachs' veteran jaegers, refusing to yield a critical bridgehead until the Equestrian Army's retreat had been secured. They only finally retreated once Jachs managed to make the bridgehead a high priority target for the Luftwaffe, before bringing forward two companies of tanks to break through under a creeping artillery barrage. Out of all the engagements Jachs took part in during the Great War, that one had nearly broken him as a commander. The irony wasn't lost on him that now the end of the war had seemingly broken one of those mares and placed her squarely under his hoof as the administrator of central Equestria.\n\nPony laborers paused their work in the fields to watch Jachs as he approached, at least until their changeling overseers barked at them to get back to it. When Jachs looked up at the porch of the farmhouse, he saw the orange mare herself sitting in a rocking chair, watching the indentured servants labor hard in her fields. He wasn't sure how to feel about the sight. Hadn't this mare been the incarnation of honesty? Hadn't she been one of the most loyal ponies in all of Equestria? What was she doing suddenly supporting the changelings? Something about it twisted his gut the wrong way, but he couldn't put a name to the feeling.\n\nThe mare noticed Jachs approaching, and she stood up and donned her hat before trotting out to meet him. "Howdy, y'all, and welcome to Sweet Apple Acres!" she proclaimed, her voice dripping with hospitality. "Name's Applejack. Pleasure to meet you... erm, is it Oberstleutnant?" Applejack asked, sheepishly cocking her head to the side. "Forgive me, I ain't the best with the ranks of the Heer yet. I weren't the smartest of ponies, not that many of us are all that intelligent.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.73.d:0 ""Ah, right, s'cuse me for forgettin', Generalmajor." Applejack put on the most sincere and apologetic smile she could muster. "You thirsty, Generalmajor? I got fresh-pressed cider back in the house if you want some."\n\nApplejack emphatically nodded to her house, and Jachs waved a hoof for two of his bodyguards to enter first and inspect the premises. "In a minute, Miss Applejack," he said. He raised an eyebrow at her. "It is 'Miss', right? You aren't married?"\n\n"Married to my work, maybe," Applejack said with a laugh. "You don't get to be the biggest producer of fresh fruit in the Hegemony by sittin' 'round on your flank all day, enjoyin' your excesses. It was a bright and sunny day when the changelings moved in and took things over. Production's never been higher!"\n\nThat part was true, Jachs at least knew. He'd signed a few ordinances instructing changeling investors to devote funding to collaborationist industries in central Equestria, and Sweet Apple Acres had surprisingly been one of them. The simple orchards of the farm before the war had been expanded into massive plantations with on-site processing and shipping factories and warehouses. Applejack certainly profited massively from it, but would one of the former element bearers really turn that easily for money? "I know our regulations can be rather stringent," Jachs cautiously ventured, trying to bait out something from the pony renowned throughout the nation for her honesty. "Have they caused you too much trouble?"\n\n"Nope! Ain't had no problems in the slightest!" Applejack proudly proclaimed. "Sometimes you gotta be willin' to bend for the customer. The Hegemony is just my newest and largest customer."\n\n"And your workers?" Jachs asked, gesturing out toward the fields where the indentured servants labor. "Any problems with them?"\n\n"Only problem with 'em I have is they don't work hard enough." Applejack nod-nod-nodded along. "Production could be even better if I squeezed a little more out of 'em. Thankfully I got some loyal changelings to help enforce order 'round here. Now, about that cider? Perhaps a room for the night? It's the least I could do for you, Generalmajor."\n\nJachs regarded the grinning mare standing in front of him and fought hard not to scowl. He didn't know what he'd expected; perhaps some sense of defiance? But no, all he saw was a broken mare who'd bend over backwards if he asked her to. Whatever Applejack had been before the war, she wasn't anymore... and he didn't know whether he should be pleased or disappointed."

changelings_paxchrysalia.74.d:0 "Jachs couldn't fall asleep that night. Something about the day's events bothered him. Applejack had been nothing but kind and courteous, perhaps a bit overly so, and had shown him nothing to leave him disappointed. The simple fact of the matter is that this larger than life figure, one of the six mares who had saved Equestria time and time again, had reduced herself to the perfect collaborationist, the perfect pony subject for the Hegemony. It was what any changeling would have wanted: a perfect figurehead of collaboration to show the rest of the rebellious populace. So why didn't it sit well with him?\n\nPerhaps it was all an act, Jachs thought to himself. Applejack had been surrounded by changeling soldiers and enforcers the whole day. Maybe she was just acting? But he frowned at the ceiling of the master bedroom he'd been placed in for the night. Could the element of honesty lie so convincingly? Could she betray her element like that? Maybe she was just a figurehead here, a puppet, and the changelings around the farm were the ones really in control. Jachs felt that he had to know, if only to answer the question nagging him and eating away at him from the inside.\n\nJachs slipped out of bed and opened his door. The bodyguard he'd posted outside of it jumped, obviously startled back to reality after dozing; at least nopony had come to try and kill him while he rested. "Stay here," Jachs ordered him. "I'll be right back.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.75.d:0 "Jachs saw Applejack sit bolt upright in the small bed in the guest room as soon as the door creaked open. Her eyes were wide and her breath ragged, before she blinked and looked around. As soon as she saw Jachs, she swallowed hard, put on a smile, and kicked off her blankets. "Generalmajor," she said in greeting. "What's botherin' you? Anythin' I can getcha?"\n\nRather than answering, Jachs stepped inside and slowly shut the door behind him, waiting until he heard the quiet click of the latch. Then, pulling a chair over from the corner of the room, he sat down backwards on it and rested his forehooves on the back. "Applejack," he slowly began, trying to carefully pick his words. "Why did you do it?" he finally asked her. "Why did you sacrifice everything you had to become..." He gestured around them, as if that explained it all. "To become this?"\n\nApplejack opened her mouth to spit out the same lines she'd been feeding him all day, but something in Jachs' eyes stopped her. Finally, after several long seconds to deliberate, she frowned at the officer instead of smiled. "I gotta protect these ponies," she said in a low voice. "I gotta do everythin' I can do to protect 'em. I fought against your kind for as long as I could to protect 'em. And that failed. Now I kiss your boots to protect 'em. Throwin' away my integrity, my element, my dignity? Ain't none of that was gonna help these ponies. But bein' your little toady, well, that was."\n\n"But why?" Jachs asked her. "I've heard rumors that your friends are fighting in the resistance against us. Why not join them? Why sacrifice all the intangibles you once held for a bunch of ponies you barely even know?"\n\n"Because there's more than one way to make a difference," Applejack said, her voice dropping to an almost inaudible level as her eyes fell to the floor. "It ain't all gotta be guns and glory. I'm doin' whatever I gotta do to protect ponies. 'Cause that's the Equestrian way." She looked at him. "I know changelings don't share the same morals as us ponies. You may have won the war, but we ain't lost, Generalmajor. Because we're willin' to do whatever it takes to protect each other. You consume and destroy. We provide and protect.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.76.d:0 ""Why do you wanna know so bad, Jachs?" Applejack asked him. "You wanna find out if I was bein' sincere or not? You wanna rip me away from these ponies for bein' a pony sympathizer? I can't help who I am. I can't help I'm an Equestrian through and through anymore than you can't help bein' a soldier for the bugs. And shoot, if I can't help but help ponies, then what's that mean for the two of us?"\n\nJachs was silent for a long while. Why did he want to know so badly? Why did Applejack's apparent subservience to the Hegemony bother him so much? But slowly, like the stars appearing in the dim light of a dying dusk, the thoughts began to connect themselves together. "I think I wanted to believe in something," Jachs said, his eyes not meeting Applejack's. "I think I wanted to know that some things are too sacred to collapse. Deep down inside, you're still a believer in harmony, and in Equestria. If we had managed to break you and turn you — honestly turn you — then I don't think I could have trusted any laws of nature in this world."\n\nHis gaze turned toward the open window, where the stars and the moon lit up the farmland outside. "It's... comforting to know, I think, that no matter how bad things get, there are ponies that won't surrender their ideals. No matter how evil this world gets, there are still those who try to do good. That, I think, means a lot to me."\n\n"And what about you, Generalmajor?" Applejack asked, eyebrow raised. "You tryin' to do good in this world your kind created?"\n\n"I... don't know," Jachs admitted. "I will never betray my country. I will do everything I can to maintain the Pax Chrysalia. But perhaps it doesn't have to be a world of tyranny and oppression. Maybe it can be one of cooperation for the good of both our species."\n\nHe stood up and pushed the chair back into the corner of the room. "Thank you, Applejack," he said, bowing his head toward the earth pony. "Carry on with your work. I will not bother you again."\n\nAnd then he left."

A few nearby soldiers offered the captain their salutes as he stepped past, though he paid them little mind. His attention was only on the Heer's Marechester headquarters looming in front of him, and his magic pushed open the doors to allow him entrance without breaking stride.\n\nInside, a lieutenant looked up as Rasch entered and saluted. "Hauptjäger Rasch," the lieutenant said by way of greeting.\n\nRasch returned the salute with a crisp one of his own. "Oberleutnant Tyrx," he answered, nodding. "I'm here. You're lucky you got through to me; I was just about to take the missus on vacation to Griffonia. Perfect way to celebrate the end of the war."\n\n"Oh, I didn't know, Hauptjäger," the lieutenant said. "I'm sorry to interrupt your plans with your family, but the situation in Marechester... we need the best."\n\n"Then you asked for the right bug." Rasch pulled out a cigarette and lit it, ignoring the grimace on the lieutenant's face. "I understand there's somepony you need me to kill."\n\n"Kill or capture, we just need the problem to go away," Tyrx said. He produced a file from the nearby table and passed it to Rasch. "We couldn't share the details earlier in case the resistance figured out you were coming and who you were after. Take a look now that you're here."\n\nEyebrow raised, Rasch flipped open the binder."

changelings_paxchrysalia.78.d:0 "The face that greeted Rasch was that of a blue mare with a rainbow mane, pulled from a promo shoot for the Wonderbolts some years back. The captain needed no introduction to Rainbow Dash. Still, he diligently read through the information compiled in the binder. Just because he knew who Rainbow Dash was before the war didn't mean he knew who she was after it. Tyrx, in the meanwhile, took the opportunity to explain the situation in brief. "We spotted her a few weeks back leading some of the raids on our garrisons," he said. "She's coordinating a strike team of several pegasi to hit targets hard and then get out before we can respond. We put air wings on patrol around the city, but she went after those on her own wings and started bringing them down with ambush tactics. We had to pull them back. We need a more... precise touch."\n\nRasch slowly nodded as he synthesized Tyrx's briefing with the notes in the dossier. "If it's the real Rainbow Dash, then she's the fastest thing on this continent," he said. "It'll be tricky, but pegasi can't fly forever. Do you know if the rest of her team are Wonderbolts, too?"\n\n"We're not sure," Tyrx admitted. "The only one we can definitively identify is Rainbow Dash herself. VOPS is convinced she's the real thing. We don't have any reason to deny their conclusions." He hesitated, then asked the crucial question. "Sir... can you do it?"\n\nRash thought hard about that question. "Can? Yes," he said. "I can kill her. I can kill anybody, be it changeling, pony, deer, or griffon. I have the capabilities to. But do I have the luck? Will I succeed?" He shrugged. "I'm the Fallschirmjäger's most decorated soldier. You want the best of the best the Heer has to offer? That's me." Then he tossed the dossier on the table and placed his hoof over Rainbow Dash's face. "And she's the Wonderbolts' most decorated soldier. She was the best of the best the Equestrian army had to offer. She and myself, we're like two sides of the same coin. There may be a resemblance, but we never face the same direction."\n\nThen he turned and walked away. "Let me call a few old comrades. We'll fight fire with fire.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.79.t:0 "Look Out for Squalls"
changelings_paxchrysalia.79.d:0 "Hauptjäger Rasch waited in the cargo hold of the transport plane as it droned over the skies of Marechester. He could hear the buzzing of the escort fighters' engines through the aluminum walls of the metal beast, and he tried not to dwell on the fact that all the pilots were likely dead. But they were the bait to draw out the big prize, and a fisherling didn't mourn the worm cast into the lake to reel in the prized catch.\n\nHe checked his gear one last time. His insulated jacket would provide him the warmth he needed for fighting at altitude, and his goggles were snug to his face and crystal clear for perfect visibility. He'd made sure to change the oil for all the components of his automatic rifle with something rated for the arctic just in case his quarry took him to the frigid heights of the stratosphere. That rifle had saved his life more times than he could count in the sacking of Cloudsdale, and he'd need all the luck he could squeeze out of that cracked and splintered wooden stock tonight. Once he made sure his own gear was secure, he looked to the rest of his team. They were eight in total, but they'd always been eight, ever since their first drop over Vanhoover to their last drop over Manehattan. And now, one more drop awaited the eight paratroopers. One successful drop, and they'd be heroes — or at the very least, even bigger heroes than they already were.\n\nThe dull boom of an explosion rocked the transport from side to side, and a trio of bullets perforated the transport's hull above Rasch's head. "They're here, Hauptjäger!" came the co-pilot's voice over the intercom. "They're trying to force us to land!"\n\nRasch jumped to his hooves and slammed his hoof on the cargo door release. The lights inside the bay turned harsh red, and he was happy to see that the rest of his companions were already on their hooves and ready to take wing. "This is it, grubs!" Rasch screamed. "She's got a team with her. Keep 'em off me, and I'll take the Rainbow Rogue down myself!"\n\nA chorus of shouts answered him, and Rasch looked out the door as the light turned green. Fighters swerved in the light of dusk, their guns blazing as they fired glowing ribbons of tracers into the night. The shadowy figures of pegasi flitted between them, infinitely more agile on wings of feather than wings of aluminum, engaged in cat-and-mouse dogfights with the changeling planes. Though the pegasi were not as outgunned as they seemed; as Rasch watched, a changeling fighter flipped over and began to tumble out of the sky, burning kerosene spewing from an array of bullet holes in its left wing.\n\n"Now!" Rasch screamed, jumping out of the open door. "Jump!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.80.d:0 "The cold air struck Rasch in the face as soon as he was clear of the backwash of the transport plane. He let himself hang in freefall for a few moments to pick up speed, turning altitude into energy, before he snapped open gossamer wings and caught himself on the air. The shadows of the rest of his team arranged themselves in the air behind him as the transport sped away, one of the engines bursting into flame as a concentrated burst of gunfire ripped open fuel lines. Each changeling paired up with a nearby comrade, until four pairs aligned themselves in the sky. Then, pair by pair, they split off to chase down the flitting shadows of the pegasi soaring in and out of the dark gray clouds.\n\nRasch and his wingling, Aitha, swooped at the first pegasus to catch their eyes. Gunfire ripped through the night, the automatic weapons by their sides casting a harsh, strobing light against their bodies. A cry of pain answered them, and the body of the pegasus fell limp, blood streaming from their wounds as they plummeted toward the ground. If they hadn't died in the hail of gunfire, they'd die when they hit the ground, but all Rasch cared about was that the pegasus was an orange stallion, not a blue mare. They had to keep looking.\n\nBy then, the pegasi had realized that they'd been baited into a trap. Gunfire and tracer rounds raced across the night sky, the gunfire sounding like the crash of thunder between the clouds, punctuated by the drone and buzz of the remaining escort fighters trying to pick off their targets in the chaos. The planes were the fastest, but the least maneuverable, while the changelings were the slowest but had the most agility; the pegasi were somewhere in the middle, not quite fast enough to outfly a plane, yet not quite agile enough to outmaneuver a changeling. Rain pelted their bodies, first a slow drizzle, but rapidly increasing in intensity. And that was when Rasch saw her: the blue devil, the Rainbow Rogue, flying at them with guns blazing.\n\nAitha took the first volley and fell out of the sky. And though Rasch wanted nothing more than to cry out in dismay at losing an old colleague to the pegasus, he took the moment to line up his gun and fire... "

He saw his prismatic target falter and begin to fall, but she had enough strength to keep both her wings open and turn her tumble through the air into a glide. Rasch, all alone in the sky now that Aitha had fallen, chased the descending pegasus down to the ground, guns blazing. His quarry barely managed to spin out of the way of the first burst of bullets, and by the time Rasch lined up the second, his rifle only sputtered out a few rounds before clicking empty. He had to slow for a moment to focus on changing magazines, and by the time he was ready again, Rainbow Dash had put enough distance between them that firing further would only be a waste of ammunition. But he could see her target: a bombed-out factory below them that would give her ample cover to slink away and lick her wounds. Rasch wasn't going to let that happen.\n\nShe landed in a collapsed assembly plant, quickly scooting into cover and out of sight, and Rasch cautiously landed a few meters away. After checking that the pegasus wasn't about to ambush him, Rasch stalked forward, tongue sticking out just enough to taste the copper taste of blood in the air. He'd hurt her, that much was clear, and if she could bleed, she could die. A flashlight mounted under the barrel of his rifle illuminated the dark corridors of the collapsed factory, and he advanced bit by bit as he followed the trail of blood staining on the floor. Yet when he rounded a corner, expecting to find his quarry at a dead end, all he saw was a bloody rag torn from her Wonderbolts uniform balled up and tossed into the corner.\n\nToo late he realized his mistake, and by the time he realized it, a pair of bucks to the side sent Rasch collapsing to the ground, his carapace cracked, crushing the fragile, membranous wings it protected. His blood smeared the ground, mingling with the pegasus', and when he looked up, he saw her hobbling toward him, hunched over in pain from the wound to her chest. Blood dripped from bullet wounds in her body and wing, dribbling on the floor by her hooves; only sheer luck had saved her from a lethal shot. "Friggin' bugs," she wheezed, pointing her rifle at Rasch's head. "You almost got me. Almost. Don't feel too bad about this; that's the closest any of you have ever gotten."\n\nRasch didn't answer her. He only sighed, accepting his fate, and closed his eyes.\n\nHis last thoughts were of his newly widowed wife."

I thought we were both done for, but then... this yellow pony, she flew up in front of the manticore. And she... stared at it, or something, and it backed down. I thought she was going to kill us or something, but she saved us! She took us back to her little home she'd made in the forest, gave us fresh bandages, and a place to stay... she helped us so much. Then she showed us the way out, but when we turned to thank her, she'd already disappeared. I never got her name..."\n\n"I see." There was an awkward cough, and then something clunked onto the table in the recording. "Thank you for that, Stabsarzt. That will be all."\n\n"Oh... thank you. So, am I free to go? I'm feeling much better."\n\nA pause, and then: "Yes, well, we'll see about that, Stabsarzt. But you should know, consorting with the partisans of the Everfree Forest is a serious crime. The punishments are... severe."\n\nVaspier clicked off the tape player and raised an eyebrow at Jachs. "So, Generalmajor? What do you think?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.86.d:0 "Vaspier nodded at that exclamation from the Generalmajor. "Yes, our thoughts exactly. It appears that more of the Element Bearers survived the war than we had thought, or otherwise hoped. The presence of the pony named Fluttershy is an... unfortunate turn of events. And, given the overgrowth of the Everfree, it is unlikely that we will be able to mount a serious capture or assassination attempt on her."\n\n"So... why tell me?" Jachs asked. "If there's nothing we can do about it..."\n\n"You are the administrator for Canterlot and the surrounding area; the Everfree, overgrown as it is, falls under your jurisdiction. Thus, I felt it wise to inform you of this development, so you may be on the lookout for her presence, should she leave the forest." He stood up, and Jachs reflexively mirrored him. "Should she be seen away from the Everfree, please do let us know. We have plans in place for all of the Element Bearers. We just need them to be vulnerable before we execute them."\n\nJachs frowned. "All of the Element Bearers? None of them died during the war? How many survived?"\n\nVaspier only smiled politely and opened the door with his magic. "That will be all, Generalmajor. Oh, and try not to drink so much. Alcohol is good in moderation for relieving stress. In excess... well, you'd be setting a bad example for the rest of us."\n\n"I... I will try to keep that in mind, Vaspier," Jachs said. Then, shaken by Vaspier's comment, he quietly excused himself and slipped out the door."

changelings_paxchrysalia.87.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs sat on the balcony of Canterlot Castle, enjoying a warm summer's day in Equestria's grandest city. Though most changelings preferred the cold of back home, Jachs had spent enough time in central Equestria that he'd grown used to the pleasant temperature and sunny days. And after a day full of meetings and tough decision-making, sometimes the best way to relax was to just review and sign paperwork outside, with a glass of something stiff by his side to unwind before dinner.\n\nIt was 5 o'clock in Manehattan anyway, right?\n\nThe lack of a breeze was nice, as Jachs didn't have to worry about the wind catching any papers off the stack he had on the table next to him. He could take his time reviewing the papers, and when the small black letters strained his eyes, all he had to do was look out over the beautiful expanse of countryside below him for a few minutes before he was ready to tackle the next wave of missives. It was after one of these breaks that he pulled open a reinforcement request from the Queen's Guard, something he would have signed and forgotten about in a second had he not noticed the way the report tried to say nothing at all. Frowning, he pulled it closer with his magic and gave it a second look over. The report was as plain as could be, a simple request for more soldiers to guard the mines beneath Canterlot. That was odd. What could be in the mines beneath Canterlot that the Queen's Guard needed more troops?\n\nHe knew that wasn't a question that he could just ask. The fact the Queen's Guard went out of their way to explain as little as possible made that pretty clear. But did he decide to give them more soldiers or not?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.87.a:0 "They have a good reason for whatever they're doing, I'm sure."
changelings_paxchrysalia.87.b:0 "I'm not going to commit more resources to projects I know nothing about."

changelings_paxchrysalia.88.t:0 "Loose Lips"
changelings_paxchrysalia.88.d:0 ""I have to admit, these small moments are becoming all the more precious," Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio said, raising his glass of whiskey in salute before downing a gulp. "I would have thought that things would begin to slow down after a while, but no, we're still busy as ever. Especially with the new projects the Queen keeps dumping in my lap."\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs took a sip of his own glass. "You don't say?" He grimaced and set it aside for the moment; he should have watered it down a little bit before taking the drink straight like Marsilio preferred. "You drafted the Seaddle Protocol; I thought your team was focusing on the operation of the Liebessammeldienst, not tackling new things."\n\n"Things get boring if you don't have new challenges placed in front of you," Marsilio said, shrugging. "But the new kind of Love we're investigating? That's something interesting. More powerful, more potent than any kind of Love we've seen before. I'm told it comes from one pony, but it's stronger than what you'd find from a large family. Fascinating, fascinating stuff. Where'd you get it?"\n\nThat certainly took Jachs by surprise. "Me? What are you talking about? I haven't approved any special shipments of Love from Canterlot to your labs, and certainly nothing unique. Are you sure you're getting them from Canterlot?"\n\nMarsilio blinked in confusion. "I... well, I thought you were behind it," he said. "The shipments we've received are all stamped from the Canterlot Commissariat. I'd assumed that they passed by with your approval."\n\n"No, I don't know what you're talking about." Jachs frowned and thought. "Actually, now that you mention it, I did see a missive from the Queen's Guard requesting more security in the mines beneath Canterlot. I dismissed it at the time, since they were being very hush-hush about it, and none of them confronted me about it..."\n\nThe two changelings shared a look. "Special kind of Love never seen before, extra security in one of the most remote and secure places in Equestria... that sound odd to you?""
changelings_paxchrysalia.88.a:0 "Now what could that mean?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.89.t:0 "That Time Between Day and Night"
changelings_paxchrysalia.89.d:0 ""Well, I've seen every kind of Love imaginable," Marsilio said, tapping his hooves together. "Deer, pony, even a few griffons that volunteered. Young, old, single, married, young couples infatuated with each other, even the bond between a mother and child. But this is something else. It's potent, one of a kind. Whomever it's extracted from, they're powerful."\n\nIt didn't take Jachs all that long to put two and two together. "If this is one of a kind... and the Queen's Guard is so interested in protecting the mines beneath Canterlot... then that's where this individual is likely to be held. And who could create such potent Love save for one of the most magically powerful beings to live?"\n\nThe revelation left Marsilio's jaw hanging open for a second. "The alicorns Celestia, Luna, and Cadance all fled overseas," he said, frowning at his drink as his mind worked. "But Twilight Sparkle... we haven't heard anything about her for so long. Suspiciously little, even."\n\nJachs took a sip of his drink. This time, he was happy that it was as stiff as it was. He didn't know if he'd be able to handle the epiphany he felt was imminent. Marsilio continued: "Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship... could she've been underneath Canterlot this whole time? The Queen's Guard, maybe they're extracting alicorn Love from her! And noling has figured this out until now?"\n\n"We could just be jumping to conclusions," Jachs cautioned. "Besides, noling had the pieces of the puzzle needed to figure it out. At least, noling outside of the fanatics in the Queen's Guard."\n\nThe two changelings formed their conclusions at the same time.\n\n"We should go see her!" Marsilio exclaimed.\n\n"I think we should forget about this," replied Jachs."

He and Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio had spent weeks preparing their journey into the mines below Canterlot just to catch a glimpse of Twilight Sparkle and confirm that the alicorn was really there. Both changelings had spent a long time trying to slowly work over Queen's Guard soldiers for information as to where exactly in the mines the alicorn was supposed to be held, and after pulling together a rough idea of the path to be navigated throughout the labyrinthine tunnels, they'd set off to go find her. Only, the maps they'd put together were incomplete, and after having to dodge a couple of patrols, had gotten hopelessly lost in a side tunnel.\n\n"This was a bad idea," Jachs grumbled, trying to make sense of the maps. "We never should have come down here. I told you!"\n\n"We would have been fine if there weren't so many soldiers everywhere!" Marsilio hissed back, glaring at Jachs. "Do you just stamp everything that comes across your desk with the royal seal on it or what?!"\n\n"Oh, be quiet," Jachs growled, tossing the map in Marsilio's face. "Come on, let's try to backtrack. Maybe we'll find our way back out."\n\nBefore they got very far, flashlights shone on the nearby walls, and then their faces. "Halt!" a soldier's voice called out at the end of the tunnel, the sounds of galloping hoofsteps rapidly closed in. "Identify yourselves and state your business!"\n\nMarsilio shot Jachs a cold glare. "So, how're those extra soldiers in the mines working out for you?" he snidely remarked."

changelings_paxchrysalia.91.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs, Oberstleutnant Alcippe, and Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio watched the lone drone and his single flashlight lazily stroll down the tunnel in front of them. Jachs and Marsilio had spent weeks preparing their journey into the mines below Canterlot with Alcippe's help, just to catch a glimpse of Twilight Sparkle and confirm that the alicorn was really there. The changelings had spent a long time trying to slowly work over Queen's Guard soldiers for information as to where exactly in the mines the alicorn was supposed to be held, and after pulling together a rough idea of the path to be navigated throughout the labyrinthine tunnels, they'd set off to go find her. Thankfully, the tunnels were sparsely patrolled, and Jachs realized he'd already had a hoof in that; the Queen's Guard hadn't been willing to press for more soldiers for the mines after Jachs' denial for fear of tipping anybody off that something was happening beneath Canterlot. Thus, the overworked, undermanned patrols weren't exactly the best at spotting intruders, should any be present.\n\n"Alright, let's move," Marsilio said, once the lone soldier was well out of sight and earshot. "It should be just around this corner."\n\nJachs nodded and followed the surgeon-general's lead, Alcippe right behind him, eyes flitting back and forth between the map he held in his magic and the loose crystals lining the ground in case his hooves crunched on any in the voluminous caverns. Left, right, down, a left, and another left, and Jachs didn't know if they knew where they were or if they were going to be lost down here forever. But crushed crystal underhoof betrayed the presence of changeling activity, and soon, a faint purple glow illuminated the crystal walls before them.\n\nIt didn't take a genius to realize that they'd found what they were looking for."
changelings_paxchrysalia.91.a:0 "Have we found her?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.92.t:0 "Metamorphosis"
changelings_paxchrysalia.92.d:0 "The three changelings rounded the last corner and found themselves inside of a voluminous crystal cavern. Sheets of solid mineral rose up all around them, connecting at the ceiling like the arches of a cathedral, reinforced by steel supports to keep the room as stable as possible. Workbenches, desks, and some small machinery ringed the perimeter of the room, for the majority of the space was dedicated to a single massive mess of metal. It was a colossal machine, Jachs quickly realized, and he soon noted it looked like a giant mechanical cocoon. Glass slits ran the length of the cocoon, and from those slits came the vibrant purple light illuminating the room.\n\n"We really shouldn't be here," Alcippe said, looking around the empty cavern as if the crystals were about to shapeshift into Queen's Guard soldiers and arrest them all. "What if the workers come back? Or the guards?"\n\n"Relax, Oberstleutnant," Marsilio said, investigating some of the nearby machinery. "It's the dead of the night, so the scientists are all sleeping. And besides, we can't be arrested. Jachs can pull rank on any bug in the city. It is his, after all."\n\n"Yes, well, let's not push our luck," Jachs said, walking closer to the cocoon. "Dieter and his cronies went to great lengths to keep this hidden under my nose. My jurisdiction or not, I don't think our presence here will be much appreciated." He looked back at Marsilio. "Do you think she's in there?"\n\n"I don't know where else she could be," Marsilio grumbled, pulling out his glasses and squinting at the blocky letters on the machinery. "But we'll find out."\n\nHe pushed a button on the console, and Jachs flinched back a step as purple smoke billowed out from the cocoon. The metal parted at hidden seams, the cocoon folding open and sliding out of the way for ease of access. And once the smoke billowed away, Jachs widened his eyes in shock, and Alcippe covered her mouth with a hoof."

changelings_paxchrysalia.93.t:0 "The Alicorn in the Web"
changelings_paxchrysalia.93.d:0 "There was a purple mare inside of the cocoon. It took Jachs several moments to recognize the pony as a mare, though; her mane and tail was falling out, her coat was thin and patchy, and her ribs were harshly outlined by her skinny chest. A metal probe had been drilled into the mare's horn, glowing faintly as it sapped her magic, and her wings were disheveled and dirty. But her cutie mark was still there, that iconic arrangement of stars, and Jachs knew for sure he was looking at the real Twilight Sparkle — or whatever was left of her.\n\n"What happened to her?" Alcippe asked Marsilio, shock written on her face. "She looks horrible!"\n\n"The Queen's Guard has been draining her of Love almost nonstop," the surgeon-general said. "Any other pony — any other creature, for that matter — would have died from it by now. But it looks like alicorns are more resilient to even the most brutal harvesting methods imaginable, for better or for worse."\n\nWhile they talked, Jachs hesitantly approached the mare in the cocoon. Her breathing was ragged, but she was still alive, despite looking like she'd been in the grave for a few days. And then, to his surprise, her eyes opened, and she feebly turned her head to look at him. "Who... are you?" she asked, squinting bloodshot eyes at the Generalmajor. "I don't recognize you..."\n\nJachs found himself at a loss for words. This is what Dieter and his cronies had done to the Princess of Friendship? He was disgusted and horrified by what he saw in front of him. He had always tried his best to do right by the ponies under his jurisdiction, ensuring that the Pax Chrysalia was justly enforced on them, and though it was hard and he may not have been perfect, he didn't revel in the suffering he caused to ensure peace. The Queen's Guard, on the other hoof, had no such qualms. He had a feeling that they were draining Twilight to the point of such physical harm simply because they could, and they derived some sort of perverse pleasure out of laying one of Equestria's four alicorns so low.\n\nWhile Jachs wrestled with his thoughts, it was Alcippe who stepped forward and answered Twilight's question. "That is Generalmajor Jachs, governor of Canterlot and the surrounding territories," she said in halting Equuish. She put her hoof over her chest. "I am Oberstleutnant Alcippe, his second in command, and that is Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio. It's... a pleasure to meet you?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.94.d:0 ""I'll take the circumstances, given everything else that's happened to me," Twilight remarked, speaking fluently in the Changeling language, and Jachs was surprised to not hear any bitterness or hate in her voice. "I don't usually have the chance to talk to anypony... or anyling, for that matter. Your scientists do a good job keeping me locked up in here and barely feeding me more than necessary..." she sheepishly chuckled, and if her hooves weren't restrained to the metal slab she rested on, Jachs was sure she would have awkwardly scratched the side of her neck. "Do you... have any water? I-I'm really thirsty, truth be told."\n\nMarsilio was there in a flash with a bottle of water snatched off of a desk, and he held it to Twilight's lips so she could drink. "They need to take better care of you," he stated, shaking his head. "You may be an alicorn, but even alicorns have limits."\n\nHe took the bottle away when Twilight nodded she was finished, and the mare sighed with relief. "You three are different from the usual changelings here," she said, genuinely smiling at them. "You're living proof that harmony can bloom in unexpected places."\n\nAlcippe frowned. "What do you mean?" she asked her. "We're loyal to the Hives. We aren't with the partisans trying to kick us out."\n\nTwilight shook her head. "That's not what I mean," she said. "Harmony isn't a government or a matter of who should rule who. Harmony is an idea, a belief, a perspective in life. You don't have to be the 'good guys' to believe in harmony. You just have to make the world a little bit brighter in whatever small ways you can. And something about you three tells me that you already know that, too."\n\n"How can you believe that when we have you imprisoned down here?" Jachs asked her. "When our kind makes you and yours suffer every day?"\n\nThe alicorn glanced down at her flank, at the colorful stars printed on it. "Well, perhaps you could say it's my destiny to not only spread friendship and harmony, but to believe wholeheartedly in the goodness in all creatures," she said. "I'm the Princess of Friendship, but I don't need a title to show creatures that there's a better way." Her lips curled once more into a tired smile, but then her ears twitched toward the exit to the cavern. "I take it the three of you aren't supposed to be down here... you might want to leave before you're discovered."\n\n"I hope you don't expect us to free you," Jachs cautioned her.\n\nBut Twilight only shook her head. "I don't," she admitted. "But I do expect the three of you to do your best at spreading a little bit of harmony wherever you go." She even winked at them. "I know you will.""

Two wore the uniforms of VOPS, and immediately flanked both sides of the door, staring blankly ahead at the far wall. The changeling in the middle was the one that concerned Jachs the most: Vaspier Orn Kladisium, the Great Imperial Nobody, brandishing his deceitfully cheerful smile. Jachs wondered what he was doing here, but he had a pretty good suspicion.\n\n"Lovely day, isn't it?" Vaspier asked him, pulling over a chair and sitting it right in front of Jachs' desk. He sat down on it and leaned forward, offering a cigarette to Jachs, who refused with a wave of his hoof. Shrugging, Vaspier lit it and stuck it in his mouth, impaling the thing on one of his fangs so he could keep talking. "Got anything planned for such a wonderful day? Don't tell me you'll be spending all day inside buried in paperwork."\n\n"I haven't decided yet," Jachs said. "Such things are more spur of the moment for me."\n\n"Carefree, eh? You have to respect that in a bug." Vaspier took a couple of drags from his cigarette, then flicked it into Jachs' wastebasket and raised an eyebrow. "I've heard from a few bugs that you've recently taken up an interest in spelunking."\n\nJachs did his best to maintain a neutral expression; he should have figured that VOPS would find out sooner or later that he had been exploring the caves looking for Twilight. "I wanted to try something new," he said, carefully choosing his words. Outright denial would be useless, but playing along might be an out. "One spends too much time in the same place doing the same thing, and one starts looking to try out new things."\n\n"True enough," Vaspier said, still smirking faintly at the Generalmajor. "If I were you, though, I'd be careful where you tread," he finally said, slowly nodding. "The caves beneath Canterlot? They're pretty big. We don't have the whole thing mapped out yet. For your safety, I'd recommend staying away from them until you get an all-clear." He stood up and slid the chair back to where it belonged. "I'd recommend Ghastly Gorge, perhaps. There's caves there you could explore, were you so interested. They're certainly safer than the crystal mines beneath this city.\n\nHe walked back to the door, and the two VOPS operatives opened the door and stepped out ahead of him. Vaspier paused just one last time at the threshold to nod to Jachs. "Do stay safe, Generalmajor. I wouldn't want to hear about you and your friends suddenly disappearing one day.

changelings_paxchrysalia.96.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio sat in his office with reports on the latest experiments with the special Love — which he now knew quite conclusively was from Twilight Sparkle — spread open on the desk in front of him. But he wasn't reading them; his mind and his thoughts were elsewhere.\n\nAs much as he hated to admit it, the short conversation he managed to have with Twilight had shaken something fundamental in him. Despite everything that had happened to her, despite every possible justification she could have to hate the changeling species, the Princess of Friendship had still lived up to her name. She had been friendly and even supportive of the work the three changelings were doing, in a certain way. And when pressed, she'd called it her destiny, and referenced the cutie mark on her flank. Despite the wishes of the world, 'destiny' let Twilight Sparkle fly in its face. In that one pony and her defiance of the rational reaction to the situation she found herself in, she placed herself completely at odds with how Marsilio expected sapient creatures to react. But was that based on science, or just his own biases?\n\nThat question nagged at Marsilio for some time. Twilight Sparkle's defiance was the opposite of the changeling species' obedience. Changelings were conformist, they acted rationally, they followed authority. Ponies, often, did not, and they believed in higher authorities like fortune and destiny. But why was that? Was it just societal values? Changelings were born from huge batches of eggs raised by queens and mothers working together. They were all the same from the start, raised to be a cog in a machine. And their ravenous appetite for Love had made them pariahs to other species; Marsilio recalled reading an ancient tome he found in the Canterlot Archives that attributed the origin of the changeling race as an unintentional byproduct of Starswirl the Bearded's experiments; a toxic mistake that grew to become a blight upon the world's rightful inhabitants.\n\nPonies were individuals; they treated each other as unique and special, and they celebrated the differences between them. Perhaps nothing was more celebrated than the cutie mark, and many believed they invariably linked a pony to their destiny.\n\nWas that all it was? Was a cutie mark all that separated the individuality of the ponies from the conformity of the changelings? Could a cutie mark change an individual's life, permanently, and for the better?\n\nWhat if a changeling had a cutie mark? Would they thus be redeemed from the original sin of their parasitical race?\n\nMarsilio soon realized he didn't care about the reports in front of him. This was a question that needed to be answered. And if destiny was on his side, then she would help him answer it."

Twilight had expressed her belief that she and Jachs and Marsilio were doing their part to spread harmony in Equestria, even despite everything that had happened and everything the three 'lings were a part of. Alcippe didn't know if the alicorn was right or if she was just deluding herself. Was she really spreading harmony by working with Jachs and faithfully executing his orders? He did seem to have the best interests of the ponies under his rule in mind. And then there was the question of Thorax, the first changeling to really make a stand in the hives for the ideas of harmony...\n\n"Something wrong, Alcippe?" Jachs asked. He was half finished with his ramen bowl, obviously not bothered by the same things tormenting Alcippe. When Alcippe opened her mouth to protest, he shook his head. "I can tell when something is bothering you, Alcippe. We've worked together far too long for me to not notice."\n\n"It's... well..." Alcippe hesitated, noting that they weren't exactly the only two bugs in the restaurant, and shrugged. "I've been thinking to THAT conversation," she said, and Jachs immediately nodded in understanding. "Is she right? Are we really doing the best we can do?"\n\nJachs could only shrug. "Perhaps, in some small little way. I wouldn't put too much stock in what she said, Alcippe. She was dehydrated and probably delusional."\n\n"But she wasn't wrong," Alcippe insisted. "Everything you've done, Jachs... you've shown that you care about the ponies. You're not like Dieter or Vaspier, or even our Queen. They just like tormenting ponies for fun. But not you."\n\n"I suppose you're right," Jachs said. "I just don't see the point. Working with the ponies makes everybody stronger — changeling and pony alike. It's pragmatic."\n\n"And harmonic," Alcippe said, nodding to herself. "Twilight was right. We are trying to make this dark world a little bit brighter, one little thing at a time. You and I, we do believe in harmony. And that... that's a good thing," she concluded. Then she smiled. "And so long as we keep doing it... maybe we can build a better tomorrow for everybody.

Unnecessarily so!"\n\n"Dieter isn't exactly the type of changeling to think about cruelty in any capacity other than inflicting the most suffering possible," Marsilio said. "Though some of the safeguards are necessary, I suppose. Twilight is an alicorn, after all. If they didn't drill the probe into her horn, her magic would be too strong for us to contain her if she managed to slip free of that cocoon."\n\n"But that doesn't mean that they have to withhold food and water from her and make her suffer like that!" Alcippe protested. She turned to Jachs, who had remained quiet until then. "Sir? What do you think?"\n\n"It's... not right," Jachs said, frowning down the length of his muzzle. "But let's look at it realistically. What can we do? Almost, if not certainly, nothing. Because doing something means that we have to admit that we know Twilight is down there. And if VOPS gets wind of that..." He shrugged. "I don't think it matters what our ranks are. We were left out of this for a reason, and if the Queen's Guard finds out that we know about Twilight, then it won't be all that long before we get a knock from VOPS on our door in the middle of the night and noling ever sees us again."\n\nThough that answer seemed to disappoint Alcippe, Marsilio solemnly nodded in agreement. "Unfortunately, Jachs is right," he said to Alcippe. "There is, essentially, nothing that we can do. Not until we're allowed to know about Twilight's presence in a more official capacity, if that day ever comes. Until then, we have to swear to talk to nobody else about what we saw down in the caves. Absolutely nobody must know that we were down there, or as Jachs said, soon nobody will know where we disappeared to."\n\nIt wasn't the answer Alcippe wanted, but it was the only possible answer to the dilemma that left them all still able to carry out their work. And so, reluctantly, she agreed."

changelings_paxchrysalia.99.d:0 "It had been some days since Vaspier's impromptu visit to his offices, but Jachs couldn't sleep.\n\nIt wasn't that he was expecting VOPS to knock on his door at any moment, though that certainly may have been part of the problem in the back of his mind. He supposed he wouldn't know if VOPS knew that he had met Twilight until it was too late for him or his friends. Rather, his insomnia stemmed from shame.\n\nWhy should he feel shame? That was just one of many questions he had no answer for. There was nothing he should feel ashamed for when it came to Twilight Sparkle languishing deep in the mines beneath the city he now ruled. Vaspier's visit made it all the more obvious to him that there was nothing he could do to help the alicorn. Not without letting the Queen's Guard and VOPS know that he knew about her, at least. Maybe his shame came from the fact that there was nothing he could do and that absolved him of having to do something. He considered himself a good changeling and a good person, and every instinct he had was telling him to find some way to help Twilight. But he could rationally ignore those instincts now, because there truly was nothing he could do. The circumstances he found himself in had exculpated him of any moral quandary he may have had to make. No longer did he have to choose between loyalty to the Hives or his own personal morals. That decision was made for him already by the sheer impossibility of finding a way to help Twilight. And the relief he felt that he didn't have to make that decision... perhaps that was what shamed him.\n\nHe slowly shook his head as he stared up at his ceiling. Was it cowardly to be happy that he didn't have to make a hard choice?\n\nHe didn't know. And he presumed that question would bother him for a long time."

changelings_paxchrysalia.200.t:0 "The Castle of Friendship"
changelings_paxchrysalia.200.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe sat side by side in the backseat of the leading kübelwagen as the armored column rode into Ponyville; the latest of the victory parades organized by the Queen. Though Jachs wondered just why in the world Queen Chrysalis had ordered that a show of force be put on for a backwater that served as a stopoff point to Canterlot at most, he was not about to question his Queen's commands. At least he had Alcippe for company during the ride into and through town; the Oberstleutnant's presence and help in organizing his work had become a stable factor in his hectic life that he couldn't do without.\n\nStill, the two changelings maintained the strictest military professionalism as the column rode into the center of the town, with the glittery and gaudy Castle of Friendship looming in the background as occupation forces practically dragged the citizens of Ponyville out into the streets to listen to the Queen's speech. As soon as Chrysalis took to the podium set up for her in front of the castle, Jachs zoned her out, his eyes scanning the crowd for any hidden threats while his queen delivered a boastful and almost mocking speech to the ponies who lived in this small town. All he saw was a barely suppressed anger from the ponies forced to listen, but luckily none made any sudden movements or presented themselves as threats to the conquering queen. His confidence in the Queen's safety reassured, Jachs let his mind wander to later that evening, where hopefully he'd be able to get some much-needed sleep on the train ride back to Canterlot.\n\nBut as Queen Chrysalis wrapped up her speech, one line she delivered caught his ear. "And lastly, to show just how much your pathetic 'Magic of Friendship' has failed you, Twilight Sparkle's beloved castle will be leveled and replaced with a new administrative center for my empire, and my generals and I will be staying here to oversee its destruction personally."\n\nJachs and Alcippe immediately turned toward each other, the two officers sharing a look filled as much with dread as it was with surprise. "Did you know about this?" Alcippe whispered.\n\n"If I did, I would have packed for more than just a day trip," Jachs grumbled, looking back over his shoulder at the towering crystal structure behind him. "Why do I feel like this is going to be a massive pain in the shell?""
changelings_paxchrysalia.200.a:0 "It's made of crystal, how tough could it be?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.201.t:0 "Castle Mania"
changelings_paxchrysalia.201.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe stood behind a blast shield erected a few hundred meters away from the Castle of Friendship. The two officers had spent the entire week hastily organizing a demolitions team and requisitioning twenty-five tons of explosives to fill the Castle of Friendship with enough dynamite to level it flat, and now the fruits of their labors were about to pay off. Hopefully, with the castle destroyed, the two would be able to return to Canterlot and continue the important work that needed to be done there, instead of wasting time dealing with the Queen's vanity project.\n\nQueen Chrysalis herself stood behind the blast shield, eagerly shifting her weight from hoof to hoof, while her team of bodyguards prevented anybody, pony or changeling, from getting too close without her permission. Jachs turned his attention further behind her, where several reporters had gathered, along with pony onlookers whose curiosity had got the better of them and dragged them out of their houses to witness this historic event. Camera crews had positioned themselves on platforms further back to get a clear shot at the crystal castle as it crumbled into shards and glitter. At the very least, Jachs knew it'd be an impressive propaganda piece, both for here and back home.\n\nThen came the time to blow the charges. The demolition team hooked up the fuses to the blasting machine, and Queen Chrysalis herself pulled it closer with her magic. "To the end of the Magic of Friendship!" she proclaimed, a wicked grin on her face as she pushed the plunger down.\n\nAn earth-shaking boom blasted out of the castle, spewing dust and smoke into the air, and the changelings gathered around whistled and cheered while the ponies scowled or looked away. Jachs and Alcippe turned to each other and shook their hooves, smiling that the job was now done, until a bout of laughter broke out from the ponies behind them. Jachs turned his attention back toward the clearing smoke only to see that the castle still stood, a little bit blackened from the blast, but none the worse for wear. "Made in Equestria," somepony joked, earning another round of guffaws.\n\nQueen Chrysalis' eye twitched as she regarded the castle still standing like a defiant enemy mocking her. Snarling, she whipped her head around to stare directly at Jachs and Alcippe, who cowered back out of reflex. "More. Explosives," she growled, and then she walked away, her hooves angrily stomping across the ground."

changelings_paxchrysalia.202.t:0 "An Earth Shattering Kaboom"
changelings_paxchrysalia.202.d:0 "Another week of planning had passed, another week of dragging in supplies from across the Hives for the demolition of the Castle of Friendship, another week of Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe working late and eschewing sleep to satisfy the Queen's demands. Despite the best efforts of the censors, word had started to spread around the countryside that the Heer had failed to bring down the Castle of Friendship in the first go around, but after packing every nook and cranny of the castle with as much dynamite and TNT as it could hold, Jachs felt confident that this time they could bring the castle crashing down. This time it had to work.\n\nOnce more, the officers, Queen Chrysalis, and her bodyguard had gathered behind blast shields, ready to watch the structure crumble before the might of the Changeling Hives. This time, however, the ponies of Ponyville had been forced to stay inside of their homes, and no reporters were gathered to observe the demolition — as confident as Jachs was that this time everything had to work, Alcippe had managed to convince him that maybe it would be best to play it safe. Doubtless a second failure would only make things worse for the Heer and the changelings as a whole.\n\nWhen the fuse was connected, Chrysalis wasted no time on ceremony or pomp, her slight scowl betraying her annoyance that there even had to be a second attempt in the first place. Snatching the blasting machine from the changeling bringing it over to her, Chrysalis slammed the plunger down, then immediately toppled backwards as the cacophonous explosion nearly ruptured the eardrums of everyling present, and the resulting shockwave shattered the glass windows of the buildings closest to the castle while nearly knocking over the blast shields. The ground shook like a tremendous earthquake had just rocked the town, and a colossal cloud of smoke and debris mushroomed up into the air. But when all the smoke and dust finally cleared almost two minutes later, the glittering branches of the Castle of Friendship defiantly stood tall, still unscathed by almost fifty tons of explosives.\n\nThe blasting machine crumpled in Chrysalis' magic, and a toss of her head spiked it into the ground, where the components broke and scattered everywhere. She stormed away without a word, rage making her shoulders tremble."

changelings_paxchrysalia.203.t:0 "Ultima Ratio Reginarum"
changelings_paxchrysalia.203.d:0 "The trains had been rolling into Ponyville one after the other for days now, delivering a nonstop swarm of materiel and soldiers to the small town. Oberstleutnant Alcippe, frazzled as she was by trying to defeat a building made out of crystals, had barely managed to straighten her uniform and make herself look presentable before the third attempt to take down the Castle of Friendship. She'd arrived a few minutes late, which was completely unlike her, but she'd been so run down by trying to direct the resources of the Heer to complete one stubborn task that her two hour nap had turned into four by the time she woke up that morning.\n\nAt least neither Queen Chrysalis nor Generalmajor Jachs seemed to notice or care that she arrived a little late. The Queen and the top brass of the Heer stood assembled in a field glaring at the castle through binoculars. In front of them were the fruits of Alcippe's work: over 1000 pieces of artillery and 100,000 high explosive shells, assembled and ready to begin firing. Alcippe couldn't help but grimace as she looked at what the proud Heer had been reduced to. It was desperate and ridiculous, sure, but leveling a castle made out of crystal shouldn't have been this hard!\n\nAlcippe approached Jachs and the Queen, managing to force herself to perform an exhausted salute when Jachs spotted her. He gestured with a gossamer wing for her to approach, and when she did, he bit his lower lip with his fangs and shook his head. "I hope this works, Oberstleutnant..." he said. "I really, really hope it does..."\n\n"It will work!" Queen Chrysalis screamed, and Alcippe noticed that she and Jachs weren't the only ones suffering for their failures. She grabbed one of the artillery officers standing nearby and pressed her nose against his as she bared her teeth in a remarkable display of fraying sanity. "Tell them to fire at will! Bring this accursed castle down!"\n\nThe artillery officer, startled and frightened, could only nod until the Queen released him, and then the command was passed down to the guns. The officers all put on their hearing protection and took a few steps back as the artillery pieces began firing shell after shell into the castle. Alcippe anxiously flitted her wings, desperate that so much firepower could achieve some effect, and she swore she could see crystal shards flying off of the castle amidst the smoke and debris from impact. But as salvo after salvo bombarded the castle and shook the earth like a terrible thunder, Alcippe's hopes soon crumbled when she saw the castle still standing tall. And when the last shot was finally fired over three hours later, no discernible damage could be seen from so far away.\n\nJachs and Alcippe shared a look, each knowing that this meant even more work for the two of them, and in a rare break of professionalism, Generalmajor Jachs mimed pulling out his pistol and dashing his brains across the fields of Ponyville.\n\nAlcippe couldn't help herself but chuckle. At least she had somepony else to suffer through this nightmare with."

changelings_paxchrysalia.204.t:0 "80 Centimeters of Armor Piercing Ordinance"
changelings_paxchrysalia.204.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs didn't even know what day it was until Oberstleutnant Alcippe knocked on the door of the town hall office he had turned into his command station in Ponyville. When he opened the door, he found the exhausted Oberstleutnant looking back at him, too tired to even manage a salute — not that Jachs cared anymore. "Is it ready?"\n\n"Yes. We should go or we'll be late," Alcippe answered, stepping back so Jachs could walk out of the office.\n\n"Then let's not keep our queen waiting for the next disappointment." Jachs took the lead out of the town hall and toward the rail lines, where the metal monstrosity loomed over the tiny train station. Somehow, Alcippe had managed to track down an 80cm railroad cannon that had been under development prior to the start of the Great War, and had commissioned a parallel line of railroad tracks to support bringing the behemoth to Ponyville. The monstrosity stood at over 12 meters tall and almost 50 meters long, making the heavy howitzers the changelings had brought in the previous week look like grub's toys. The gun crew had spent the previous half hour using a crane to load a single 80cm armor-piercing round into the barrel of the huge gun, that single shell weighing more than 7000 kilograms alone. What a thousand guns and a hundred thousand shells of high explosive couldn't accomplish, hopefully one massive gun and one massive shell fired directly at the trunk of the Castle of Friendship would send the whole thing crashing down.\n\nAs Jachs took his place a comfortable distance away from the oversized field gun and the deafening roar he knew was coming, he spied Queen Chrysalis herself standing on top of the beast, eagerly rubbing her hooves together. He looked around to make sure that no other changelings were within earshot, then turned to Alcippe and nudged her shoulder. "Think it's too much to ask that they launch her out of that thing?" he joked, earning first a surprised gasp from his fellow officer, then a snicker and a chuckle.\n\n"It'd be the end of our problems, wouldn't it?" she replied. But both officers put their banter aside as the gun crew moved to their ready positions and other changelings came closer. That left just the Queen herself and the crew standing on the firing platform, and after sharing some words with the artillery officer in charge, Chrysalis' green magic grabbed hold of a lever and yanked it back.\n\nThe shockwave chased the thunderclap of noise like a punch to the gut, staggering Jachs and Alcippe back as the massive gun recoiled on the rail tracks. The report of the shell impacting the Castle of Friendship was almost inaudible through the ringing in Jachs' ears, but he faintly heard the crash and shriek of metal and the detonation of an explosive charge in the distance. Yet when the smoke cleared, the only sign of damage on the Castle of Friendship was a scorched black ring dead center in the trunk, and a couple of shards of crystal filigree that had snapped loose from the ends of some of the smallest branches.\n\nJachs didn't need his hearing to know the Queen was less than pleased when she tossed the artillery officer off the firing platform of the gun."

changelings_paxchrysalia.205.d:0 "The air raid sirens snapped Jachs awake, years of instincts already sending him out of his chair and under his desk for cover as that horrible drone wailed throughout the town. He hunkered down for several seconds before he remembered that the war was over, and the Equestrian bombers had all been reduced to scrap metal long ago. But why were the sirens going off?\n\nOberstleutenant Alcippe barged into Jachs office, her officer's overcoat forgotten somewhere else. "We need to go to the bunker!" she shouted, running around behind the desk and dragging Jachs to his hooves. "Bombers are coming!"\n\n"Bombers?!" Jachs shouted, confused as he let Alcippe guide him along. "What do you mean? The war is over!"\n\n"The Great War, maybe, but not our Queen's personal war," Alcippe replied, taking Jachs over to the stairwell that descended into the town hall's basement and the bunker underneath. "It would have been nice if she'd given us more warning, right?" Other confused and alarmed changeling staff and soldiers ran about to and fro, trying to gather important documents before retreating below the building, a nervous chittering filling the building to accompany the wail of the sirens outside. And that was when Jachs heard it: the distant droning of a bomber wing, a hundred planes strong by the sound of it, making its approach from the west.\n\nThe two officers staggered down the steps together, reaching the armored door at the bottom of the stairwell and scampering inside right as the ground began to shake. They fell into each other's forelegs in a shadowy corner as they lost their balance, and there the two changelings remained for several hours, holding onto each other as the Luftwaffe's bombers pounded the town and the hated castle therein. Hour after hour after hour the explosions and shaking continued, only interrupted for a few minutes here and there as bomber waves cycled in and out of the airspace to unload their payloads. When it was finally all over, Jachs and Alcippe cautiously ventured their way out of the bunker together, only to find that half of the town hall had collapsed from a direct strike, and fires raged throughout Ponyville as the garrisoning soldiers struggled to control the blaze.\n\nAnd silhouetted against the dark of the night by the fires burning in town was a glittering castle surrounded by craters, a few unexploded bombs caught in its branches like metal apples."

changelings_paxchrysalia.206.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs wasted no time barging into the Queen's office before the Queen's Guard could stop him, ignoring the shouts of warning and the weapons trained in his direction. "Your Majesty," he shouted, stomping up to her desk and barely managing a salute through his exhausted anger. "We need to talk!"\n\n"Back away, Generalmajor," the Queen's Guard captain, Dieter Heinrich, snarled. "Who gave you permission to—?"\n\n"Enough, Dieter," Chrysalis barked, sending Captain Heinrich wincing and bowing his head like a dog brought to heel. Then the Queen shifted her attention from the papers on her desk to the Generalmajor in front of her. "Respect your Queen, Generalmajor, or this will be a very short conversation," she warned him.\n\nIt took all of Jachs' willpower to bite back an angry retort. Instead, he forced himself to close his eyes, take a breath, count to three, and then begin to speak. "Your Majesty, sending bombers against Ponyville last week was an unacceptable danger to the lives of not only your soldiers but also the lives of your new subjects. The town has suffered extreme infrastructure damage in the aftermath. Half of the buildings burnt down in the blaze, and the other half suffered damage from the bombardment. Is destroying the Castle of Friendship really worth such collateral damage?"\n\n"Of course it is!" Chrysalis shot back. She stood up to her full, menacing height and slammed her forehooves down on her desk, leering at Jachs. "That castle was Twilight Sparkle's seat of power. It stinks of her presence, and it's a reminder to these pathetic ponies of how things used to be before we conquered them. Do you understand how dangerous such reminders are?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.8206.d:0 "I do, your Majesty, but—"\n\n"Obviously you do not!" Chrysalis cut him off. "So long as it stands, it will inspire rebellion and dissent, and all of your failed attempts to bring it down have only made us a laughing stock throughout Equestria. We must bring it down to show these ponies that nothing is beyond the power of the Changeling Hives!"\n\nJachs resisted the urge to point out that the bombing raid that practically leveled the town was her idea, not his, and took a step closer. "Your Majesty, it's become increasingly clear that some magic protects the castle, magic that ordinary weapons cannot overcome. Which leads me to believe that there is only one possible way to take down the castle, and if that fails, then it truly cannot be destroyed."\n\n"And what way is that?"\n\n"You must destroy the castle yourself," Jachs said, choosing his words carefully. "You bested Celestia in single combat in Canterlot after draining Shining Armor of his Love for the harlot, Cadance. You were stronger than an alicorn that could move the sun. What could you possibly not accomplish if you used the Love harvested from tens of thousands of ponies all across your new empire?"\n\nChrysalis seemed to turn that over in her head for a moment, practicality clashing with ego, before her ego won, just as Jachs had hoped. "Yes," she said, grinning wickedly from ear to ear. "It is the only way. Only a truly powerful queen could be rid of this menace once and for all." She rubbed her hooves together and giggled. "Do it, Generalmajor. Let's make it happen.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.207.t:0 "One Final Effort"
changelings_paxchrysalia.207.d:0 "Truck after truck of Love harvested throughout Olenia and Equestria rolled into Ponyville over the past few days, all in anticipation for Queen Chrysalis' personal attempt to bring down the blasted Castle of Friendship. Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe watched from a safe distance away as their queen made her way to the staging area where the trucks had been gathered, their reserves of Love opened up all for her use. "I really hope this doesn't kill her," Generalmajor Jachs thought aloud. "If it does, Dieter will have my head."\n\n"At least you can get all the sleep you want when you're dead, right?" Alcippe joked, lightening the mood for a moment.\n\n"No guarantees our queen doesn't haunt my soul for eternity," the Generalmajor answered. Then his lighthearted smile disappeared, replaced by a stern and focused frown as Queen Chrysalis' horn turned green and she opened her maw to devour the pink streams of Love she summoned forth out of the trucks. Jachs and Alcippe moved a little closer together as they anxiously watched the queen ingest the collected Love of thousands of ponies and deer, both wondering if there was a limit to how much Love a changeling queen could possibly consume and what would happen if that limit was reached.\n\nBut Queen Chrysalis soon proved herself once again as the greatest of the changeling queens when she emptied all the trucks without difficulty. Her body practically glowed with energy, her horn enlarged and her green chitinous armor on her back growing to protect her chest and shoulders. Then, after a moment to feel out her new strength, the Queen wasted no time launching herself head first at the Castle of Friendship, barging through the doors and unleashing all her magic inside of the structure. The ground shook and the windows glowed with green magic for what felt like hours as everyling present held their breath, waiting for Chrysalis to bring the castle down on top of herself, yet slowly but surely, the glow began to fade and the shaking started to subside. And at the end of it all, Queen Chrysalis staggered out of the castle, barely able to support her weight and collapsed from exhaustion on the ground.\n\n"She couldn't do it..." Alcippe observed, fangs teasing her lower lip.\n\n"No," Jachs agreed, "but I think this is finally the end of it.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.208.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs signed off on the last directive for the refurbishment of the Castle of Friendship into a new administration center for the Equestrian heartland. With Queen Chrysalis' failure to destroy the Castle, the leader of the Changeling Hives had finally, reluctantly, admitted defeat. Since destroying the Castle was no longer an option, it would instead be covered in concrete to hide the original structure from sight and change the architecture to something resembling the buildings back in the homelands. 'Out of sight, out of mind' as the saying goes, and with a few last directives, anypony or anyling that mentioned the existence of the Castle of Friendship would certainly find themselves out of sight before long once the censors and secret police got wind of them. Jachs didn't care, though; that was a reasonable compromise to leveling Ponyville with thousands of strategic bombers.\n\nPutting the papers aside on his desk for later, Jachs slid out of his chair and went down the hall to where Oberstleutnant Alcippe had set up her office during the weeks they'd been stuck in Ponyville for their queen's folly. Alcippe had left her door open, though Jachs still knocked on it out of politeness when he stuck his head inside. The 'ling jumped at the sound, startled out of her important work, then scrambled to stand up and salute when she realized who had called on her. "Generalmajor!"\n\n"Relax, Alcippe," Jachs said, stepping into the office and shutting the door behind him. He sat down in one of the seats across from Alcippe and gestured for her to do the same, and the Oberstleutnant sat back down in her chair. "So, finally this whole mess is behind us," he said, leaning back in the chair and rubbing his eyes.\n\n"Yes, finally," Alcippe agreed. "I was beginning to think it would never end."\n\n"You're not the only one." Jachs yawned and stretched his wings, letting the flitter about to try and get his blood moving again. "I'm going to sleep for a week when we get back to Canterlot if I can get away with it."\n\n"I know the feeling." Alcippe fidgeted with some papers on her desk, then lightly cleared her throat. "So, Generalmajor... what do you need?"\n\n"Need? Oh, nothing," Jachs said, waving a hoof. "I just wanted to know if you'd be interested in some drinks and dinner tonight when you're finished with your work. I think we could both use some time to unwind."\n\n"Drinks and dinner?" Alcippe echoed. She took a moment to think it over before an easy smile appeared on her muzzle. "I think I'd like that a lot, Generalmajor."\n\n"Good. Oh, and one last thing." Jachs winked at her as he stood back up, a little fluttery feeling settling in his gut. "Let's see if we can get through the night without any titles, hmmm, Alcippe?"\n\nAlcippe abashedly smiled back and tried to hide her face by turning back to her work. "I'll try my best, Jachs.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.209.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs sifted through the latest reports coming in from across the Equestrian heartlands, looking for anything that needed his immediate attention. Most were just progress reports on various projects or updates from garrison commanders in their efforts to quell unrest throughout the Hives' new holdings — nothing serious that required action for him. He did, however, notice a letter addressed from the garrison commander in Ponyville, the memo marked 'URGENT' across the front and back.\n\nSighing, Jachs opened it up, already expecting something inane to come from that backwaters town that had caused him so much trouble in the past, only for his eye to twitch at what he'd read. Apparently, the concrete facade that had been erected around the Castle of Friendship to conceal the ridiculously indestructible building from sight had seemingly crumbled overnight, once again exposing the glittering castle to the residents of Ponyville. The commander supposed that it might have been the actions of rebels, though no such evidence had yet been uncovered, but Jachs wouldn't have been surprised if that was the doing of the tree itself at this point. Biting his lip, he ultimately decided against reporting anything to Vesalipolis to spare himself the headache of dealing with Queen Chrysalis' inevitable demands for something to be done, and instead wrote back a simple order to be delivered to the garrison commander: "Cover it up with a blanket or something. I don't care what you do, just make sure nobody talks about it."\n\nSatisfied, Jachs immediately tore up the memo from Ponyville, tossed the shreds into a dustbin, and then flicked a lit cigarette into the bin after them. Out of sight, out of mind."

Settle down," Generalmajor Jachs instructed the sergeant. "Go take a walk, get a drink of water, and calm down. Your report is over." He nodded to a pair of soldiers standing by the door, who gently escorted the shell-shocked sergeant out of the conference room. Sighing, Jachs turned to the other officers seated around him: Oberstleutnant Alcippe, his indispensable right hoof; Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio, the Heer's surgeon general; and an assortment of local commanders from the central Equestria region. "The Hauptfeldwebel's report isn't an outlier," he said to them, tapping a plain folder sitting in front of him. "Many of you that have troops around the Everfree have reported back the same things, I'm sure. Attacks by pony insurgents wearing shamanistic paint and markings, who melt away like shadows into the undergrowth. An alarming increase in monster sightings around the Everfree; a reconnaissance plane even spotted a hydra." Picking up a sheaf of photographs, Jachs continued: "Furthermore, there have been raids by partisans who seem to be armed with unknown alchemical weapons." He spread the photographs across the table; one showed what had once been a changeling panzer, now a warped hunk of twisted metal. Another showed a changeling soldier sutured to the side of his burnt-out truck, chitin become steel where his carapace had fused with the door of the driver cab. "On top of all this, the tree line seems to be creeping forward at a frightening rate."\n\nOberstleutnant Alcippe nodded and provided some context. "Rail lines around the forest are being torn up by plundervines, and several of our scout posts have already been overrun with foliage. I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything like this, Generaloberstabsarzt?"\n\nMarsilio shook his head. "The Everfree Forest is a place of wild, untamed magic, opaque to even the greatest pony mages and scholars that lived near it," the surgeon general said. "We are fighting against magic that we do not understand. And I'm not sure if we'll win."\n\n"We will try," Jachs definitively stated. "It's the only thing we can do.""

When he'd first fled into the forest to fight on Zecora's behalf, he thought that the indomitable forest on the outskirts of Ponyville would protect him from anything. Now, as the forest grew thick with smoke and ash, and the clattering of gunfire and thundering of artillery reverberated through the dead trees, he realized that all was lost, and the changelings were coming to wipe out the insurrection, once and for all.\n\nUp front, the resistance's heroic leader watched the destruction of the forest with pain in her eyes. In better times, she had made her home in its secluded depths. Now, her sanctuary — one of the last places in Equestria where the magic of the wilderness had remained untamed — had collapsed into cinders around her, and with it, the last vestiges of Free Equestria. Still, she bared her teeth and rubbed at her eyes, then turned to face the ponies gathered before her, tears streaming down her face. The fire behind her illuminated her like an angel of hellfire, and her bloodshot eyes burned through the smoke thickening the air.\n\n"Ponies of Equestria, this is not the end," she said, shaking her head, "for our actions, even the fates must commend. Our lands and our country are not yet lost, for their victory was bought at a terrible cost. Their armies battered us with monsters of steel, yet even now, we refuse to kneel. Perhaps Chrysalis was right, in that it was foolish to fight..."\n\nEverypony present watched as Zecora picked a rifle up off of the ground and brandished it into the air. Even though the changelings had taken from her her forest refuge, overwhelming the monstrous fauna and flora that protected it and called it home, she still had one tool left, in the crude form of a firearm. So long as she had something to fight with, then she was determined to fight. "But even though we may die, that does not mean we will not try!"\n\nWith a yell, her partisans raised their weapons and let out a war cry, Varnish among them. They all knew there was no surrendering now. The changelings would execute them as soon as they got their hooves on them. The only thing they could do now was fight, even though it would be their doom.\n\nThe final battle for the Everfree had begun."

Craggly, broken plundervines reached toward the sky, as if desperate that some heavenly figure would descend from above to save them before flamethrowers and napalm turned them to charcoal fossils. The skeleton of a hydra lay not too far away, the vertebrae in one neck crushed beneath the treads of a panzer. To the side, pony carcasses festered in a mass grave, the awful stench fouling up the air.\n\nFinicus looked up, where another wave of heavy bombers flew overhead, bomb bay doors open and ready to drop their payload. Day after day, night after night, the bombers flattened and burned the forest, working in conjunction with more artillery brought to bear on a single target than ever before. And if the industrialist opened his mouth and tasted the air, the faint tang of metal touched his tongue, the fallout from the magical nuke still floating gently on the winds, accompanied by a faint tinnitus whine caused by the residual radiation.\n\nSomehow, the Heer had done it. The Everfree Forest may have been a source of wild, untamed magic, but it had buckled underneath the weight of the changeling war machine like the ponies it tried to protect. In the end, magic couldn't stand up to modern military might. In the clash of sorcery versus steel, steel had won, and indominitably so. Now, naught would remain of the once awe-inspiring forest but bones and ash.\n\nIt was a shame it had to be this way. Who knew what the Hives could have learned given the chance to study the forest's wild magic and unique flora and fauna? What sort of advancements could have propelled the changeling species into the next era? Those were questions without answers now.\n\nAs the wind blew through the skeletal trees, their branches rattled like the bones of the dead, creating an eerie cacophony that settled over the land.\n\nIt was time to go."

It was an army on the retreat if there ever was one. If he looked just a bit further toward the southwest, he could see the fires in the Everfree Forest dwindling as the night wore on, the orange lights succumbing to the devouring darkness around them. He had already called off the bombers three hours ago, noting how futile any continued attempts to contain the Everfree were. It had simply grown too powerful and too large, and by now was far beyond the Heer's efforts to stop.\n\n"Generalmajor?" Oberstleutnant Alcippe stood by the archway leading back into the castle, concern written on her face. "Are you... okay?"\n\n"Yes," Jachs answered her. "At least for the moment. I don't know who our queen will pin the blame on for our failure to contain the Everfree, but whoever they are, they aren't long for this world."\n\nAlcippe anxiously bit her lip. "Well... it's not all bad news, Jachs," she said, slowly striding closer. "Our scouts say the forest has stopped expanding. Its magical energies must be growing too dilute to advance any further."\n\n"Or maybe it's just satisfied with its victory," Jachs said, shaking his head. "We've pulled out everyling we could, and we'll figure out where to redeploy them over the next few days. The heart of Equestria is lost to us now, forever. That's as troubling a sign as any."\n\n"Jachs?"\n\nJachs sighed. "Leave me be, Oberstleutnant," he said, defeated. "I'll be fine. I need time to think."\n\nAlcippe bowed her head, sad eyes trained on the general she so admired, utterly defeated by the onslaught of the forest. "Generalmajor... Jachs... if there's anything you need..."\n\n"I'll be fine," Jachs insisted. He had no more words for her."

changelings_paxchrysalia.403.d:0 "Oberpionier Mauric covered his ears just in time, a moment before the massive locomotive challenged the Everfree with an ear-splitting roar from its horn. The wartrain's advance seemed inexorable, the spearhead of the Heer as it thrust deeper and deeper into the forest. Protected by a regiment's worth of pioneers equipped with flamethrowers and armored bulldozers, the train's relentless advance felled the forest and the monsters that called it home with a cold efficiency, matched only by the brutality of the military police onboard the train; with whip, truncheon, and bayonet, they were responsible for ensuring that the ragged band of pony tracklayers at the front laid down crossties and rails past the point of exhaustion. Mauric had already passed by so many equine bodies that he'd become numb to the sight.\n\nIt wasn't an easy task for the Heer, not by a long shot. Sheltered by the forest and aided by the monsters lurking within, the partisans resisted every inch of the changeling thrust through a relentless onslaught of ambushes and raids. And as the wartrain and its entourage advanced deeper into the Everfree, the gulf between the changelings and the outside world grew ever more distant. The rearguard left to protect the miles of track suffered not only the depredations of the partisans and monsters, but from the Everfree itself; dozens of times the pioneers had been dispatched back down the line to carve a path through the resurgent foliage which had reclaimed the tracks.\n\nBut no matter what they threw at it, the train's thick armor plating and heavy artillery sent the forest and its denizens reeling after intense fighting. Still, it was slow going at best. Plundervines regularly erupted between the crossties, ensnaring the train's wheels until they were burnt away by flamethrowers, and the ambient magic and suffocating humidity regularly corroded and ruined the delicate electronics onboard the train. Runners had proven the most reliable way of communicating with the Heer, as the radios regularly stopped working a few hours after being delivered to the train. In spite of all this, the train's progress, slow and painful as it was, would not be stopped.\n\nA scout let out a whistle, and the soldiers around the train immediately rushed to their battle stations, crewing the ordnance mounted on the train's wagons against whatever the forest threw at them this time. Mauric himself quickly scurried aboard the train's armored cabins with the rest of the pioneers, hopefully out of harm's way. "Join the Pioneer Korps, they said, it'll be fine, they said," Mauric bitterly remarked to himself. "It's better than being on the front lines, they said.""

"I was stupid like you once, too. I won medals in the Great War. I stormed the palace in Canterlot. I was a member of the Jagdkommando-Einsatzgruppen. I had everything I wanted. Slaves, shekels, status. Everything." There's something in his eyes — a twinkle of nostalgia for the good old days, perhaps?—but it's gone in a split second.

It's there in moments, and the changeling wastes no time slipping it into his hoof and downing the liquor in one gulp. He coughs, grimaces, and before you can ask if he's alright, he fixes you with his haunted eyes again. "The trees, grub. They talk to you. They moan and wail when night falls. They've got faces on 'em, too. The night is filled with whispers and screams. They try to get you to do things, try to get you to kill your friends, to blow your own brains out. You sleep too close to one, and it'll strangle you with its roots, dragging you down into the mud without so much as a scream.\n\n"And then there's the timberwolves. Just wolves made out of wood, right? Well, wood doesn't feel pain, and it doesn't bleed. You need anti-tank rounds to kill one; bullets won't do the trick. And good luck getting enough fuel for a flamethrower when you're deep in the forest, isolated from the rest of your unit. About the only thing that kept me going was the contraband I could get my hooves on. I perfected the recipe for a nice cocktail of stimulants and tranquilizers made out of industrial-grade Love just to keep me going. It messed with my head, grub. I swear, I shot the same pony in the face dozens of times, but I could never kill her. To this day, I don't know if she was real or not.\n\nHe sadly glares one last time at you.

When Alcippe shook her head, he shrugged and gestured to the chair across from him. "Well, my team has made some progress since we last spoke on this matter," he said as Alcippe sat down. "The short version is that at the rate the Everfree is growing, we have maybe under two months to contain its spread before the Heer's position in central Equestria becomes untenable.

He placed a map in front of Alcippe that marked the borders of the Everfree, and then ever-widening rings radiating out from it. "Plundervines are the first sign of its encroachment. These vines tear through roads, collapse bridges, and swallow towns whole. Then the trees move in, followed by the monsters and, inevitably, the partisans themselves. Not only that, but the forest is intensifying its inward growth. Soldiers and reconnaissance parties we're sending into the forest are suffering greater casualties, and many are simply going MIA within a few days. Swathes of forest that the Heer fells are almost fully regrown the following day; it's a constant effort just to keep the forest pushed back and to not lose any progress we gain. The more resources we commit to containing the forest, the more successful we are, but we are bleeding personnel and equipment at a staggering rate. We won't be able to keep this up for long."\n\n"So," Alcippe said, looking at the map between them. "What's the verdict, then? What should I tell Jachs when he's awake?"\n\n"Tell him that by my calculations we have just about two months to contain the forest," Marsilio said. "If it fully overruns the surrounding states, it will have grown too large and dense for us to hope to make any efforts in reversing its expansion. We will have to pull everything back and dig in around the perimeter just to make sure it doesn't overrun the entirety of Equestria. Right now, are military presence around the edges is slowing the growth, but eventually it will become too much to stop.""

"I heard that the Heer is planning on using Subject Omega as a defoliant to stop the growth of the Everfree. You plan on dropping the spores from low-flying crop dusters, right? After which they will grow into a moss that parasitizes all organic matter it touches, feeding and expanding on its host until it kills them both in a matter of hours. An ingenious approach to an unorthodox problem, if I do say so myself."\n\n"Yes," Jachs said, narrowing his eyes. "And how are we making a huge mistake? Proper precautions are being taken, and the land surrounding the forest is to be torched and cleared to make sure the moss doesn't grow where it shouldn't..."\n\n"But you're buying the weak stuff!" Finicus exclaimed. "The company that's supplying the spores for you? One of Dieter's cronies owns it. Our Queen's Guard captain pushed it over all the other competitors for the contract, even though it's the least refined. I should know, I was competing for that contract too."\n\n"Okay," Jachs said with a frown. "And you want me to use yours...?"\n\nFinicus emphatically nodded. "Yes," he said.

As she watched, a trifecta of modified crop-dusters swooped over the Everfree, a green cloud billowing from the nozzles under their wings to fall and settle on the forest canopy below. She couldn't see where the spores made impact from where she stood, but closer to her station at the Heer field hospital, she could see the bone-white husks of trees where the moss had landed, feasted, and subsequently died out. Little by little, the Heer's latest plan to beat back the encroaching forest seemed to find success, and the efforts had dramatically slowed the ability of the forest to press outwards toward the concrete-lined ditch the Heer had hastily erected around it.\n\nBut the price those efforts demanded could be horrid. In a steady deluge, ponies and changelings who had fallen victim to the spores had been brought back to her hospital, the former often civilians caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, the latter members of the Fernspäher operating deep within the Everfree. The moss didn't limit itself to plants; it went after anything organic, and ponies and changelings alike whimpered in agony as the moss ate into their flesh. Most had no chance for survival. Once the moss made it into a creature's bloodstream, they would wither and die from the inside out as the moss feasted upon their organs. All Katydid could do was prepare a triple-dose of morphine to ease their pain on the way out. It put a terrible toll on her mind, and her fears weren't eased when one of the orderlies under her command started coughing and fell ill as the spores infected him as well.\n\nHer brief moment of introspection over, her face resumed its usual impassive mask of stoicism, and Stabsarzt Katydid turned back to her work as the noise of the planes died away.

Retaliatory gunfire from the rest of the partisans further up the street barraged his position, and the sergeant slid down deeper into his foxhole.\n\nBeside him was Oberleutnant Cisiphus, her officer's cap lost somewhere in the fighting around Ponyville.

You were supposed to keep the plundervines away from the guns! That's what the concrete emplacements were for!"\n\nA roar went up through the town, and dirt fell down into the foxhole as an ursa minor leapt over it, its starry claws flattening the halftrack that had been providing Vexel and the Oberleutnant fire support. The ground trembled underhoof as the ursa minor continued its rampage, and as changeling soldiers fled down the street in a panicked rout, Vexel realized their lines were breaking and they'd soon be overrun.

Still propelling itself skywards, the eyes on the tatzlwurm's petals stared down at the fleeing soldiers below with a brutish, inequine malice. The thing let out a horrendous screech as it lashed at the formation of Luftwaffe fighters circling the town from above, ensnaring a trio of Stukas with its whiplike tongues and dashing them on the rooftops below with a powerful flex of its body.

Chrysalis paid them little mind as she immediately strode over to the table and placed her hooves on the edge, grinning from ear to ear. "The Everfree is no more," she proudly proclaimed. "Reduced to little more than charred sticks and scorched stones. Excellent work, Generalmajor. I always knew I could count on you."\n\nJachs humbly dipped his head. "Thank you, your Majesty."\n\n"Now," Chrysalis began, "what of the witch herself? What of this zebra that's been causing us so many problems?"\n\n"My best and bravest spies have carefully confirmed that the zebra shamaness known as Zecora is still alive and at large within the Everfree," Vaspier said, lighting a cigarette and putting it between his lips. "Her partisan movement has been utterly decimated, but she still has a ragtag band of survivors with her. There's hardly any forest left for her to hide in. Sooner or later, her time will come."\n\n"So let's flush her out, then!" Dieter exclaimed. "Now's our chance to deliver the coup de grâce to that foul witch. With the forest no longer a threat, how much longer can she hide?"\n\n"I've mobilized a dedicated task force to scour the Everfree by land and air," Jachs said, pushing a file toward the center of the table. "All we need is your word, your Majesty, and we will begin."\n\nChrysalis thought for a moment, then grinned even wider. "I should hunt the zebra personally," she proclaimed. "It would only be fitting for the greatest of the changeling Queens to bring back the head of the zebra that has caused us so much trouble!"\n\nAt once, all three underlings shared a look of concern. "Pardon my imprudence, your Majesty," Vaspier said. "But the Everfree is no place for a Queen to be. I'm sure the task force will be capable of leading itself. If anything were to happen to you...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.415.d:0 "Deep in the recesses of the forest, the hunters were afraid. Setting up camp where the undergrowth was naught but soot and ashes, they huddled around unlit campfires — for there was no foliage to serve as fuel — and told each other stories of the monsters that still lurked within the dark.\n\nFearful of the forest as they were, the soldiers of the Fernspäher took pride in the extraordinary nature of their service, for only the best of the best could delve deep into the Everfree and return. They'd survived bugbears and parasprites, and the depredation of the forest's partisans, but even with the Everfree scorched and atrophied, its most infamous denizen remained uncowed and at large.\n\nZecora the witch, who went into battle with her face hidden behind a shamanistic mask, or who could change bodies like any changeling shapeshifter, or whose visage no soldier of the Heer had ever laid eyes upon and lived to tell the tale. The partisans who painted themselves in their rudimentary, esoteric camouflage paid homage to their leader in their evocation of zebrican tribal markings. It was her who the changelings hunted and feared.\n\nThey recounted to each other hearsay of what had befallen their fellow hunters, recalling the snippets of information that eluded the attention of the censors and propagandists. They drank toasts to fallen brothers-in-arms; Major Pugnax, eponymous leader of his doomed Kampfgruppe, whose ossified form was found sticking out of the cupola of his tank, having been petrified by the same witchcraft that turned his soldiers to stone; or the three-dozen Fallschirmjaegers who'd been dropped over the heart of the forest, disappearing beneath the tree canopy at the nadir of their descent to be swallowed up apiece by the forest. A patrol found their bodies days later, the entire platoon hanging from a grove of trees by their parachute straps, which had been fashioned into makeshift nooses.\n\nThe changeling commanders in Canterlot read the reports that trickled in from the hunters who'd survived their forays into the forest, returning battered and empty-hooved, and more often than not marred by traumas both within and without. When it became clear that the Heer would not be able to track down the witch, the reports were filed away to be quietly forgotten about, the hunters reassigned to other, less dangerous postings, and the zebra expunged from all official records; after all, what didn't exist couldn't be a threat."

With Chrysalis as its vanguard, the changeling hunters had little difficulty penetrating the ragged and burnt-out foliage to reach the last bastion, where the zebra witch herself still hid.\n\nA hailstorm of gunfire erupted from the partisans as Chrysalis burst into the clearing, but an ethereal shield protected herself and the bodyguards immediately at her sides. Baying like bloodhounds, the changelings burst into the clearing, eager to set upon the smattering of weary and exhausted partisans that had somehow managed to survive the onslaught of the Heer. It wasn't even a fair fight; it was more akin to target practice, with the ponies falling to bullet and bayonet as their defenses were quickly overrun.\n\n"Show yourself, witch!" Chrysalis roared, ripping apart tent after tent and flinging the debris every which way. "Surrender to me, and I might let you live. Or don't; that might make it more fun." She closed her eyes and turned her nose skyward, drawing in a deep breath to cast a spell. Then, grinning, she turned toward the far corner of the forest and stalked closer like a cat pursuing a cornered mouse. "I can taste your fear, zebra, and it tastes delicious..."\n\nHer magic seized ahold of the unassuming tent and tore the fabric in two..."

Black ash smeared the lines between her stripes, her green tribal paint was all but worn away, and burns covered her face, her neck, and her front legs. A sling held her foreleg close to her chest, and her eyes were bloodshot with fever. She'd survived the Heer's efforts to destroy the Everfree, but only barely by the looks of it.\n\n"There you are," Chrysalis purred, her magic seizing Zecora by the throat and pulling her out of the tent. The zebra coughed and struggled, but she was too weak to put up a fight. "How the mighty have fallen," Chrysalis taunted her. "You've been a pain in my side for too long, you realize? But now I finally have you."\n\n"You think... you have me?" the zebra choked out through Chrysalis' grip. "But perhaps... you should wait and see!"\n\nHer hoof lashed out at Chrysalis' horn, and the changeling queen dropped Zecora at the sudden pain. Chrysalis' bodyguards leapt into action, but Zecora struck her hoof against the ground, and a wall of plundervines burst forth to cut them off from their queen. It was just Zecora and Chrysalis now, and Chrysalis bared her fangs at the zebra. "You cur! I'll have your head!"\n\nShe moved to advance on Zecora, but fast as lightning, Zecora snatched a vial of a blue liquid from her sling and hurled it at Chrysalis. The glass broke on her face and the liquid hissed as it burned through Chrysalis' chitin, leaving the changeling queen howling in pain. Then, Zecora began to chant in a haunting voice:"

Her face felt like it was melting, the chitin plates cracking and drooping as what was in the vial worked its foul magic on them. Gritting her teeth, Zecora spat on the ground before turning tail and fleeing deeper into the deepest, darkest heart of the Everfree, the bastion that had remained untouched and resilient no matter what the Heer had thrown at it. The forest seemed to close in after her, trees moving closer together and branches interlocking to form an impenetrable wall.\n\nIt took almost an hour before the jaegers were able to break through the plundervines and reach their queen.

The surgeons went to great lengths to repair your face. Too much pressure and you might damage the chitin..."\n\nChrysalis wanted to scream at him, but didn't see the point. It'd taken all the best surgeons in the Hives to fix her face, or at least get it to resemble something like her old self, after that damned zebra cursed it with the poison joke in that vial. But none had been able to fix the real curse placed on her, and that bothered her more than looks ever did. Mostly, because she couldn't change hers anymore.\n\nStill, she did as the doctor asked, and she felt the surge of magic within her erupt in a ring of green fire around where she sat. The pretty pink form of Princess Cadance sat in the mirror, almost perfect... but it wasn't. Her horn was a touch too long, her eyes the wrong shade of blue, even the gradient of the purple on her wings was off! "Why won't it work?!" Chrysalis howled through Cadance's voice. "It's not perfect! It's not right!"\n\nThe doctor cautiously scribbled a few things into his clipboard and tried to give his queen a reassuring smile. "But your M-majesty... it is p-perfect. This looks exactly like Princess Cadance, just like when you infiltrated the royal wedding in Canterlot." He hesitated, then added, "Your Majesty... perhaps Zecora's so-called "curse" has taken a toll on your mind, not your powers. The witch has tricked you into thinking your transformations aren't perfect when, in fact, they are flawless imitations, just as they always have been."\n\nChrysalis seized the doctor in her magic. "Liar!" she shouted at him. "Don't patronize me! They're wrong! I know they are!"

changelings_paxchrysalia.418.d:0 "In the dead of night, Carrot Top was still awake, stargazing. Beyond her garden, over the rooftops of Ponyville, the night sky was on the prowl.\n\nJust weeks ago, the Everfree had swept into Ponyville like a tidal wave, ousting the changeling garrison in a deluge of rampaging foliage. Even after the worst of the forest had receded, some of its denizens had stayed behind, settling down amidst neighbourhoods overgrown with exotic vegetation.\n\nNow, timberwolves stalked the streets, occasionally getting into fights with the bugbear who'd made its den in the ruins of the town hall. Lurking in the gutted interiors of houses were carnivorous parasprites or star-spiders, or worse, a nest of cockatrices. Then there was the ursa major, mother to a dozen ursa cubs, all of whom still lived within the Everfree proper but had made the recently-afforested Ponyville part of their hunting grounds. It was the monolithic, star-speckled bulk of the mother bear that now towered above the canopy, the cosmos within its ethereal body blending into the night sky.\n\nCarrot Top watched as it meandered off into the outskirts of the town. She wondered how the urban topography had been transformed in the wake of the ursa major's incursion. At daybreak, she would set out to the farmers' market — the new one, in the shell of Barnyard Bargains — and sell her carrots to the few ponies who still called Ponyville home.\n\nIt wouldn't be an easy journey. She'd first have to detour around the Pear family farm, where a platoon of changeling infantry had holed up, left behind during the panicked flight of the Heer. Sometimes, when she felt especially brave, she'd creep as near as she'd dared. She'd eavesdrop on the stranded changelings, listening to them bicker amongst themselves, crying out for their frigid northern homeland. Something in the ambient magic that now saturated the air stopped them from shapeshifting.\n\nPonyville was not a no mare's land. Some of the beasts who roamed the streets could not be cowed by any pony, not even the fighters of the zebra Zecora; an expedition into the town by the forest-dwelling partisans had ended in a one-sided slaughter in the middle of town, where they'd provoked the bugbear. Cut off from the rest of Equestria, there were still those loyal to the Harmonic Resistance, harbouring dreams of a Ponyville restored to its former glory as the bastion of Friendship; between them and Zecora's partisans there existed an uneasy truce. Neither side laid claim to the vacant Castle of Friendship, though it was the only structure in town untouched by the forest. Some of its windows were wide open, beckoning to the foolhardy.\n\nMost of Ponyville's extant population lived on a single street sealed off from the rest of town by barricades, guarded by wary ponies wielding shotguns and pitchforks. Walls had been knocked down to create thoroughfares through rows of houses, a family in each room. In a basement, there was a school that provided an improvised education for the foals in the community. Carrot Top preferred the seclusion of her carrot farm, but she was happy to do business with the survivors. They were her friends, and her deliveries of carrots, though infrequent, were her way of showing that she still cared for her erstwhile neighbours."

changelings_paxchrysalia.419.d:0 "FINAL REPORT ON SUBJECT THRAIS FOLI, FORMER THEORETICAL PHYSICIST OF THE VRAKS INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED PHYSICS:\n\nPresented for reviewal, for V. O. Kladisium's eyes only.\n\nTwo months ago, Dr. Thrais Foli, theoretical physicist of the Vraks Institute of Advanced Physics, was collected by our agents for extensive psychological review after concerning details of his work were leaked to the agency. Raids on the laboratory where the subject worked yielded binders stuffed with what can only be described as the ravings of an individual on the verge of a serious mental breakdown. Such papers included hypotheses on destroying the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville with a theoretical hypermagical 'singularity' device that would distort local gravity in the town to over 50,000G in a 30m radius centered on an infinitesimally small point inside of the castle, crushing it instantly. While these works have been disregarded as impractical and, by all known laws of physics and magic, impossible, we believe that certain other articles warrant treatment as Items of Special Interest by the VOPS.\n\nOne large binder was filled with hypotheses about the eventual expansion of the Everfree Forest due to its unstable and unexplored magical properties. In the event that the Forest were to magically expand, the subject posited that the current operating capabilities of the Heer will be insufficient for controlling its growth. The subject hypothesized that a dedicated bombing campaign utilising biological, chemical, and nuclear munitions would be the minimum amount of military force necessary to stem the forest's growth. Other notable details include speculation on the efficacy of deploying armoured trains as mobile FOBs, as well as the creation of specialist jaeger formations for operations in the Everfree. These concerns should be relayed to the Heer in the event that the worst comes to pass as indicated in the seized reports, though this is seen as unlikely.\n\nAs for the psychological review of the subject, we have made little headway. The subject is seldom lucid enough for direct questioning, and struggles to perform basic survival tasks such as eating, drinking, sleeping, and cleaning himself. It appears that the doctor's mind is already all-but broken, and perhaps only recoverable with the help of years of psychological therapy. We recommend committing the doctor to an institution to live out the rest of his insanity someplace where he can be provided for rather than waste the time and effort of reconstructing his mind with little chance of success."

She certainly hadn't failed to notice their bodyguards forcibly emptying their destinations of all ponies inside before they arrived, just to be safe...\n\nBut none of that mattered now; it was time to greet the new governor of Canterlot. So, leading her friends up to Generalmajor Jachs' door, she only knocked once before opening the door and bursting in with a cheerful exclamation of "Congratulations!"\n\nJachs jumped in his seat, surprised by the sudden entrance, which wasn't helped when Finicus popping the cork off of a bottle of champagne boomed around the office like a gunshot. When he saw it was his friends, however, Jachs let out a happy sigh and stood up. "Don't scare me like that," he teased Alcippe. "I thought the Queen's officials had come back for round two."\n\n"Chryssi's goons wouldn't bring champagne to anything, would they?" Finicus asked, quickly pouring the fizzy drink into four glasses and passing them about. "Congratulations on the new title, though from what I've gathered, you'd much rather have gone without it, eh?"\n\n"It's an honor, even if the responsibilities that come with it are daunting," Jachs admitted. "Now I not only have to coordinate the Heer's strategy throughout central Equestria, but I also have to dip my hooves into civil affairs. At least I'll have Alcippe to help with that."\n\n"And I'll be taking over laboratories and ongoing research here in Canterlot," Marsilio said. "You won't have to concern yourself with that."\n\n"That's good," Jachs said. Then he raised an eyebrow at Finicus. "And what brings the president and CEO of Main Hives out to Canterlot?"\n\n"Well, officially, I'm here as director of the Canterlot headquarters of Main Hives," Finicus began, but he then added with a wink, "but in reality, I just needed a vacation. A bug's gotta relax, you know?" Then he held up his glass. "So, what are we waiting for? Are we going to toast the new governor or not?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.501.t:0 "The Good Ol' Days"
changelings_paxchrysalia.501.d:0 "The past few weeks had been such a whirlwind of frenzied activity that Generalmajor Jachs could barely separate one day from another. His promotion to governor of Canterlot had been both the opportunity of a lifetime and a kick out of the hive into a deep, deep well of responsibility. Getting a good night's sleep had certainly been one of the first things he'd sacrificed to make the new position work.\n\nBut as he sat on his balcony overlooking Canterlot, a glass of whiskey within easy reach, his mind started to wander back to simpler times. It was incredible to think of how far he'd come from commanding the 96th Infantry Division — known colloquially as 'Das 96th"—as an Oberst at the start of the Great War. From a colonel flung into some of the toughest and nastiest fighting in the entire war, to governor of Canterlot and all of central Equestria... it was amazing how time could fly.\n\nHis thoughts of the old 96th sent him reminiscing about the soldiers he used to serve with. They'd all been through the worst modern warfare had to offer, and somehow survived. They'd seen it all, from the siege of Acornage to the bombardment of Cloudsdale and the fall of Canterlot. Many of his old comrades had returned to civilian life at the end of the war; many more had been promoted to command other divisions in the Heer, or even the Queen's Guard. And with the need to decompress and demobilize, the 96th had been one of the casualties and disbanded. What war had failed to do, peace had accomplished: the soldiers of the 96th scattered to the winds. It was a sombering thought to know they'd never serve together in these new times of peace the Hives found themselves in.\n\nOr was it that final? Jachs frowned into his drink. His recent promotion, as much as he bemoaned the responsibilities, had opened up doors that had long been shut. He had the first and final say of anything that happened in Canterlot, the city that he now directly controlled. He could do whatever he wanted within the old capital of a defeated nation.\n\nSo what was stopping him now?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.501.a:0 "Let's just make a few phone calls and see what happens..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8501.t:0 "Getting the Band Back Together"
changelings_paxchrysalia.8501.d:0 "Oberstleutnant Alcippe walked out onto the balcony, dossier after dossier fanned out in her magic and held in front of her face. "Generalmajor... what are all these?" she asked, setting them aside and turning to Jachs, who seemed to be watching the parting clouds hanging over the city with calm interest. "We've been processing the reenlisting papers for so many veterans... are you up to something?"\n\n"Just an old bug reliving the glory days," Jachs said, glancing at Alcippe and inviting her to sit. "Seeing who still is around and who's interested in coming to Canterlot to make a difference."\n\nAlcippe stifled a small chuckle. "You're hardly an old bug, Jachs," she said. "And what do you mean, 'coming to make a difference'?"\n\n"We need more bugs like us in Canterlot," Jachs explained. "We need changelings that don't bend over backwards for Queen and country. We need changelings who are willing to find a balance between what's good for the Hives and what's good for the ponies we rule. What the Heer is seeing these days, it's mostly zealous recruits and fanatics. Perfect for the Queen's Guard, but not for keeping the peace. And if I can bring together my comrades from the old 96th under my command... if I can make us serve as a role model for how we should police Equestria... then I think that maybe, just maybe, there's a chance the Pax Chrysalia survives."\n\n"But how do you know they'll all think like you, Jachs?" Alcippe asked. "War is one thing, but peace... that's something else."\n\n"We were disciplined seven times in the Great War for being too lenient with our prisoners," Jachs said, frowning at the horizon. "We were about as moderate as a division could get. And I doubt very much that what my old comrades have seen since the war ended has hardened their hearts instead of reaffirming our beliefs."\n\nHe looked straight at Alcippe, almost as if he was looking through her eyes and into her soul. "The world doesn't have to be boots stepping on necks. I'll bring the 96th back together, and we'll show changelings and ponies alike that occupation does not have to mean oppression."
changelings_paxchrysalia.8501.a:0 "The Heer needs moderates in the rank and file, not just in its officer corps."

changelings_paxchrysalia.9501.t:0 "Soldiers of Canterlot"
changelings_paxchrysalia.9501.d:0 "It'd taken some time, but Jachs had finally done it. A nonstop series of phone calls, telegrams, and in-person meetings had all been leading up to this moment. And getting the official clearance from the Queen herself had been as simple as presenting a paper to her and stating that it was for the recruitment of more soldiers to garrison Canterlot and keep the peace. Chrysalis didn't care who Jachs wanted when he promised her it meant more changeling soldiers in the pony capital. She liked to look at the little numbers on a board and laugh when the math favored her instead of bothering to look at what the numbers meant at the end of the day.\n\nAnd now, as the fanfare of trumpets and the stomping of hooves came to a stop in the Plaza of the Sun, Generalmajor Jachs stepped out to the podium in his finest parade uniform, all brand new and tailored for the occasion, save for the old patch of the old 96th that he'd saved from his previous uniform and sewn onto the fabric. Arranged before him were the changelings of the 96. "Canterlonian" Infanterie-Division, with around half of the soldiers — including much of the NCOs and officers — consisting of alumni from the original division, and the other half filled with names recommended by those like-minded colleagues he talked to. They were an impressive force, a beautiful force, and Jachs knew they would make him proud.\n\nWith a division at his back, it was time to change the Pax Chrysalia for the better, starting with Canterlot."

changelings_paxchrysalia.502.t:0 "The Changing of the Guard"
changelings_paxchrysalia.502.d:0 ""Move, move! Keep those legs moving, fillies! You call that a march? You're so damned behind that it's a May at best, and partisans aren't going to surrender if you ask for their permission to arrest them!"\n\nKommandant Second Wind frowned as he watched the new recruits of the newly-minted Canterlot Guard try and fail to march up and down the parade grounds behind the Canterlot Castle. Everything about them was a mockery of the real Royal Canterlot Guard, the elite regiment he had belonged to before the changelings won the war and dismantled the force. The armor his new recruits wore was plated in gold to resemble the golden armor of the old Royal Guard, but a thick, black stripe had been painted down the midsection, like it was dividing each pony in two. And instead of the Sisters' coat of arms, the changeling trident now adorned the collar and flanks. No doubt if the Sisters were here to see this they'd be ashamed of how the Royal Guard had been satirized by the bugs. Maybe that was the point.\n\nBut Second Wind didn't care. The Royal Guard had been a dead end job for him before the war. He lacked the pedigree to move up in its ranks, not being from a noble family, and his promotion just before the war ended had only been out of desperation born from a deteriorating military situation. He had little love lost for the aristocratic unicorns that had filled the Royal Guard's upper echelons, and perhaps that was why he was the highest-ranking officer to defect from the defunct Royal Guard to the new Canterlot Guard. There certainly wasn't much to complain about now. All he had to do was listen to what the bugs told him to do, and they gave him almost free reign to shape the Canterlot Guard as he wanted.\n\nPerhaps the changelings winning the war wasn't such a bad thing, after all."

It's good to see you," the pegasus said, bowing his head in deference to his changeling superior. He did, after all, owe his new position to the directives of Jachs.\n\n"Kommandant," Jachs said, removing his hat and lightly tossing it on the table before sitting down. "Please, take a seat. You've probably been on your hooves all day."\n\n"Getting the new recruits to march in formation is a challenge I didn't expect to take this long," Second Wind admitted, sitting down across from the Generalmajor. "Most of the ponies who were trained in the war wouldn't dare sign up for something like the Canterlot Guard. And most of my comrades in the Royal Guard would probably skin me alive if they found out this is how I've approached the postwar life."\n\n"Well, you've certainly come farther and done better than most have, now that the war's over," Jachs said. He snickered as a thought crossed his mind, and he shook his head. "I've read your file, obviously. It's amusing to me that a pony named 'Second Wind' can go from flying wounded comrades out of a warzone on his bare back and still getting no recognition from his old institution, to finding himself in command of a brand new institution under a new regime."\n\n"I suppose it's fitting," Second Wind said with a shrug. "I've always find it funny how our names work, though I'm not as strong a believer in prophetic naming than most. Too bad I don't have any ponies named 'Long March' or 'Parade Formation' under my command."\n\nThe two chuckled in their moment of camaraderie, at least until Second Wind slowly began to frown. "But the more I'm out there... what am I supposed to do, Generalmajor?" he asked Jachs. "I may not have had a lot of love lost for the Royal Guard at the end of the day, but Equestria is still my home. I hate seeing it suffer like this, and sometimes when I'm out there drilling the new troops, I feel like I'm part of the problem." A pained, conflicted look took hold of his face, and he looked to Jachs for an answer. "What am I supposed to do?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.503.d:0 ""It is irritating, Finicus, but I have my hopes that one day, the Canterlot Archives will be the crown jewel of knowledge throughout the entire known world."\n\nGeneraloberstabsarzt Marsilio took a sip of the mimosa Finicus had made for him as the two changelings sat on his new manor's third story balcony. It was an impressive building, and even a scientist more concerned with the lasting work of his research than picking apart the ephemeral styles of Canterlot architecture could appreciate it. Many of the landed nobility had fled Canterlot long before the Heer scaled the mountain, and now their ancient family homes were all being auctioned off on the cheap. Finicus, of course, had wasted no time leveraging some of the massive profits he'd made during the war toward purchasing the finest one he could find for himself.\n\n"I don't get what the big deal is," Finicus said with a shrug. "The archives are spoils just like everything else in this city. Of course the victors are going to fight over the choicest bits."\n\n"But it's not helping anybody, changeling or pony," Marsilio said. "On paper, the archives should have been opened up for any creature to peruse their knowledge. But the Heer is ripping through them looking for anything about dark magic and long-lost weapons and spells, while corporations much like your own are filling crate after crate with esoteric tomes and shipping them back to the Hives. I doubt they'll ever be seen again if they contain something even the slightest bit interesting."\n\n"Business is business," Finicus said with a shrug. But when Marsilio frowned, the industrialist bit his lip and leaned in closer to his friend. "But... you do have my word that I'll make sure everything gets back to the Archives in one piece when we're done with it.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.504.t:0 "Triple Threat"
changelings_paxchrysalia.504.d:0 ""How many today?"\n\nIt was always the first question that Jachs asked Alcippe in the morning when she delivered the day's items to his desk. The subject in question were the black folders Alcippe put on top of the stack held in her magic. Those folders, black as the inky night sky, contained information on threats critical to the stability and functioning of the Canterlot Commissariat. Most days, there were none, though occasionally there would be one or two. Today, however...\n\n"Three," Alcippe said, setting the stack on Jachs' desk and pulling the three off the top. "Shall I read them for you, Generalmajor?"\n\nJachs' eyebrow raised at that. "Three? Well, go ahead. Summarize, if you can."\n\nAlcippe nodded and opened up the first folder, skimming through its contents. "A missive from VOPS," she began. "They believe they've uncovered an underground society of unicorn supremacists here in Canterlot calling themselves the Cornucopia Society. They're going to intensify operations to determine if that's true, but they wanted to let you know."\n\nShe set that folder aside and grabbed the next. "A letter from some concerned townsponies, along with a report from the Queen's Guard. The townsponies say that they believe there's some sort of underground drug den stirring up trouble in the lower levels of Canterlot; the Queen's Guard thinks they're part of a Harmonic Resistance cell, and they demand that you do something about it before the Queen visits Canterlot for her grand coronation."\n\nThen she grabbed the last folder, and frowned at it. "And this is... a letter from Finicus asking you if you want to try out this new 'Love den' he found in Lowtown Canterlot." She tossed that folder aside. "So only two things of importance. We need to remind him not to use urgent folders for personal mail..."\n\nJachs scratched his chin in thought. "A supremacist cult, a resistance hideout, and a drug den... how much do you want to bet they're all connected?""
changelings_paxchrysalia.504.a:0 ""I don't think I'll take that bet, sir.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.8504.t:0 "Unicornia Blues"
changelings_paxchrysalia.8504.d:0 "It had been a busy day, to say the least, and Jachs was more than happy to finally go back home for the night and hang up his hat. The past few days had been spent overseeing the counterinsurgency operation to infiltrate and destroy this so-called 'Cornucopia Society', and he had absolutely no worries that anything would go wrong. The troops were well-trained and the operational plan was sound, perfected from so many other counterinsurgency operations before it. This wasn't Jachs first cell he had to squash by any means, though he did wonder whenever he'd finally get the chance to end his last. Maybe someday soon, if he was lucky.\n\nWhen he opened the door to his bedroom, however, his eyebrow raised as he spotted a letter resting on his pillow. Curious, he pulled it closer and looked it over. There was nothing to denote who it came from or how it got in here; all that was written on the envelope was a simple, 'To the Governor of Canterlot'. Frowning, Jachs opened the envelope and pulled out a fine piece of stationary, carrying two sentences carefully written by horn:\n\n"The Society cordially invites you to attend our next gathering, at 2 past midnight during the next new moon. Come alone to the corner of Bit and Bridle in Lowtown."\n\nIt was an ominous message, to be sure, and so the next day, Jachs brought Alcippe and Marsilio together to discuss it. After explaining the situation and reading the letter's contents to them, the Generalmajor waited for his subordinates to voice their thoughts on the matter.\n\nAlcippe, of course, immediately shook her head. "It's too risky," she said. "It absolutely has to be a trap. They're partisans, right? Why would they want to meet with you for anything other than to kill you?"\n\n"We don't know if they're partisans. At least, not for sure," Marsilio cautioned. "Truth be told, we don't know what exactly this 'Cornucopia Society' is supposed to be. Yet I still must agree with Alcippe. It's too dangerous. Nothing good can come of it.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.505.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs made his way to the top of the nearby radio station, where the building's tall roof afforded him the perfect vantage point to observe the operation about to take place several blocks down the street. Oberstleutnant Alcippe accompanied him, along with a signal corps detachment and a bevvy of radios to keep them apprised of the battle about to transpire.\n\nOn the street below, several companies of changelings set off from their muster point, marching down the streets toward the suspected headquarters of the Cornucopia Society: the Hotel Calihornia. After turning down the Society's invitation, Jachs had analyzed the map of the area surrounding the intersections of Bit Street and Bridle Avenue, and come to the conclusion that the opulent, but still-shuttered, hotel would have made the perfect headquarters for a resistance cell operating directly under his nose. Infiltrators had confirmed pony activity at the supposedly vacant building, and that had been all the assurance Jachs needed to give the operation the go-ahead. Now, his soldiers would have to seize the hotel and bring back any assets they could find inside.\n\nBut before they could do that, they first had to reach the hotel. Before the companies were halfway to their destination, glass shattered amidst a cacophony of gunfire breaking out along the streets. The soldiers dispersed, diving for cover wherever they could find it, as the tall buildings on either side of the street erupted with insurgent gunfire.\n\nAlcippe turned to give Jachs a worried look, but the Generalmajor kept his eyes focused on the street below. There was nothing they could do now except watch and wait."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8505.t:0 "Putting Your Hoof Down"
changelings_paxchrysalia.8505.d:0 "Without missing a beat, the changeling soldiers split into two groups: the first group rushed to enter the nearby buildings, battering down doors and breaking through windows before storming inside, while the second group took wing and gave them covering fire before getting onto the rooftops and securing the high ground. Gunfire flashed behind dusty windows as the soldiers and the partisans engaged in close quarters combat, and though the ponies had defensible ground to hold, the changeling soldiers were drilled, disciplined, and moved as one solid unit. Building by building, room by room, Jachs' counterinsurgents cleared out the resistance, boldly advancing through the relentless onslaught of machine guns and mortars. Even without armor support, the changelings were simply too much for the partisans, and the ponies began to fold in on themselves as their defensive lines broke.\n\nIt felt like an eternity, but soon the changeling fire brigades were on the footsteps of the Hotel Calihornia. After securing their positions and readying charges to breach the exterior, the units moved up as one to gain entrance. But before they could, a chorus of explosions erupted from the base of the hotel, and the entire structure began to list as its foundations gave way. Changeling soldiers fled as fast as they could as the rubble came crashing down, and soon the eight-story building turned into an avalanche of concrete and mortar sweeping down the street. The terrible rumbling seemed to shake the whole city, and a cloud of dust rose up into the air, dry and suffocating. Alcippe covered her astonished muzzle, while Jachs watched in disbelief. And when the dust finally settled, no trace of the Hotel Calihornia was left.\n\nFinally, Jachs turned to the radio operator at his side. "Start recalling the units, and get search and rescue to sift through the rubble for anyling missing," he ordered. "The day is ours."\n\nThe radio operator did as he was told, and Jachs simply watched the settling dust as his soldiers limped away from the carnage. They'd won, but the hotel had been completely destroyed. Whatever hope Jachs might have had for learning more about this 'Cornucopia Society', it was gone for good now.\n\nNot that it mattered much. Another resistance cell was destroyed, and the Queen would be safe to venture to Canterlot for her grand coronation."

He'd thrown on a heavy cloak, but even that didn't seem to stop the chill that seemed to pierce his exoskeleton. The night was too quiet, too dead, and having jaegers in the surrounding buildings and Alcippe talking to him through an earpiece didn't do much to put him at ease."\n\n"I have to know," Jachs said, frowning down the deserted roads. The microphones embedded in his clothing picked up his voice and carried it back to Alcippe, allowing them to communicate at a distance. "I need to know what this is really about. Besides, it would be rude to turn down an invitation."\n\n"Getting yourself killed is rude to me," Alcippe grumbled, a curious tone in her voice that passed by in a fleeting moment. "If you get into trouble, shapeshift into something tough and get out of there. Jaegers can get to you in sixty seconds, and you'll have a car in five minutes ready to take you back to the palace."\n\n"I can always count on you, can't I?" Jachs chuckled lightly, then sighed, letting out some of the nervous tension building up inside of him. He checked the watch on his foreleg and frowned as the second hand slowly completed another lap around its face. It was just about two in the morning. Where was this so-called Cornucopia Society?\n\nThe distant bell towers began to toll the hour with somber melodies before ending with two brass chimes that seemed to echo throughout the sleeping city forever. And it was then that Jachs heard the faint purr of an engine approaching. He looked all around the intersection, up and down every street, but didn't see anything. Maybe it was the next block over...?\n\nThen he heard the rumbling right in front of him, and a shimmer of magic swirled the air before a white automobile appeared in front of him, like an oasis appearing out of a desert mirage. Jachs blinked and rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't seeing things, but the car was still there, waiting for him. And as he watched, the back door opened of its own accord, revealing an empty seat."

He took a careful peek inside, only to find the passenger section of the cabin had been separated from the driver by a decorative panel. There was nopony in the back and, with a deep breath, Jachs took his seat. "Where are we going?" he asked, but he got no response. Instead, the door closed behind him, and he felt a momentary shift in gravity as the car began to accelerate. When he tried to look out of the car windows, he only saw the swirling stars of the night, not the buildings of Canterlot. Whoever had enchanted this car had done an impeccable job; Jachs could practically taste the magic lingering in the air.\n\nIt wasn't a long drive, but Jachs quickly lost his orientation as the car turned from one block to the other. But finally, it came to a stop, and once again the car's door opened on its own. Jachs hesitated for a moment, expecting a pony with a gun to paint the back seat with his blood, but when no such attacks came, he stepped out of the car and looked around.\n\nHe looked like he was in a parking garage of some kind, though the only decorations were water stains along the walls and trash collected in the various corners under flaking concrete. The place looked like it had been abandoned for some time, and the only other thing inside of the garage was the car. Curious, Jachs walked around toward the driver's side and peered through the glass, wanting to see the face of the pony that had driven him to this location, but was surprised to only find an empty seat. Had the car driven him here of its own accord?\n\nThere was still one more thing in the garage, and that was a simple door in front of the car. Frowning, Jachs slowly approached to it. "I'm about to enter," he muttered into the microphones. "Wish me luck."\n\nThen, taking a deep breath, Jachs knocked on the door. A slat opened at eye-level, revealing a pair of deep amethyst eyes. "Governor Jachs," a sultry voice purred, and he could tell those eyes were smiling at him. "It's an honor. A moment, if you would."\n\nThe slat closed, and sturdy locks in the door opened one by one. Then the door swung inward, revealing a tall unicorn mare in a slim dress coyly smiling at him from beneath a mask. "Welcome to the Cornucopia Society. You may call me Gloriosa. Please, do come in.""

In front of him, the masked mare looked him over, her deep purple eyes seemingly dissecting him where he stood. Then she smiled, a reaction Jachs wasn't expecting after spending so long dealing with either hatred or fear from the common ponies of Equestria. "I was wondering if you would join us or not," she said, her magic tugging on his coat and guiding him deeper into the building. "I feel there is so much we could gain from talking to each other."\n\n"I'm always willing to talk," Jachs said, hesitantly following the tall unicorn deeper into the shadowy rooms. "Talking is much cleaner than fighting, and fewer creatures get hurt that way."\n\nGloriosa chuckled. "Yes, I tend to agree. And I believe that, together, we can make Canterlot... something special." They entered a wide, open space, softly lit by red and pink lights, and scattered about with plush pillows and empty glass bottles lying on the carpet. Dotted around the room were unicorns in various stages of sobriety, many murmuring to each other with slurred words, others lazily giggling on the ground, and still more passed out on the pillows with smiles on their faces. The masked mare took Jachs past all of them, then sat him down at the edge of the room and gestured at its occupants. "We are the Cornucopia Society," she said, by way of introduction. "All of us, unicorns, many from noble houses, the crème de la crème of Canterlot. With the recent... shake up of the Great War, our numbers have grown considerably in my city. Unicorns looking for an escape... none of us were meant to be ruled by the other races, let alone another species."\n\nThat caused Jachs to frown. "If you're asking that I turn over control of Canterlot to your society, I'm afraid I'm going to have to say no," he stated. "I came here to see what this 'Society' was and find out if it could be of use to me, not to have terms dictated to me."\n\n"The mare's smile never faltered or wavered; she was impossible to read, and the gilded porcelain mask that ensconced the upper half of her face didn't help in that regard. "I understand, Governor, and if I wanted control of Canterlot, I would have killed you, rather than talk to you." She waited for a moment, then levitated over a pair of martini glasses, which she set between them. "I offer you... a proposal," she said. "A compromise between me and you.

Pink and white fog erupted from the bubbling concoction as it touched glass, spilling over the side like a smoking thermal vent. Jachs frowned at the strange drink as she continued. "The Society has the best of the best the unicorn race has to offer. We also have ways of providing... a fleeting moment of escape from the unfortunate situation that so many Equestrians now suffer in." She gestured to the drink in front of her, before holding it aloft in her magic. "Have you ever wondered what happens if you take a pony's Love, refine it, and give it back to the pony?"\n\n"I... can't say that I have," Jachs said, his magic gingerly lifting his own glass.\n\n"Bliss," Gloriosa said, eyes fluttering shut. "A way to forget about the world for a while. We've found a way to refine it that even your species, naturals as you are, have not. So I offer you this: lessen the burdens on unicorns in Canterlot. Place us in deserving positions throughout the city and your administration. Let unicorns stand side by side with the changelings, not kneeling beneath them, and in return, I'll give you the means to achieve your ambitions." She wiggled the glass in her magic. "Insight in a bottle."\n\n"And if I refuse?" Jachs asked, raising an eyebrow. "What if I instead order the Heer to crack down on this drug den?"\n\nThis time, the mare's smile turned to a sharp frown. "Then we will fight just as bitterly as the rest of our species," she said. "And there will be consequences."\n\nThen she gestured to the drink. "Do we have a deal, Governor?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.4506.d:0 ""Jachs, don't do it," Alcippe squawked in his ear. "Whatever you do..."\n\nJachs wanted to reassure her, but he couldn't without giving away that he was covered in surveillance equipment. Instead, he gave the foggy drink in his magic a look over. "Well... I would be a fool if I were to turn down help," Jachs said, both to the masked mare and to Alcippe. He held his drink up in a toast. "For politeness' sake. Don't expect me to become a regular customer."\n\nGloriosa smiled back at him. "Of course," she said, though the teasing tone in her voice made it plain she didn't exactly believe him. "To a new friendship between Governor Jachs and the Cornucopia Society."\n\nShe lifted her glass to her lips, deeply inhaling the fog rolling off of it before tilting her head back and drinking the refined Love. Jachs hesitated for a moment, wondering if, perhaps, this was just another layer of a trap he'd stumbled into, before he steeled himself and did the same. He almost coughed as the sweet smell flooded his nose, and when the liquid touched his lips, he practically convulsed as the sweet and savory taste of Love rolled down his throat. He forced himself to finish the drink after noticing Gloriosa had finished hers, and when he set his glass down, his magic flickered and strobed as his changeling body absorbed Love refined to a higher degree than anything he'd ever experienced before.\n\n"Enjoy, Governor Jachs," Gloriosa murmured, her head lolled back and her eyes partially lidded. "Enjoy the escape of the Cornucopia Society...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.5506.d:0 "Jachs staggered away from the table, his hooves clumsy and numb. The red and pink lights of the den had erupted into a rainbow of bright and swirling colors, the lethargic unicorns lying around suddenly turning into lively, giggling park goers on a sunny summer's day. Alcippe was shouting something at him in his ear, though her voice quickly morphed away into birdsong. After all, Jachs wasn't on duty anymore; he was down by the pristine lake in Canterlot's Royal Gardens.\n\nHe walked around the crystal-clear water, feeling the cool tickle of freshly cut grass on his bare hooves. A cool breeze kept the warm heat of the summer sun at bay, and Jachs removed his hat, tossing it to the ground. He paused by a pier on the water's edge, recognizing the unicorn standing by the water. Rather, he recognized the changeling underneath the disguise; after all, he'd seen Finicus' wear the same unicorn stallion disguise countless times before. "Finicus?" he asked, moving closer. What are you doing here?"\n\nFinicus turned around, surprised, but a wide grin broke out on his muzzle as he saw Jachs approaching. His disguise disappeared in a flash of green magic, and the two changelings met at the middle of the pier. "Jachs! I was wondering when you would join me!" He put a leg around Jachs' shoulders, and he gestured out at the crowd in front of them. "Look at this... isn't it beautiful? It's beautiful, isn't it?"\n\nJachs looked back and forth, his eyes widening with each passing second. This wasn't the war-weary Canterlot he'd known. Instead of ponies cowering beneath changeling boots, he saw ponies and changelings sitting side by side, sharing picnics, singing songs, enjoying life as friends and equals. He saw changelings composing music, painting landscapes, teasing out the core ideas of puzzling philosophical questions with their peers. Long gone was the oppressive, industrialist society of the Hives, where changelings worked with their nose to the grindstone in pursuit of the glory of the Hives, and the wicked whims of a singular queen lording over her subjects. It was a utopia, not the hellish nightmare that changeling society today represented. And not only that, but the changelings all had colorful pictures on their flanks, Cutie Marks, just like their pony companions... \n\n"It's... yeah, it's beautiful," Jachs said, struggling for words. He looked at his side and realized he'd picked up another foggy drink from somewhere, and when he looked back at Finicus, he noticed his friend had one as well. As one, they put the drinks to their lips and tilted their heads back."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6506.d:0 "Jachs woke up when he rolled off of his bed and banged his head against the nightstand. Cursing, he clutched at his throbbing head, before a wave of nausea left him curled up on the floor. It took a few minutes before it passed, and only then did he manage to gingerly rise to his hooves. His legs were shaking, and he leaned against the wall for support, but he eventually worked up the strength to get out of his bedroom.\n\nHe walked down the short hallway into the kitchen, where he saw two changelings: Finicus, rubbing his head while he sat at the kitchen table, and Alcippe, where she was preparing some meal on the stove. She turned around when she heard Jachs slump down into a chair at the table, her expressions moving through surprise, then to relief, then to anger. Frowning, Alcippe levitated a plate and silverware in front of Jachs, then dropped a scrambled egg on it. "Good morning, Generalmajor," she tersely greeted him. "Sleep well?"\n\n"No," Jachs grumbled, rubbing his head some more. He looked around and realized he didn't remember ever getting home last night. "How did I...?"\n\n"We found you and Finicus wandering the streets by yourselves early this morning," Alcippe said. "Somehow you slipped past the jaegers staking the place out. You're lucky we found you before any members of the resistance did! What were you thinking, taking that drink?!"\n\n"Hey, shush," Finicus growled, laying his head on the table. "Not so loud, please. My poor head..."\n\nWhile Alcippe glared at him, Jachs shook his head. "I'm sorry I made you worry, Alcippe," he apologized. "But you heard what I said. Getting the Society on our side will be a boon for us. I just did what I had to do to seal the deal."\n\nAlcippe sighed. "Alright, fine. But no more Love for you for a little while. Either of you. We don't know how potent that stuff is, or what it could do to you. The last thing we need is the Governor of Canterlot getting an addiction." She pulled off her apron and tossed it aside. "I need a drink if I'm going to have to play grubsitter. I'm surprised I didn't start day-drinking sooner..."\n\nShe walked off, leaving Finicus and Jachs alone at the table. The two looked at each other, remembering the experience they'd shared the previous night, and Finicus spoke up. "Jachs... those changelings we saw... did you see what they had on their flanks?"\n\n"Cutie Marks," Jachs said, frowning at his plate. "And they were living so harmoniously with ponies...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.7506.d:0 "Frowning, Jachs set the drink back down and shook his head. "I must decline," he said, standing up. He nodded to Gloriosa, who had adopted a sharp frown on her muzzle. "And now that I know that this Society is home to unicorn supremacists, I'm afraid I'm going to have to disband it. You are a threat to the Hegemony that I cannot afford to tolerate."\n\n"Is this the part where your goons burst through those doors and arrest us all?" Gloriosa sneered. A pistol appeared from under the table, catching Jachs by surprise. "They would not be able to get here fast enough to save your life."\n\nJachs shook his head. "Of course not. So I'm going to respond to your courtesy with my own. I will be leaving now, and come the dawn, I'll have my jaegers raid this place. I would suggest you be gone by then." He turned away and walked for the door, leaving Gloriosa snarling at him. "Good evening, Gloriosa."\n\nHe half expected her to shoot as he left, but no such shots came. Instead, he opened the door and slipped out, bypassing the parked car and heading for the staircase going up to the surface. In a few minutes he was outside, where his Jaegers flew down to meet him, and a staff car took him off to safety. Alcippe was inside, and a relieved smile appeared on her lips when he sat down next to her. "I was worried for you for a minute," she said. "I almost sent the Jaegers in early."\n\n"I'm glad you have such faith in me," Jachs lightly teased back. Then he sighed and closed his eyes, leaning back in his seat. "This is going to come back to bite us one way or another. Heighten security for the next few weeks, at least until the Queen's coronation. They'll probably try to strike then."\n\n"Why not just storm the place now?" Alcippe asked. "Why give them time to flee?"\n\n"Because they didn't kill me," Jachs said. "Consider it a sign of mutual respect. Besides, we'll have more success catching them on the move than storming a fortified drug den."\n\nAlcippe didn't seem convinced, but she nodded anyway. "If you say so, Jachs..."\n\nWhen the five companies of Jaegers arrived the next morning, the drug den was abandoned."

"Vaspier... I didn't see you," Jachs said, frowning and stepping away from the door. "To what do I owe the honor of your presence?"\n\n"A rote concern that I felt like personally checking up on," Vaspier said. He lifted a stack of papers off of Jachs' desk and waved them around like an oversized fan. "VOPS has been tracking a strangely high number of civilian posts being turned over to unicorns of middling status throughout Canterlot as of late," he said. "Most of them are from commissions bearing your signature. I just found it odd, that's all, and I wanted to hear your reasoning."\n\nJachs shrugged. "This is my city, Vaspier; when I was appointed governor, I thought that at least came with some level of autonomy without everyling close to the Queen questioning my actions. But if you really want to know, they're collaborationists, and returning some function of civilian life to this city by reopening museums and universities under the watchful eyes of ponies loyal to us will allow us to control the city better than we could with military force alone."\n\nVaspier thought for a moment, as if he was trying to pick apart Jachs' words for any weakness, before he shrugged and stood up. "If you say so, Generalmajor. I'll leave the policing of Canterlot to the expert. But I would caution you about these unicorns. VOPS believes they're connected to some cell of undesirables operating inside of the city. It would be dangerous to put them on the same pedestal of us changelings."\n\nThen he grinned.

changelings_paxchrysalia.507.d:0 "Jachs and Alcippe arrived at the party half an hour after it began, fashionably late as expected of them. Both were dressed to the nines in their finest dress uniforms, as befitting as two soldiers of the Heer were expected to be in a party for Canterlot high society — or what was left of it. Most of the nobles had fled Canterlot as the Heer advanced, but the lesser nobles and socialites that remained were more than willing to climb the now vacant ranks under the watchful eyes of their changeling occupiers. It seemed some ponies cared less about patriotism to their country and more about getting a better seat at the dinner table.\n\nThe spacious manor, claimed from an old noble family by some upstart socialite that Jachs couldn't bother to remember the name of, was filled with ponies and dotted with changelings. Jachs could tell at a glance that the party was filled with infiltrators disguised as the wealthiest and most attractive nobles, which the rest of the vapid and foolish guests fawned over, but he paid them no mind. He wanted to talk to one pony only, and that was the renowned cellist playing a soothing if somber melody in the mansion's ballroom.\n\nHe waited a respectful distance away for Octavia Melody to finish her performance, and only when she set aside her bow did he approach. "Lovely song, that," Jachs said as he approached. "I can see why you were renowned before the war."\n\n"And during it," Octavia said, avoiding meeting Jachs' gaze by turning aside to the small table that held a glass of water and a bite to eat. "And now that all the concert halls are closed, and I've been blacklisted by the new government because I helped with Equestria's propaganda effort, I have to play at small parties like this one just to get by. Thank you for that, by the way."\n\nJachs didn't let the thinly-veiled barb get to him; Octavia was just one of many ponies whose lives had been upended by the war. "A regrettable side effect of the nasty business we call war," Jachs said, trying to be sympathetic. "Which is why I'm here to talk to you. I've got a proposal that I think could benefit us both.""

"Her Majesty deserves the greatest musicians in all of Equus to be there for her coronation, where she takes the crowns of both the Hives and Equestria for herself. You were one of the best." Seeing the flat look on Octavia's face, Jachs frowned and shifted his weight. "You'd be amply compensated..."\n\n"No." Octavia scowled at the Generalmajor. "I will not play any music for you or your queen. My heart is with Equestria, not your blasted hives. And even if I wanted to, I know you don't want me because I'm the best. You want me because I am a symbol of what Equestria used to be like, and you want tie strings to my hooves and dance me in front of the world like your marionette. It's nothing more than a power play, and I value my beliefs more than I do my life. And I refuse to be a puppet dancing to another puppet's tune."\n\nWhile Jachs searched for a response, Alcippe bristled and stepped forward. "I'm afraid you don't have a choice here," she bluntly informed the mare. "And you will address the Generalmajor with more respect."\n\n"Oberstleutnant," Jachs cautioned his subaltern, shaking his head. Then he turned back to Octavia. "But she is right. This is non-negotiable. I am here to discuss compensation out of courtesy for services rendered. Do realise that others in my position would have forced you to play on a chain and not given you anything in return."\n\nIt took a few moments before Octavia responded. "Pay me whatever you want. That's not the compensation I want. I want two things. First, I want Sapphire Shores to be allowed to host a concert for the Equestrian POWs that I know you still have locked up in camps. She's become persona non grata like me, and the concert would benefit her as much as it would those POWs. Next..." She hesitated, as if she wasn't sure she should make the request or not. "Do not go through with the POW parade I know you're planning for Chrysalis' coronation. Have some mercy in your heart, if changelings even have one. Equestria is defeated and broken; how much longer are you going to rub our faces in the dirt?"\n\nThat took Jachs by surprise. "How did you even know about that? That was supposed to have been secret."\n\n"You'd be surprised what you hear at parties like this one," Octavia said. Then she picked up her bow and set it to her cello's strings, ready to start the next song. "Please, reconsider the parade. And help out Sapphire Shores.

Jachs and Alcippe watched from the balcony ringing the warden's office on the west side of the Canterhorn Prison, where the Canterhorn Mountain rose up sharply behind them. Extra guards had been posted around the walls of the prison, and a pair of soldiers leaned against a mounted machine gun overlooking the yard below them, a belt of brass ammunition loaded and ready to fire at a moment's notice.\n\nA crude wood and steel stage had been erected at one end of the yard, and the POWs had been assembled across from it. Many of the ponies were covered in scars and bruises from clashes with their guards, and some were thin, almost emaciated in their prison clothes. But as Sapphire and Octavia began a passionate and lively performance, some of that energy was taken up by the prisoners, and they had a reason to smile for the first time in months, if not years.\n\nWhen it was over, and the guards had gradually dispersed the prisoners back to their barracks, Jachs and Alcippe went down to see Octavia. The cellist had just finished giving Sapphire Shores a hearty hug, and when she turned to Jachs, she couldn't entirely remove the smile from her face. "Thank you for this opportunity, Generalmajor," she said. "It meant a lot to those prisoners to have this concert. Maybe you're not so bad... for a changeling."\n\nJachs had a little chuckle at his expense. "I've been hearing that a lot lately, though I'm not sure how much I believe it. Perhaps there's some truth in there."\n\n"Perhaps," Octavia admitted. Then she looked Jachs up and down. "I hope you're not trying to butter me up, Generalmajor. I'm married to my music, you know."\n\nAlcippe rolled her eyes and placed herself between Jachs and Octavia. "You know, we're not always after love — or Love. The Generalmajor is merely a changeling who wants to do right by us all, ponies and changelings each."\n\n"It was a joke," Octavia said, backing off slightly. Then she bowed her head. "I hope today has opened your eyes some, Generalmajor. Think about what I asked you before, about the parade. If you're really trying to do the right thing..."\n\nThe second part of that sentence didn't need saying."

Rather it was the purpose of the soirée that bothered him: a party to celebrate the impending destruction of Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, attended by everyling who was anyling, alongside pony collaborators looking to make a good impression on their masters. If Second Wind had a choice, he wouldn't have been here, but as Kommandant of the Canterlot Guard, it was his duty to be present.\n\nThe party was barely tolerable, until a changeling general came over to greet him. "Kommandant," the general said, a disgusting grin on her fanged muzzle. "A pleasure to see you here. It's always great to see sensible ponies making the most of their new lot in life."\n\nSecond Wind at least had enough professionalism to greet the general properly. "General Actia," he said, quickly pulling the changeling's name from his memory. "It's a pleasure to see you as well, ma'am. I hope you have been well."\n\n"Better than ever," General Actia said with a laugh. "Though I certainly long for the excitement of the war. Peace is a droll affair. Say, do you think we ever crossed paths on the battlefield?"\n\nShe chuckled and waved over a pony without waiting for Second Wind's response. "Do you happen to know Windbreak? She was a soldier in the war, too. I think she was part of your Royal Guard."\n\nSecond Wind blinked in surprise as he locked eyes with Windbreak. The mare had fought alongside him in the war, but had been captured during the evacuation from Bales. He'd thought she was dead... "We... crossed paths," Second Wind said, nodding to the other pegasus, who bowed her head. "I'm glad to see she's doing well."\n\n"Doing better than ever, now that I took her under my wing as my personal servant." General Actia draped a gossamer wing over Windbreak's back, and Second Wind saw the mare suppress a shudder. Then the general tipped her hat to him. "Anyhow, I must be off. Keep on doing the good work.

Second Wind and the Canterlot Guard had been brought down shortly after to keep the curious crowd from getting too close, and his soldiers formed a semicircle around Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns as the changelings gutted the building of all of its valuables. The bugs brought out cart after cart of scientific equipment, research papers, and magical oddities, all packed into cardboard boxes and loaded into the waiting trucks. One by one, the trucks departed, carrying all of the stolen goods from the school, and when there was nothing left of critical importance to take, the Queen's Guard descended on the building and stripped out anything not bolted down. Every bit of gilding that could be scraped from the walls was tossed in a wheelbarrow, and soon the once magnificent building looked like nothing more than a dilapidated wreck.\n\nThat was when the flamethrowers came out.\n\nSecond Wind gritted his teeth as his soldiers did their best to hold back the furious and dismayed crowd as the soldiers of the Queen's Guard torched the building, inside and out. Brilliant orange fires leapt into the sky, and the windows coughed up acrid black ash that fouled the sky like a cloud of poison. And then, with the cracking of a support column and the crumbling of ages-old masonry, the school collapsed in on itself, flinging embers and debris into the sky, like a soul leaving a corpse on its way to the afterlife.\n\nThe crowd ceased fighting, and Second Wind could see the horror in their eyes. Somepony in the back began to cry, her sobs a sharp contrast with the cheers and laughter of the changelings as they spat on the ashes of the fallen building.

changelings_paxchrysalia.512.d:0 "Oberstleutnant Alcippe stood in the magnificent throne room of the Canterlot Palace as the pegasus and unicorn laborers worked hard to place the decorations for Queen Chrysalis' coming coronation. The past few days had been a whirlwind of activity, and the next few were likely to be the same as the final preparations were made for the Queen's arrival. She held a checklist by her side in her magic and scratched off another box with her pen as the ponies finalized the decorations. That was the easy part done, at least. Hopefully everything else would fall into place soon.\n\nShe looked through the list as she turned away and began to walk back to her office. She'd made sure to send out the invitations to the remainder of Canterlot's nobility, as well as some of the socialites and collaborators that had been instrumental in keeping the peace in the city. Security had been organized, with every single building along the parade route checked by the Heer in case any were harboring resistance agents or ponies sympathetic to the partisans' cause. A cadre of bodyguards had been assigned to protect the Queen during the parade, chosen from the most capable of the collaborators and defectors to emphasize how much the Queen was beloved by Equestria. And to top things off, Second Wind and his Canterlot Guard would be the honor guard for the occasion.\n\nShe tucked the checklist back into her pockets and hummed to herself as she went along. Everything was going smoothly. It was time for the changelings to finally claim vengeance for the Canterlot Defeat of 1002. That day had hardly been perfect, but this one would be.\n\nShe was sure of it. "

changelings_paxchrysalia.513.t:0 "One Last Humiliation?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.513.d:0 ""After the Queen's procession through the city, she will take to the podium here at the Royal Palace, where she will watch the rest of the parade," Generalmajor Jachs said, tracing the parade path with his hoof. The other generals of the Heer's High Command, along with ranking officials from the Queen's Guard, watched with rapt attention. "First we'll start with regiments of the Queen's Guard, who will end their march by filling out the plaza around our queen. Once the image of her stalwart protection is assembled, then we'll proceed with the Jaegers from the Heer, and the accompanying armor regiments. Then, Hivesmarschall Trimmel will give a speech, and Chrysalis will be crowned Empress Regnant of Canterlot and Equestria, and give her own speech. Cue fanfare from Octavia Melody, cheering, a thunderous flyover, and that's a wrap. Any questions?"\n\nThe changeling generals shook their heads and murmured their agreements — save one. "What about the POWs, Generalmajor?" Dieter Heinrich asked. "You know Her Majesty would love to see those filthy wretches squirm in their chains before her. It would be the icing on the cake."\n\nJachs frowned. "The POWs would go before the tanks," he said. "The imagery of the defeated being driven before our metal monsters that broke Equestria would be sufficient to please the Queen, I hope."\n\n"Certainly," Dieter agreed with a smug smile. "And it'll give the rest of us something to feel proud of as well. I can't wait to see it done."\n\nThe changelings broke soon after that, the officers going their separate ways to prepare for the upcoming coronation, leaving Jachs behind with the parade plans. He frowned at his notes as he thought about the POW march. Octavia had begged him to call it off... but could he still do that? Could he still make that change last minute? But perhaps the better question was... should he?\n\nThe Pax Chrysalia had been nothing short of humiliation and atrocity for the ponies of Equestria. The changeling boot had never been so heavy or so firm on their necks as of late. Marching the once-proud Equestrian soldiers through Canterlot as emaciated prisoners of war would be the final insult to a defeated populace.\n\nCould the Pax Chrysalia survive one last insult from the changeling occupiers?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.513.a:0 "The parade must be called off."
changelings_paxchrysalia.513.b:0 "One final insult should get the ponies to realize their place once and for all."

changelings_paxchrysalia.514.t:0 "A Missing Piece"
changelings_paxchrysalia.514.d:0 "Oberstleutnant Alcippe reviewed the parade order as the soldiers got set to march through Canterlot before their queen. Everybody had checked in so far, from the zealots of the Queen's Guard to the pony collaborationists of the Canterlot Guard, save for one key entry. Alcippe frowned when she realized that Second Wind hadn't checked in for command of his division, and it wasn't like the Canterlot Guard could march without their commanding officer. Perhaps something had come up that was keeping him? It would be wise to go check.\n\nAlcippe passed off the checklist to a Leutnant and snatched a small portable radio to take with her. "Make sure the parade begins on time," she ordered the Leutnant as she set off. "Nothing gets off schedule." Then, confident that her oversight wouldn't be missed, she set off through the barracks, looking for Second Wind.\n\nShe looked high and low, but the pegasus was nowhere to be found. He wasn't at his quarters or in his office, and she didn't see him in the yard within the compound or in the skies above. Frowning, Alcippe was about to return to the staging area when she noticed the heavy door to the prison block was slightly ajar. Curious, the changeling dragged the door open and slipped inside. "Kommandant?" she asked, hearing some noise from up ahead. "Are you there?"\n\nShe rounded a corner and came to a stop. There in front of her were two ponies, Second Wind and a mare by the name of Bluebelle arrested a few days ago for plotting with the resistance. Second Wind had what looked like a bomb jacket around his chest, and the Bluebelle had just finished fixing it onto him. All three looked at each other in shock before the room burst into a flurry of frenzied activity.\n\nBluebelle reached for her gun, lying on the table behind her, and Alcippe drew her own and fired off several quick shots before she could react. The bullets killed the partisan instantly, but in that split second, Second Wind dove through a nearby window, disappearing out into the open sky. Alcippe cursed, knowing she could never catch the pegasus on wing, and reached for her radio."

changelings_paxchrysalia.515.d:0 "The parade was about to start, but Jachs still had enough time for a quick lunch. Knowing that marching on an empty stomach and then reviewing the troops for hours wasn't exactly the smartest idea, the Generalmajor took a much needed lunch break as his calm before the storm moment to prepare himself for the march to come. But even that wasn't spared the demands of responsibility, as a pair of soldiers hurriedly rushed into his office after a perfunctory-sounding knock on the door.\n\n"The Queen herself better be in danger or something," Jachs grumbled, setting his sandwich aside. "What is it?"\n\n"A pony turned herself in, claiming that she had something urgent she needed to talk to you about," one of the guards said. "She claims that she is, or was, a member of the resistance... It's Octavia Melody, sir."\n\nThe name struck Jachs like a slap to the face. "Octavia?" he asked, incredulous. Then he stood up, his lunch forgotten. "Take me to her. Now."\n\nMinutes later, he entered an interrogation room, where Octavia was seated at the bare table. She looked disheveled, and much the worse for wear. He didn't even wait for the door to shut behind him before he started asking questions. "Right now, I don't care if you're part of the resistance or not. What did you need to tell me."\n\nOctavia looked at Jachs and nodded. "A splinter cell of the resistance in Canterlot wants to assassinate Queen Chrysalis," the mare said. "Despite the wishes of the rest of the resistance, the radicals are moving forward with a plot to bomb her during the parade. Your own Canterlot Guard captain is going to deliver the bomb himself."\n\nJachs blinked in shock. "Second Wind? You... how do you know this? And why tell me?"\n\n"That's none of your business," Octavia said, shaking her head. "What is important is that the status quo in Canterlot is tolerable for ponies, thanks in large part to your efforts, but blowing up the changeling queen will do nothing but make things worse. Forget reprisals; if the Queen's Guard gets to avenge their queen, nothing short of genocide will come to Canterlot." She leaned across the table. "Do whatever you want with me, but you have to stop it, for all of our sakes."\n\nJachs stomped his hoof and cursed. "I'll take care of it," he said, sharply turning about and heading for the door. "And you, get back out there and get ready to play, like we agreed on!""
changelings_paxchrysalia.515.a:0 "We're losing precious time!"

changelings_paxchrysalia.516.t:0 "The Stage of Apocalypse"
changelings_paxchrysalia.516.d:0 "Jachs had teams of Jaegers fanning across Canterlot in minutes, searching desperately for the runaway Second Wind and the bomb meant for the Queen. Jachs himself had taken wind, abandoning the early stages of the procession. He would have stopped the parade entirely, but Queen Chrysalis had already set out in her motorcade, and he didn't think she'd stop even if he told her what was about to happen. All that would accomplish would be a waste of precious time, so now his only hope was to find Second Wind before it was too late.\n\nAs luck would have it, Jachs spotted a figure flitting into the top of a nearby bell tower out of the corner of his eye, and he immediately changed course. He swooped into the top of the tower and drew his sidearm in the same motion, aligning the pegasus in his sights. "Second Wind!" Jachs shouted, making the pegasus jump and turn around. The two soldiers locked eyes in their standoff, on opposite ends of the tower, with only a large brass bell hanging above to separate them. "Don't do this," Jachs urged him. "Whatever you think you're trying to accomplish, you're not going to succeed."\n\nSecond Wind visibly shook as he offered a retort. "The changelings have had their boot on the neck of ponykind for too long!" he shouted back, rage and agony filling his voice. "You marched in and took everything from us, and when that wasn't enough, you turned us to slaves! Windbreak, a mare I knew from the Royal Guard and a hero in her own right, is some bug general's personal slave for her to play with as she pleases! Your vicious queen's selfish conquest and disdain for my entire species has brought misery to Equestria like never before!"\n\nHe touched his hoof to the bomb vest securely fastened around his body. "I'm going to stop it," he shouted, his voice cracking with anguish. "I don't care what happens to me, but she needs to die. She needs to die if Equestria is to live."

changelings_paxchrysalia.517.d:0 "Jachs risked a step further, and when Second Wind didn't flinch back, he took another, then another. He'd closed half the space between them before he thought of what to say. "You will only make things worse for ponies in Equestria, Second Wind," Jachs said. "Queen Chrysalis is too self-absorbed to ever look at what's happening beneath her in the chain of command. She has cruel whims and flights of fancy, but show her something else to distract her from it, and she can be dissuaded out of those ideas." He gestured to the street below, where the procession was approaching the bell tower. "Remember when I told you to make the best of what we have? To work within the system we have and try to make what small changes we can? I used my authority as governor to cancel the POW parade. It would be nothing short of humiliating and degrading for ponies across all of Equestria, I know. So I used the authority I have as governor of Canterlot to put an end to it. I didn't go protesting to the Queen that this would violate pony rights or cause more trouble than it was worth. I'll catch flak from it when this is all said and done. But I had the right and the means to make a difference using my station. Not every change has to come through violent revolution."\n\nHe took a few steps closer, and placed his hoof on Second Wind's shoulder. "Killing Chrysalis will lead to nothing short of cruel and harsh reprisals from the Queen's Guard. They will not be so easily distracted, and they will put every waking moment toward exacting vengeance upon ponykind. We can't let that happen; Chrysalis has to live. And together, we can use our postings to keep the worst of her impulses away from hurting your kind."\n\nTears streamed down Second Wind's face, and finally, after what felt like an eternity, he hung his head. "You're right," he whimpered. "I'm just so... so angry... the world shouldn't be this cruel."\n\n"It shouldn't," Jachs agreed. "And we can do our parts to make it less so. Now come on. Let's get this thing off of you and get you back into the parade. If we're quick, it will be like nothing happened.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.518.d:0 "It took until Jachs found himself standing behind Chrysalis at the podium in front of the Royal Palace for his heart to finally stop racing. He didn't know if he'd be able to stop Second Wind at the belltower, but he was glad that the pegasus finally saw reason. And when Second Wind led the Canterlot Guard in procession in front of Queen Chrysalis, it was impossible to tell that the stallion had a bomb meant for the Queen strapped to himself just minutes before.\n\nThe rest of the parade was a blur to the worn-out changeling. Soldiers marched, tanks rolled, and planes roared overhead as the changeling high command each took their turns giving speeches. Jachs, as Governor of Canterlot, had to give his own speech, and when the time came, he stepped up to the podium and pulled out a couple of folded note cards from inside of his jacket. Then, clearing his voice, he spoke to the assembled changelings and ponies, his voice booming around the plaza.\n\n"Citizens of Canterlot, soldiers of the Heer, and everybody else that has honored us with their presence here today," he began, eyes scanning the crowd. "It has been a difficult journey to get to where we stand today. We have had to make hard choices. We have had to make risky choices. We fought hard to conquer Equestria, and we fought even harder to keep it. But we have. Today, our Great Queen shall be given her rightful crown, and a Queen shall become an Empress. But today would not be possible without the hard work of everybody, pony and changeling alike, that have come together to make the Pax Chrysalia a lasting peace. We may still have much work to do, and we may still be faced with threats both inside and out, but there is one thing that I know for certain: that we have overcome our darkest times, pony and changeling alike, and now, together, we can work to make brighter times in the days ahead."\n\nThen he turned to face Queen Chrysalis and deeply bowed. "All hail Empress Chrysalis, the true keeper of the Pax Chrysalia!"\n\nThunderous applause greeted Chrysalis, and Jachs stepped aside to let the Queen be granted her new crown. And as the Queen lifted it off its satin pillow in her magic, all the world knew that the defeat of 1002 had finally, finally been avenged."

The adrenaline rush of his last-minute confrontation with Second Wind before the parade had long since left him, and being present for everything Empress Chrysalis wanted in the hours that followed had left him drained. He wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep, but the full moon was out over a cloudless night, and he felt compelled to spend a few moments admiring the sleepy city before retiring for the night.\n\nHe wasn't the only one, he realized, as he stepped out onto the balcony. Alcippe, Marsilio, and Finicus were there, talking quietly as they admired the night sky, but what surprised Jachs was that Second Wind was there as well. Their chatter stopped when they heard the door open, though smiles greeted him when he shut the door behind him. "Enjoying the night?" he asked the three changelings (and one pegasus).\n\n"It's nice to have some peace and quiet," Alcippe said, and then she glanced aside at Second Wind, who lowered his head. "And we were just talking with Second Wind. He told us about what happened."\n\n"It's in the past, now," Marsilio said. "And what happened doesn't need to leave this balcony. It's for everyone's best interests."\n\n"Though blowing up Chrysalis would have been pretty funny," Finicus said with a snicker. But then he shook his head. "I'm just kidding. It's good that everything worked out the way it did. It's the best outcome for all of us."\n\nJachs nodded as he took a seat at the edge of the group. "It's been a long journey to get here, but I'm happy it's finished with," he said, leaning back against the wall and looking up at the stars above. "Somehow, we did it, and that's all any of us could ask for. And so long as we keep doing our best, then we can make things a little better, step by step."\n\n"It's all any of us can hope for," Second Wind said. "Maybe one day, ponies and changelings will be equals."\n\n"One day," Jachs said. "I'm sure of it. So long as we all work to make it so.""

Those interests can be diverted and distracted to prevent real harm from coming to ponykind. All it takes is the right creatures doing the right things at the right time..."\n\nBut Second Wind only gestured to the roads below, where the parade of pony POWs had started. "You call this doing the right thing at the right time?" he spat at Jachs. "Those are my comrades, my brothers and sisters in arms, paraded before your whole despicable army like livestock, humiliated and broken! There isn't any justice in this!

Then, wings spread, Second Wind dived out of the tower, speeding toward the parade below.\n\nJachs scrambled to his hooves and managed to jump out of the tower after the speeding pegasus, but he had no hope to catch up with him. Instead, he could only shout a warning to the soldiers on the ground, and thankfully, he managed to turn a few heads before Second Wind could reach his target.

Thanks to her arrangement with Generalmajor Jachs, she'd been able to take the Cornucopia Society from an underground drug den to a reputable establishment where unicorns and changelings alike could escape from the stresses of the day. Bits traded hooves for exotic Love elixirs, and the wealthy paid extra for private rooms and personal attendants while they submerged themselves in bliss for a few hours. All of it served to make the Society stronger, and Gloriosa herself ever more powerful.\n\nShe sipped on her own cocktail, the sweet aftertaste of Love lingering on the back of her tongue. Her arrangement with the changelings had let her put trusted unicorns in many civilian positions throughout the city. She'd even started placing unicorns in the lower echelons of the occupying garrison, and she had no doubt that the money and product she could move would see them rise in due time. Thanks to her efforts, paired with the resources of the Society, unicorns were finally reaching their rightful place at the top of the pony pyramid. Canterlot would be a shining beacon of unicorn supremacy, and soon, she'd extend her efforts to the neighboring provinces and states. Anything was possible with the Society's resources and the partnership with the changelings. Maybe one day, she wouldn't even need to work with the changelings anymore. Maybe soon the unicorns would climb up the next step and put the changelings beneath their hooves, as was only right. Unicorns deserved to rule all, after all. Sharing power was but a short-term alliance.\n\nShe took another sip and set her drink aside. One day, she'd get her wish. She was sure of it.

She was out of ammunition anyway; clutching onto it wouldn't help her at all.\n\nShe galloped through the night, trying to put as much distance between herself and the den the jaegers had just raided. She knew Generalmajor Jachs would come for her eventually; she just hoped that fool, Second Wind, would have blown up the changeling queen before then. The chaos would have given the Society the opening it needed to seize control of Canterlot, but with the Queen's survival, all of her hopes had been dashed. And as the changelings gunned down the last of her collaborators in her new makeshift den, she knew that the Society was finished.\n\nShe finally stopped many miles away by the river that flowed past Canterlot. Her limbs were shaking from exhaustion, but she'd managed to flee her pursuers. But she knew they wouldn't stop looking for her. So long as she lived, she was a threat to the Hegemony. She'd have to try to flee the country if she could, or at the very least, go into hiding in some no name town, and wait for her time to come again.\n\nShe pried her mask off and held it in front of her. Not a pony nor a changeling knew what she looked like under the mask; Gloriosa was the mask, not the mare. In this case, her true self would be her greatest disguise. So, taking a deep breath, the mare flung the mask as far into the river as she could. Maybe the bugs would find it and think she was dead.

I'm having regrets."\n\n"Regrets?" Second Wind invited Parsnip to sit down across from him, and the private accepted the invitation. He looked her anxious face over and slowly nodded. "Ah. I see. You don't think you're doing the right thing, being in the Canterlot Guard, do you?" When she slowly shook her head, Second Wind pushed aside his papers and laid his hooves on the desk. "You may speak freely, Private. Whatever you say will not leave this room. You have my word."\n\nFinally, Parsnip took a deep breath and hung her head. "It just doesn't feel right, serving in the Guard," she said. "I feel like the bad mare. I should be helping these ponies, right? I shouldn't be trying to crush them down and helping to keep our country oppressed. The changelings conquered us, and here I am licking their boots just so I can get exempt from the Love tax and provide better for my family. What is wrong with me?"\n\n"Nothing," Second Wind assured her. "You're doing what you have to do. And look at it this way, Private." He stood up and gestured at the map of Canterlot hanging on the wall by their side. "Who would you rather be patrolling the streets of Canterlot: us, or bug soldiers fresh in from Vesalipolis? Who's likely to treat ponies fairly and with respect: us, or bug soldiers fresh in from Vesalipolis? Who's likely to make a difference under their watch: us, or...?"\n\n"...Bug soldiers from Vesalipolis," Parsnip said, finishing Second Wind's sentence. "I... I think I understand what you mean. Things can be better under us than under the bugs." She even managed a small smile. "Thank you, Kommandant. I guess I really needed to hear that."\n\nSecond Wind nodded. "Anytime, Private. And if any of your companions are having similar thoughts, tell them to come to me. Us ponies have to stick together, you know?""

She was filled with questions that needed answers, but those answers were hard to pin down.\n\nThankfully, she spotted Jachs coming out onto the balcony for his evening drink, as he usually did, and she went over to him. "Alcippe," Jachs said, accompanying the informal greeting with a slight nod. "How are you holding up?"\n\n"To be honest? Pretty poorly," Alcippe admitted. "I've been doing a lot of thinking ever since Second Wind's... you know." She sighed. "What we're doing... I don't think it's right."\n\nJachs raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"\n\n"Everything," Alcippe sighed in frustration. "A lot of what we've been doing is just... wrong! And Second Wind trying to assassinate the Queen really made me open my eyes. To the ponies, we're the villains of this story, Jachs. And in spite of all that we've done to keep the Queen's Guard in line..." She swallowed. "It seems pretty clear to me that we're a part of the problem as much as they are. How are we supposed to live with that?""

"I understand where you're coming from, Alcippe," he said at last, setting his drink aside and turning to face her. "And I've had my fair share of those thoughts ever since the end of the war. I think it all comes down to..." Jachs paused, searching for the right words. "I suppose it depends on what you feel is the most meaningful way you want to go about effecting change. I could resign my commission right now and go join the Thoraxians — or, well, what's left of them. But the higher ups would just promote another officer to take my place, and looking at the way the Queen's Guard has been snatching up all the leadership positions with any real power... Well, suffice to say that it's unlikely my successor will share my inclination towards sensible policy-making. From a rational point of view, the best thing I could do for the ponies right now would be to stick it out in the Heer, and make sure that the worst impulses of our colleagues remain in check."\n\n"But that's not how morality works," Alcippe said, shaking her head. "Just because we're being easier on POWs doesn't mean that we aren't responsible for their suffering in the first place. The little acts of kindness and mercy don't outweigh the bad that we've done."\n\n"And you're right," Jachs agreed. "We have benefited greatly from an unjust status quo. And in enforcing the Pax Chrysalia, we are complicit in upholding that status quo. But big changes can be brought about by small steps. Our actions today will inform those carried out by the officers of tomorrow, and they will learn from our example. And the generation after that will learn from them. Little by little, we're making a difference in the best way we possibly can. But change can't happen immediately, and it can't be done by one changeling alone. Do you understand what I'm saying?"\n\n"I... I think," Alcippe said, hesitantly nodding.\n\n"Good," Jachs said, and he patted her on the back. "It's not immediately gratifying, I know. And it's not easy to live with all these burdens on our conscience. But if we work together... well, maybe one day, future generations will judge us by all the good we've done, alongside the bad.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.528.d:0 "For once, the hectic responsibilities of being both a Generalmajor in the Royal Heer and the governor of Canterlot and central Equestria had given Jachs a break, and the stars had aligned to give him a free weekend off. For once, Equestria wasn't on the verge of total revolt, and that allowed Jachs and his staff a chance to breathe. So, thinking to do something fun and relaxing, he invited Alcippe over to his residence to watch some old Equestrian films from before the war.\n\nAlcippe arrived shortly after eight in the evening, in a plain and reserved dress that made her look like just another changeling going about her day. Jachs smiled as he welcomed her inside, and he took the offered bottle of wine in his magic and popped the cork. Then, pouring two glasses, he followed Alcippe into his living room, where he already had his personal projector set up and loaded with film. Alcippe sat down on one end of the couch, looking at the stack of films set next to the projector. "How much digging did you have to do to find contraband like this?" she asked as Jachs started up the projector.\n\n"Less than you'd think, but more than you'd hope," Jachs said with a coy smile. "But I know a few ponies who were willing to help me out."\n\n"And how much trouble would we get in if VOPS found out?" Alcippe asked, a mischievous twinkle in her eye.\n\n"Plenty," Jachs said. "But I bet Vaspier watches the same films in his free time, so we'll be fine."\n\nAlcippe giggled, and soon the speakers began to play the opening music of the film. Taking a sip of wine, Alcippe slid across the couch until she was by Jachs' side, leaning her weight against his shoulder. Jachs responded by draping his wing over her back, and wrapping them up in a nearby blanket. The two changelings smiled, rubbed noses, and happily turned their attention back to the screen, happy to finally have some time together that wasn't consumed by the weight of their responsibilities."

What's the big deal about that?"\n\n"Why, Mister Vesali... they're ponies," the board member protested. "The only thing they're good for is manual labor, and even then they're not very good at that. It's a miracle their kind has lasted this long, truth be told."\n\n"It's a miracle you're still on this board, you freakin' idiot," Finicus growled. Then he stood up and put his hooves on the table. "What sort of crap have you been huffing? Have you seriously been lapping up the garbage the Empress and her cronies feed you? If ponies were so bad at, well, everything, as you seem to believe, then the war wouldn't have lasted as long as it did or been so costly. Truth is, the ponies are good at a lot of things. And the ponies that have gears and machines on their butts? They're better than the average drone at almost anything you could throw at them in this factory. Why wouldn't we want to hire them?"\n\n"But... sir..."\n\n"Go," Finicus said, glaring at the changeling and pointing to the door. "You're not welcome in this company anymore. And if my rank as CEO and president doesn't get you to step down, I'll ask Generalmajor Jachs or maybe the Empress herself to deal with you. I've got a lot of influence now, so I'd watch it if I were you." Sighing he looked at the rest of the board. "Well, if a pony's merits don't sell you on this idea, think of it this way. We can be the first to get qualified pony technicians into our factories. Do you understand the marketing appeal of that? Do you understand how much more efficient our workforce could be with a few well-placed pony technicians working for us? You thought the money we made during the war was a lot? Well, you have no idea what you're in for when we outcompete our competitors and get a monopoly on industrial production! So come on, sounds like a good deal, eh?""

The past few weeks, he'd shifted his office headquarters from Seaddle to Canterlot, where Jachs' jurisdiction shielded his work from the worst of the Queen's Guard's and VOPS' curious eyes. Now, he and his longtime friend and partner, Dr. Spectrograph, had busied themselves with the newest question that could change the world: how to create artificial Love that was just as potent as the real thing. "I'm glad to hear that," Marsilio said, ripping the report out of the machine once the printing was finished. He held it up and frowned at it. "Huh... take a look at this."\n\nDr. Spectrograph removed the wires taped to his body and hopped off the table, walking around to where Marsilio stood. His eyes glided over the lines and numbers, and then he whistled. "Thirty-seven percent comparable? That's more than double what we had a week ago! At this rate, we should have an acceptable substitute in a few more months!"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't go quite that far," Marsilio said. "We'll likely plateau out at some point when we hit a snag. But yes, it is promising. If our artificial Love has a third of the potency of real Love, then we're really getting somewhere."\n\nDr. Spectrograph shook his head in amazement. "It's amazing to think their may be a day soon in the future where changelings won't have to forcibly take Love from us ponies. Who knows what sorts of cooperation could happen then when that day comes?"\n\n"I can't imagine," Marsilio said, but he turned and smirked at Spectrograph.

For many, it was their first time in Canterlot, and for all of them, it would be their first lecture from a senior officer. For Alcippe, it was her first time giving such a lecture. She'd petitioned Jachs to reorganize the curriculum in the officer schools, and somehow, the Generalmajor had found the right strings to pull to make it happen. Now, any would-be officers that were set to receive assignments somewhere in Equestria or Olenia would go through schooling at Canterlot, not Vesalipolis, and that would let Alcippe impart what she wanted to on them.\n\nThe clock in the academy buzzed at the top of the hour, and Alcippe straightened her posture and cleared her throat. "Good morning, cadets. Welcome to your first lesson of officer schooling. My name is Oberstleutnant Alcippe, and I report directly to Generalmajor Jachs himself. And today, we will be teaching you about something that you absolutely must keep in your mind at all times if you are to be an officer in the Heer: respect."\n\nShe advanced the slide projected against the wall, revealing a series of pictures: one of Empress Chrysalis at the top, another of Generalmajor Jachs on the left, and a third featuring a unicorn, an earth pony, and a pegasus standing side by side by side. "Respect is what the officer's corps is built upon. First and foremost, respect to our Empress, for she is the one who brought the hives to glory. Second, respect to your superiors, for the chain of command must always be upheld. And lastly, respect to the ponies of Equestria. This was their country not too long ago, and most are still resentful about our occupation. They have a right to be resentful; I would be too if things were the other way around."\n\nShe looked out into the crowd, making note of which faces were paying the most attention; she knew those cadets would be the ones she could count on in the future. "We are conquerors. But that doesn't mean we need to be oppressors. For the Pax Chrysalia to be upheld, we must be respectful to our subjects. We must respect their rights. We must respect their concerns. And we must respect their culture. Because if we don't, then we are not the righteous changelings we believe ourselves to be. We are nothing more than criminals.

changelings_paxchrysalia.532.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs applied his signature to the last form on his desk and dropped it into his outgoing mail to be sorted and sent that evening. It'd been a busy day in Canterlot, a busy day full of new and exciting changes for the future. Piece by piece, bit by bit, Jachs used his authority as governor of the Canterlot Commissariat to push through reforms that would make life just a little more tolerable for the ponies living under the changeling boot. And with the recent round of reforms, he felt he was making good progress. When he had first come to Canterlot, ponies cried out in dismay under the brutal oppression they found themselves suffering under. Now, the boot had come off of their necks, and in its place, a helpful hoof had been extended to guide them into the future.\n\nThere was one last item on his desk, however. It was a parcel, concealed under the stack of missives to be drafted and signed, and Jachs pulled it over with a curious quirk of his brow. Unwrapping the parcel, he found a book wrapped in a plain brown dust jacket, and nothing else. Opening the cover, his eyes immediately set on a hoofwritten note from Second Wind, scrawled across the corner of the page:\n\n"Jachs, you've done so much for the ponies of Canterlot. You've done so much for me. Some might even call it friendship. Take a look at this book and tell me if you agree.\n-Second Wind"\n\nJachs turned the page, and he gasped at the title. "Twilight Sparkle's Journal of Friendship?" he murmured to himself. That was impossible; all the surviving copies of the journal had been the first thing thrown into the fires as the changelings settled into their occupation of Equestria. To have a surviving copy in his hooves...\n\nJachs closed the book and shivered. In his hooves was the most illegal book in all of the Hegemony. Surely, he'd be executed if VOPS found out he had this. It would be safer to destroy it.\n\nBut then again...\n\nSmiling, Jachs opened a locked drawer on his desk and slipped it inside with the rest of his keepsakes, gathered over years of service to the Heer and the Canterlot Commissariat. Getting rid of such a powerful book would be foolish. And maybe, just maybe, one day he'd be able to openly read it and discuss it with his friends."

Talk instead turned to what was going on in everyling's personal lives, and how they were making the best of their opportunities in the Pax Chrysalia to enjoy themselves in their downtime. It made for an easygoing, relaxed dinner, and when dinner was finished, the four changelings took their drinks outside and sat on Jachs' porch overlooking his spacious backyard.\n\nFrom there, socially lubricated by alcohol as they all were, talk continued to less-remembered topics, and Finicus, of course, was the one who brought it up. "Hey, Jachs, remember that time we got high as kites in Gloriosa's drug den?" he asked. "That was something else, wasn't it?"\n\nJachs sighed and leaned back in his chair, his hoof rubbing his temple. "I remember the awful hangover the next day, that's for sure.

Word is that the armaments procurement branch of Mayfly Electronics is trying to create magitech exoskeletons that could let one of our jaegers go toe to toe with a griffon knight. I also know that the university in Soryth plans on using genetic engineering and psychological conditioning to raise a generation of designer grubs. But I've got something even better in mind: Cutie Marks."\n\nAlcippe snorted and shook her head. "I think you're doing too much hard Love," she said. "That's just crazy. Having a cutie mark isn't going to turn a changeling into a super soldier."\n\n"Isn't it?" Finicus turned to Second Wind, who'd been quiet until now. "What do you think, Second? You're the only one here with a picture on your butt. I'd say you're the most qualified one to speak on this matter."\n\n"Well, I'm not sure about changelings with cutie marks, but the best soldiers and generals in the Equestrian army had very relevant cutie marks to their positions on the battlefield," the pegasus said. "You could train a townspony with a stack of bricks as their cutie mark to shoot well at fifty yards, but they're never going to shoot as well as somepony with a bullet and crosshairs on their flanks. Even our generals could be almost unstoppable if they had the right mark for the job."\n\n"Like General Spearhead," Jachs said, and both he and Alcippe groaned and shook their heads. "It's a good thing for the Hives that Spearhead didn't get a command until near the end of the war. She had a knack for using concentrated armor spearheads to pierce our lines and constantly threaten our flanks. The tank duel between her and Trimmel outside of Las Pegasus is the stuff of legends, and we only bested her when she lost her supply lines and couldn't get fuel to her tanks and trucks."\n\n"Sounds like nominative determinism to me," Marsilio agreed.

We need plenty of funding and assistance to get this project going, but I bet we can make it work. Besides, the ramifications of it succeeding are huge! Think of all the things that ponies are capable of but changelings aren't, just because we don't have cutie marks. Think of what it would mean if we managed to find the missing piece that would allow the changeling race to reach its full potential! Perhaps then we wouldn't have to be," and Finicus lowered his voice to a stage whisper, "the parasites that Queen Chrysalis is so keen on saying we're not."\n\n"Missing piece?" Second Wind asked. "What do you mean by that? You think cutie marks are some sort of missing piece for changelings?"\n\n"I don't know if any of you feel the same way," Finicus said, glancing at the other changelings in the room, "But I've always wondered what life would be like if I had a cutie mark like ponies do. Probably it would be a whole lot more meaningful, knowing what you're meant to do with your life. Not that being the CEO of Main Hives is even remotely a bad place in life to be, but..."\n\n"After we met Twilight in the mines," Marsilio said, "She got me thinking a lot about destiny and individuality. Ponies have it, and their marks are a huge part of that. And I've always wondered what would happen if we gave changelings cutie marks. Could we engineer individuality into the changeling species? Change our destiny? Who knows what we could accomplish if cutie marks are truly as life changing as ponykind believes them to be?"\n\nSecond Wind was taken aback by that, though one thing in particular stuck out. "Twilight? As in, Twilight Sparkle? She's in the mines beneath Canterlot?"\n\n"It's a long story," Jachs said, "and I'll tell you about it some other time. The important thing is that we need to keep it a secret." He turned to Finicus and the rest of his changeling friends. "But I have to admit... it's an interesting idea. I wonder if having cutie marks would mean not needing to consume Love as much as we do now, or even not at all. Could we change changeling society for the better, just by giving our people cutie marks? Do you think it could work?"\n\n"I think it could," Finicus said, nodding. He glanced aside at Marsilio. "What about you, mister scientist? Any ideas?"\n\nMarsilio shrugged. "I suppose it's improbable, but by no means impossible. I do think we might have leaped to conclusions as to what having cutie marks would truly mean for us changelings... but why not? I'd like to believe there's something inherently magical and life-altering about cutie marks. And if we pool our resources together, well, we might be able to find something out.""

"The beauty is in the simplicity, obviously. Who needs to spend millions doing cutting-edge genetic or cybernetic research, when we can use the natural bounty of the world around us to slap a picture on our flanks and enhance our natural talents twentyfold?"\n\nQueen's Guard captain Dieter Heinrich frowned as they rounded a corner and continued along the brick path meandering through the gardens. "Cutie marks are a symbol of ponykind," he said. "Why would we want to sully changeling perfection by plastering them on our chitin? We would be admitting ponies have an advantage which changelings lack."\n\nFinicus rolled his eyes. "And sticking mechanical arms onto our soldiers and turning them into robot soldiers doesn't 'sully changeling perfection'? Please." He trotted out in front of Dieter and turned around to walk backwards so the two could talk face to face while they walked. "You're a soldier, Dieter, and I know you've fought ponies with cutie marks that made them just the biggest pains in your flanks. The right cutie mark can turn the average pony into something like a super soldier in their own right. But giving our soldiers cutie marks wouldn't just make them better fighters, it'd make them better infiltrators."\n\n"Better infiltrators?" Dieter asked. "How so?"\n\n"You know how the Equestrians used to sniff out changelings in disguise by making them act out the special talent related to their cutie mark? Our infiltrators couldn't do those things to the same degree of skill and aptitude you'd expect from a pony with a cutie mark suited for that task, and so it gave them away to whoever was onto them. But if you gave an infiltrator a true cutie mark, and the abilities that came with it, then they could more or less perfectly perform that task, as ponies would expect. Cutie marks are what make ponies, and a changeling with one would be a lot closer to becoming the ultimate infiltrator — a picture perfect pony, so to speak."\n\nDieter thought for a moment, but eventually he nodded in agreement. "I see what you mean. Alright, fair. Main Hive will have the support of the Queen's Guard, but we expect results. Especially from a project as ambitious as this.""

Buying the space in the crowded mountain city and then furnishing it with state of the art equipment had put a sizable dent in Finicus' wallet, but with the Queen's Guard preparing to foot the bill for his work, he wasn't too worried about that. Plus, if he was actually successful, the returns would be sky high. He'd never have to work a day in his life ever again. Maybe he'd give himself a cutie mark in something artistic to give him something to spend his retirement doing. He always thought getting into watercolors would be fun.\n\nAs he was about to leave the building and get lunch, however, he suddenly found his way blocked by members of the Queen's Guard and Empress Chrysalis herself. Finicus bowed low when he realized he was the subject of the Empress' attention, and he smiled up at her. "Ah, your Majesty, it's a pleasure to see you here. How may this humble bug be of service today?"\n\n"I've come to observe the premises where your research is to take place," she said. "Captain Heinrich informed me that you're trying to put cutie marks on changelings. It's ambitious, I'll give you that.

If you could steal their cutie marks and give them to us, then you empower changelings while depriving ponies of their birthright. And I could think of nothing that could be more just in this world."\n\nThen she stood back up and smiled at him. "Actually, I could. If you could give me Celestia's cutie mark and her power to move the sun, you would be a true hero of the changeling species. Oh, the things I could do with that power..."

Many of these books had old and obscure references to things the changelings knew little about; Marsilio was just happy that he was able to get as many as he did to help with Finicus' project. Not only that, but he'd managed to recruit many old friends, such as his pony peer, Dr. Spectrograph, to work on the project. It had the potential to change changeling society inside and out, after all...\n\n"What about this?" Dr. Spectrograph slid a book across the table to Marsilio, hoof tapping a picture of a pony covered in cutie marks. "Old texts reference a 'cutie pox' that struck a small town centuries ago. The citizens randomly acquired cutie marks, sometimes dozens at once, and they gained talent in the depicted skills for as long as they had them."\n\n"That sounds incredible," Marsilio said, raising an eyebrow as he read through the book. "Why would something that gives an individual so many talents be considered a pox, though?"\n\n"Because those afflicted were magically compelled to act out their cutie marks, often to the point of exhaustion or even death," Spectrograph stated. "Nopony knew what the cause was for the longest time, though now it's believed to have come from a flower called Heart's Desire that grows in the Everfree Forest. There should be some in the Canterlot gardens we can use for testing purposes. Perhaps that might be a way."\n\n"Perhaps," Marsilio agreed. "Maybe we can use whatever magic is in the flower for our ends. I'll make sure Finicus knows about this.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.1603.a:0 ""It's a start, that's for sure.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.2603.t:0 "A Few Questions"
changelings_paxchrysalia.2603.d:0 "Initial trials of Heart's Desire had proved promising, but they hardly provided the breakthrough Marsilio had been looking for. Diluted solutions made from the pollen of the plant did, when given to pony test subjects, cause an extra cutie mark or two to appear for roughly a week, and then fade away. Not only that, but the cutie marks were largely consistent, in that the same mark would reappear if the subject was given another dose. The first trials on changeling volunteers had been far less successful; fleeting cutie marks would appear on the flanks or necks of a changeling for a few seconds, then fade away again. It was a start, but something more would have to be done.\n\nGiven the nature of the source of the magic, Marsilio tracked down an Everfree biologist who had moved to Canterlot following the war. Dr. Green Hoof had a humble little home next to the sprawling Canterlot parks, no doubt to be closer to the greenery she loved so much, and she had agreed to a visit from Marsilio to discuss her work. Though initially reluctant, promises of being allowed to join expedition teams into the forest to recover flora that may have survived the Heer's attempts to eradicate it and the partisans it held proved enough to get her to talk.\n\nSo it was that on a Saturday afternoon, Marsilio found himself inside Dr. Green Hoof's kitchen, sharing tea while he explained what exactly he was after. "Heart's Desire is a powerful magical agent, but it's hardly stable," he explained to the botanist. "The Heer wants to make use of its properties for our projects, but we need something to stabilize. It is my hope, and the hope of the Heer, that you would be able to provide some information to us as to any other floral agents that could be used for this purpose."\n\nGreen Hoof rubbed her chin and thought. "Well, there might be something," she said. "Granted, nopony's ever tried to use Heart's Desire for much of anything, given the debilitating side effects. But it is a member of the Incredibilis genus, and so some other plants from that genus might be what you're looking for.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.2603.a:0 ""And what other plants in the Incredibilis genus are there, doctor?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.t:0 "A Couple of Plants"
changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.d:0 ""Well, first, the obvious and infamous one is Incredibilis humorous, or as you're likely to have heard it called, Poison Joke," Green Hoof said. "Getting any of the pollen on the skin or shell of a living creature causes the plant to perform 'humorous' pranks on the victim, usually playing off of their name. The effects are therefore chaotic, but not random, and in fact, one can get some reliability out of the plant. Poison Joke pollen added in small doses to anything tends to greatly exaggerate its strength; for example, adding some to a weak acid turns it into a very strong acid, and ingesting it alongside simple painkillers for a headache can leave a pony in a numb, catatonic state."\n\nMarsilio frowned. "That could prove too unpredictable," he said. "Is there something else?"\n\n"There is," Green Hoof said with a nod. "The seeds of the Incredibilis veritas, or simply known as the Seeds of Truth, have traditionally been used in the Equestrian south east as a remedy for all sorts of mental conditions and afflictions, from schizophrenia to dementia and more. How it works is mysterious, even to a trained botanist like myself, but it is believed that it brings out and reinforces the 'true being' of the person who ingests their powder. Though of course, it's not that simple; it seems most likely to simply reinforce the current state of an individual at the time of ingestion. Dementia patients that take it in a bout of madness have had their symptoms dramatically worsen, though those that take it during moments of clarity have significantly improved mental faculties. It's about the timing, you see."\n\nMarsilio nodded and smiled at the botanist. "Thank you, Doctor," he said, holding out his hoof for her to shake. "That was incredibly helpful. If I have any more botanical mysteries I need solving, I'll come straight to you."\n\n"Of course, surgeon-general," Green Hoof replied, taking his hoof. "And please, do remember what you promised me. The Everfree Forest is more dangerous than ever before, and I would love the opportunity to visit again with added security. Please do take me along the next time an expedition is mounted.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.a:0 ""I will be sure to do that, Doctor.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.t:0 "A Critical Decision"
changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.d:0 ""So that's what I was able to come up with," Marsilio said, closing the folder in front of him with his magic. Around the table, Jachs, Alcippe, and Finicus did the same, now that the surgeon-general's briefing was over. "Heart's Desire is the basis for what we're looking for. It has the possibility to make cutie marks appear, but it isn't stable enough to make them last. So we either need Poison Joke, which can greatly strengthen the power of the Heart's Desire serum, or the Seeds of Truth, which are supposed to be able to reinforce a creature's 'true self'. Now we need to make a decision on what to go after."\n\n"Why not just get both?" Finicus asked. "Then we could try both ways."\n\n"The plants are only found in the Everfree Forest or in small patches in the southeast," Marsilio explained. "And given the chaos in the southeast and their prevalence in the Everfree, I think we'll honestly have an easier time focusing on the forest. But that means that we'd need an armed and quick expedition to find what we need and get out, so we don't have time to go looking for blue flowers and then dig up seeds. So, since we can realistically only get one, what should we focus on?"\n\nJachs shrugged and pushed the folder away from himself. "Don't ask me," he said. "I'm useless when it comes to biology and botany."\n\n"That doesn't mean anything," Finicus said. "I'm useless too, but from what Marsilio said, it sounds pretty clear that Poison Joke is the way to go. I mean, come on, how can you argue against the plant that makes everything it touches stronger?"\n\n"But the Seeds of Truth are probably the safer candidate," Alcippe said. "I actually studied biology briefly before joining the Heer, so I'm a little bit familiar with it. The Seeds of Truth will be a safer alternative than Poison Joke. Who knows what could go wrong if that blue flower plays its tricks on us?"\n\n"We have time to think it over," Jachs said. "I'll need to organize an expedition regardless; that will take some time to organize." He nodded to his companions. "Think about this, and we'll discuss it later. Maybe then we'll have a clear path forward.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.a:0 ""If you say so, Jachs.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.604.t:0 "The Truth of the Matter"
changelings_paxchrysalia.604.d:0 "Finicus sighed and rubbed his eyes as he pushed the latest report aside. He'd spent so long looking through his research and preliminary findings that his eyes were glazing over and he could hardly focus on anything anymore. So, grumbling, he stood up from his desk and walked to the other side of his personal study, where an opened bottle of cognac and a set of crystal glasses were waiting to give him the cure to his headache.\n\n"Want any?" he called over his shoulder to the other changeling in the room. Alcippe sat upside down on the plush faux leather couch at the far side of the room, with her hind legs resting against the wall and her head just above the floor, her magic holding reports in front of her face. She'd been there as long as Finicus had, and together, the two had spent many hours that evening looking over the industrialist's notes while Jachs and Marsilio were busy with other facets of their work.\n\n"Sure," she said, dropping the notes onto the floor and grunting as she reversed herself into a real sitting position. She took the offered glass in her magic and took a long sip, immediately grimacing and coughing as the cognac hit her tongue. "Cognac?! Oh, I should have asked what you had before I answered."\n\n"It's good for you; builds character," Finicus said with a smirk, sipping on his own glass. Then, sitting across from Alcippe, he looked at the pile of notes and folders fanned out around her couch. "So? Any earth shattering breakthroughs?"\n\n"Not much more than what we already suspect." Alcippe sighed and, despite her earlier distaste, took another sip from the cognac. "I don't even know if the Seeds of Truth will make cutie marks appear, honestly. It gives creatures intense hallucinations and episodes, but that seems to be about it."\n\nFinicus thought for a moment, taking another sip of cognac, and frowned. "You know... reading all those reports... I feel like I realized something.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.604.a:0 ""Oh? What is it?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.t:0 "The Meaning of Life"
changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.d:0 ""I realized that... well, I don't care about a cutie mark," Finicus said. "And that's because I'm not looking for a cutie mark to be better in something. I'm looking for a cutie mark to tell me what to do with my life. I've spent almost my whole life devoted to one thing, and one thing only: making money. I didn't care how I did it, I just wanted to do it, because I thought money would give me the answer to what to do with my life. I just needed to get enough of it, and eventually I'd know what to do with it.\n\n"And now I have all this money," he continued, gesturing around them. "I have more money than I could possibly imagine as CEO and president of Main Hives. It bought this awesome house and it provides for my comforts, day in and day out. But what does it really get me? Nothing. And now that the Great War and all this disgusting death and destruction is over, of which we're all a big part of, I don't want to do this anymore. So I just... what do I want to do with my life?" He shrugged. "Maybe those seeds can help me. After all, what's the point in getting a cutie mark if I don't even know what cutie mark I'd want? I'd rather just know what I should spend the rest of my life doing, and then do it."\n\nAlcippe, though surprised at first, found herself slowly nodding along. "Yeah... I see what you mean. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. I changed majors in college four times before I eventually dropped out and joined the army. Now I'm here serving Jachs... but sometimes it feels like that's all I am. Jachs' right hoof. And I'm happy to help him, don't get me wrong... but if Jachs retired tomorrow, I don't know what I'd do. I don't know what'd make me happy. Sometimes I wish there was just someone I could ask to tell me, some way to figure out what I should be doing with my life..."\n\nThe two changelings slowly made eye contact, and in that moment, a decision was made. "Screw the cutie marks and all this crap," Finicus said. "The Seeds of Truth will give us what we want. Life's bigger than a little picture on your butt. It's what you do with it, not what you're good at.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.a:0 ""Let's just hope our friends will understand.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.t:0 "The Meeting"
changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.d:0 "Alcippe was nervous as Jachs and Marsilio sat down into their seats, joining her and Finicus at the meeting. Jachs, rubbing his eyes after another late night of work, wasted little time opening the discussion. "Right. So, Marsilio was just informed last night by one of his buddies in Vesalipolis that the Queen's Guard somehow heard about our efforts to stabilize Heart's Desire with Poison Joke extract to give changelings cutie marks, and now they're pushing their own research into the stuff. Someling from VOPS probably tipped them off; I still haven't been able to figure out who in our staff was put there by Vaspier and who wasn't, and I likely never will. But now that the Queen's Guard and, by extension, Empress Chrysalis know that Heart's Desire and Poison Joke is supposed to be a very powerful combination to give ponies cutie marks, that's what they want us to push for. So that's what we're looking at now. Alcippe and Finicus, do you two have a good argument for the Seeds of Truth? I know you two were doing lots of research into that."\n\nAlcippe and Finicus looked at each other, and Finicus took the initiative. "Well, that's the funny thing, isn't it? Alcippe and I had some interesting discussions the other night and we thought... well, screw the cutie marks. The Seeds of Truth aren't going to give changelings cutie marks, but they can be used to give whomever ingests them vivid hallucinations, or put in other words, epiphanies. If you combine that with Heart's Desire... well, I think a changeling could figure out the meaning of life... or at least THEIR life. And that's more important than any picture on a changeling's flank, we feel."\n\nJachs and Marsilio glanced at each other as if they weren't sure what they just heard, then Jachs frowned at them. "You want to give up on giving changelings cutie marks? You want to give up on making the greatest discovery our species has ever made or ever will make just because you can't find out what you want to do with your lives when today's over with?"\n\n"It's extremely selfish," Marsilio observed. "Well, maybe that's too harsh. But it's definitely short-sighted and impulsive. We have a chance to improve our species in untold ways. Some kind of intense drug trip isn't going to do anything for that. If you really want to dream about what to do with your life, just go to Gloriosa and ask her for her drugs. At least you won't be wasting our resources to get high.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.a:0 ""It's a waste of time and resources. Poison Joke is the way to go.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3604.t:0 "The Decision"
changelings_paxchrysalia.3604.d:0 ""Giving changelings cutie marks isn't going to make a better world," Alcippe pushed back. "You think anything we find out will leave the Queen's Guard's jurisdiction? Sure, they might let you guys get one of your own, but the average changeling isn't going to get one. They'll only give them to their best soldiers or infiltrators, and all it will do is make the chokehold of the Pax Chrysalia even tighter. You're just creating a stronger and more oppressive regime with that. At least with the Seeds of Truth, we can help our species find the individuality we so crave by showing every changeling what they really want in life, even after our society beats every 'ling's hopes and dreams out of them when they're small."\n\n"It's missing the point," Finicus agreed. "Even if we gave Chrysalis Celestia's mark, it wouldn't make her kind and compassionate, though it would certainly make her much more powerful. Our synthetic cutie marks would just become a way of giving changelings an extra talent in one thing or another, or increase their aptitude in performing specific tasks, but who they are fundamentally, the experiences and biases that make us who we are — getting all of that to change will take more than just a simple stamp on your flank. Your obsession with making cutie marks a reality is blinding you to what it's really going to do to the world, and it ain't a pretty picture."\n\nMarsilio opened his mouth to retort, but Jachs held up a hoof and stopped him. "I don't want this to devolve into a shouting match," he said. "I was up late last night and my head hurts, so I'd like us to keep it down. But more importantly than that, we're friends, and we don't need to be ripping into each other. So let's agree to make a decision here, in this room, where it's just the four of us, instead of letting it fester outside. Okay?" When everyling nodded, Jachs put his hooves down on the table. "Alright. I'm going to stay out of it. I'm not going to take sides between subordinates. The three of you, figure this out on your own."\n\nMarsilio and Finicus immediately locked eyes. Alcippe knew that neither was going to back down, and the dreadful realization dawned on her that she'd have to be the tiebreaker. So what did she want: a way to give changelingkind cutie marks? Or a way to figure out the meaning of her life?"

Though the forest had been beaten and battered by the Heer, it had not lost any of the creepiness factor, and Alcippe had trouble getting a good night's sleep, knowing that monsters she could scarcely imagine could be lurking just outside of the campsite. They'd already suffered terrible attrition in the week they'd spent camped in the forest, losing expedition members and escorts to timberwolf attacks and manticore ambushes, and now their party had lost a quarter of its size. The longer they stayed in the forest, the bigger the risk that nobody was getting out of this alive.\n\nStepping out of her tent, Alcippe made her way over to the table where Marsilio and Green Hoof had gathered around a pot of coffee, trying to get some energy going for another fruitless day of searching the Everfree for the Seeds of Truth. "I know nobody here slept well," Alcippe said as she sat down, pouring some coffee out for herself. "How much longer do you think we can go on?"\n\n"Not long at all, to tell you the truth," Marsilio said. "This place does things to your nerves. Did you hear the trees whispering last night?

Or do we keep going until we all die?"\n\n"Screw the seeds," he muttered, tossing his empty coffee cup away. "We're not going to find anything out here.

It had cost a great deal to get this far; skirmishes with partisans were common, owing to the Heer's prior failure to subjugate the Everfree, and had exacted a great toll on the escort. Even Hauptjäger Scolytin, who had seemed so cocky and confident at the start of the venture, became increasingly subdued and serious the more soldiers he lost to the forest. So far, they'd already bled away half of their escort, and Alcippe wondered if there'd be anyling left by the time they decided to return home.\n\nThe mechanized transport she rode in along with Marsilio, Green Hoof, and Scolytin came to a sudden stop, slamming into something unseen ahead of them. "Ambush!" someling shouted from the other side of the bulletproof metal, and Alcippe could have sworn she heard someling else shout, "It's the witch!" before the gunfire started. It lasted for several minutes, slowly dying out along with its accompanying shouts, until all was eerily quiet.\n\nAlcippe, Marsilio, and Green Hoof huddled in one corner of the transport, while Scolytin grabbed his rifle and cautiously made for the door. No sooner had he opened it and peered around the corner did a bamboo pole strike him in the throat, and he fell to the ground, choking on his crushed windpipe. Another blow to the head stopped his movement, and then stripes appeared in the opened doorway, eyes seemingly aglow beneath a green mask.\n\nAlcippe reached for her pistol, but the zebra was faster, darting into the transport and bashing Alcippe's head against the wall. She heard muffled shouting between the flashes of pain, and when her vision stopped swimming, she realized she, Marsilio, and Green Hoof had been dragged out of the transport by the zebra. It was only then, in the dim light of the Everfree, did Alcippe realize who she was looking at."

Green Hoof said, hopping to her hooves. Zecora frowned at her and readied her staff, and the botanist took a nervous step back. "This isn't a military expedition, I promise!" she pleaded. "All we want... all the changelings want, rather, is to find a source of the Seeds of Truth. They're looking for a way to change their entire species, a sort of salvation of individuality. They decided that the Seeds of Truth would be better than Poison Joke, even if it may be optimistic and wishful, because they want to know their true way forward, a way to become something other than... well, this."\n\n"We're not here to attack your forest again," Marsilio tried to assure Zecora. "We gave up on that. You beat us. You beat everything the Heer had at its disposal, and we're not going to try again. We just want to harvest some of the Everfree's bounty, and if we're right, this project could be good for both changelings and ponies. It could be a way to working together in the future."\n\nZecora watched them with narrowed eyes for the longest time. "There can be no peace, until your aggressive ways cease," she said. But finally, she dug through the satchel at her side and tossed a small pouch toward Green Hoof, who caught it in her hooves. "Your honesty I wish to believe, so take your seeds and leave. But if in this forest you ever draw another breath, then it shall be the last thing you do before death."\n\nWith that, Zecora picked up her staff and slipped it under the strap of her satchel as she backed away. The bushes rustled, the trees shifted, and somewhere, a timberwolf howled. The zebra melted away into the darkness of the Everfree, and the three survivors wasted no time looking at each other, now that they had the Seeds of Truth."

Green Hoof was the first to the transport door, throwing it open and hopping outside, followed close behind by Hauptjäger Scolytin, weapon readied in case of an attack. Marsilio and Alcippe followed them out, and Alcippe's eyes widened as she saw the faintly glowing blue patch of flowers not even thirty meters away. The small patch had grown directly under moss-laden branches of a great willow, completely obscured from aerial reconnaissance; nothing but dumb luck had led the team to where they were now.\n\nMarsilio had a large grin on his face as his team immediately set about carefully collecting samples of the dangerous flower. "Poison Joke, Poison Joke. I knew we'd find you sooner or later. I can't wait to get these flowers back to the lab."\n\n"Hopefully it works," Alcippe said. "It'll at least make all the hassle we've gone through worth it."\n\nThe team spent the better part of an hour carefully collecting and catalogueing the plants, only for a roar to interrupt them. "Bugbear! West side!" a soldier shouted, and the escorts moved into position to take down the monster with heavy weapons. Hauptjäger Scolytin jogged from one side to the other, nodding at Alcippe and Marsilio. "Better hurry it up," he told them. "Where there's one bugbear, more are sure to come." Then he left to join his troops as the monster drew closer to the convoy.\n\nAlcippe and Marsilio took his warnings to heart, quickly finishing their collection of Poison Joke plants and packing them away in the transports as the anti-tank rifles of their escorts made quick work of the bugbear. Soon, with dozens of flowers safely contained in glass jars, the convoy rolled out once more, escaping the forest with their harvest before any more monsters could pounce on them."

changelings_paxchrysalia.4606.d:0 ""There! Poison Joke! I think I see some!"\n\nAlcippe snapped alert, shaking off her exhausted nap with a yawn as the mechanized transport came to a stop. Green Hoof was the first to the transport door, throwing it open and hopping outside, followed close behind by Hauptjäger Scolytin, weapon readied in case of an attack. Marsilio and Alcippe followed them out, and Alcippe's eyes widened as she saw the faintly glowing blue patch of flowers not even thirty meters away. The small patch had grown directly under moss-laden branches of a great willow, completely obscured from aerial reconnaissance; nothing but dumb luck had led the team to where they were now.\n\nMarsilio had a large grin on his face as his team immediately set about carefully collecting samples of the dangerous flower. "Poison Joke, Poison Joke. I knew we'd find you sooner or later. I can't wait to get these flowers back to the lab."\n\n"Hopefully it works," Alcippe said. "It'll at least make all the hassle we've gone through worth it."\n\nThat was when the gunfire started, followed quickly by a tribal yell as pony partisans burst out of the undergrowth, firing stolen weapons at the distracted changelings. "Ambush!" a soldier cried out, only to be cut down in a hail of gunfire, and soldiers everywhere hit the dirt and grabbed their weapons to fight back. Alcippe, Green Hoof, and Marsilio were still next to the flowers when the shooting started, and realizing the danger they were in, immediately abandoned the grove and raced back to the waiting transports. Bullets whizzed past Alcippe's head, and she fired her pistol blindly into the undergrowth around them, trying to buy a little bit of breathing room with lead. But as they hopped into the back of the mechanized transport, Green Hoof tripped and fell to the ground, and Marsilio turned around to haul her into the transport. No sooner had the earth pony tumbled inside did Marsilio cry out and fall to the ground, blood blossoming under his clothing and sopping it through in seconds. "Marsilio!" Alcippe cried, stopping to try and grab her friend, only for Hauptjäger Scolytin to tackle her into the back of the transport and slam the door shut behind them. "No!" Alcippe tried, trying to go back out after him, but Scolytin pinned her to the ground and slammed his hoof against the side of the transport.\n\n"Go! Go!" he shouted to the driver, and the transport lurched seconds later as it fled the ambush. As the gunfire faded away, Alcippe could only weep and shiver on the ground, knowing that she'd left her friend behind to die... not that there was anything she could have done this deep in the Everfree to save him."

changelings_paxchrysalia.607.d:0 "Marsilio proudly displayed the blue flower in the glass jar to his friends, who all leaned in closer to get a better look at it. "Beautiful, isn't it?" he said with a smirk. "One little flower with untold potential."\n\n"You better be careful with that thing," Second Wind warned, having found some time in his day to attend this gathering of friends. "Every foal in Equestria's heard stories about the dangers of Poison Joke. Unlike what its name wants you to think, it's not laughing matter."\n\n"I'm surgeon-general of the Heer, one of the Hives' greatest scientist," Marsilio retorted. "Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing."\n\n"So you think it'll really work?" Jachs asked. "Cutie marks might be within our reach?"\n\n"I've got some volunteers lined up to help us figure that out. Once we get a stable compound, we'll see what happens."\n\n"I still think we should have gone with the Seeds of Truth," Finicus said, forelegs crossed. "But it is what it is. So long as this thing actually works, I'll consider that a success, if nothing else but for the contract."\n\n"But how do you know this is actually going to help changelings as a whole?" Alcippe asked. "It sounds like the Queen's Guard is just going to use it for their own purposes, making better soldiers and infiltrators. How does that benefit the common changeling?"\n\n"It... it will, eventually," Marsilio said, waving the question away with a hoof. "Once cutie marks in the Heer and the Queen's Guard are widespread, they'll trickle down to civilian use. We'll have a massive change in changeling politics, culture, even our economy. Once the military sees how beneficial cutie marks are, it's only a matter of time before it authorizes civilian use." He picked up the glass jar, tapped it once, and smiled at the rest of his friends. "Now, I need to get to work. Discovery waits for no bug!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.608.d:0 "A few days had passed as Marsilio set about finding the perfect solution for the mixture of Heart's Desire and Poison Joke. Experimentation was performed at a rigorous and methodical approach, modifying the concentrations of each plant until an optimal solution could be formed. But it was little more than trial and error, and there was certainly a lot more error than success with each trial. Thankfully, Marsilio had all the Poison Joke he needed, and he'd even set aside a portion of the harvest to cultivate more of the plant. Given enough time, he could find the solution he needed to give changelings cutie marks.\n\nBut time was not something he had. A week after he reported the successful recovery of poison joke to VOPS and the Queen's Guard, he found a directive sitting on his desk, waiting to be read. In it was an order from Vaspier Orn Kladisium to move immediately into test subject experimentation; VOPS wanted cutie marks even more than Marsilio and Jachs did, it would seem. Though Marsilio wanted to wait, he knew that trying to tell VOPS to be patient wasn't exactly a winning proposition. So, selecting the best solution he'd been able to develop so far, Marsilio wrote a request for brave soldiers to begin volunteering for the Queen's Guard's latest clandestine program."

changelings_paxchrysalia.610.d:0 "Marsilio stared out the window of his office, watching the sun set on Canterlot once again. The last of the Poison Joke trial notes sat on a corner of his desk, tossed to the side after review. It was the same every time. Even though the cutie marks gave the test subjects what Marsilio intended, and even though they worked in the short term, some freak accident would always arise to kill the subject. Every single trial had ended in the death of the changeling, as if the universe itself was telling him that his efforts were foolhardy, as if he was messing with the natural order of the world. Maybe he was. Maybe that was why VOPS told him to stop.\n\nHe let the letter slip from his magic. The program wasn't officially cancelled, per se; rather, VOPS and the Queen's Guard had decided to reallocate almost all of its funding to other, more promising projects. But the effect was the same. The project was dead, and without the funds to continue research, Marsilio had no choice but to stop. There was no other way of explaining what had happened: he had failed.\n\nOnly now did Marsilio wake up to the blind faith that had been clouding his vision for the longest time. He and Jachs had been so sold on creating cutie marks, but not so the changeling species could profit off of it. No, no. That was just what they told themselves. What they really wanted was cutie marks of their own, as if that would help them grasp their destiny by the horns and control it like no changeling ever had before. How many changelings and ponies died to get to this memo from VOPS? How many ponies and changelings died on this fruitless endeavor? And how many more would have died if VOPS didn't cancel the project?\n\nFinally, Marsilio understood just how stupid he had been. This whole project was a fool's errand from day one. At least now he finally understood that before it consumed him too."

"Finicus?" Marsilio asked, causing the industrialist to jump in surprise. "What are you doing here?"\n\n"It sucks about the project being cancelled," Finicus said, frowning at the train. "It had so much promise. We could have done so many great things with it."\n\n"It's too dangerous," Marsilio said, shaking his head. "And we were fools for pursuing it. It's better that it's quietly put away now, for good."\n\n"How can you say that?" Finicus snapped, catching Marsilio by surprise. "After everything we went through to make this happen, to finally give changelings cutie marks... how can we just give up now? How can we give up now when our destiny is right there?!"\n\n"It isn't our destiny," Marsilio countered. "We were trying to control forces we don't understand. Nobody, not a changeling nor a pony, can know what their destiny is. Our destiny is what we choose to do with our lives, not what our lives tell us to do."\n\n"Screw that!" Finicus exclaimed. "I wanted to go with the Seeds of Truth because they would have told me what to do with my life! I feel so confused and listless, like a ship without a rudder. Those seeds could have let me make sense of this stupid world I'm living in! And yeah, we didn't get the seeds, but we got the Poison Joke. That would have been a good consolation prize, to at least choose what I want to do in my life. But now that's being scrapped, too. What am I supposed to do?!"\n\nHe lunged for Marsilio, grabbing the lapels of the surgeon-general's jacket, and pulling him in close. "You've got the stuff to make at least one more of those cutie mark potions. I know you do. Please, just please give me a cutie mark in something like water colors. I've always wanted to be an artist, but life had other plans. I was groomed for this stupid job ever since I was a grub. I didn't have a say in the matter. But now I do. Now I want to get back at life. And you can help me." He desperately smiled at Marsilio. "You'll help me, Marsilio. Right?""

He wanted a cutie mark in painting. So I... I gave it to him."\n\nJachs' eyes widened. "You what?" he asked, only to be immediately cut off as an aide rushed into the restaurant and saluted him. He held up a hoof to Marsilio and turned to the aide. "What is it?"\n\n"Generalmajor... Oberstleutnant Alcippe called me to inform you that your friend, Finicus Vesali, was found dead in his apartment in Vesalipolis." The soldier hesitated at the shock on Jachs' face, and bowed his head. "I'm... sorry, sir."\n\n"Dead," Jachs murmured to himself, and when he looked at Marsilio, he saw the horror on his friend's face. "How did he die, soldier?"\n\n"He was... found in his study, surrounded by all kinds of paintings," the soldier said. "The paints he used had trace amounts of toxic heavy metals in them. The coroner believes that the paint dripped off of the canvas of his painting and into his coffee cup, and he was poisoned." When neither Jachs or Marsilio responded to that, the soldier uncomfortably saluted once more and took a step back. "I'll... arrange travel to Vesalipolis for the funeral, sir. I'm really sorry, sir."\n\nWhen he left, Jachs and Marsilio could only look at each other in shock for the longest time, neither quite believing what the soldier had just told them."

changelings_paxchrysalia.613.d:0 "Following his confrontation with Marsilio at the train, Finicus retreated to his house in Canterlot for several days to think things over. The complete failure of the cutie mark program had devastated him. He had wanted for nothing more than to make some sort of divine intervention in his life to show him his destiny. He refused to believe he was supposed to live the rest of his life at the top of a corporation that profited off of death and destruction. At the very least, he had hoped for an excuse that could validate his desires to leave it all behind and do something different, something better, with his life. But that wasn't happening, neither through Poison Joke nor through the Seeds of Truth. He was stuck where he was, helpless  and adrift in life, and the only thing he could hang onto was the status quo.\n\nBut slowly, he saw what Marsilio had meant. Test subject after test subject died getting their cutie marks. The whole thing was little more than an attempt to play god, and they were being punished for it. Marsilio was right: his destiny was to choose what to do with his life, not what his life told him to do. And right now, he had a choice between moping because he didn't get what he wanted, or actually taking some responsibility and doing what he could as president and CEO of Main Hive Industries to make things better. Maybe when he was done making the world a better place, he could turn his efforts to bettering himself the old fashioned way. Getting a cutie mark in painting was cheating, anyway. Where was the sense of pride and accomplishment in that?\n\nTaking a deep breath, Finicus made his way into his study and began to draft a note announcing Main Hive's abandonment of the cutie mark project. And then, once the air was cleaned up about this whole awful mess, he could direct his company to something better than war and death.\n\nIt was time to change the world."

The Everfree Forest had claimed one of his oldest friends, and the world didn't even have the decency to share in his misery.\n\nThe door to his office slammed open, and Jachs jumped as Finicus shuffled inside. "Unbelievable," he growled, hooves stomping on the floor. "This whole thing is a disaster! An absolute disaster! Marsilio's food for the timberwolves, and the Heer's crawling up my ass about him dying, as if it's MY fault that their surgeon-general is dead, and not THEIR fault for not pacifying the damn forest!

The Everfree not being contained was my fault, I know that, and that means I killed him! If you want to say that, then just say it!"\n\nFinicus' eyes narrowed and he stepped back. "Fine, Jachs. You killed him, if that's what you want to hear. But I didn't come here to tell you that. I came here to give you the courtesy that I'm leaving for Vesalipolis, and I don't think I'll be coming back to Canterlot.

"What happened out there?" he asked her. "What happened to the others?"\n\nThey were picked off, bit by bit," Alcippe said.

"But what about you and Main Hives? This isn't what the Queen's Guard wanted, after all."\n\n"Who cares about them?" Finicus asked, waving his hoof in dismissal. "I'll just tell them that we failed in making cutie marks, they'll give Main Hives a slap on the fetlock, and then it'll be back to business as usual. This was a low risk, high reward kind of thing for them, and given MHI's track record, a failure here and there is perfectly acceptable. We'll be fine.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.617.t:0 "Almost Ready"
changelings_paxchrysalia.617.d:0 ""So you think this'll work? This'll really work?"\n\nMarsilio sighed and rubbed the end of his pencil against an itch on his temple as Finicus practically hovered over his shoulder in the lab. "It will work, eventually. It may take some time to figure things out, but we'll get the details down. Now please, sit down on the stool and don't touch anything."\n\nFinicus did as he was told, but he still practically vibrated with excitement. "I wonder what I'm gonna see when I take a sip," he said, staring up at the ceiling as he daydreamed. "It's not everyday someling gets to unravel the meaning of their own life."\n\n"I'll say," Marsilio grumbled; he was already regretting letting Finicus visit him in the lab while he worked on the potion. "Say, did everything go alright with the Queen's Guard?"\n\n"Hmmm? Oh, yeah, it was just like I said. Dieter and Vaspier were less than thrilled that I didn't have a way to give them their own personal butt tattoos, so they confiscated all the research and notes MHI had on the project, as well as stripped away our funding for the contract. But they didn't do anything besides that. It was like I said, a slap on the fetlock."\n\nHe hopped off of the stool and looked at the clock on the wall above Marsilio's lab bench. "I have to get going anyway, I've got to have a call with the board about this whole cutie mark kerfuffle. When do you think this'll be ready?"\n\n"A week," Marsilio said. "I spent the last two weeks doing my due diligence to see if the Seeds of Truth could work with the Heart's Desire to make cutie marks appear, and nothing stuck. Now that the Queen's Guard is off of our cases about the project, we can go ahead with our own ideas for it. That shouldn't take too long, hopefully.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.618.t:0 "Potion Commotion"
changelings_paxchrysalia.618.d:0 "Finicus could barely contain himself as Marsilio gently placed a tray full of glowing blue vials on the table. Finally, after weeks of work, he was about to know his destiny. It was like stealing fire from the gods; a sip of this potion could reveal a changeling's purpose in life beyond serving their hive. Individuality, at long last, seemed in reach.\n\n"This is all that we have," Marsilio cautioned Finicus, along with Jachs and Alcippe, who had also come to his lab to see the final result. "I took two of the seeds to try and cultivate more, but without perfectly recreating their natural boggy conditions in the Everfree, I doubt they'll grow. Everything else went into making these four potions. Hopefully, it's what we're looking for."\n\n"I don't doubt you for a second, Marsilio," Finicus said, taking one of the potions in his magical grip. He pulled off the cork and smelled an aroma that seemed equal parts walnut and cherry. "It's got a great smell, at least. So, what, just down the hatch?"\n\n"Yes," Marsillio said. "The seeds were given as a sort of stew to ponies suffering from psychotic episodes, so it should work via ingestion."\n\n"Then down the hatch it goes!" With that exclamation, Finicus put the vial to his lips and tossed his head back. The potion coated his tongue and slid down his throat like syrup, and it even had a slight fizz to it like carbonation. The rest of Finicus' friends looked on as he sat in place, waiting for something to happen... only for him to blink and frown. "So, uh... how long is this supposed to take to kick in?"\n\n"I'm not exactly sure," Marsilio said, checking his notes. "Sometimes the effects were immediate, and sometimes they took hours. I don't know which one this will be."\n\n"Hmph. Well, I don't like drinking alone." He gestured to the tray as he looked at his friends. "How about it? There's three of you, and three potions left. Are you gonna get in on this too?"\n\nJachs frowned like he wasn't sure, but Alcippe was the next to grab a vial and take a drink. She licked her lips and nodded. "Well, it's got a good taste," she said, and she turned to Marsilio. "This will really show us our destiny?"\n\n"I only hope," Marsilio admitted, taking one of the vials as well. "Might as well give it a try."\n\n"I feel like I'm back at Gloriosa's den," Jachs said, taking the last vial. "Here goes nothing."\n\nFinicus chuckled and opened his mouth to say something, but he lost his voice as the world began to sway around him. He fell out of his chair, startling his friends, as vertigo took hold, and he felt like he was going to be sick. And just when he thought he couldn't take it anymore..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.619.d:0 "Finicus awoke on an infinite expanse of bright stars. He looked around himself, but saw nothing save for the galaxies of the universe. It was as if he and infinity were all alone since the beginning of time.\n\nThen, he saw movement. Up ahead, a purple alicorn made out of starlight approached him. He cowered, afraid the pony was about to smite him down, but her horn lit and lifted his chin. "Come," she said, beckoning him onwards, and Finicus felt compelled to walk in her hoofsteps until the stars winked out and darkness shrouded him.\n\nWhen he could see again, he found himself inside a factory, the hum and clamor of machinery assaulting his ears. He moved forward, walking past machine after machine and station after station of ponies chained to their equipment, working without rest in threadbare uniforms. A stallion collapsed at his workbench, and a changeling guard stomped over and began beating the stallion with a cudgel until, beaten and bloodied, the pony forced himself back to his post. It was then that Finicus realized this was no factory, but a death camp disguised as one.\n\nHe went up the stairs off of the factory floor and pushed open the foreling's office to voice his disgust, only to stop in shock when he saw himself sitting behind the desk, the suffering of the factory blocked out by loud music, and a drink in his hoof. His reflection seemed not to notice anything going on outside, until a soldier brushed past Finicus in the doorway and entered the room. "The workers are losing steam, sir," the guard said to not-Finicus. "We'll need a fresh batch soon."\n\n"A fresh batch is coming," not-Finicus said, setting his drink aside and standing up. "Damn these lazy ponies. It's almost as if they don't want tonight's ration. Well, if they don't want it, don't give it to them. Nopony eats tonight. Maybe we'll get more out of them tomorrow."\n\nThe guard nodded and walked away, and Finicus could only watch in shock as his callous double got up and casually followed after him. He didn't even move as his double approached him, and just when he thought they were about to bump into each other, his reflection phased through him, and the world exploded into bright light."

changelings_paxchrysalia.620.d:0 "Alcippe found herself wandering through the rubble of a city, moments after having followed a purple alicorn out of a starry void into darkness. She didn't know how she ended up here, but it didn't take her too long to recognize the city as Canterlot due to its verticality. Except, this Canterlot, or what was left of it, still had the banners of the Equestrian Army and the Princesses hanging from flagpoles, the fabric scorched black from a fire that died out a short while ago. The smoke rising from the embers underneath the rubble attested to that.\n\nAlcippe shuddered as she passed pony skeleton after pony skeleton, many left in gruesome poses, and many still with charred flesh clinging to their blackened bones. She paused when she saw a larger skeleton curled up on top of a smaller one... a mother and her foal, perhaps? The sight made her sick to her stomach. All around her, countless more ponies lay dead, their bones frozen in time to highlight their last agonizing moments. And when she didn't see rifles or uniforms clinging to the corpses, she realized that these were civilians, not soldiers.\n\nBut then she heard laughter up ahead, and she tore her eyes away from the bones to buzz forward on her wings. What greeted her was a terrifying sight: she saw herself, kicking a pony's skull down charred cobbles, and she was dressed in the black of the Queen's Guard instead of her usual Heer grey. And as she watched, aghast, she saw Captain Dieter approach her, a big smile on his face, matched by the grin her double wore on hers. "Excellent use of the incendiary shells, Alcippe," Dieter congratulated her imposter. "The wind caught it just in the right way to burn the vermin from their holes. Oh, what I would have given to be able to see into the firestorm, to watch them scream in agony as their flesh boiled away."\n\n"I couldn't see it, but I heard it," Alcippe's imposter said. "It was like music to my ears. I had the guns go silent for fifteen minutes just to listen to the choir."\n\nDieter chuckled and reached into his uniform, pulling out a medal and pinning it to Alcippe's own. "I think that deserves a promotion. How does that sound, Oberst? There were too many Oberstleutnants in the army anyway."\n\nAlcippe watched in dismay as her doppelganger grinned. "My thoughts exactly, Captain Heinrich. I can't wait to give Manehattan the same treatment.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.621.d:0 "Marsilio tried in vain to find an exit to the compound he was in. There were so many hallways and so many rooms, he had no idea where to go. Whenever he stopped to ask a changeling for directions, they passed by as if he wasn't even there. He eventually gave up after the fifth try, knowing that something strange was going on. Was he a ghost? Was he dead? He didn't know, but that should have been scientifically impossible. So what was going on?\n\nA set of double doors opened, and four changelings left, with an emaciated pony between them, her legs chained together so that she struggled to take more than small steps. He thought she was a unicorn at first, until he saw the nub where her horn had been removed. He blinked in shock; removing a unicorn's horn was like taking away a changeling's ability to shapeshift. It was like removing a key part of a pony's identity. What monster would do that, when simply putting a crack into the tip of a unicorn's horn rendered all but the most basic of spells impossible for them? Curious, Marsilio turned to the side and slipped inside before the doors could close.\n\nHe immediately regretted his decision.\n\nHe had stumbled into what looked like a warehouse, and the aisles and walls were lined with stainless steel cages going from floor to ceiling, some twenty feet tall. Inside each cage was a sickly, exhausted pony, trapped in a little box without even enough room to turn around. The ones on the bottom were covered with the waste from the ones up top, and the whole place reeked of refuse and disease. The ponies were like animals packed into a slaughterhouse, and most didn't even have enough hope left to cry about their situation. Marsilio could see in their dull eyes that they'd already given up long ago.\n\nThe door opened again, and Marsilio did a double take when he saw himself walking in, escorted by other scientists and assistants. "Proper living conditions don't increase the amount of Love a pony can produce," he heard his double scold an assistant. "They'll make the same amount of Love whether they're in a cage or free on the range. Sure, the Love can be sweetened if given a proper relationship with another pony, but that would quadruple the cost of housing our food supply, and it's nothing that artificial sweeteners can't cover up during the refinement process. Industrialization, Pedipalp, that's the future of Love extraction!"\n\nMarsilio could only watch in horror and disgust as his double rounded the corner, walking out of sight behind a wall of encaged and miserable ponies."

But he could hear activity up ahead, so he doubled his pace, hoping to find someling that could explain to him what had happened.\n\n"Places, changelings, places!" he heard the director shout as he set his eyes on the stage, and Jachs stopped in his tracks; that was HIS voice. Now more curious than concerned, Jachs carefully stepped forward to get a better look at what was happening. The stage in the studio had been set to look like a picturesque Equestrian farm, and he saw the changeling actors arrange themselves for when the camera was set to roll. "Alright, Pupa, your character," Jachs' double reminded one of the changelings, and the changeling giggled in light embarrassment as she shapeshifted into a cheery-looking earth pony. Once everything was in place, Jachs watched his imposter pick up his megaphone once again. "Okay, that's good. Good! Everyling, let's make this the last take, okay? Lights, camera, action!"\n\nThe actors on the stage immediately set into their rehearsed routine, with a changeling soldier accompanying a civilian up to the front door of the farm. The soldier knocked on the door, raising his voice for the microphones to catch it. "Oh, Miss Junebug? Are you home?"\n\nThe actress disguised as the earth pony immediately opened the door and stepped outside, giving exaggerated nods to the uniformed soldier. "Oh, yessir, Mister Tarsus! Yessir! What can I getcha, sir?"\n\nThe soldier and the civilian laughed, and the pony giggled along. "Why, Miss Junebug, did you forget what today is? It's the harvest day! My friend here, Carapace, said that you forgot to give your donation today!"\n\nJunebug slapped her hoof to her head. "Oh, shucks, Mister, I keep forgettin'! Thank the Queen that I have you to remind me! How's about I give my donation right now, since you're here!"\n\n"That'll work splendidly!" Tarsus exclaimed, and the actress portraying the civilian stepped up and opened her mouth as if she was drawing Love, leaving the earth pony giggling some more as a result. The scene went on for a few more seconds before Jachs' imposter picked up his megaphone again. "And cut! That'll do perfectly, we'll fill in the voice over in post. Great work, everyling! Great work!"\n\nAs the changelings began to disperse now that filming was over, Jachs could only look on in disbelief. He went from being a soldier to a film director whitewashing the occupation?

Also on the ground around him was the rest of his friends, who were just now coming to. Jachs was the first to say something, and that was accompanied by a groan as he clutched his head. "Urgh... I really need to stop doing drugs. It's not professional."\n\nFinicus snickered and leaned back against the wall. "I get that," he said, closing his eyes for a moment. But then his memories of what he'd seen came back to him, and he nervously looked at Jachs and the rest of his friends. "I, uh... what did you all see?"\n\n"I was apparently a film director whitewashing the painful truth of this occupation," Jachs grumbled. "If that's supposed to be my destiny, I don't believe it in the slightest."\n\n"I'll say," Alcippe said in a quiet voice, trembling. "I was with the Queen's Guard after the battle of Canterlot. I...

I think that was Twilight. She was showing me how much good I've done by showing me how much bad I could have done."\n\n"I think you're right," Jachs agreed. "If I didn't have control of the Canterlot Commissariat to keep me involved after the war, I may have retired and just found something else to do. I likely wouldn't have known myself the horrors of what the Pax Chrysalia truly means."\n\nFinicus thought for a moment, and then slowly, ever so slowly, a smile appeared on his face. "You know what? I think those seeds did show me my destiny."\n\nAlcippe raised a startled eyebrow. "What do you mean? You're not going to become a slave driver, are you?!"\n\n"No, no! Not that at all. What I mean is that I know what I'm going to do now. I'm going to try my hardest to make Main Hives the opposite of what I saw in that vision. I'm going to make it ethical and fair. Screw it, I'll hire ponies for decent wages and a Love tax exemption to help get them out of this mess!"\n\n"You know what? I like that idea," Marsilio said. "I'm going to turn my lab toward finding a safer and easier way of Love collection. Maybe I'll find a way to make artificial Love as good as the real stuff. Then we wouldn't need to corral up ponies and harvest their Love on a regular basis."\n\n"I'm going to do my best to be a role model for the Heer," Alcippe said. "There shouldn't be a single officer in the army that thinks it's okay to treat ponies cruelly. We have to stop it in the upper ranks if we want that mentality to propagate into the enlisted ranks."\n\n"And I'm going to make sure that we correct the injustices of the Pax Chrysalia one by one, not hide them and pretend they don't exist," Jachs said.

The increase in attacks, coupled with the extremely hostile environment, had attrited away half of the Heer's garrisons before they fell back.

One of the first Equestrian cities to fall before the advance of the Heer during the Great War, Acornage became the hub for Changeling military transportation and logistics, through which supplies, armaments, and soldiers were directed to whichever section of the front required them most.\n\nThe long-established Changeling presence in the city made it the prime candidate for large-scale settlement by Changeling colonisers after the war. Acornage's former Changeling Quarter soon grew to encompasses much of the entire city, and the pony population was relegated to the suburbs or inner-city ghettoes, where they still make up a majority of the city's total population. The Changeling immigrants now dwelling in the Hive-Colony mostly congregate in its downtown, where several city blocks have been demolished to make way for the construction of a massive Hive built in the style of those anchoring the Changeling metropolises of Vesalipolis, Vraks, and Ditrysium. Outside the city, Changeling settler-colonies proliferate in the countryside, some being wholly new settlements created from scratch, while others, like Alvarium, were established on the sites of Equestrian towns or villages. These peripheral colonies support the main Hive-Colony, providing food, water, resources, and workers. They are much more highly militarized as well, and while Alvarium remains in transition from military occupation into quasi-civilian colonial rule, the peripheral settler-colonies stand as the bastions of Changeling control over the region, ready to mobilize their populations of soldier-settlers to march on Alvarium should the ponies rise up in open dissent.§!"

Though originally pressured by his family to attend university and become a doctor, Jachs enlisted in the army in 996, and participated in the ill-fated attack on Canterlot in 1002 as an Unterfeldwebel, having risen through the ranks in those six short years due to acute military acumen. Jachs' company managed to find fame in the defeat as the regiment that captured the Element Bearers before they could reach the Elements of Harmony, and when the military situation following the Canterlot disaster was reassessed, Jachs found himself placed in the fast track to promotion, and had reached the rank of Oberst by the time the Great War began. \n\nThough present on or near the front lines for the majority of the war, Jachs' moment of greatness did not arrive until he was tasked with capturing Canterlot. With efficient command of the resources at his disposal, Jachs managed to seal off the narrow passes through the mountains around Canterlot, isolating the city from the rest of the Equestrian army, and approaching from all sides with veteran divisions capable of fighting in the treacherous mountains surrounding the capital. Though the campaign was long and bloody, Jachs worked closely with the Luftwaffe to chip away at the Equestrian defenses before using two Jaeger infiltrator companies to outflank and destroy the first line of Equestrian fortifications around the main road leading up the mountain and into the city. Once the road had been opened, the city fell within days. Jachs would be promoted to Generalmajor for this accomplishment, and when the war concluded, was placed in charge of the central Equestrian garrison, operating out of the place of his greatest victory.\n\nThe trials of peace, however, are a completely different beast than the horrors of war. Generalmajor Jachs has more familiarity with ponies than most of the changelings under his command, and as such sympathizes with their plight. But with the changelings' hold on the city tenuous at best, a firm hoof may be needed to maintain it. The Generalmajor now faces a true test of his morals: can he hold Canterlot without resorting to wanton violence and bloodshed?§!"

With her family's resources and access to nearly anything she desired, Alcippe flitted from interest to interest, at times overwhelmed with the possibilities ahead of her and unable to choose what to dedicate her life to. After attending university in Vesalipolis and changing majors three times, Alcippe enlisted in the Heer just in time for the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where she participated as a hoof soldier assigned to Unterfeldwebel Jachs' company. After she and her company successfully captured the Element Bearers and brought them to Queen Chrysalis, Alcippe found herself promoted in the reorganization of the Heer following the defeat. She was given the choice between staying with Jachs' 96. Infanterie or accepting a position into the Queen's Guard, but decided to stay with her superior officer in 1002 as a member of his staff. This relationship would prove to be a fruitful one, as Oberst Jachs and Major Alcippe would successfully take Canterlot using a carefully executed strategy they developed, and when Oberst Jachs, then a Generalmajor, was assigned the task of garrisoning and holding Canterlot, he tapped Alcippe to come with him as his second in command. Alcippe, now an Oberstleutnant and a great admirer of her superior officer, finds herself tasked with executing Generalmajor Jachs' decisions throughout the entirety of central Equestria. The rigors of the Pax Chrysalia will put her convictions to the test, and she looks to Jachs to steer them both right as they navigate the tough task of maintaining the changelings' hold over Equestria.§!"

His family consisted of poor dockyard workers, largely ostracized from society, and Marsilio initially grew up resentful of the deer and ponies in the city who viewed his kind with deep and unflinching suspicion. Determined to make a better life for himself, Marsilio made frequent use of the city's largest library, educating himself in all manner of topics he did not otherwise have access to in the city. His efforts paid off, and he was able to attend the University of Acornage in 981, where changeling and pony scholars worked in close tandem. There, he would meet a young stallion by the name of Spectrograph, and after becoming unlikely best friends, Marsilio's worldview on ponies and deer changed. The two graduated at the top of their class, and Marsilio left Acornage to venture to Vesalipolis to further his studies with his new worldview in mind. Marsilio excelled in Vesalipolis, earning his doctorate and originally finding work along the Changeling-Olenian border as a medical doctor. He even planned on returning to Vanhoover to continue his work and provide medical treatment for changelings in the multicultural city.\n\nThat all changed following the failed Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where in the aftermath, pony riots torched much of the ethnically changeling quarters of Vanhoover, sending refugees fleeing into the Changeling Lands. Instead of returning to Vanhoover, Marsilio decided to look after the refugees fleeing into Vesalipolis, where he eventually attracted the attention of the Royal Changeling Heer due to his expertise in changeling, deer, and pony biology and anatomy. Marsilio would quickly rise through the ranks as he worked to modernize changeling love extraction, eventually becoming surgeon-general of the Royal Changeling Heer by the time Olenia became a protectorate of the Hegemony. He would eventually move his headquarters to Seaddle, right across the Luna Bay from his old home in Vanhoover, and become much more closely involved in the Pax Chrysalia with his work on love extraction. His efforts to improve love extraction to be a painless and ethical process for the Hegemony's new subjects eventually put him in contact with Generalmajor Jachs, and after finding that they share many of the same ideas on treating ponies with respect, the two changelings became fast friends. Now the two seek to do what many consider impossible: turn the Pax Chrysalia from a brutal oppression of ponies and deer to a cooperation between the hives and their fallen foes.§!"

From a young age, he was groomed to take over the sprawling corporation, a powerhouse that his father worked tirelessly to improve and expand until his death in 1005 from an automobile accident. At the young age of 26, Finicus found himself thrust into command of the Hegemony's largest producer of heavy machinery, a situation that would have broken many less competent changelings. Finicus, however, had been prepared well by his father, and immediately turned Main Hives' attention to the wars to come. By forcing out competitors, hiring all the best talent they could afford, and filing thousands upon thousands of defensive and speculative patents, Finicus turned MHI into the greatest industrial giant in the Changeling Hives, and established its total monopoly in the area of heavy industry. Then, sensing the wars to come, Finicus made MHI practically inseparable from the Royal Changeling Heer, providing it reliable and cheap equipment in exchange for lucrative exclusive contracts. By the time the Great War started, every machine that was used to make every part of every last bit of war materiel, from the transmission of trucks to the treads of tanks to the bolts of rifles, was built and provided by Main Hive Industries to the factories that kept the war effort going. Finicus had become unfathomably personally wealthy as a result of his successful business deals, finding himself as one of the richest changelings in all of the Hegemony, yet even then, something eluded him.\n\nFinicus had never wanted to take over MHI. As a grub, he had been more interested in artistic pursuits, but those were quickly shut down by his father. Now, at the conclusion of the Great War, Finicus has captained one of the most successful companies to ever exist to untold success, yet even that has failed to satisfy him. In meeting Generalmajor Jachs, however, Finicus has found an opportunity to turn Main Hive Industry's vast resources from producing weapons of death to the tools of peace. Maybe, just maybe, Finicus will be able to find personal satisfaction in making the Pax Chrysalia a better time to live, and not a worse one.§!"

Born far above the ground in the city of Cloudsdale, Second Wind came from a long line of soldiers, dating all the way back to the genesis of Nightmare Moon almost a thousand years prior. Soldiering was in his blood, much like it is for most of the pegasus race, and he immediately enlisted with the Royal Guard upon turning 18 in 994.\n\nThe next decade would be a busy one for Second Wind. He was present in Canterlot during the infamous Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where after a brief clash with changeling soldiers on the outskirts of the city, he rallied together members of the Guard that were patrolling the perimeter at the time of the attack and organized a counterattack with the aim of retaking the royal palace. Thanks to Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, such a counterattack was unnecessary, and Second Wind's chance to prove himself came and went without him being able to seize it. Not being from a noble house like many of the unicorn members, Second Wind found his chances for a promotion slim and practically nonexistent. He seemed destined to spend his years in the service on the lower echelons looking up, where the officer corps was staffed by nobles that more often than not bought their way in using their names and familial pedigree. There was perhaps no surprise to be found there that Second Wind, born from a proud military family, had little chance of advancement when the unicorn nobility treated the organization as just another political body to dominate.\n\nThat changed during the Great War, where the mass mobilization of Equestria and the bloody fighting that followed gave Second Wind the chance he desired to prove his worth. He fought valiantly throughout the war, but even then, his long-overdue promotion only came when the fighting was all but lost and the Royal Guard was desperately looking for officers to fill its ranks. When Equestria capitulated and the new Royal and Imperial Canterlot Guard was established, Second Wind defected and became the head of the organization. Now, Second Wind watches the Pax Chrysalia be enforced on his species, himself serving as a tool to the changelings to keep his people under control. How long can a proud pegasus soldier bow to a foreign conqueror and keep his own kind in chains before something has to give?§!"

Gloriosa is the matron of the Cornucopia Society, an organization that has its roots in a long-since faded unicorn supremacy movement, but now caters to unicorns looking for a form of escapism from the tolls of the world by functioning as a drug den. Many lesser nobles are frequent visitors of the Society, operating out of the old Hotel Calihornia, and the Society has found a way to manufacture a powerful drug made from a pony's love, fashioned in a way that not even changelings have been able to perfect. It is unclear how closely the Society is or was involved in resistance activity in Canterlot before joining forces with Generalmajor Jachs, but the society is undoubtedly powerful and influential, and if Gloriosa has an interest in something happening in her city, she always finds a way to put a hoof on the scale and give it a little tip.

Before the war, love could not be reliably stored after its extraction, as it would lose its potency within minutes of being drawn from a victim. The traditional solution to this dilemma was to envelop hapless victims in cocoons, where their dreams would produce a steady and reliable source of love for a hive. However, love harvested in this manner can often be tainted by the context of the victim's dreams, and the victims could not survive being trapped in cocoons and harvested for more than a few months. Nowadays, however, the changeling industry giants have found ways to extract and contain love without it losing its potency, allowing it to be harvested from far-away towns and brought directly back to factories, where it is further refined and processed using recently rediscovered magical runes and processes to remove any unpleasant emotions that may have slipped into the love during collection. In this manner, the love that is now widely available to the hives is purer, stronger, and much cheaper to acquire than ever before.§!"

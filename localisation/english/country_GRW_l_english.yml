GRW_enter_modern_age:0 "Enter The Modern Age"
GRW_enter_modern_age_desc:0 "With our industrial reforms complete, we are on the precipice of making our mark upon the world as a whole.

GRW_open_up_schools2_desc:0 "With our initial education reforms making good progress, we are prepared to open voluntary schools, where our people can both learn, and volunteer to teach subjects that they've already grasped, or learn easily.

GRW_protectionism:0 "Isolationism"
GRW_protectionism_desc:0 "We should not concern ourselves with those around us, as they have no desire to follow our ways, and our people have no desire to spread our ways by force- especially so soon after our bloody civil war with the monarchists.

GRW_annex_Lushi:0 "The Northern Expeditions"
GRW_annex_Lushi_desc:0 "We should begin with our expansionist efforts by striking [LUS.GetNameDef], who had, during the civil war, supportive partisans that were ready to die for our cause.

GRW_demand_salt_markt_desc:0 "The province of Saltmarkt once belonged to us when we were subjugated under the Brodfield's Monarchy.

GRW_red_knights_desc:0 "Whilst the knights are an institution of the old monarchy, there's no reason we cannot make our own knightly orders, loyal to our goals and aims, and the peoples of our socialist state. Such as force would be a boon to any army, and would heighten our military prestige."

GRW_artillery_effort:0 "Develop Our Supportive Cannons"
GRW_artillery_effort_desc:0 "We have spent time focusing on our smaller firearms. However, it is now time to focus on larger weapons, such as cannons and howitzers. Infantry weapons are fine and all, but artillery is a great boon to any and all forces we put into the field."

GRW_military_use_of_magic:0 "Military Use Of Magic"
GRW_military_use_of_magic_desc:0 "While we griffons are unable to cast spells in the way that ponies and their kind are capable of doing so, there are still many military-applicable uses of magic and the like that we are quite capable of using, and to develop such tools and weapons would be an excellent idea."

GRW_aircraft:0 "Our Own Plane"

GRW_air_experience_desc:0 "We should train our pilots in the ways of modern air warfare, which we've come to learn by watching Stalliongradian air force pilots during our visits to the pony country, as well as a few ex-Stallionist pilots themselves who have offered to help train our quite green pilots in exchange for various favours."

GRW_foreign_tools:0 "Import Of Industrial Machines"
GRW_foreign_tools_desc:0 "We should take the time to make deals with our more advanced neighbours both on this continent and across the water, to improve upon our industrial capacity by importing more advanced tools that we can then integrate into our industry.

GRW_excavation_of_march:0 "Develop The Marsh"
GRW_excavation_of_march_desc:0 "The terrible marsh is, as the name implies, quite terrible.

prywhen.8.d:0 "We can call a group of partisans for an uprising in the enemy territory, and secretly send a number of our weapons to them. The question is, which region of Brodfeld would be best for this operation?"

prywhen.16.t:0 "Search For The Prince!"
prywhen.16.d:0 "We must not allow Prywhen to return to the oppression of a king ever again. To this end, we must hunt down and capture the heir to the throne of Brodfeld as soon as possible."
prywhen.16.a:0 "The Hunt is on."

prywhen.17.t:0 "The Prince Has Escaped!"
prywhen.17.d:0 "After eluding our capture for weeks, we had finally managed to corner the Prince while attempting to leave the country. Unfortunately, his loyalist guards managed to delay the arrest, and his current whereabouts are unknown. It can be safely assumed, however, that he has left the country and has found shelter in the court of some other tyrannical regime. The Prince has eluded our grasp."
prywhen.17.a:0 "Damn that blue-blooded swine!"

prywhen.18.t:0 "The Prince Was Killed!"
prywhen.18.d:0 "Our police finally managed to track down the prince in hideout near Twelt. Our special forces stormed the cave, and in the ensuring firefight, the Prince and all his loyalists were killed."
prywhen.18.a:0 "So the bastard's dead? A shame we didn't capture him alive."

prywhen.19.t:0 "The Prince Was Captured!"
prywhen.19.d:0 "After citizens reported seeing a griffon matching the Prince's description in the port of Sydia, our police managed to stop him from boarding a ship bound for Equestria in the last minute. The Prince was arrested and imprisoned immediately. What shall we do with him?"
prywhen.19.a:0 "Hang him publicly in [GRW.Capital.GetName]!"
prywhen.19.b:0 "Just execute him. No need for a show."
prywhen.19.c:0 "Let him rot in jail."

prywhen.20.t:0 "Find The King!"
prywhen.20.d:0 "The crimes committed by the rulers of Brodfeld are unforgivable. It is of the utmost importance that the former King Kloseu be captured and put on trial for his crimes. We must not allow the tyrant to escape justice, and hence we shall immediately instruct all echelons of power in Prywhen to find and arrest him."
prywhen.20.a:0 "We will find him."

prywhen.21.t:0 "The King Has Escaped!"
prywhen.21.d:0 "After weeks of fruitless search, we believed that we had finally cornered King Kloseu in the home of a family sympathetic to the royalist cause. It was soon revealed however, that the individual our police was tracking was not, in fact, the King, but a double with striking similarities to Kloseu. Under torture, the double revealed that his sole purpose was to throw us off the King's trail, and that he was, in all likelihood, already far from [GRW.GetAdjective] territory. The King has eluded our grasp, most likely for good."
prywhen.21.a:0 "Damned Fools! This is a disaster!"

prywhen.22.t:0 "The Tyrant Was Killed!"
prywhen.22.d:0 "After an intricate search of the royal palace, it was revealed that the King was still hiding in his secret chambers in the castle walls. Although he did not resist arrest, our soldiers could not contain their anger and beat the King to the brink of death. Sadly, he died hours later in the Kivessin Central Hospital."
prywhen.22.a:0 "Good riddance anyway."

prywhen.23.t:0 "The Tyrant Was Captured!"
prywhen.23.d:0 "After weeks of hunting, our police forces finally caught a break in their search for King Kloseu. Apparently he was planning to flee the Continent and was all ready to leave via airplane, but because of poor weather his departure was delayed for a day. Police caught wind of his plans, and raided his hideout in Twelt. Though most of his guards were killed, the King himself surrendered without a struggle. He is now safely locked away and awaiting his fate."
prywhen.23.a:0 "Death is the only option for him!"
prywhen.23.b:0 "Imprison him for now."

prywhen.24.t:0 "Find The Monarchist Supporters!"
prywhen.24.d:0 "We may have been victorious in the civil war, but monarchists and counter-revolutionaries still exist in Prywhen. If we wish to secure all that we have accomplished here, these reactionary elements must be dealt with. How big shall our effort to find these traitors be? "
prywhen.24.a:0 "Find them at any cost!"
prywhen.24.b:0 "A moderate effort should be enough."
prywhen.24.c:0 "We cannot spare much for this."
prywhen.24.e:0 "They are not important."
prywhen.24.f:0 "Counter-revolutionaries? What nonsense."

prywhen.25.t:0 "The Revolution Is Safe!"
prywhen.25.d:0 "After weeks of searching, we believe we have finally captured and imprisoned all reactionary elements within the nation. They will now be put to trial, and the worst of them shall never see the light of day again. At this point, it seems highly unlikely that counter-revolutionary forces will ever be able to organise a militia in Prywhen again."
prywhen.25.a:0 "Great News!"

prywhen.26.t:0 "Royalists In The Country!"
prywhen.26.d:0 "Though the efforts of our police and military have been very great, we have not managed to capture all of the royalist filth that still remains in Prywhen. This will certainly cause problems for us in the future."
prywhen.26.a:0 "Damn those traitors!"

prywhen.27.t:0 "Counter Revolution!"
prywhen.27.d:0 "Our efforts to quell reactionary and counter-revolutionary activities have been too low, it seems. Many royalists and fascists are beginning to form militias again, fighting a guerrilla war against our state. We must rally our forces to deal with this."
prywhen.27.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

prywhen.31.t:0 "Industrialisation Progress!"
prywhen.31.d:0 "Our recent efforts to improve the industrial capabilities of Prywhen have born fruit, and our economy and industry have improved by a large amount. This will surely benefit the nation in the future."
prywhen.31.a:0 "We reap that which we sowed."

prywhen.32.t:0 "Our Industry Grows!"
prywhen.32.d:0 "Our economy has improved a lot in the last years, and we are now almost at the industrial and economical level as the western Griffonia states. Through careful investments into our industrial sector, we should be able to improve our economy even further."
prywhen.32.a:0 "The Revolution will prevail!"

prywhen.33.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution Has Failed!"
prywhen.33.d:0 "After months of fighting, arrests and imprisonments, it seems we have finally managed to stop the counter-revolution in it's tracks. This will allow us to improve the ideological foundation of Prywhen and finally initiate a return to normality."
prywhen.33.a:0 "About Time!"

prywhen.35.t:0 "Our Industry Has Grown!"
prywhen.35.d:0 "After years of industrial and economical development and expansion, our industrial potential has finally reached the levels of the major western griffon states! This clearly shows that communist economics are the most efficient ever to be devised."
prywhen.35.a:0 "The Revolution has prevailed!"

prywhen.36.t:0 "Possible Support From The [LUS.GetName]"
prywhen.36.d:0 "Currently there are several communist groups in Lushi. We shall send our envoy and beg for their support in our final push in this civil war."
prywhen.36.a:0 "Yes."

prywhen.37.t:0 "Possible Support From Gryphus"
prywhen.37.d:0 "There are several partisan rebel groups hiding out in the forests of the northern part of Gryphus. We must send an envoy and ask them to join us in the final push in our own civil war. It is a much better option than fighting in the forests endlessly with victory nowhere in sight."
prywhen.37.a:0 "Great."

prywhen.38.t:0 "Possible Support From The Gryphian Host"
prywhen.38.d:0 "There are many groups of griffons who are dead tired of the despotic government of the Gryphian Host and their endless and useless attacks on the River Federation. They will surely join us in our fight for freedom if we promise to liberate their nation next."
prywhen.38.a:0 "Yes."

prywhen.39.t:0 "Support For The Prywhenian Liberation Army"
prywhen.39.d:0 "We may provide support for [GRW.GetNameDef] in their struggle for freedom, shall we? While this will obviously cost us griffonpower that could be used elsewhere, the experience gained by our volunteers could prove to be invaluable."
prywhen.39.a:0 "Yes."
prywhen.39.b:0 "No."

prywhen.40.t:0 "Volunteers Arrived!"
prywhen.40.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has arranged for more volunteer brigades to help us in our struggle to spread the revolution."
prywhen.40.a:0 "Fantastic!"

prywhen.41.t:0 "Claims On Saltmarkt!"
prywhen.41.d:0 "Saltmarkt is a rightful part of our nation, and if we have to use force to get it back, then so be it."
prywhen.41.a:0 "It will be ours once more!"

prywhen.42.t:0 "Famine Erupts!"
prywhen.42.d:0 "With the civil war dragging on and on, the devastation has caused our agriculture to collapse. We are running out of stored supplies, and hunger slowly envelopes the countryside."
prywhen.42.a:0 "Damnation!"

prywhen.43.t:0 "Ravaging Hunger"
prywhen.43.d:0 "The ongoing famine continues to ravage the countryside. Many are dying, and there are reports of griffons resorting to cannibalism in order to stay alive. It is not expected that the situation will improve anytime soon."
prywhen.43.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

prywhen.44.t:0 "Open Up The Lord's Cellars!"
prywhen.44.d:0 "The former King of Brodfeld has a huge private larder. Opening it up and distributing it to the public will reduce the effects of the ongoing famine for some time. However we will need to reform our agriculture to be able to fully get rid of the famine."
prywhen.44.a:0 "The Swine, hoarding food during a famine..."

prywhen.45.t:0 "The Famine Is Over!"
prywhen.45.d:0 "With our agriculture finally modernised, we are now able to centralise our food production and distribute it equally among the citizens. This will finally end this famine, but its effects will likely be felt for decades still."

Sharing bread with the foals, negotiating for the elderly, and always trying to sneak a little extra ration when times turned tough. When he came of age, he decided the best way he could help was to join the armored corps as an officer. The new invention of tanks was fascinating, the peak of technology surely! But it was not to be, as many other like minded ponies had already applied, and the government was not easy to persuade without a higher standing. He was instead put into the officer school for infantry, which wasn't what he wanted. But if it was the best way to protect ponies, he would do it. As time went on, however, the only protecting he did was for the books and sidewalks. Growing increasingly frustrated, he looked for other places that could use his skills. His ears and wings led him to the griffonian continent, and word of beak led him to Prywhen. There he is able to make great use of his skills in the war-torn countryside.

JRR_legacy_of_serfdom_desc:0 "Serfdom in Westkeep has a long and storied history, considered a backwater of the realm, agricultural serfs were a major part of the economy. While the practice was officially abolished within the Marquisate in the year 978, the rural nature of the region and the entrenched nobility that controls much of it means that while the system may be gone, the issues remain."

JRR_right_of_counsel_desc:0 "There is no doubt that all republican movements stem at least partially from the dissatisfaction of being ruled without a form of representation.

### Focuses ###
JRR_a1:0 "The Patriotic Fiefdom"
JRR_a1_desc:0 "The MPA are the true warriors of Aquileia, true and strong. Ready to do anything to fight for a pure future for this land. We are a diverse group, but we are entirely united behind this great task, out with the King."
JRR_a2:0 "The Fighting Coqs"
JRR_a2_desc:0 "Those rulers in Aquila do not understand the citizens of Westkeep. Those urbanists look down on us and poor and dirty, when it is they who have been corrupted. The aristocratic elites have put a sheet over their eyes and corrupted them with Herzlandish nonsense. We will restore the true Aquileia, the Aquileia of the peasant."
JRR_a3:0 "The Cercle Closes"
JRR_a3_desc:0 "The time is now, my brothers and sisters. The Cercle is ready to fight for the freedom of nature against the corruption of the land. Arcturius looks down upon us fondly, and blesses our fight. Our freedom will be won by the blood, so let us begin."
JRR_a4:0 "The Colonel's Forces"
JRR_a4_desc:0 "The Colonel is a rallying point for the true patriots of the MPA who refuse to work with the Herzlandish sympathizer Rodier. Every day griffons and ponies from accross the land arrive to be trained by the MPA. Officially of course, these recruits are loyal monarchists. We'll show them how much of a lie that really is."
JRR_a5:0 "Refurbish Township Fairgrounds"
JRR_a5_desc:0 "The fairground has long been the center of life in Westkeep. Life in the town has become corrupted by values from the capital, and so we must restore what was lost. The fairground shall be once again the center of the community, with freecreatures of all sorts meeting to exchange goods and participate in their Westkeep heritage."
JRR_a6:0 "From Guilds To Unions"
JRR_a6_desc:0 "The guilds have long been our allies against the nobles. For generations, the true creatures of Westkeep tried to wrest control of the economy from the corrupt nobles, to protect the prosperity of the common griffons and ponies. But now their model has become outdated, we shall help them by working to reforming their guild structure into a union one, to continue their fight in the modern age."
JRR_a7:0 "Prioritise Agrarian Reforms"
JRR_a7_desc:0 "The age of serfs still hangs heavy over Westkeep, when the nobles of the land tried to force the peasants to adopt the despotic ways of the herzland. Their estates dominated the land, and the peasant cried out for someone to save them. The revolutionaries answered, but soon they too were corrupted. Now it falls to us to cut the final shackles from their claws and hooves and to right the order of the land."
JRR_a8:0 "Storm The Castles"
JRR_a8_desc:0 "The nobles are hiding something in their castles. We know not what, it could be weapons, money, the Marquess perhaps, but they have become even more secretive of late. We must blow open the door, expose them all to the justice of the people."
JRR_a9:0 "Rouse The Peasants"
JRR_a9_desc:0 "The peasants understand! They know the pain they have been put through at the claws of the unfaithful, those who profess their love for an impure King and a false society. Soon they shall know even more, but for now, they are ready to fight. And that is enough."
JRR_a10:0 "Gather The Hunters"
JRR_a10_desc:0 "Rouge Guirlande's natural society and hiking group are known as the Tempète de Feu. A relatively simple name for what lies beneath. For they do not hunt nature, but those who wish to harm it. Let the corrupted come, they shall pay the price."
JRR_a11:0 "The Bulwark Strategy"
JRR_a11_desc:0 "Our land can be easily defended, with rivers and mountains protecting our heartland, we can hold out against the forces of reaction and dégénération."
JRR_a12:0 "Our Talons Bared"
JRR_a12_desc:0 "Odds are we will end up surrounded during the revolution. Rila sympathizes with the revolution, but they are just as corrupted as the monarchy, and so they must too be wiped out. The only way to achieve a total victory for our forces is to strike out, to bring down each of the vassals before bringing down the King in Aquila himself. "
JRR_a13:0 "Reform Township Citizenship Laws"
JRR_a13_desc:0 "To be a citizen in a Westkeep town under the noble regime, they placed the ridiculous restriction of needing to own a stone house within a city along with other insane limits. To deny the right of citizenship to creatures is to deny them their nation and their very spirit. This wrong must be righted by true patriots."
JRR_a14:0 "Standardise Westkeepian Statute Laws"
JRR_a14_desc:0 "Westkeep's legal code is bound up in centuries of royal decrees, Marquisatal ordinances, and the rights of the old nobility. With Colette's help, we shall sweep that all away and implement a new law code following our principles of fraternité and the peasants' right."
JRR_a15:0 "Offer Compensation To The Landlords"
JRR_a15_desc:0 "While the idea disgusts us, sometimes we must take a peaceful approach to the landlords of Westkeep. Some of them are reasonable creatures, simply blinded by urbanist lies. And while some of the money we give them may one day be turned against us, to avoid a chance of violence is a noble pursuit in its own right."
JRR_a16:0 "An Unrelenting Tide Of Coqs"
JRR_a16_desc:0 "It is time my brothers and sisters! Unleash the Coqs accross the province, the nobles cannot stop all of us! Coqiste organizers have drummed up support from the peasantry and Colette is ready to make the decree. The land of the nobles shall be theirs no longer, it shall be overrun with the true patriots of Aquileia."
JRR_a17:0 "Operation: Broken Lance"
JRR_a17_desc:0 "The decadent and pompous nobles are one of the Marquess' only backers in the region. They are an entrenched group, having near total control over Westkeep for centuries. But we put the first chip in their armor when we took over the province, and now it is time to deal the final blow. The nobility must be purged."
JRR_a18:0 "Operation: Outlaw"
JRR_a18_desc:0 "The outlaw Marquess must be discovered and made to pay for the crimes she has committed against Westkeep and all of Aquelia. And once the head of the snake is cut off, we can be sure the loyal servants of the MPA will have full control over the province for... no reason in particular."
JRR_a19:0 "The Bunloe-Angaz Line"
JRR_a19_desc:0 "The mountains and rivers of our land can form an impenetrable line of defense with some effort. Bunkers will line the hills, and machine-gun nests will stop the invaders in their tracks. We will never surrender this bastion of purity to the corrupted!"
JRR_a20:0 "The Camaris Trail"
JRR_a20_desc:0 "We've contacted a group of smugglers from Camris in Pomovarra who can plug us into a network stretching from Flowena to Skyfall, securing us a stable supply of weapons for our fight."
JRR_a21:0 "Optimise Logistics"
JRR_a21_desc:0 "Railroads in Westkeep are far behind the rest of the nation, and aren't good enough to get the supplies we need to the front. We need to improve our logistical structure to be ready to fight back against the reactionary forces."
JRR_a22:0 "Shock Squad Tactics"
JRR_a22_desc:0 "Squads of our most loyal and skilled soldiers will lead the assault on enemy positions to create opportunities for the rest of the army to achieve their goals. They are our sword and shield, the vanguard of a new army and a new nation."
JRR_a23:0 "Utilise The Marginaliste"
JRR_a23_desc:0 "There is a class of creatures at the edge of our society, those who do not fit into the social order of the urbanists. They live in the cities but have no homes, they wander the streets looking for a purpose. They are the traveling merchants, the prostituées, those who society rejects. They are the consequences of the urbanist dégénération that has overtaken our land, and we can show them a brighter future."
JRR_a24:0 "Barter With The Crafthounds Of Angaz-Barak"
JRR_a24_desc:0 "The hold of Angaz-Barak has been a long supporter of the nobles of Westkeep. Their relationship runs so deep that it is said their leader is privy to more of the secrets of the land than the Marquess herself. Even more unfortunately, their hostility to our movement is well known. Let us pay them a visit for some negotiations."
JRR_a25:0 "Farmers Not Serfs"
JRR_a25_desc:0 "Give the land unto the tiller, and they shall prosper. To deprive a creature of their Arcturius-given right to land is to deprive them of their livelihood and culture. This is the final goal of our quest, to return to citizens of Westkeep to the land, which shall return them to their authentic culture, their true heritage, the genuine spirit of holy Aquileia."
JRR_a26:0 "Anti-Landlord Proscriptions"
JRR_a26_desc:0 "Let the landlords bleed! They are the tools of the decadent urbanists by their own will or by the corruption in their blood. Only their deaths will constitute repentance for their generational sins. Their consorting with herzlanders will be their death sentence."
JRR_a27:0 "Operation: Backfire"
JRR_a27_desc:0 "The forest is our weapon, the rivers our shield, and the mountains are our armor. And if the enemy is to take them, we shall fight on our own terf. Tunnels, mines, traps, kill zones, all are justified tools for the defense of this land. It has protected us and showed us the way, so we shall give everything to pay back that favor."
JRR_a28:0 "Establish The Partisan Central Command"
JRR_a28_desc:0 "We are outnumbered and outgunned. We will likely lose land to the invader, but there is still hope. Our brave warriors will fight behind their lines and strike their logistics. Governed by one central council led by Rouge Guirlande, they will become our warriors in the dark, our final line of defense."
JRR_a29:0 "Rifle Modernisation"
JRR_a29_desc:0 "We don't have the quality of weapons the central government does. But we have sympathizers in the army, and we can get a shipment of modern rifles sent to us, along with the designs for how to make more."
JRR_a30:0 "The Regional Emergency Grain Depot"
JRR_a30_desc:0 "The war will inevitably do great harm to our citizens. This is a regretful necessity in the age of national cleansing. So we must prepare for this, and try our best to alleviate the suffering of the people in these times of violence."
JRR_a31:0 "Bite And Hold Tactics"
JRR_a31_desc:0 "Extreme aggression followed by a defensive pivot, to bite and to hold. That is what we will need to do for our army to win this war. It will be a long and hard fight, but it will all be worth it in the end when our army storms the city of Aquila, ready to free the nation from its shackles."

JRR_b1:0 "The Marquess' Last Stand"
JRR_b1_desc:0 "The time has come for us to reign in these republican traitors once and for all. The Marquess and her associates will fight these agents of chaos with beak and claw to finally destroy the malignant cancer that is the MPA."
JRR_b2:0 "Noblesse Oblige"
JRR_b2_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our endeavours against the scum that roam our lands, our most reliable support basis must once again rise to the occasion. The remaining nobles shall finally come out of hiding, lest they allow themselves to be ground into dust by our enemies."
JRR_b3:0 "Sharpen The Blade"
JRR_b3_desc:0 "Violence is the answer to a number of our pressing concerns at this time, but we must use this tool with careful discretion if we hope to truly deny our foes support. We shall work swiftly and quietly, before it is too late."
JRR_b4:0 "Aurélien's Schemes"
JRR_b4_desc:0 "Westkeep has little in the way of consistent military organisation and the forces loyal to us are no exception. Aurélien has been tasked with ensuring that, when the time comes, our soldiery will stand and fight; whatever that broad demand may entail."
JRR_b5:0 "The Right Of Counsel"
JRR_b5_desc:0 "Much as it may pain the Marquess, some concessions are necessary for the stability of the nation and the functionality of the state. The right of council maximises the positive popular reception whilst giving away as little actual power as possible; a perfect solution."
JRR_b6:0 "Affirm The Pact Of Angaz-Barak"
JRR_b6_desc:0 "The hounds of Angaz-Barak have knelt at the talons of our nobility for many centuries and are openly distasteful of the MPA. Cooperation with our loyal dogs is not only favourable, but honourable and proper."
JRR_b7:0 "Fight Against Mob Rule"
JRR_b7_desc:0 "A violent mob is no better than a violent monarch, collective responsibility simply makes placing the blame more of a challenge. We must resist these blatantly idiotic ideals if we wish to run an efficient bureaucracy."
JRR_b8:0 "The Treachey Of Colette"
JRR_b8_desc:0 "Few foresaw her betrayal when the MPA first began branching off into its regional groups, but now her punishment is sure to arrive. Her militarism is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the republican movement and will be destroyed whenver the opportunity arises."
JRR_b9:0 "The Demagoguery Of Fervante"
JRR_b9_desc:0 "Fervante was always a troublemaker in the the world of politics, overt and brazen even at the best of times. Now it seems that the very same firey attitude is being used to spout frankly ridiculous right-wing theory. We will make efforts to suppress this obtuse propaganda."
JRR_b10:0 "The Madness Of Guirlande"
JRR_b10_desc:0 "How Guirlande has any influence in the republican movement is beyond even the Marquess, but her power and surprisingly large following should nevertheless be suppressed where possible. Their outlandish and frankly insane teachings must not leave their ranks under any circumstances."
JRR_b11:0 "The Westkeep Insurgent Army"
JRR_b11_desc:0 "The obvious solution to the organisational issue is that we should proliferate a system of autonomy within the armed forces. Though the soldiery may lack some discipline, a campaign of brutal guerilla warfare shall be undoubtably effective."
JRR_b12:0 "The Flower Of Aquileian Chivalry"
JRR_b12_desc:0 "Structure, discipline and modern chivalry are the three key points for the restructuring of the military. Aurélien understands that even with an unfavourable doctrinal choice, winning over the hearts and minds of the people through courage and valour is more important than entirely decimating the enemy."
JRR_b13:0 "Enforce The Statute Of 980" #The act in which the Marquess formally recognised the abolition of Serfdom in Westkeep
JRR_b13_desc:0 "Reform is integral to the betterment of any state and nation. Though it may mean less power for the nobility and the Marquess, enforcing the abolition of serfdom is necessary for progress and stability. Let the nobles may grumble about their profits, they will see her wisdom in time."
JRR_b14:0 "Enforce The Marquisatal Mineral Right" #Basically, the Marquess has the exclusive right of profit and taxation of the various mining communities within Westkeep
JRR_b14_desc:0 "If we are to laud over these lands, we must secure resources and the facilities with which to utilise them. All the Marquess needs to do is exercise a firm yet careful claw over the various mining communities and her rights to their profits and produce."
JRR_b15:0 "Daggers In The Dark" 
JRR_b15_desc:0 "A quick end to our various enemies is the simplest solution to our problems. A gun, a knife or a vial of poison will always be more effective than compromising with the peasant leaders, especially if we can pin their deaths on the detestable republicans."
JRR_b16:0 "The Power Of Persuasion"
JRR_b16_desc:0 "A little bribery here, a small promise there and and a spoken agreement between various members of the peasant leadership will be more than enough to sway their loyalties. Violence is only necessary if the traitors in the MPA are involved."
JRR_b17:0 "Fight Back Against The Brown Mob"
JRR_b17_desc:0 "If we wish to contest the currently unobstructed propaganda of the republican scum, we will have to take the fight directly to them. Orchestrated street brawls and public displays of hostility to their cause will worsen their public image substantially whilst giving them a bloody nose."
JRR_b18:0 "The Paladins Of Aquileia"
JRR_b18_desc:0 "If we wish to combat Guirlande and the Cercle, we will need a dedicated force to counter their unholy operations. "
JRR_b19:0 "Embrace Asymmetric Warfare"
JRR_b19_desc:0 "If we wish to increase the effectiveness of our asymmetrical tactics then we must embrace slash-and-burn strategy and deliberate targeting of infrastructure. Not one inch of Westkeep will be safe for the detestable republican rabble, not even the roads and rail lines."
JRR_b20:0 "The Feathisian Connection"
JRR_b20_desc:0 "If there is one reliable source of weapons, it would be Aurel's husband and his connections as a Feathisian noble. With just a little funding in the right claws and some promised favours with the right officials we can gain for ourselves a consistent supply of weaponry in the short term."
JRR_b21:0 "Centralise The Levies"
JRR_b21_desc:0 "With proper organisation, it has become apparent that the leavies are massively overencumbered with soldiers. Aurélien has had the excellent idea to cut the excess manpower and use it to create several new divisions of a similar organisation whilst using the apparent enlargement of the force as propaganda."
JRR_b22:0 "The Last Joust"
JRR_b22_desc:0 "These old knights, once retired from service, will now face again the enemies of the state in glorious and noble combat. The Marquess herself has seen fit to visit them and renew their knightly vows, which has cemented their respect and loyalty."
JRR_b23:0 "Clarify Aristocratic Contributions" #A Contribution in feudal/modern era kingdoms was essentially the official term for the taxes (whatever form they may take) that a noble was suppose to pay to their liege lord
JRR_b23_desc:0 "The current system of taxation is so ancient that nobles frequently use age-old loopholes to circumvent contributing to the state in any meaningful way. We shall rewrite these obscure laws in an effort to modernise and empower the state, whether the decadent landowners like it or not."
JRR_b24:0 "The Pragmatic Sanction" #This one is a bit confusing, but the general point is that while the Monarchy owns all of the mineral wealth beneath Westkeep the Diamond Dogs of Angaz-Barak are allowed to use that wealth in perpetuety
JRR_b24_desc:0 "One great convenience of convention is that unique agreements are not only frequent but acceptable. Though the diamond dogs will no longer legally own any of the resources that are extracted from their lands, we may permit them to access the relevant funds and materials at any time. This will grant us an even greater supplies of war materials for the brewing conflict."
JRR_b25:0 "Agrarian Colonialism" #Essentially the Marquess giving money to various non-vampire landlords to buy their 'serfs' and the lands they work and setting them free afterwards
JRR_b25_desc:0 "The Marquess has decided to personally fund the purchase of remaining serfs and the land that their lords and ladies forced them to work on with the intention of incentivising further agrarian growth and profit-motivated farming as part of a broader focus on economic reform."
JRR_b26:0 "Allies Within The MPA"
JRR_b26_desc:0 "The MPA wasn't always the despicable republican organisation that it is now, supposedly many monarchists remain in their ranks from the early days. We must make efforts to contact these veterans in high places to sway their loyalties."
JRR_b27:0 "Institutional Reclamation"
JRR_b27_desc:0 "The time has come to purge the remaining republican debutants from the nooks and crannies of the state. No longer shall they hold political sway or stirr the masses with their words; we shall annihilate their deplorable organisation."
JRR_b28:0 "Honour Is For The Dead"
JRR_b28_desc:0 "Those who seek honour will earn it in battle. If we are to fight and die then we shall die in glorious battle and in the pursuit of victory, knowing that with our sacrifice our dutiful compatriots shall remember us and fight in kind!"
JRR_b29:0 "The Allwerder Battalion"
JRR_b29_desc:0 "It seems the Feathisians are so committed that we can form a division of their volunteers exclusively! Aurélien will not waste their skill and valour in reinforcing existing battalions; no, they shall be remembered for their heroism as one!"
JRR_b30:0 "Standardise Equipment"
JRR_b30_desc:0 "A good gun is a cheap and reliable one. With a single template in the claws of our manufacturers, production can dramatically increase; as is necessary for any military effort."
JRR_b31:0 "The Virtues Of Knighthood"
JRR_b31_desc:0 "A knighthood is something that any griffon should strive to achieve, a rank and role that is demonstrative of their prowess and strength. Our forces shall be as legendary as each set of claws that dutifully fights with bravery and honour is to their compatriots!"

JRR_c1:0 "The Aquileian Revolution"
JRR_c1_desc:0 "The second revolution has come and we must be ready to fight! Prepare the soldiers, organise the industry and summon the generals!"
JRR_c2:0 "Organise Insurgent Training Camps"
JRR_c2_desc:0 "Insurgents accross Westkeep are rising up to join us in our battle, we have only gains to make in training them to be a true geurilla force."
JRR_c3:0 "Calibrate The Economy"
JRR_c3_desc:0 "The economy must be ready to meet the stresses of war, bonds and requisitions will be implemented to increase state production."
JRR_c4:0 "The Cottage Arms Industry"
JRR_c4_desc:0 "Local westkeep craftscreatures, including the dogs of Angaz-Barak, have been making guns for centuries, we can tap into this easily to arm our forces."
JRR_c5:0 "The Village Conscription System"
JRR_c5_desc:0 "Organizing conscription on the local level will ensure a new stream of recruits to fight in the civil war; the more able-bodied griffons we can spare, the more likely we are to emerge victorious."
JRR_c6:0 "Morale Optimisation Initiative"
JRR_c6_desc:0 "Our soldiers must know what we fight for and be ready to sacrifice everything for it. For every griff that falls, three more shall take their place in stride!"
JRR_c7:0 "Rage Against The End"
JRR_c7_desc:0 "The end is close now, Westkeep shall not falter or fall! Tides of our enemies cannot break our resolve and shall fall before our talons!"

JRR_d1:0 "Aquileia Reforged"
JRR_d1_desc:0 "Aquileia stands ready my brothers and sisters. It has finally been brought back from the brink of destruction by our courage and sacrifice. The monarchy and the weak republicans can degrade her no longer, now is the time of rajeunissement!"
JRR_d2:0 "The Power Of Mass Politics"
JRR_d2_desc:0 "The monarchy and the elitist revolutionaries did their best to keep the people out of the public sphere. Their methods of politics tricks the citizens into thinking they had a voice when in reality they controlled everything from behind the scenes. There shall be no such smoke and mirors in our system, and citizens will participate with their voice and their bodies, to show their vigor for a new Aquileian age!"
JRR_d3:0 "Rise From The Ashes"
JRR_d3_desc:0 "After our victory in the civil war, many units of the monarchist and revolutionary armies have shown their interest in joining us. Swayed by our conviction, we have reorganized the army into new units for our next wars."
JRR_d4:0 "Dirigisme Economics"
JRR_d4_desc:0 "To let business run unrestrained is to let it fall to the influence of foreign capital. With the government's guiding hand, industry will be put to work for the nation's good, not for the good of herzlanders and other foreign agents."
JRR_d5:0 "Decentralise Economic Development"
JRR_d5_desc:0 "The regions of Aquileia know their citizens the best, no grand central authority can understand the needs of the creatures of all corners of the land. So it will be up to the regional departments to cater to the needs of their civilians with help from the political factions."
JRR_d6:0 "Idyllic Agrarianism"
JRR_d6_desc:0 "The agrarian economy is the authentic Aquileian economy, away from the cultural destruction of the herzlanders. In the countryside, the creatures of the land can prosper, and interaction with industrialized urban centers will be minimized. A peaceful life in connection with nature is the greatest reward for our citizens."
JRR_d7:0 "Syndicats Nationaux"
JRR_d7_desc:0 "Industrial organization must be as natural as possible for the economy to remain pure. Organizing our workers into patriotic syndicates owned and managed by the state, a system without the oppression of tycoons and bosses, will form a deeper connection between the laborer and his labor. This will allow the economy to flow like nature intended, without the interference of capital. "
JRR_d8:0 "Mend The Rural-Urban Divide"
JRR_d8_desc:0 "For too long, the urban has dominated the rural. The degenerate herzland-influenced cultures of Aquila, Rila, and Pridea have had their tendrils drill deep into the pristine countryside. But now that the rural has broken the shackles placed on the urban, and both of them can serve the nation as equals."
JRR_d9:0 "The Patriotic Education Act"
JRR_d9_desc:0 "The PSA by itself cannot teach the entire nation the truth of the world. It must use the tools at its disposal to show the nation the light that Aquileia must aspire to. Using the pre-existing education system to spread our message will create both opportunities for learning and devotion to the national cause."
JRR_d10:0 "The Fascist Welfare State"
JRR_d10_desc:0 "Our recent past is shameful. The monarchs hoarded food and money for themselves and lived opulent lives of decadence while the herzlanders corrupted their nation. The revolutionaries were little better, looking down from their high hills upon the starving masses. The PSA is different. We have grown up poor and struggling, we know the suffering of the peasant, and we will do everything we can to help."
JRR_d11:0 "Formalise The Jeune Patriote" #Youth Branch of the PSA
JRR_d11_desc:0 "For generations, the nation's youth have been led astray by lies from all corners. To prevent this from ever happening again, The Young Patriots will show the colts and chicks of Aquileia the national values of camaraderie, service, and loyalty, so that they may avenge the mistakes of the past."
JRR_d12:0 "Promote The Vie Naturelle Movement"
JRR_d12_desc:0 "Our lives have been artificial for too long, created by societal engineers in Griffenheim trying to suppress our culture. For too long, false gods, false kings, and false values have been embedded in our land. The Aquileian is meant to live naturally, as one with nature and their true God. A return to this way of life is a return to a glorious era of prosperity and joy for our citizens."
JRR_d13:0 "Formalise Party Demonstrations"
JRR_d13_desc:0 "Citizenship is a daily plebiscite, a regular commitment to the nation and all of its citizens. Professions of loyalty do no good if they are made without joy and enthusiasm, so the PSA will do everything to show the citizens how beautiful loyalty to the motherland can be. Festivals, parties, parades, the whole nine yards, all to bring out the patriotic bone that lies within the skeleton of all Aquileian creatures."
JRR_d14:0 "Promote The School Of Authentic History"
JRR_d14_desc:0 "Our textbooks are filled with lies, and our professors are liars or unknowing tools. We know the true history of our land, one where our honor was torn away generations ago by a foreign king who made us into slaves. Since then, we have never been free, but the PSA represents a new dawn, the renewed glory of the Aqueilian nation and its people. A fact our history will remember."
JRR_d15:0 "The Aquileio-Arcturian Thesis"
JRR_d15_desc:0 "Boreas and Eyr are foreign to our land. They were the gods of the the enslaver, Grover the First. The tyrant Emperor and our cultural enemy. He stole Arcturius from us and left his two gods to hold our culture in chains thought everlasting. But now they have been broken, and Arcturius, the great smith, warrior, and soldier, will return to his people."
JRR_d16:0 "Revanchist Fervour"
JRR_d16_desc:0 "What we have lost is great, but what we can regain is far greater. But not just in terms of land and prosperity, but also in revenge. We will one day get back at the herzlanders for what they did to us. They thought their yoke on our nation eternal, but we have since shrugged it off. They now cower in terror at our might, and lie awake at night fearful of when we shall come for them. And it will be soon."
JRR_d17:0 "The Cure Of Social Ills"
JRR_d17_desc:0 "Militarism, duty, courage. For generations, the cures for all social ills have been in front of us, but we were blind. The army has a duty to protect the state from all foreign threats, but now that the army serves the PSA with duty and courage, it can also be used for other purposes. Unemployment, dissent, and other social corruptions can be solved through service in or for the armed forces."
JRR_d18:0 "The Recruitment Department System"
JRR_d18_desc:0 "The old system of the royal levy is outdated and favors the corrupt nobility over the peasants. Implementing a new approach based on regional Departments and local military units will rejuvenate the army with fresh recruits and new ideas about war."
JRR_d19:0 "Passion And Power"
JRR_d19_desc:0 "The power to kill, to take life from the oppressor, and to give life to the nation, is the most holy power. The surge of adrenaline when red begins to flow is the most pure feeling. To fight for your culture is the most genuine struggle. Passion and power, the heat of the fight, will be the glory of our nation."
JRR_d20:0 "The Vanguard Of Aquileian Civilization"
JRR_d20_desc:0 "The PSA is the purest expression of the Aquileian spirit, the guiding force behind the modern Aquileian destiny. As our citizens once followed the Kings of old before the corruption of the royal lines by the Herzlanders, now the citizens of the nation shall look to the PSA for guidance on our noble quest for the restoration of our honor. "
JRR_d21:0 "The Légion Étrangère"
JRR_d21_desc:0 "There are others throughout the world who have similar ambitions to us. Those whose cultures have been perverted and corrupted by the herzlanders, and are prepared to bleed and die to free their countrymen from the same shackles that we have slashed off the mother country. These brave souls who have offered to serve shall be organized into the Foreign Legion, so they may fight for their own national renewal."
JRR_d22:0 "The Corps Des Séraphins"
JRR_d22_desc:0 "Like angels from above, there are those in the military ranks whose job is not to bring death to the enemy, but to prevent death from coming to their comrades. Those who work in support roles like medics and logistics have just as important of a role as the infantryman or the tanker in the grand scheme of war, and shall be supported as such."
JRR_d23:0 "The Department Of Military Innovation"
JRR_d23_desc:0 "To think is too feel, and to think about war is to feel desire for revenge. New plans must be constructed, new tactics and theories of war invented for our sacred charge against the herzlanders. And for this a new department is needed, ready to shepherd our army to inevitable victory against the greatest foe our nation has ever fought."
JRR_d24:0 "Mass Military Mechanisation"
JRR_d24_desc:0 "Aquileia possesses a robust industry for trucks and tanks, something we can use in our coming conflicts. Modern war is a mobile and armored war, something we must learn well if we are to conquer the herzland and return glory to the nation."
JRR_d25:0 "Harness The Power Of The Crystal"
JRR_d25_desc:0 "Our ponies are skilled in magic and harnessing its power, but there is another way for magic to be used. Crystal, the physical manifestation of magical essence, is rare in our land. But as we possess intimate knowledge of the workings of magic through our equine compatriots, we can still make use of it."
JRR_d26:0 "The Tip Of The Lance"
JRR_d26_desc:0 "At the tip of the lance lies the tank. A shield of iron for the infaytr to advance under, and the bigger and tougher the tip of the lance, the harder the whole spear can hit. Innovating in the sphere of heavy tank production will be our wonder-weapon to roll into Griffenheim and tear the emperor off of his throne."
JRR_d27:0 "The Principle Of Continuous Innovation"
JRR_d27_desc:0 "The future is bright, and there are endless ideas both cultural and scientific to rediscover. By embracing our national past, we have become stronger than ever before, and can enter the future a new and healthy nation, free of the taint and shackles of the past."
JRR_d28:0 "Reclaim The Périphérie"
JRR_d28_desc:0 "Like Aquileia proper, the Périphérie territories have been corrupted by herzlandish influences for far too long. But in reality, they have had it even worse than us. We have at least remained within a realm that pretended to be Aquileian, while they languished in ignorance of their true identities. But do not fear, creatures of the Périphérie, we have come to free you."
JRR_d29:0 "The Matter Of Tarrin"
JRR_d29_desc:0 "Tarrin has fallen into the wingbardian cultural sphere under the crown of the Martlewing dynasty. While the wingbardians are not as foul as the herzlanders, and the Martlewings are a proud family of warriors, we must still reclaim our lost cousins if we are ever to do battle with the Empire."
JRR_d30:0 "The Liberation Of Lointaineau"
JRR_d30_desc:0 "The griffons of Lointaineau are more members of the lost Aquileian family that must be reclaimed. These cousins have been locked in dynastic struggles for years ever since the fracturing of the crown of Verenia, this violence in the name of false princes must end."
JRR_d31:0 "Revitalise The Authentique Aquiléen Spirit"
JRR_d31_desc:0 "While our efforts to restore our pure culture at home have been progressing well, we must now expand our efforts to the Périphérie, where griffons fight against our rule under the false delusion that they are our enemies, when we are really family. We must embrace them as brothers and sisters and show them the light of the Aqueleian nation in all of its glory."
JRR_d32:0 "État, Patriotisme, Ferveur"
JRR_d32_desc:0 "The state, patriotism, and fervor, the three integral values of the new Aquileia. Everything we have done builds up to these three core principles. All actions we take are in the name of imbuing them into our citizens. In this task, we must not fail, for our culture must never fall victim to enslavement again. As even if we may die, the true Aquileia will live."
JRR_d33:0 "Equivalise Party And State"
JRR_d33_desc:0 "The PSA is Aquileia, and without the PSA, there would be no true Aquileia. The party and the nation were born from the same womb. So the PSA must make itself one with the nation and the state, to be the purest representation of Aquileia itself. Once this is achieved, all else is possible. "
JRR_d34:0 "The Serene Beauty Of Violence"
JRR_d34_desc:0 "Like spirits of violence, the army moves. United in an eternal dance with nature, the nation's soldiers take the lives of those who would chain them down once again. Spirits of the wind! We call to you! Push our warriors forward across their fields of battle, and let their strikes land true on the corrupt! Let the dance continue into a second act, and may it never end."
JRR_d35:0 "Cast Down The Empire Of Evil"
JRR_d35_desc:0 "The time has come, my brothers and sisters, let the blood of the Herzlanders salt their fields, and let them never rise again to threaten Aquileia. We will be the victors. We are superior. We will make them pay."

JRR_d36:0 "Formalise The Aquileian Air Force"
JRR_d36_desc:0 "Aquileia has had a meager collection of squadrons for years and it is time to create a modern air force that Aquileia can be proud of."
JRR_d37:0 "The Department Of Civilian Aviation"
JRR_d37_desc:0 "Aviation doesn’t just have potential on the battlefield, but also as a means of transportation. Once we can organize a fleet of civilian planes we can use them to quickly transport civilians, resources, and communications."
JRR_d38:0 "Encourage The Formation Of Flight Clubs"
JRR_d38_desc:0 "If we wish to adequately support our troops from the skies, we need to establish multiple airbases across Aquileia. By lessening the tax burden on these “flight clubs” they will begin to establish more hangers and airports that we can appropriate during wartime."
JRR_d39:0 "Aviation Development Grants"
JRR_d39_desc:0 "By allocating enough recourses to our fledgling air force we can significantly increase the production and modernization of our planes."
JRR_d40:0 "Fighter Craft Modernisation"
JRR_d40_desc:0 "To compete against the herzlanders, our fighters need to be able to match theirs in speed, maneuverability, and weaponry."
JRR_d41:0 "Calibrated Destruction"
JRR_d41_desc:0 "To use our bombers to their maximum efficacy we should build planes and train bombers who can pinpoint key positions before laying them to waste."
JRR_d42:0 "Infantry Support Craft"
JRR_d42_desc:0 "In order to effectively use our control of the skies, we need to design and produce planes that can specialize in aiding ground units by using bombing and strafing runs to soften up the enemy for our forces to crush."
JRR_d43:0 "Project: Damocles"
JRR_d43_desc:0 "Nuclear technology is an emerging science that which creatures all across the world are, as we speak, trying to understand how to utilize it. One of our scientists had a very good question: Can we use it to make the herzlanders bend?"
JRR_d44:0 "The Aerial Transportation Network"
JRR_d44_desc:0 "With our cutting-edge network of planes, airports, and experienced pilots Aquileia will become a mold for the rest of the world to follow. At will goods, civilians, administrators, and soldiers can be across the country within hours."

westkeep.1.t:0 "The Colonel and The Marquess"
westkeep.1.d:0 ">>>>CHOUETTE REPORT<<<<\n\nFor approved eyes only.\n\nThe situation in Westkeep is tenuous, and King Moriset seems to not care. His cousin, the Marquess, is still on the run, and the MPA has been uncooperative in our efforts to track her down. They say they can handle the investigation themselves, but this report presents a more significant threat.\n\nWe believe that the MPA in Westkeep may be plotting against the throne. With all royal institutions in the province effectively destroyed, the MPA has nearly full control over the state apparatus, and their nationalism seems to only be on the rise. While we have previously trusted them to remain loyal to the crown, it seems they are slowly revealing a secret agenda. A cabal of three leaders within the MPA together form the backbone of their power, with Colonel Colette serving as the public face of the province, with the other two taking a back seat. More time is needed to investigate. However, they are both extremely populist and nationalist.\n\nOur investigation into the Marquess has returned equally unexpected results. We sighted her once with a pony noble named Lance Incarnat, who seems active within aristocratic social circles from the number of nobles who have at least heard of him. Additionally, we have received no cooperation from the majority of the nobles in the region, especially those in the mountainous regions, and the Diamond Dogs also claim to have no information on the Marquess. Our conclusion is that there is something deeply strange happening among the nobility of Westkeep, and we cannot figure out what. Whenever we believe we have a lead, all our informants and tips disappear into the night.\n\nWestkeep is on an edge, and this report has no correct answer of how to fix it."

Colette pushed the paper across the table towards Rouge and Fervante, both of them leaning over to read what it said.\n\n"An MPA militia saw the Marquess last night, set up a simple ambush for her, and now she's dead." Fervante leaned back in her chair and chuckled, "Well, that's that, I guess. The plan now has zero hitches to it."\n\nRouge nodded, "All members of the unit shall receive a medal from the Cercle and be considered for Tempête de Feu training, but now onto the bigger issues."\n\nAll three of them nodded. The second revolution was coming, republicans and other revolutionaries across Aquileia were in the process of launching their uprisings, and now Westkeep had to decide how to proceed. It was the only territory that had been under true anti-monarchy control for a long time now, and so the obvious choice was to help their fellow revolutionaries.\n\n"On the other hand," Rouge smirked, "This revolution could be our big chance. There will be chaos. Vérany and his minions won't be able to perform a clean sweep. We can use it!"\n\nThe three looked between themselves. They all had goals bigger than the other revolutionaries would ever let them achieve. Still, they all knew the risks of true rebellion. Was it worth the risk?"

They were all dilligent little souls, and it warmed his heart to see that they were taking this opportunity. It was a disgrace that Aquileia had left so much of its populace uncultivated, but at least they would be cultivated now.\n\n"Sixty seconds to go, mes élèves," he called out to hurry them up. They were eager to learn, but undiciplined, and he had realized quickly a lifetime of running wild in their countryside games had not done much for their ability to focus focus. Yes, there was much work to be done, but he was determined to bring out their full potential. Of course, that meant constant vigilance and a firm claw from him, and so he slapped his pointer at the desk of one of the students. "No speaking during class. To the corner." He ordered the student, who silently got up and walked over to the corner to take up his position there. A firm claw indeed.\n\n"Pens down, mes élèves," he ordered and walked back to the teacher's pulpit. "Now, who can tell me why Monsieur Lacroix is currently standing in the corner? Madmoiselle Blanc?"\n\n"He is there because he spoke during class. But Monsieur, he was trying to help..." Monsieur Pèlerin held up his claw to stop her.\n\n"Thank you for your answer, Madmoiselle Blanc." He cut her off. Thankfully she did not press the issue, and he continued. "Monsieur Lacroix will stay for an hour and help me. The rest of you may leave. Thank you all for today."

westkeep.7.d:0 "It was a splendid day for an excursion, and Monsieur Pèlerin took a deep breath of the fresh countryside air. It was no wonder that his students were so vital, when this clean, natural air was the only thing they had ever known. He was about to tell his students to continue when an ear-splitting shriek filled the air. Spinning around, he saw the students recoil away from the snake that had reared itself up by a rock, about to attack one of them!\n\nThen, out of nowhere, a rock hit the snake straight in the head, and it was thrown backwards before slithering away and vanishing among the rocks. Monsieur Pèlerin, who had been about to jump at it with his walking staff, realized that the rock had come from young Monsieur Lacroix - who was running to see that his classmate was okay.\n\nWith the scare over and nobody hurt, they eventually began to head back towards the school, and he called up Monsieur Lacroix to walk beside him. "That was a very brave thing you did," he told the boy, who blushed in response. "No, don't blush. Hold your head high, young man. You acted quickly and decisively, and you may well have saved one of your classmates' life."\n\n"I just didn't want it to hurt Marie," Remy mumbled awkwardly. Monsieur Pèlerin patted him on the shoulder in response.\n\n"And that is why a real griff fights, Monsieur Lacroix. A true warrior fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him. Be proud of yourself, you showed instinctively what many will take a lifetime to learn.""

His teacher was an educated griff, who knew way more about the world than anygriff in this village. If he said that things were a certain way, that's how they were. Those who didn't listen would get the cane, and then they'd listen the next time. Realising that had made school easier, and as he had adapted, Monsieur Pèlerin had become nicer as well. Yet now, as Monsieur Pèlerin sat in front of Remy and his parents at their table, Remy couldn't help but feel really scared again.\n\n"I understand that this is a great opportunity for him..." His father was reluctant, and chose his words carefully. "And we all have the greatest respect for the military..."\n\n"Thank you, Monsieur Lacroix," Monsieur Pèlerin cut in. "I understand the reservations you might have, and where they come from. But as I have told your son many times, we are living in an age where all griffs at some point will be expected to serve Aquileia. We both know that Remy is an intelligent and capable young griff, and in the choice between being an officer or an enlisted soldier, the former is the more suitable option for him. And if he is sent to cadet school, he will have a six year head start when he finally enters service. Duty is his destiny, and as his parents you will choose what aid he gets in achieving it."\n\nHis father mumbled in affirmative, unable to formulate a response, and Remy swallowed nervously. When Monsieur Pèlerin spoke, you listened."

westkeep.9.d:0 "The uniform was stiff, and it squeezed uncomfortably in several places. What more, Remy didn't know what to do with the kepi. It didn't fit the way his old cap had, and he moved it around on his head, trying to make it look less weird as. Cadet Remy Lacroix... it sounded so strange. Leaving his home and coming to this giant academy on the outskirts of Aquila had been terrifying for a boy who barely had left his home before, but he remembered how everygriff back home had come to the station to say goodbye to him as he left, cheering for him as the pride of the village. Cadet Remy Lacroix carried the hopes of his entire village, living up to those hopes was his duty, and he couldn't let them down.\n\nThe sound of the bugle outside almost made him leap out of his skin, and he quickly put the kepi back on, rushing out of the bathroom he had been standing in, down the stairs and out into the courtyard. The others were coming out as well, and Remy quickly stepped up to the position they had shown him yesterday, putting his legs together, his back straight and his head high in his best attempt to mimic the uniformed teacher standing in front of him. The teacher looked at his pocket watch, and when the last students came running out and took their positions, he nodded.\n\n"Fourty-five seconds! Strong improvement, cadets! Swiftness and efficiency will be vital to your future as commanders of the Aquileian armed forces. I expect this number to be down to thirty by the end of the week. Is that understood?!"\n\n"Yes Monsieur!" Remy, along with all the other cadets yelled, and the teacher nodded in approval again.\n\n"Vive l'Aquilée," he told them, Remy having learned what that phrase meant. It meant you were willing to fight for your homeland, and had the courage to do it. It meant you were strong, and that you through that could save those who weren't. He had to become strong, so he responded as loudly as he could along with the others."

She had only returned from her husband’s comfortable lodgings in Feathesia a few weeks ago, but things had become dire already in the month or so spent away from her home province.\n\nThe scum in the regional branch of the MPA here in Westkeep were making their final moves for power and she was the only griffon with the support base and influence to stop them. The central government in Aquila might send their inspectors or try to push things in a particular direction, but their influence was marginal at best. Aurél and her landed allies were all that stood between order and ruin at the talons of republican degeneracy.\n\nShe hadn’t slept enough, nor had she the mind to try and rectify that issue at the moment; all that mattered was taking back control. The Marquess was no madgriff, she was an intelligent and calculating noble with much to lose from the final expulsion of the nobility from Westkeep and a personal vendetta that needed resolving.\n\nA rather scared griffon cleared his throat to get her attention, holding a letter between outstretched talons. “M-Madame; I hope I’m not interrupting-”\n\n“No, not at all.” She turned about with a glare and took the letter in one swift movement, “Wait for me inside, I may yet have need of your services.”\n\nHe bowed and dashed back into the mansion proper, a little surprised that she hadn’t given him what for.

Aurél, a loving mother at heart, had a tendency to encourage her only daughter’s headstrong attitude; leaving the tempering of that self-assuredness to her eldest son.\n\nThe griffon made to stop speaking as she began running out of breath, “...and she’s fought wars all across the land!”\n\n“She’s quite the repertoire, hasn’t she?” He returned, chuckling a little before continuing. “I wonder… why does she fight? Honour? Money? For fun? To find and save a significant other, like the old knights in stories?”\n\nLucie stared at him blankly for a moment, then down at the wooden figure in her talons; maybe she was a little young to understand those sorts of motivations.\n\n“To help her family!” She blurted out with the sweetest of grins, before he had even thought about explaining.\n\nHe laughed and affectionately ruffled the feathers on her head, then excused himself to go and get changed out of his uniform for dinner. Caring for the family wasn’t part of his duty as a military official or even really his societal obligation, but he would be damned before he let his own sister and brothers fall by the wayside in their quest to reclaim Westkeep.

Though for some, it is merely the beginning of their day.\n\nIn a particular manor on the outskirts of Westkeep, a finely-dressed pony observed several extravagent guests entering his estate from the balcony, along with several hulk-like griffons covered head-to-paw in armour. These guests, the nobles of Westkeep, idly chattered with one another as they filtered into the grand house of Lance Incarnat.\n\nLance himself gave one last glance at the rising moon before he went inside to welcome his guests. It had been some time since the last gathering; the MPA's activities had made them considerably more difficult to organize lately. If things got any more heated in Westkeep...\n\nHe shook his head as he re-entered his house. Another thought for another time. He stepped over to the indoor portion of the balcony. The exquisite luxury on display would have made some monarchs look poor in comparison, for Lance had spent many centuries gathering the fine decor on display throughout his manor. The nobles were dressed in equally opulent attire, almost to the point of decadence. Some began to engage in courtly intrigue or poetry, while others laughed and sang.\n\nThese ponies and griffons all had one thing in common, however: they all held glasses of a fine, red liquid from which each occasionally sipped between conversations. Lance procured some for himself from his personal cabinet. Sangrine "Pastour" - 834 ALB. This wasn't quite the occasion for opening such a bottle, but as he watched the nobles revel amongst themselves, he couldn't help but wonder if that "other time" was approaching soon.

Around a quarter of the soldiers wore the standard Aquileian army uniforms, professionals she knew were loyal to her. While the others wore the uniform of the MPA paramilitary arm.\n\nColette looked down the line again and noticed one stallion glancing over at her, breaking eye contact whenever she looked his way. She could not tell if it was fear or respect in his eyes, but it served her well either way.\n\n"Ready, aim, fire!" The Commander reran the drill, and this time the crack of gunshots voiced unanimous approval. Their trigger discipline was getting better.\n\nColette called out, "Very good! We have a crucial few months ahead of us, and I expect you all to maintain this standard for that entire period. But for now, take the rest of the day off. You'll need the rest so you can take the fight to the nobles and their ivory towers."\n\nAs the soldiers streamed away, Colette smiled to herself. Soon, she would be in Aquila, the city of her birth.

Do you wake up each morning, proud to practice your trade, proud of where you have born?"\n\nFrom the back of the crowd, a single voice cried out, "No!"\n\n"Of course, you don't! Because our nation is built around making you desire something different, you are not meant to feel happy or fulfilled." Fervant smiled to herself. It was time to turn up the heat. You are taught your entire lives to be like them!" She raised her hoof and pointed to the hill nearby the village, upon which sat a castle, high and lofty, towering above them all.

Even in sacred Westkeep, where the last warriors of nature kept the land pure for the true to cherish, some opposed the will of Arcturius and his devoted. When something sufficiently irked her, Rouge came up here, alone. It allowed her to bond with the spirits of the world, hear the divine call of God whisper lightly into her ears, and bring herself back in sync with the natural order.\n\nA natural order that was increasingly thrown off.\n\nThe time was coming to make a move, Rouge could tell. The nobility became ever bolder in supporting the impure Marquess, and the corruption was leaving their castles to infest the peasantry.\n\nThat was what had driven her here. One of her most trusted lieutenants had turned up dead, covered in his own blood. The noble had slit the officer's throat as blood streamed from his neck onto his MPA uniform.\n\nEvery member of the Cercle's elite that died was a significant loss, and Rouge had to listen to nature for what to do next.

He stood before a beaten-down, poorly maintained house with naught but his own voice to keep him company. As he approached the house, he closed his eyes and listened carefully... one beating heart. His intel was correct, this indeed was the place.\n\nImmortality was not without its benefits. Jacque, along with some others of his bloodline, had the ability to sense the presence of nearby living creatures through the beats of their hearts. Something that came in handy whenever he needed to get his hooves dirty.\n\nAs he prepared a lockpick to gain entry into the house, he noticed that one of the misshapen front windows was ajar, making his unnoticed entry that much easier. Sneaking into the house, he made his way to the source of the beating heart.

It'd been a while since he'd feasted upon the unsuspecting, and here he wouldn't have to hold himself back.

The mare, an earth pony, had exclaimed surprise at having an "admirer" and told him that if he wanted to see her so bad, he should take her out to dinner first.\n\nAnd so here he was, sitting inside of Restaurant La Aquileia, one of the finest eateries inside of Westkeep. Jacque honestly wasn't sure why he had agreed to this. Perhaps it wasn't too late to leave, he could always find her while she was asleep and-\n\n"Jacque! You came!" the mare called out as she trotted towards the table. She wore a smile that easily outshone her dress, which clearly wasn't very refined or elegant. It would appear that she didn't have much money to spend on such things.\n\n"Yes. I did." Jacque found himself saying without enthusiasm. Oh, how the other nobles would mock him for entertaining a lower-class mortal. If they found out, he wouldn't hear the end of it for decades at least.\n\nAs she sat down and began to make conversation with Jacque, he noticed that she attributed much of her happiness to her involvement with the MPA. How they had promised her more wealth, a better life, and so on. Against his better judgment, he told her that he was a member of the nobility and that the MPA sought to harm him. She was aghast when he said that. Her expression then turned to worry as she asked, "But why? You're one of the nicest stallions that I've ever met!"\n\nJacque was silent for a moment.

Just know that the MPA has caused me significant heartache."\n\n"I had no idea that the MPA was actually hurting people! If that's true, then I don't want to be a part of it!" she exclaimed. Her sudden change of heart was surprising. Had Jacque used his vampiric charm without realizing it? He couldn't tell. But here this mare was, seemingly willing to abandon the MPA over dinner. If she was being genuine, then perhaps he could be as well.\n\nJacque bit his tongue. The other nobles would have his head for what he was about to do. "Unlike the MPA, I won't lie to you. And don't worry about the bill. Would you care to join me for an evening stroll in the park? I'll explain everything to you.""

westkeep_flavour.13.d:0 "Mostly intact. That was the only thing the Marquess could think to say about the palace as she slowly plodded through abandoned halls and equally disused rooms. To claim that it was as beautiful as she remembered it being would be simply a lie, not least for the incredible number of items that had seemingly disappeared. The MPA must have stripped the place bear of whatever they thought was valuable after her family had been forced to flee. Still, it was mostly intact besides.\n\nThis was her home once; it could be her home again, so long as they managed to find a willing group of griffons to refurbish it.\n\n"It needs more than a little spring cleaning, doesn't it?" Hendrik-Jan, her husband, quipped once she had made her way into the master bedroom.\n\nHe set down some old lamp that had been thrown on the floor, rounding the dilapidated bed frame with a comforting smile.\n\nAurél glanced around and sighed before looking back at him, understandably upset by the damage and disrespect. "There used to be paintings of my family everywhere. Me, parents, grandparents, relatives... They're all gone. Sold or burned, more likely. Everything that made this place special is gone."\n\n"Well... not everything," He noted, taking two steps forward and pointedly nuzzling her neck. "You're still here, and you'll have plenty of time to restore it all. You know, I've always wanted one of those big portraits that takes up an entire wall."\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the Marquess smiled; even letting out a quickly-stifled chuckle as she reciprocated the affectionate gesture."

westkeep_flavour.14.d:0 ""...and you're sure you can get us that equipment?" Aurélien asked tentatively, all eyes directly intently at his father.\n\nHendrik-Jan nodded, confident in his own abilities and connections. "Absolutely. I'll leave as soon as I've informed the boss." He added, saluting and turning to leave.\n\nAmongst the congregation of griffons there were all manner of individuals from knights to loyal partisans. They had spent the last three hours on logistics, a conversation which was happily cut short by news that weaponry could be reliably restocked. Needless to say Aurél or, as his father affectionately called her, 'the boss' would support a trip back to Feathisia on such grounds. In any case, the time had now come for strategy; a topic which was quite devisive for the disparate high command, if one could even call it such.\n\nAt the first opportunity, one of the knights began to speak. "If we can secure a steady supply of firearms the strategy is clear. Levies and volunteers can be professionally trained and properly supported on such a basis, so we should focus on creating and maintaining a small but disciplined force."\n\nNot to be outdone, a griffon caked in mud from a long week of recon immediately opposed the idea. "A modern professional force needs more than guns. Even if we could acquire artillery or other equipment, a geurilla campaign would be far more successful. Our partisans are already experienced, all we need is more manpower and a little morale to expand our operations. Trying to professionalise what we have isn't a valuable use of our time when we could be handing out guns to anygriff willing to fight and causing chaos for the MPA!"\n\nAurélien frowned and took another look at the map they were all standing around, carefully scratching his chin with one claw."

The businessgriff asked, adjusting his grip on a cigar before taking a drag with a concerned frown.\n\nHe let out a short chuckle before taking a swig of whiskey, "You know me well enough by now to know that anything I do is worthwhile, Roe. Even if I didn't support Aurél as my wife I would get involved for a return on investment, though what I'm asking of you all is more of a... kind donation, hence a need for favours."\n\nRoelof nodded slowly and looked to the others amongst the little friendly gathering. This was quite abnormal, but they did all owe Hendrik-Jan something; or at the very least they had obligations as his friends to contribute. After some silent deliberation, punctuated by occasional influxes of cigar smoke into the room and the sound of glasses being placed on tables, he and several others had made up their minds.\n\n"I shall see to it that the MPA is faced with Feathisia's finest materiel."\n\nMathijs, another good friend, then piped up in support.

"Now let's see how you shoot. Lift up the rifle so that you're looking down the ironsights and we can work on how you hold it."\n\nShe did as instructed, raising the weapon straight up and pointing it directly at Fernand who immediately pushed it away from his beak. Her trigger discipline was bad enough, tempting fate by allowing her to point it at his face was not a good idea.\n\nNeedless to say, the entertainment value of the situation had disappeared for him. "First rule of firing a gun, only ever point it at something you intend to shoot, in all other cases point it at the floor or otherwise away from non-targets. Second rule, keep your talons off of the trigger unless you intend to fire. You risk inuring yourself or friendlies if you don't follow those two tenets. Third, always treat the gun as if it is loaded even when you think it is not; it only takes one mistake to accidentally fire a loaded rifle when you think the chamber is empty."\n\nCécile nodded apologetically, following his instructions and trying to ignore the snickering from her friends who were watching her nearly kill their commanding officer from a bench behind them. She then fired a shot, missed her target by a little and lowered the weapon, thinking it now needed reloading like the muskets that she'd seen in action.\n\n"Now, you see that piece of metal sticking out from the side?

So Dungaraz made the preparations.\n\nDungaraz heard the column before he saw them, singing the songs of the local peasantry and chanting MPA slogans over and over. As they crested the hill, the Hold Lord saw the Coqiste banner at the head of the procession, and the movement's leader, Fervante Tempête, at the head of them all. Dungaraz was ready for them, but not quite prepared for what came next. As rolling over the hill came artillery pieces larger and more numerous than any canons that had sieged Angaz-Barak before.\n\nDungaraz remembered his council's words, the oaths of the past are sacred, but his dogs' lives are oaths of blood. In his paws, he held two letters, one of defiance and one of tacit acceptance. He turned to one of his retainers, and offered him the concession letter. The hound crossed the field and offered it to Fervante. Dungaraz could see her smile as she read it.

The ancient, yet lavish carriage stood out like a sore hoof along with the vampires surrounding it. Evidently, despite the multitude of warnings and cautions he had given them over their previous visits, the vampires of House Rubra seemed to pay only the barest minimum respect for the rules of the Masquerade.\n\nGlancing to his side, Lance could see that his mixed group of mortal and vampire servants seemed to be equal parts nervous and excited. Many of them had been warned of her brutish behavior of course, but the idea of entertaining a vampire noble from a distant land was nevertheless intriguing.\n\nAs the carriage came to a halt, one of its attendants approached Lance directly for approval to begin. With a nod from Lance, the attendant cleared her throat, "Announcing the arrival of Lady Rubra, First of House Rubra!"\n\nThe door to the carriage opened and out stepped one of the largest ponies that Lance had ever seen. Even though she was of earth pony heritage, Lady Rubra stood a full head taller than others of her kind; a fact that she utilized quite often as she was fond of intimidating others. With a wicked smile, she slowly walked towards Lance, taking the time to examine each of his servants. "I see you have many new faces this time, my dear Lance. Why not grant them your eternal blessing?"\n\n"It would not be prudent to turn everyone," replied Lance with tact and consideration that came with centuries of diplomacy, "And besides, having fresh blood means fresh ideas, and fresh ideas means unique furniture to admire. That is why you are here, is it not?"\n\nDespite the subtle jab, she seemed unfazed. "Straight to the point as always. Yes, I am here for more furniture, though regretfully my time here will be short, as there have been some recent developments in Magehold that I must be present for. But first... you have prepared a feast in my name, as custom? I am quite famished, you know. The journey here was much more difficult to make than my previous visit twenty years ago."\n\nLance's polite expression faltered momentarily as he recalled the struggle to obtain enough criminals to sate the needs of the vile guest in front of him.

Fervante Tempête has since come out swinging and has forced her way to the forefront of the MPA's right-wing. A young mare, Fervante has brought an infectious energy to the movement. She continues its tradition of populist, anti-elite, anti-urban, and Aquileian nationalist beliefs. Notably, this faction of the PSA is the one that most strongly encourages mass participation in politics. "
JRR_directorate_militarist_description: "The £militarists §yMilitarist§! - The Militarist movement in the PSA is a collection of army officers and soldiers who believe that the army's imbuement in all aspects of Aquileian society will rejuvenate the wounded nation and have it emerge stronger than ever before. Unsurprisingly, they are extraordinarily nationalistic and militaristic, also believing in a more technocratic leadership style than their Coquiste counterparts, and not quite as into religion as the Cercle. To sum it up, they believe that Aquileia needs a great commander to lead it to prosperity, and Colette will be that commander."
JRR_directorate_cercle_description: "The £cercle §ZCercle§! - The Cercle is the most esoteric of the three factions of the PSA, with most of their support coming from their prominent role in the MPA's takeover of the nation through their loyal Tempête de Feu paramilitary and Rouge Guirlande's personal cult of personality. The Cercle's political platform is primarily cultural. They care little for the complexities of economic or political organization as long as their main priorities are addressed: the restoration of what they see as the authentic Aquileian way of life. This includes their religious program centering around the God Arcturius and their cultural emphasis that all Aquileians should live following nature's laws. Some suggest that the spiritual practices of their higher ranks are even more extreme than they let on.

### Character Descriptions ###
JRR_COLETTE_SOLIDE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of March, 972 in Aquila\n\n§YRank§!: Colonel\n\n§YBiography§!: Colette Solide was born to a family of soldiers in the Aquileian capital in the lead-up to the sea change that was the revolutions of 978. When the revolutionaries rose up and took Aquila, her father left to fight for the republic, leaving her mother and her behind. Surviving on money they had saved, Colette's mother told her how brave her father was for fighting for their freedom. When her father returned home, he was extatic, he had fought for liberty and won, but it all came crashing down four years later. When Albert Bertholot led his counter-revolution, the republican army crumbled before him. Still, Colette's father went out to fight once again. Alas, while he was gone, tragedy struck. As the battle for Aquila raged, Colette was in the crossfire. As cannon crashed around them, a piece of shrapnel struck young Colette in the right eye, permanently blinding her.\n\nWhen Colette's father returned, he was horrified. His misery became anger as he constantly ranted about how weak the republic was to lose so quickly and to let this happen to his daughter. He decided that Colette must too be a soldier despite her injury to make Aquelia stronger and purify it of the weakness that had hurt her. Years later, and Colette joined the army, quickly joining the MPA and moving up the ranks with that organization's help. Here, she was introduced to the works of writers like Guilo Beakolini and Duke Haygle, which meshed well with her personal ideas regarding strength.\n\nSoon she became Aide de Camp to Leonard Rodier, the MPA's Marshal, and was... disappointed, to say the least. She believed she would be meeting the griffon who would cleanse the nation of weakness through Aquelian pride, and found he was no more nationalist than most of the griffs she had met up until that point. Growing bored with the mainstream MPA, she worked with the organization's right fringe to get an appointment under the governor of Westkeep General Thomas Reiany. Swiftly eliminating the old general, she blamed the murder on the Marquess and became the sole legitimate power in the region. Partnering with a local nationalist group and the rest of the MPA's far-right fringe, she rules Westkeep with an iron claw, waiting for the day she can make the nation truly strong.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tek"

JRR_ROUGE_GUIRLANDE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of June, 980 in Orvillo\n\n§YRank§!: Capitaine\n\n§YBiography§!: Born into a family of wealthy landowners in Orvaillo, Rouge Guirlande was only a child during the first revolution. It left its mark on her, however, and as she grew up she earned a name for herself as a poet and author, writing about all creatures' deep connection to nature, and what it meant. For a weary Aquileia, her writings became a comfort, and she became one of the frontal figures of the walking society "Les Randonneurs" which gathered hundreds of creatures for excursions away from the cities and out to experience nature.\n\nUnlike other leaders, she advocated highly organised excursions, with designated roles for every member and a strict hierarchy as, according to her "hierarchies exist in every creature", and that acknowledging these was part of becoming closer with nature. Soon, rifle training, survival and similar activities was added to the curriculum. Her militarism ended up creating a rift in Les Radonneurs, one she encouraged all the way to its fragmentation as various local chapters - the faithless and useless according to her - departed the organisation. In its wake, Rogue was the only remaining leading figure of a now purified organisation, and she officially fell in with the MPA.\n\nWith Les Radonneurs renamed Société de Vie Naturelle, Rouge leads them in a strict militarist fashion, with equally strict ideals about what they may eat, how they will live and how they shall act. Her poems about the purity and strength of nature has taken form, and her group members are its final expression; sapient masters of nature pure in ideology, body and mind who will be able to take charge of not only their fates, but the fate of all Aquileia.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"
JRR_AUREL_DISCRET_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 19th of May, 960 in Westkeep\n\n§YBiography§!: There are few amongst the remaining nobility with as much patience and dedication as Aurél Discret. For a many years she was regarded as incompetent by her family and her subjects, a reputation that she has shed only with diligence, time and significant outside assistance.\n\nAfter a widely hated stint lauding over the province of Westkeep, a popular movement inflamed by republican soldiers successfully ousted her from power during the revolution and sent the Marquess into exile. Her time spent away from home proved invaluable in a number of ways as she learned the intricacies of governance and politics in the Feathisian court as well as meeting one Hendrik-Jan Van Allwerder, the griffon that would eventually become her husband.\n\nShe later returned to her home province after the counter revolution on invitation, rapidly doing away with her poor reputation. Additionally this gave the Marquess an opportunity to prove her commitment to her country and cause through carefully planned acts of violence against known republicans and members of the MPA. She is both feared and revered, it all depends on who you ask.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tek"
JRR_AURELIEN_DISCRET_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of April, 987 in Westkeep\n\n§YBiography§!: Aurélien is as much a leader as his mother, something that likely evolved from having to look after his younger siblings as they grew up. In more recent years his skills have broadly developed in line with his military career which is followed by his family with great interest.\n\nHe commands respect and loyalty from the other griffons within the general staff as much as those under his command who themselves appreciate his more personable nature. His training lies somewhere between formal and informal, having received some professional training from remaining knights in Westkeep, some military education in Feathisia and even adopting methods from active partisan forces. In spite of the fact that moving back to his mother’s home province halted his professional education in military matters, such a wealth and breadth of experience and knowledge allowed him to quickly develop his effective and adaptable offensive strategies.\n\nDespite his promising future, he still considers his family to be the most important thing in his life; particularly his siblings who he frequently has to take care of even now. When they smile, he smiles with them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tek"

JRR_angaz_barak_desc:0 "§YLeader§!: Dungaraz 'Ironhead' Longfur\n\n§YHold History§!: During the 630s, splinter clans from the diamond dog hold of Karaz-Drynburaz began the march west through Verenia, looking for a new home. They arrived in the hills and mountains of Westkeep, the first time they had found terrain amenable to hold construction since they left on their journey. Soon after beginning construction, the diamond dog miners encountered representatives of the Aquelian Kingdom, already established in the area. The representatives of the King and the Diamond dog clans hashed out a basic agreement, opening trade between their two peoples, and allowing the dogs to live there in exchange for a yearly tribute.\n\nOver time, the diamond dogs became more connected to and reliant on the griffons of Aquileia. Needing to import food to support a growing population, the hold's economy became more and more connected with the griffons outside. So instead of offering goods to the griffons, they offered their services as craftscreatures. The local Westkeep lords happily paid the dogs in coin and crops for their excellent craftsmanship. This relationship has gone on for hundreds of years, with each Forgelord meeting with a council of nobles and renewing the sacred contract. Over time the system evolved, with skilled griffon enchanters augmenting the diamond dog forging process, producing the most refined forgeries of the entirety of Aquelia, rivaled only by the dogs of Bronzehill on the Griffonian continent.\n\nThroughout the politics of the centuries, the dogs of Angaz-Barak have generally been ambivalent to the political sea-changes. Maintaining loyalty to the regional nobility rather than any great hierarchy. However, when the revolution of 978 came, the dogs refused to help the republican cause, shut their forges for the first time in years, and sheltered many local Westkeep nobles. The Forgelord at the time, Barnoth Longfur met with a council of nobles, and helped general Thomas Reiany restore order to the province. With the ancient compact restored, the forges were lit again, and once more weapons were produced in the halls of Angaz-Barak."

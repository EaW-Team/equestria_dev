#### IDEAS ####
WIT_unicorn_parties:0 "Mage-Nobles of Wittenland"
WIT_unicorn_parties_desc:0 "Powerful and influential, the nobles of Wittenland known as the Witan are held to a high standard not only because they hold vast tracts of land, but also because of their unrivalled magical prowess. Even as Wittenland stagnated, incompetent nobles rose to power and the lower classes became increasingly dissatisfied with their position, these peers remained a force to be reckoned with. They exert their influence in the Witenagemot, an advisory assembly that over time began to rival the monarch in power. As a result, the nation is highly focused on everything unicorn, at the expense of other pony races, who are politely discriminated at best."
WIT_magical_weapon_mastery:0 "Mastercraft Magical Weapons"
WIT_magical_weapon_mastery_desc:0 "Improvements and innovations, alongside high quality standards, with the added touch of Wittenlandic magical ingenuity have all combined to create a magical rifle that is more efficient and reliable than any other creature can make."
WIT_overcharged_rifles_idea:0 "Overcharged Rifles"
WIT_overcharged_rifles_idea_desc:0 "In place of magazines, magical rifles utilise a carefully attuned crystal filled with arcane power. This power storage is depleted as the firearm is used, necessitating a replacement, much like an ordinary rifle. However, bullets can't be overcharged or modified, as it drastically wears down a gun, which is designed for a very specific caliber. Such a restriction does not exist for crystals, and we are able to add more magic to them, at the cost of slightly more occasional mishaps."
WIT_mandatory_magical_training_idea:0 "Mandatory Magical Training"
WIT_mandatory_magical_training_idea_desc:0 "It is important that every unicorn is more than capable of utilising his magical potential. It is what gives us an edge over the other races, and must not be spurned."
WIT_food_imports:0 "Increased Food Imports"
WIT_food_imports_desc:0 "Wittenland's mountainous terrain has never been conductive for agriculture, and what was suitable was harried by Cossack raiders. Although their raids are no longer a daily worry, the exponential population growth caused by influx of industry requires a solution, lest starvation breaks out. This is settled by importing various grains from the other Riverpony nations."
WIT_terrace_farms:0 "Terrace Farming"
WIT_terrace_farms_desc:0 "Resembling steps cut into slopes, terracing is the innovative solution for Wittenland's lack of fertile plains. Not only are they safely located, near mountain strongholds, but they are also ecologically friendly. The time required to properly transform slopes into terraces is not an issue when it comes to solving the problem of food. Everypony will have enough for their plate."

WIT_centralized_banking:0 "National Bank of Wittenland"
WIT_centralized_banking_desc:0 "White Star always believed that the nobles cannot be entrusted to handle the national finances, taking note from historical precedents. Instead, a central bank overseen by the state will command every monetarily related matter, from loans to minting coinage."
WIT_new_bureaucracy_idea:0 "Reformed Bureaucracy"
WIT_new_bureaucracy_idea_desc:0 "Relying on a professional, coordinated bureaucratic apparatus is vital for a monarch seeking to enact further reforms in Wittenland."
WIT_land_redistribution:0 "Redistributed Land"
WIT_land_redistribution_desc:0 "Noble-held property has not always been properly utilised, as many prefer a scenic park near their estates. Although it is certainly aesthetical, what few arable land there is in Wittenland shouldn't be squandered on frivolities - White Star has given the excess to the peasants to cultivate."
WIT_reorg_tagmata_idea:0 "Reorganised Tagmata"
WIT_reorg_tagmata_idea_desc:0 "Military service has once more become a requirement for the higher classes, even as many ponies complain about being unfit to serve. It is nothing that the standard training procedure won't whip into shape."
WIT_empowered_monarchy:0 "Empowered Monarchy"
WIT_empowered_monarchy_desc:0 "Instead of relying on nobles to run the matters of state, White Star has enacted changes to further concentrate power in the position of the monarch, taking more responsibility for themselves. This hasn't been popular with the now disenfranchised peers, however."
WIT_integrate_fyrds_idea:0 "Integrated Fyrds"
WIT_integrate_fyrds_idea_desc:0 "The responsiblity of raising and mobilising freeponies is now the responsibility of the Wittenlandic crown, and not the nobles' on whose land the ponies make their living."
WIT_privileges_curtailed:0 "Privileges Curtailed"
WIT_privileges_curtailed_desc:0 "White Star has stripped the aristocrats from their many traditional privileges, with the aim of relaxing social tensions. It remains to be seen if it will make a change for the better."
WIT_titular_nobility:0 "Titular Mage-Nobles"
WIT_titular_nobility_desc:0 "Although certain traditions of Wittenland remain firmly rooted, the winds of change have swept through the ranks of nobility - almost all have been reduced to pure title holders without any concrete authority, which is centralised in White Star."

WIT_disarray_idea:0 "Disarray"
WIT_disarray_idea_desc:0 "The accursed witches of Wittenland have cast a curse on our soldiers and civilians, turning sibling against sibling and clouding the minds of our leaders!"
WIT_blight_idea:0 "Blight"
WIT_blight_idea_desc:0 "Our crops are perishing in the fields, and our stored seeds are rotting away before our eyes. The witches of Wittenland have cursed us, depriving our people of food!"
WIT_rust_idea:0 "Rust"
WIT_rust_idea_desc:0 "Something is wrong with our equipment. All steel parts in them are rapidly rusting, turning rifles, guns and tanks into useless brown husks. It is likely the witches of Wittenland have used their black magic against us!"
WIT_nimbusian_training:0 "Nimbusian Training"
WIT_nimbusian_training_desc:0 "Necessity has required us to focus on improving the fighting capabilities of our army. Fortunately, through diplomacy we've secured the assistance of Nimbusian martial experts, led by a seasoned veteran called Iódis Avgí. They will train our special forces through their grueling exercise regiment, not unlike their so-called Trial of the Cyclone."
WIT_weakness_idea:0 "Weakened Soldiers"
WIT_weakness_idea_desc:0 "Soldiers are complaining about their bodies feeling weak and feeble, as if strength had been drained from their muscles. They have greater difficulty fulfilling tasks which were previously easy."
WIT_strength_idea:0 "Strength From Fear"
WIT_disease_idea:0 "White Plague"

WIT_diplomatic_corps:0 "Diplomatic Corps"
WIT_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "Hoof picked by White Star, the newly formed diplomatic staff is ready to serve Wittenland's interests abroad, replacing the nobles who previously held such positions as a form of sinecure."
WIT_royal_judiciary1:0 "Privileges Curtailed"
WIT_royal_judiciary1_desc:0 "Further reforms have resulted in the nobility becoming increasingly powerless in the face of White Star's progressive changes. Little occurs without her previous mandate and approval."
WIT_royal_judiciary2:0 "Reformed Bureaucracy"
WIT_royal_judiciary2_desc:0 "A competent and efficient cadre of ponies to enact the monarch's will is the key towards increasing the state's ability to make positive changes."
WIT_payment_for_land:0 "Payment For Land"
WIT_payment_for_land_desc:0 "In the interest of avoiding further tension, [WIT.GetNameDef] has agreed to provide us a monetary concession in exchange for the territory they have claimed."
WIT_paying_for_land:0 "Paying For Land"
WIT_paying_for_land_desc:0 "Diplomatic successes have given us our lands, but the cost is high, giving Wittenland much less breathing room with its budget. Nonetheless, everypony can agree that it is a joyous moment for Wittenland's history to have its rightful territory once more."
WIT_worker_protection:0 "Worker Protections"
WIT_worker_protection_desc:0 "Although it comes at a cost of maximising possible profit, White Star's reformed labour law has satisfied the impoverished workers, for now, quelling revolutionary thoughts similar to those that have transpired in Prywhen."
WIT_titular_nobility2:0 "Titural Mage-Nobles"
WIT_titular_nobility2_desc:0 "Although certain traditions of Wittenland remain firmly rooted, the winds of change have swept through the ranks of nobility - almost all have been reduced to pure title holders without any concrete authority, which is centralised in White Star."
WIT_elective_council_idea:0 "A Democratic Witenagemot"
WIT_elective_council_idea_desc:0 "The Witan have always been prestigious and powerful, owing to their wealth, but their ranks have become swelled with ponies who do not truly represent what Wittenland is about - arcane prowess and a sense of obligation for their fellow pony. White Star has implemented a radical reform in which members of the Witan are elected by their constituents. Current title holders will have to prove themselves worthy of their position."
WIT_parliament_idea:0 "The Wittenland Parliament"
WIT_parliament_idea_desc:0 "Wittenland now has a democratic parliament like a true constitutional monarchy. It is bicameral, with the lower house consisting of elected individuals while the upper house is the old Witenagemot, its positions occupied by the nobility of the Kingdom. Majority of the power lies with the lower house however, with the upper house being able to do little more than oppose proposed legislation if they so desire."
WIT_torchbearer_liberty_idea:0 "Torchbearers Of Liberty"
WIT_torchbearer_liberty_idea_desc:0 "Those who yearn to be free, who remain under a tyrant's hoof - let it be known to all - Wittenland stands firm in its devotion to liberal values. Resolute enough that our ponies are willing to travel to distant lands to achieve a greater ideal."

WIT_noble_allies:0 "Allies Among The Nobility"
WIT_noble_allies_desc:0 "Those who have recognised Honoria's quality, and sided with her in the crucial moment were bestowed upon with greater privileges. These nobles are assisting Honoria in the transition of power."
WIT_clean_ranks:0 "No More Incompetent Nobles"
WIT_clean_ranks_desc:0 "Debauchery, laziness, frivolity and ineptitude - these are all traits Honoria cannot tolerate. As a result, many previously wealthy and influential nobles have found themselves stripped of their privileges."
WIT_privatised_banks:0 "Privatised Banks"
WIT_privatised_banks_desc:0 "State interference in the financial sector is unwise, as it only creates bad decisions that only profit the nation, and not its private citizens. Honoria has mandated that the government must not own any stake or holding among the Wittenlandic banks, to fully encourage the invisible hoof of the free market."
WIT_sold_land:0 "Public Land Sold"
WIT_sold_land_desc:0 "Instead of squatting on valuable properties, most of the state owned lands have been sold to promising enterprised and businessponies, to encourage a quicker industrial growth."
WIT_finest_soldiers:0 "The Finest Soldiers"
WIT_finest_soldiers_desc:0 "The concept of fyrds has become rapidly outdated and unsuitable for the current times. Although freeponies are certainly motivated to fight for their country, the various contractual obligations prevent them from becoming a true fighting force. The outdated ways must be swept aside for a professional standing army with equally professional standards."
WIT_examinations:0 "Mandatory Examinations"
WIT_examinations_desc:0 "Every candidate for a state employed position must prove their capability through an exam personally approved by Honoria. The purpose is to weed out those would slack off and become a detriment to the nation."
WIT_advisory_council_idea:0 "An Advisory Witenagemot"
WIT_advisory_council_idea_desc:0 "The Witenagemot has been restored to its traditional role as an advisory council for the ruling monarch, its excessive powers curtailed almost entirely. The only way its members can influence policy is by convincing the monarch to implement their ideas."
WIT_evaluations:0 "Talent Evaluations"
WIT_evaluations_desc:0 "The success of implementing bureaucratic examinations has given Honoria the affirmation needed to progress towards the next step - evaluating everypony for their actual skill and capabilities. Talent marks are only secondary, and should not be relied upon to determine a pony's future, but rather scientific scrutiny with unbiased standards."
WIT_exploit_the_weak_idea:0 "Exploiting The Weak"
WIT_exploit_the_weak_idea_desc:0 "If a pony cannot withstand an assault, he is weak and unworthy. It naturally follows that those who are less successful should be given only menial labour unfit for those who are pushing new boundaries for Wittenland."
WIT_unicorn_master_race_idea:0 "Unicorn Master Race"
WIT_unicorn_master_race_idea_desc:0 "Wittenland has always been about its unicorns, and not anypony else. Thus, why should they be given any consideration? Our national focus should be an intense campaign of promoting unicorn values above all else."
WIT_all_races_have_potential_idea:0 "All Races Have Potential"
WIT_all_races_have_potential_idea_desc:0 "Although Wittenland is a primarily unicorn based nation, the new guideline aims to slightly subvert such a stereotype - everypony regardless of their race and heritage are encouraged to set new records, and strive above all else to be successful."
WIT_denounce_democrats_idea:0 "Anti-Democratic Values"
WIT_denounce_democrats_idea_desc:0 ""Democracy is two timberwolves and a pony deciding what's for dinner." - Queen Honoria"
WIT_honoria_stop_youre_taking_it_too_far:0 "Survival Of The Fittest"
WIT_honoria_stop_youre_taking_it_too_far_desc:0 "To struggle is to survive. Only ponies who can continuously prove their worth, their capabilities, their adaptability in the face of extreme odds can strive in Honoria's Wittenland. Such is the ultimate expression of merit."

WIT_empowered_council:0 "Empowered Witenagemot"
WIT_empowered_council_desc:0 "Backroom deals and a sharp turn to the past have given the Witenagemot an increased authority to enact changes, working in tandem with Wulfric Grey. It remains to be seen if they can function together adequately."
WIT_noble_banks:0 "Banks Of The Nobility"
WIT_noble_banks_desc:0 "In Wulfric's opinion, money is something commoners cannot be trusted with - it gives them uppity ideas to rise above their assigned role in society. Ownership and management of banks is an affair reserved strictly for those of noble rank, which in turn assures their cooperation with the state."
WIT_expanded_fyrds:0 "Expanded Fyrds"
WIT_expanded_fyrds_desc:0 "Each noblepony has an obligation to raise a fyrd - experienced soldiers and freeponies, who would provide their own weaponry, pressed into service for a short time to respond to a threat. Failure for either party to answer the call to arms results in fines and loss of land.\n\nSuch a system worked well in its day, but Wulfric Grey, mindful of increasing dangers in today's world, has expanded the requirements of the fyrd, particularly in duration of service."
WIT_serfdoms_back_baby:0 "The Return Of Serfdom"
WIT_serfdoms_back_baby_desc:0 "Serfdom is a simple necessity, as ponies continue to shirk their responsibilities. If they cannot pay off their debts, then they have no choice but to work them away. A much more elegant and practical solution than having them rot in prison."
WIT_bureau_of_barbarians_idea:0 "The Bureau Of Barbarians"
WIT_bureau_of_barbarians_idea_desc:0 "A wise pony keeps an eye on his friends, and more importantly his enemies. For Wittenland to regain its prestige and splendour, it needs dedicated ponies keeping eyes on the wider world. Even if they complain about "intrusion" and "state sovereignty". Wittenland is simply better than other nations."
WIT_bureau_of_barbarians_idea_lar:0 "The Bureau Of Barbarians"
WIT_bureau_of_barbarians_idea_lar_desc:0 "A wise pony keeps an eye on his friends, and more importantly his enemies. For Wittenland to regain its prestige and splendour, it needs dedicated ponies keeping eyes on the wider world. Even if they complain about "intrusion" and "state sovereignty". Wittenland is simply better than other nations."
WIT_bureaucratic_nobles:0 "Aristocratic Bureaucracy"
WIT_bureaucratic_nobles_desc:0 "Nobility have made the state apparatus their own personal affair, complete with titles, privileges and the obligatory exclusion of the lower classes. Most have taken to their duties with serious fervour, but it is little comfort for the downtrodden masses who are prohibited in making decisions for the state."
WIT_workers_patron:0 "Patron Of The Workers"
WIT_workers_patron_desc:0 "A monarch's responsibility is to reward those who excel in their duties. Honouring those who exceed their quota will inspire the other ponies to continue striving forward, to give their best for Wittenland."
WIT_divine_monarchy_idea:0 "The Divine Monarchy"
WIT_divine_monarchy_idea_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the monarch of Wittenland is chosen by fate itself to guide the nation. As such it is a sacred position, receiving the blessing of the mountain spirits. The Kingdom is holy by its very nature, and opposing it is sacrilege."

WIT_abolished_nobility:0 "Abolished Nobility"
WIT_abolished_nobility_desc:0 "The ponies have had enough of the leeches draining our society! The nobles have been stripped of their rank, wealth and privilege, with the land being redistributed to the needy."
WIT_integrated_nobility:0 "Integrated Nobility"
WIT_integrated_nobility_desc:0 "Although it is a deviation, we have welcomed those mage-nobles who would cooperate with the republican goal. Their experience in handling the matters of state is needed to properly transition, and should make a gradual change to an equal, rankless society more easier to accept."
WIT_equal_nobility:0 "Equal Nobility"
WIT_equal_nobility_desc:0 "It is not in the interest of society to punish those with influence and wealth, for they could simply emigrate and take all their assets with them. Abolishing titles and privileges is certainly the way towards a better state, but the formerly privileged ones need to be encouraged to stay, so that they can help in nation building."
WIT_peoples_army:0 "New Ponies' Army"
WIT_peoples_army_desc:0 "Following the example of Steel Stallion, any suspected monarchists in the Wittenlandic armed forces have been sacked and replaced with enthusiastic, if inexperienced newcomers from the proletariat. For now, the future of the Republic has been secured from internal uprisings."
WIT_deal_with_army:0 "A Pact With The Army"
WIT_deal_with_army_desc:0 "The young republic has followed a pragmatic approach towards the largely monarchist old guard generals: they would be allowed to retain their positions and influence in exchange for swearing fealty to the Republic. Although denounced by the radicals as revisionary sedition, it ensures that opportunistic neighbours will think twice before plotting against us."
WIT_army_reform:0 "Reformed Army"
WIT_army_reform_desc:0 "Instead of making sweeping changes, Voliare has enacted a policy of gradual reforms for the armed forces, aimed to slowly weed out the reactionary elements. Already has the training of the next generation of officers began, and the increase in payment for the common soldier will remind them to maintain their loyalty to those who provide them."
WIT_r_atheism:0 "State Atheism"
WIT_r_atheism_desc:0 "Religion has no place in a modern nation guided by the principles of Marks. Down with the false idols, down with the peddlers of false tales! The proletariat will simply have to accept in time the truth."
WIT_state_religion:0 "State Religion"
WIT_state_religion_desc:0 "What was once a previously unspoken agreement has become the official state policy: the state will sponsor and provide for the monks of Wittenland, and ensure they have enough funding to maintain their buildings and provide charity for the needy."
WIT_secular_state:0 "State Secularism"
WIT_secular_state_desc:0 "A compromise has been secured for the future of worship in Wittenland - the Republic will prevent its hardliners from abolishing the monasteries, but the official national policy will no longer give any favour to any organised religion."
WIT_republican_constitution:0 "The Constitution Of The Republic"
WIT_republican_constitution_desc:0 "With the turmoil of the change of government settled, the fundamental rights and freedoms of ponies and other creatures inhabitating Wittenland has been enshrined in a newly written constitution, guaranteeing the abolition of serfdom and feudalism, therefore granting personal freedom for everycreature."
WIT_new_bureaucracy_rep:0 "New, Efficient Bureaucracy"
WIT_new_bureaucracy_rep_desc:0 "The cobwebs and dust of the previous order have been swept away, which includes the notoriously slow and privileged bureaucrats. We've brought over educated ponies, who couldn't be hired before due to noble prerogatives, to replace the old guard. They're enthusiastic towards improving Wittenland to the fullest."
WIT_university_idea:0 "The University Of Wittenburgh"
WIT_university_idea_desc:0 "Higher education in Wittenland was mostly restricted in the form of patronage, where nobles would support those they choose as particularly brilliant. It was an effective system, but the scope was very limited and very few ponies could hope to attract the attention of a wealthy scion.\n\nTo resolve the problem, and prevent our brilliant ponies from leaving Wittenland to seek a better future, the first modern, equal opportunity university in Wittenland will provide for everypone seeking higher education."
WIT_commie_agitation:0 "Communism On The Rise"
WIT_commie_agitation_desc:0 "The socialists in our country have been rising in popularity lately, and seem to be inspired by the communists of Wittenland. This could prove to be an internal threat, so we must be wary."
WIT_commie_agitation_NIM:0 "Uppity Workers"
WIT_commie_agitation_NIM_desc:0 "The working class in our country is growing increasingly restless lately, and seem to be inspired by the communists of Wittenland. This could prove to be an internal threat, so we must be wary."
WIT_land_and_freedom_idea:0 "Land And Freedom"
WIT_land_and_freedom_idea_desc:0 "All land has been redistributed to the farmers and their rural communes. The state and the nobility do not own a single acre of arable land. Agriculture is now exclusively managed by those who work the land."
WIT_socialized_factories:0 "Socialized Factories"
WIT_socialized_factories_desc:0 "Industrial complexes have been seized from private owners and given to the urban workers, who have formed socialized organizations to manage them. Any state-owned assets have been given to collective proletariat ownership as well."
WIT_councils:0 "Communal Councils"
WIT_councils_desc:0 "The country's old administrative divisions, based on a semi-feudal structure, have been abolished and replaced with a large amount of rural and urban municipalities, each of them run by a democratically elected council. These councils in turn answer directly to the national government."
WIT_internationalism:0 "Internationalism"
WIT_internationalism_desc:0 "Across the world, there are many creatures living in an oppressed state under the hoof of their tyrants, landlords and factory owners. It is our obligation to break their chains, to cast them free from the appalling conditions they live in, and spread the socialist revolution worldwide."
WIT_centrist_paramilitary_idea:0 "Green-Red-Gold Banner of the Republic"
WIT_centrist_paramilitary_idea_desc:0 "Green-Red-Gold Banner of the Republic is a paramilitary organization dedicated to guarding the nascent democracy of Wittenland. Its membership primarily consists of HEF party members, but some of them come from the GAB and HCG parties as well. Alongside its paramilitary duty, the organization also educates the populace about democracy and their constitutional rights as citizens."
WIT_revised_labour_laws:0 "Revised Labour Laws"
WIT_revised_labour_laws_desc:0 "Queen White Star started to move in the right direction, but her changes to the labour laws were still overly favourable to factory owners, with syndicates gaining only minimal rights. Eight hour of work per day and the right to strike will be the new guideline, and factory owners will be compensated to some degree for their expected losses."
WIT_defanged_government:0 "Defanged Government"
WIT_defanged_government_desc:0 "The state's authority should be concentrated in what are nation-wide interests exclusively, such as policing, military and courts. The citizens will be protected from aggression, fraud and other misdoings, while being free to pursue their day-to-day activities without active state interference."
WIT_trade_post_idea:0 "Wittenlandic Trade Post"
WIT_trade_post_idea_desc:0 "Wittenlanders have established a trade post in our land, and now ferry goods back and forth on their river barges. This has given a minor boost to our economy."
WIT_slashed_taxes:0 "Slashed Taxes"
WIT_slashed_taxes_desc:0 "Although taxes are a government's necessary evil, too much burden puts a chokehold on the population's willingness to invest and spend their hard earned currency. In accordance with the principles of our economic guidelines, we have drastically reduced multiple forms of taxation (such as income, property and corporate tax) to encourage the growth of private businesses."
WIT_right_to_bear_arms_idea:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
WIT_right_to_bear_arms_idea_desc:0 "The common pony needs to be armed and organised; the proletariat will ensure its freedom through ownership of firearms. Under no circumstance should weapons and ammunition be surrendered, such attempts must be frustrated by force, if necessary."
WIT_privatised_welfare_idea:0 "Private Welfare"
WIT_privatised_welfare_idea_desc:0 "Responsibility for providing welfare has been given to private companies themselves, so the rules of free market competition can affect the pricing and quality of it. Oftentimes, companies provide welfare directly to their own workers."
WIT_minimum_wage:0 "Minimum Wage"
WIT_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Unrestricted economic growth has led us to overlook certain rights for workers, namely minimum wage. To avoid Voliare's displeasure, [WIT.GetLeader] has promulgated an emergency law codifying the minimal amount of money a worker is entitled to per hour's labour."
WIT_economic_council_idea:0 "Economic Council Of Wittenland"
WIT_economic_council_idea_desc:0 "An advisory council of industrialists and capitalists has been established to guide the government's economic policy. Checks are in place to ensure they don't guide the policy too much, however."
WIT_agriaid_idea:0 "Agricultural Aid"
WIT_agriaid_idea_desc:0 "The farmers of Wittenland have long struggled with our nation's poor and rugged soil, but subsidies from the government should help them acquire the equipment needed to turn even barren land into fertile soil."
WIT_central_bank_idea:0 "Central Bank Of Wittenland"
WIT_central_bank_idea_desc:0 "A central monetary authority is required to oversee the national financial policy, have a monopoly on creating new currency, and ensure that their partner institutions are following regulations. Furthermore, it is independent from political interference, although we have some mechanisms to intervene should a difficult situation present itself."
WIT_integration_idea:0 "Vassal Integration"
WIT_integration_idea_desc:0 "Wittenland, our overlord, has begun to expand their administration into our nation, and clearly intend to abolish our automony sooner rather than later."

WIT_technocratic_principles_idea:0 "Technocratic Principles"
WIT_technocratic_principles_idea_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply espouse the ideas of merit and technology, there must be an involvement of educated, capable ponies in making difficult decisions. Nopony knows everything, and relying on each other's wisdom and experience will benefit Wittenland greatly."
WIT_grand_canal:0 "The Grand Griffking Canal"
WIT_grand_canal_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Queen Honoria, tens of thousands of workers managed to carve out one of the world's largest canals in Papaglia, connecting the Griffking river to the Barradian rivers and thus to the southern seas. This has created a new trade route, which is much shorter and cheaper than alternative routes which rely on portages."
WIT_silver_mine:0 "The Cemricia Silver Mine"
WIT_silver_mine_desc:0 "The Cemricia silver mine was once one of the largest sources of silver in the world, before its easily accessible deposits were exhausted and the mine was closed for being unprofitable. Modern mining equipment however allowed exploitation of new veins of silver and thus the mine was reopened."

WIT_next_stage:0 "The Next Stage Of Reforms"
WIT_next_stage_desc:0 ""For many years, my attempts to reform Wittenland have regularly been stymied by the venerable Lord Wulfric of Cemricia and his noble lackeys. To openly act against them would lower my own support; my next moves must be careful and deliberate. Only then can my home become a model of contemporary times.""
WIT_centralize_banking:0 "Centralize The Banks"
WIT_centralize_banking_desc:0 ""The invention of banking has revolutionised how finances work; no longer was the wealth of a nation determined by the sovereign's purse.

WIT_demand_deet:0 "An Ultimatum For The Traitors"
WIT_demand_deet_desc:0 ""Austurland, too, once proudly served the kingdom of Wittenland, before they grew indolent and slothful, reneging on their oaths and promises. The deer must be reminded who allowed them to settle where there was little land to share, and stress what could occur should they fail to prostrate themselves before their rightful rulers.""
WIT_restore_high_kingdom:0 "Restore The High Kingdom!"
WIT_restore_high_kingdom_desc:0 ""Many have said it could not be done, that this old stallion was delusional, but where are they now? Beaten into obedience as it is rightful and proper! Éawalda, the River-Rule has been restored, and it is fitting to celebrate such an event with a resplendent celebration, one to commemorate this success for a lasting memory.""
WIT_ancient_regime:0 "The Ancient Regime"
WIT_ancient_regime_desc:0 ""I've been tried to be courteous, I've tried to be patient, but the pitiful rebellion left me with little choice. Strict deference from peasants to their lawful lords must be maintained, everypony in the armed forces suspected of harbouring sympathies to the republican idea will be imprisoned, and the rightfulness of my rule will not be questioned.""
WIT_redistribute_rebel_assets:0 "Redistribute Assets"
WIT_redistribute_rebel_assets_desc:0 ""There is little choice on what must be done with traitors. By forsaking their oaths of fealty and service, they've left us with no choice but to proceed with the harshest punishments we can muster, short of death penalty itself. As a life in imprisonment will hopefully cause them to repent for their crimes, their possessions will be put to better use."
WIT_limited_concessions:0 "Limited Concessions"
WIT_limited_concessions_desc:0 ""One would be surprised to know that I am not entirely unreasonable and harsh. Indeed, perhaps I've overreached myself at certain points, but it still does not excuse the revolters' actions. But I must now trot more cautiously. A certain balance must be maintained to keep the peasants relatively... content with their place in life.""
WIT_magocratic_might:0 "Magocratic Might"
WIT_magocratic_might_desc:0 ""Magic, the mastery of the arcane, is the primordial rule keeping our nation together. Those who would push it aside in favour of machines and bullets are simple-minded fools. Thaumaturgy has only progressed and improved since ancient times, and while some feats remain unreplicable today, it is no excuse to cease improving our knowledge.""

WIT_nobles_of_the_robe_desc:0 ""To partake in and enjoy the luxuries of life is a natural choice, and I'd be lying if I didn't indulge from time to time, but it is excess that resulted in Wittenland fallowing behind the rest of world.

WIT_revive_literature:0 "Revive Wittenlandic Literature"
WIT_revive_literature_desc:0 ""One's superiority is not measured with only magical feats or strength, but with the diversity of culture, as well.

WIT_patron_of_workers_desc:0 ""Although the ideas of Marks are entirely incompatible with everything that is proper and good in this world, there is a point to be made about proper treatment of one's workforce.

WIT_thousand_year_republic:0 "A Thousand-Year Republic"
WIT_thousand_year_republic_desc:0 "Wittenland was a monarchy for well over a thousand years. But that age has now ended. The old order has been overthrown and the corrupt Witenagemot disbanded. Republican ideals will guide us towards a free and equal utopia, which will last over a thousand years!"
WIT_fate_of_nobles:0 "The Fate Of The Nobility"
WIT_fate_of_nobles_desc:0 "The mage-noble dynasties of Wittenland have dominated us for countless generations. Now their rule is over, but it remains to be decided: What is to be done to them? Every party has a different view on the matter, and Voliare will let the Council of Deputies decide on what to do."
WIT_fate_of_loyalists:0 "The Fate Of The Loyalists"
WIT_fate_of_loyalists_desc:0 "Many soldiers in the army of Wittenland still claim loyalty to the old order, having sworn oaths of loyalty to the monarchy. If we wish for our republican government to survive, we need to do something about those ponies who still stand against us."
WIT_fate_of_clergy:0 "The Fate Of The Clergy"
WIT_fate_of_clergy_desc:0 "The monarchy had always been a generous supporter of the mountain monasteries, and in return the monks were loyal to the monarchy. They have so far been distrustful of our republican government and threaten to turn the commonfolk against us and our rule. We must take care of the matter at once."
WIT_seek_recognition:0 "Seek Recognition"
WIT_seek_recognition_desc:0 "Now that our young republic has been stabilized, it is time we send ambassadors to other countries in the River Coalition, asking them to recognize our republican government as the legitimate one. Foreign support would dampen the spirits of the monarchists and increase citizenry's confidence in us."
WIT_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
WIT_new_constitution_desc:0 "The old Kingdom never had a proper codified constitution that would've clearly defined the structure of the state. This is what allowed the degregation and decadence of Wittenland and the aristocracy's rise to power. Our republic needs a constitution that guarantees universal suffrage, establishes separation of powers and safeguards the rights of ponies."
WIT_my_work_here_is_done:0 "My Work Here Is Done"
WIT_my_work_here_is_done_desc:0 "A constitution has been drafted, the republican government properly established and parliamentary elections prepared. Everything is now ready for Wittenland's full transition into democracy, equality and liberty. Voliare, the interim leader of the nation, is content. Now he can finally step down, knowing the Republic is in safe hooves."

WIT_commie_gang:0 "The Proletariat of GAB"
WIT_commie_gang_desc:0 "The party of workers and peasants has risen to power in the Republic, led by fiery Violet Plough. Under her rule, Wittenland will warmly embrace the ideas of Caramel Marks, seeking to create a truly equal society free from capitalist oppression. But whether democracy will be part of that "utopia" remains to be seen."
WIT_crush_bourgeois:0 "Crush The Oppressors"
WIT_crush_bourgeois_desc:0 "The rising capitalist class of Wittenland seeks to inherit the magocratic oppressors of old. Wage slavery is no better than serfdom! Our Workers' Republic has no place for wealthy tyrants who wish to rob the common ponies. We shall hunt them and drive them out of our country, and kill them if they resist!"
WIT_mother_of_republic:0 "Mother Of The Republic"
WIT_mother_of_republic_desc:0 "Violet Plough is a mare filled with fiery determination. She is the one who led the proletariat in their rise to power. Without her, it is unlikely GAB would even exist as a political force. We have her to thank for saving Wittenland from the burghers. Therefore, does she not deserve to be rewarded most generously for her hard work?"
WIT_griffon_comrades:0 "Join With Our Griffon Comrades"
WIT_griffon_comrades_desc:0 "The revolution has been successful in the west as well, and griffon proletariat have successfully seized power. We should abandon the capitalist River Coalition and join with our comrades in the Evi Valley who are in dire need of our help! By working together, we can spread the light of revolution to all races."
WIT_pony_comrades:0 "Voice Of The Workers In The Coalition"
WIT_pony_comrades_desc:0 "Proletariat of other nations in the River Coalition have not been as successful as we have been. Therefore it is our duty to represent the workers' cause in the Coalition, opposing any oppressive reforms. With enough support from the proletariat, we'll be able to minimize capitalist and reactionary influence in the coalition, hopefully uniting it into a communist Federation in the future."
WIT_land_and_freedom:0 "Land And Freedom"
WIT_land_and_freedom_desc:0 "Those who do not employ wage slavery are not burghers. Thus, the peasants are part of the working class. Indeed, much of GAB's membership consists of small-holders and former serfs, and our party's agenda was always land socialization. Now it can be fulfilled: Those ponies who work the land deserve to own it collectively, becoming free from feudal and capitalist oppression."
WIT_socialize_factories:0 "Socialize The Factories"
WIT_socialize_factories_desc:0 "The urban proletariat have been the vanguards of our revolution, so why should they remain in chains? The factories belong to those who use them, and they shall have them. Workers' councils will replace burgher overseers and assume control of the economy under the loose guidance of the central government of the Republic."
WIT_communal_councils:0 "Establish Communal Councils"
WIT_communal_councils_desc:0 "As an alternative to the parliamentary system, we will establish a more equal and democratic government based on local councils. Council delegates are elected and can be recalled by their constituents, which means citizens themselves run the government. For some reason, the remaining burghers in our country refuse to participate in councils, even though they are not disenfranchised."
WIT_international_cause:0 "The International Cause"
WIT_international_cause_desc:0 "Our own struggle to liberate ourselves was not isolated. Workers all around the world are fighting and striving to liberate themselves from tyranny of capitalism and feudalism. We must do everything we can to aid these brave revolutionaries. Only united in purpose can we stand against reactionary aggression. Workers of the world, unite!"
WIT_liberate_barrad:0 "Liberate Barrad"
WIT_liberate_barrad_desc:0 "Barrad is clear proof of the old monarchy's decadence and weakness. A madpony seized power in the region, establishing his own state of sorts run by a cabal of maddened mages. And what did the monarchy do? Nothing! But we are the new Republic, and unlike our predecessors, we shall take immediate action to liberate the ponies of Barrad."
WIT_integrate_barrad:0 "Integrate Barrad"
WIT_integrate_barrad_desc:0 "Barrad was, de jure, part of the Kingdom, and thus we inherited its claims on the region. However, we cannot simply restore the old local government, as it was based on the old aristocratic model. Instead, the region needs democratic institutions and elections established. But first we must decide if we should try to salvage the area in the first place."
WIT_little_sister_republic:0 "Little Sister Republic"
WIT_little_sister_republic_desc:0 "Down south, the small country of Kása has long been a beacon of hope and liberty in the entire region. They espose capitalist values and have acted as a haven for refugees. We should seek to bring them to our fold, for they are in dire need of our protection in these uncertain times."
WIT_coltstream_question:0 "The Coltstream Question"
WIT_coltstream_question_desc:0 "Another territory we have claimed is Coltstream, which River Republic took from the Kingdom many years ago. While some ponies say we should let them have it as a sign of friendship between our nations, others say that the land is rightful clay of the Republic. We should approach the occupiers of Coltstream and ask them about the matter."
WIT_socdem_gang:0 "The Moderates of HEF"
WIT_socdem_gang_desc:0 "The centrists led by Marshal Sigeweard Spellshield have gained victory in the elections, presenting an appealing middle ground between tradition and progression, and between socialism and capitalism. Sigeweard is firmly opposed to radicalism and is determined to defend the Republic from both internal and external threats."
WIT_hold_trial:0 "Hold Trials For The Communists"
WIT_hold_trial_desc:0 "Thanks to the brave efforts of Sigeweard Spellshield, we have managed to avoid disaster and save democracy from doom. Now we must do the difficult task of dispensing justice to those responsible. The communists may have been our comrades once, but they have condemned themselves with their foolish actions and no longer deserve our trust and respect."
WIT_centrist_paramilitary:0 "Form Anti-Extremist Paramilitary"
WIT_centrist_paramilitary_desc:0 "The violent acts of the communists have given us a grim reminder how fragile our Republic is. We must remain vigilant against the threats of radicals within our nation. To defend parliamentary democracy and to teach the ponies to respect the Republic, we will form a paramilitary organization called "Green-Red-Gold Banner of the Republic", led by veterans loyal to the new order."
WIT_fight_against_radicalism:0 "Take A Stand Against Radicalism"
WIT_fight_against_radicalism_desc:0 "The River Coalition is endangered from within by extreme ideologies and ruthless rulers who do not care for the sanctity of law and order. If we wish to truly remain united, we must expunge these internal threats from our Coalition! We must contact other moderates in the Coalition and convince them that this act must be done as soon as possible, before it is too late."
WIT_advocate_reform:0 "Pragmatic Cooperation"
WIT_advocate_reform_desc:0 "While we, the members of the River Coalition, may not always agree on everything, we did agree to put aside our differences so we could face outside threats together. If we want our Coalition to become something greater than a mere alliance, we need to expand our cooperation and learn to tolerate one another. Only then can we face radicals from outside the Coalition."
WIT_revise_labour_laws:0 "Revise Labour Laws"
WIT_revise_labour_laws_desc:0 "The primary purpose for the leftist agitation is our outdated and unjust legislation regarding working conditions. These laws must be rewritten before another coup attempt is launched by disgruntled workers. At the same time, we cannot give them too many rights, lest we anger the employers and the owners of farms and factories. Like with everything, we will try to find the middle path."
WIT_cultural_preservation:0 "Cultural Preservation Act"
WIT_cultural_preservation_desc:0 "In these times of rapid change, we cannot hope to remain stuck in the past. However, neither should we forget our roots. For that purpose, the Cultural Preservation Act has established the Institute of Cultural Heritage, whose purpose it is to protect and rejuvenate Wittenland's culture. This includes buildings, monuments, artifacts, art, oral tradition, religious practices and natural sites."
WIT_economic_council:0 "Economic Advisory Council"
WIT_economic_council_desc:0 "When making policies, we shouldn't ignore the interests of those ponies responsible for running our economy. As such, we should establish a business association to represent the interests of the mercantile middle class. However, the council will act in a purely advisory role, as their interests sometimes conflict with those of the common workers."
WIT_school_for_unicorns:0 "President Sigeweard's School For Gifted Unicorns"
WIT_school_for_unicorns_desc:0 "Wittenland is famed for its talented unicorns, but there never was a proper centralized educational facility where such unicorns could be trained. Equestria has had one for centuries and their mages have surpassed ours in many ways while we languished in decadence. Now our President has proposed we open a similar School of Magic, where unicorns can refine their skills free of charge."
WIT_new_bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild Bureaucracy From The Ground Up"
WIT_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The old bureaucratic apparatus of the monarchy was bloated and corrupt. Queen White Star tried to fix it, when she should've just torn it all down and remade it from scratch. The old administrative divisions, based on feudal sub-realms, will be replaced. The new machinery of government will be modern and efficient, with specialized ministries focusing on their assigned responsibilities."
WIT_education_for_all:0 "Liquidate Illiteracy"
WIT_education_for_all_desc:0 "Illiteracy has no place in our Republic. Commoners who cannot write or read are impaired and struggle to be proper democratic citizens. We must initiate a swift campaign to completely eradicate illiteracy in our country, so our society can become truly modern and civilized."
WIT_no_poverty_focus:0 "Eradicate Poverty"
WIT_no_poverty_focus_desc:0 "The overthrowing of the old order was largely motivated by the poor conditions of the lower classes. Now the common ponies are in charge, and we will do everything we can to bring an end to poverty in Wittenland. We will have no slums, no beggars, no starving peasants. Investments and vocational training programs will quickly vitalize the working class."
WIT_central_bank:0 "Establish A Central Bank"
WIT_central_bank_desc:0 "Instead of having a single national bank or leaving the control of money in the hooves of private banks, we shall have a central bank to oversee our banking system. It will manage the monetary supply and interest rates and prevent individual banks from engaging in fraudulent acts. It shall also be fully independent from political interference by the government."
WIT_libtard_gang:0 "The Liberators of HCG"
WIT_libtard_gang_desc:0 "The mercantile libertarians led by Eadberhta Featherwing have won the elections, promising liberty and equality for the ponies of Wittenland. Eadberhta promises to weaken the central government so the citizens of the Republic -- and more importantly, the economy -- can be as free as possible."
WIT_ban_commie_cucks:0 "Ban The Communist Party"
WIT_ban_commie_cucks_desc:0 "It was clearly a mistake to allow the communists to participate in the republican government. We tried to be reasonable with them, yet they remained stubborn in their misguided ideals. They ended up violating the principle of non-aggression and thus no longer deserve our trust or sympathy. There is no place for communism in Wittenland!"
WIT_defang_state:0 "Defang The State"
WIT_defang_state_desc:0 "While some degree of government is all well and good, it should not be the Republic's responsibility to regulate commerce and force citizens into service. The government, too, should be a voluntary organization, and should only use coercion in response to violation of the non-aggression principle. The state should act as a gentle guide, not as an oppressor."
WIT_offer_deal_to_FRE:0 "Offer An Irresistible Deal To Pònaidhean"
WIT_offer_deal_to_FRE_desc:0 "Our neighbouring cousins in Pònaidhean suffer from a stagnant, underdeveloped economy. They could use our help and generous investments. Of course, we expect something in return: They agree to become our dominion, allowing us free access and use of their ports. Being a landlocked nation has such a negative impact on the economy, after all."
WIT_get_down_to_business:0 "Get Down To Business"
WIT_get_down_to_business_desc:0 "Lucrative opportunities for trade await us abroad. We should follow Voliare's example and go forth, establishing trade posts in distant countries and engaging in commerce with all kinds of creatures. Our boats will sail down the Griffking and Evi rivers, looking for the best deals that can be made. Soon enough, we shall prosper!"
WIT_slash_taxes:0 "Slash The Taxes"
WIT_slash_taxes_desc:0 "With reduced government expenses, we can easily afford to lower the taxes for businesses and citizens alike. This will allow consumers to spend more and for companies to invest more, thus creating increased growth. Taxation is theft, of course, so minimizing its amount not only has an economic imperative, but a moral one as well."
WIT_right_to_bear_arms:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
WIT_right_to_bear_arms_desc:0 "Traditionally, weapon ownership legislation in Wittenland has prevented anypony except for the mage-nobles from carrying arms. White Star's reforms allowed hunting rifles to be used by the commoners, but the Republic and the new constitution did nothing more. Now we can revise the gun ownership laws and allow every citizen to carry weapons for defence."
WIT_privatised_welfare:0 "Private Welfare"
WIT_privatised_welfare_desc:0 "There is a misguided notion that welfare needs to be provided by the government. In truth, companies themselves can guarantee welfare for their own employees. All kinds of welfare can be provided privately: Healthcare, insurance, pension plans, unemployment benefits and so on. It is in the best interest of companies to provide for their workers, and make a profit while at it."
WIT_soldiers_of_fortune:0 "Soldiers Of Fortune"
WIT_soldiers_of_fortune_desc:0 "Instead of forcing our citizens to join the army, we can instead use foreign volunteers to fight on their behalf. These uncertain times mean that there is no shortage of soldiers from all over the world looking for work. We can provide it alongside a generous reward to motivate them. These mercenaries can also be useful in suppressing any internal unrest from the communist workers."

WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military:0 "Review the Wittenland Military"
WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military_desc:0 "A brief assessment of our armed forces leads to the conclusion that our grand military is not only outdated, but woefully underequipped. The military is in dire need of a reform, as it follows an inefficient and old structure. A study into how we can adapt our military is the only course of action."

WIT_superior_firepower_focus:0 "Maelstrom Of Death"
WIT_superior_firepower_focus_desc:0 "In the magically oriented society of Wittenland, flair has distinguished an exceptional unicorn from the rest. It shouldn't be too difficult to adapt this concept for our grand military. The last thing our foes shall see are the most aesthetic, yet deadly explosions."
WIT_import_artillery:0 "Import Artillery From Abroad"
WIT_import_artillery_desc:0 "Having fallen behind on the development of artillery, it falls on us to learn from our allies, or would be rivals. Magic itself cannot replace years of study and development, but having an advanced, functional model of foreign ordnance would do wonders for our needs."
WIT_scrying_company:0 "Utilize Scrying Magic"
WIT_scrying_company_desc:0 "No pony mage, however talented he might be, can see the future. Those who attempted have gone mad, or simply wasted an extensive amount of effort. However, it is well within a decent mage's ability to see events transpiring on a distant location. If the ponies on the field knew what they faced in advance, they would have a greater success rate."
WIT_offensive_infantry_training:0 "Offensive Infantry Training"
WIT_offensive_infantry_training_desc:0 "Although Wittenland prides itself on its numerous mountain holds which have repelled numerous invaders, primarily the vicious Cossacks of the south, warfare has changed and a grand defence cannot win a war on its own. Let us stop hiding behind ramparts and charge our foes, horns blazing."
WIT_overcharged_rifles:0 "Overcharged Magical Rifles"
WIT_overcharged_rifles_desc:0 "Among the nations of the Riverlands, Wittenland was the first to came up independently of the idea for magically infused weaponry. Soon after came the first successful prototype to be used in the field. Following the request from the high command, our engineers will work out a method in making the rifles more powerful, without greatly compromising its reliability."
WIT_anti_tank_tactics:0 "Purchase Anti-Tank Weaponry"
WIT_anti_tank_tactics_desc:0 "Tanks have already made their impact on the battlefield, and their usage is rapidly spreading. Magical rifle shots bounce off armour plates, regular artillery is too inaccurate to counter them. Once more we shall turn to foreign inventions to close the gap in our knowledge, so that we may always be prepared for what we face on the field."

WIT_grand_battleplan_focus:0 "A Bulwark Of Stone And Steel"
WIT_grand_battleplan_focus_desc:0 "Citadels built from mortar and stone may have gone out of fashion, but the idea of a defensive doctrine itself remains relevant. Wittenland needs to merely modernise its existing knowledge and strategies to remain an unassailable fortress no lesser foe shall overcome."
WIT_mandatory_magical_training:0 "Mandatory Magical Training"
WIT_mandatory_magical_training_desc:0 "While it is not possible to have an army made fully of unicorns, we can make strides in expanding the training unicorns go through. To give them more options, to cast complex spells while in the heat of combat, that is the mark of a disciplined soldier, and we would greatly benefit in increasing our standards."
WIT_healing_magic:0 "Recruit Mage Healers"
WIT_healing_magic_desc:0 "Restorative magics are a woefully underappreciated branch of the arcane spectrum. It is rare to find unicorns with the aptitude and desire to specialise in it, but we believe we can spread this knowledge so that a greater number of ponies are able to utilise it. Nothing needs more healers than the army itself, as well."
WIT_mage_engineers:0 "Magical Engineering"
WIT_mage_engineers_desc:0 "A sufficient mastery of the arcane can adequately replace physical hoofwork. That is to say, shovels and satchel charges would become less important, as a corps of skilled magically trained engineers would replace "ordinary" engineers. Of course, a full conversion would not possible, but it is something we should be very interested in looking towards."
WIT_modern_fortifications:0 "Modern Fortifications"
WIT_modern_fortifications_desc:0 "Much like how an old castle has its rings of walls, modern defences have many trenches, nested bunkers, mines and lines of barbed wire and machine guns. To adequately protect our proud home, investment should be given towards fortifying crucial areas of our nation. The question is, where to start?"
WIT_mountain_combat_mastery:0 "Mountain Combat Expertise"
WIT_mountain_combat_mastery_desc:0 "Unlike other Riverland nations who rely on professional corps of pegasi, inspired by the Nimbusians, Wittenland's pride lies within its mountaineers, who are able to traverse difficult terrain to place themselves in an advantageous position. Further training and accolades should be given to them, so that they can remain at the top of their profession."

WIT_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Expand Darnish Crystal Mines"
WIT_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Crystals are a much needed resource in a society such as Wittenland's. A necessary component in magical experiments, recent innovations have uncovered an efficient method of balancing the frequencies between spells and crystals themselves, resulting in an harmonic resonance. Mines will have to be dug deeper to satisfy the demand for more crystals."
WIT_revive_palatine_schools:0 "Revive Palatine Schools"
WIT_revive_palatine_schools_desc:0 "In the ages long past, the Palatine Unicorn Guard accompanied Wittenland's monarch on military marches. Renowned for their unyielding defensive tactics and almost impregnable magical shields, they became infamous for attempting to play kingmaker during a troubled time. Although we have no need for such a force, their strategies are worthwhile to introduce again."
WIT_expand_excubitors:0 "Expand The Ranks Of Excubitors"
WIT_expand_excubitors_desc:0 "Formed to replace the decadent and lazy Palatine Guard, the Excubitors are Wittenland's premiere fighting force, battle-hardened against the many Cossack attacks. Their presence among the supporting battalions could lift the heart of any forlorn pony. Their numbers have shrunk over the years, and we believe the Excubitors could use a much needed revival."
WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery:0 "Crystal Crafting Mastery"
WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery_desc:0 "Crystals are a natural medium for storing spells due to the similar frequencies both possess. Yet, they are incredibly fragile and require a master spellweaver and crystalblower to avoid shattering during the transfer. Their skills are a closely guarded secret earned by years of work, but it is necessary in this age to spread the knowledge wide."
WIT_new_mage_generals:0 "Nimbusian Military Advisors"
WIT_new_mage_generals_desc:0 "It is without doubt that Wittenlandic ingenuity can overcome any obstacle, but sometimes, we must seek help from our pony kin. The Nimbusians are famed for their martial skill and prowess, and it would be in our best interest to seek their assistance in improving our armed forces. As long as civility is maintained, of course."
#A tree falls so that its seeds may grow anew. With the recent expansion and modernisation of our complete armed forces, the Wittenland general staff has become insufficient. It must expand, with bright new strategists to properly lead our contemporary armies to victory. We have already decided on several promising candidates.
WIT_enchanted_tanks:0 "Enchanted Armour Experimentation"
WIT_enchanted_tanks_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have already shown their worth in the wider world, but Wittenlandic ingenuity could take them to the next level of effectiveness. If armour plates could be quickly and reliably enchanted, without an insurmountable cost in resources, Wittenland shall be at the forefront in the new age of warfare. The state should sponsor those who have already begun experimenting."
WIT_proving_day:0 "Magical Proving Day"
WIT_proving_day_desc:0 "One of the many traditions that grace Wittenland are Magical Provings, competitions where sorcerers would show off their inate talents and perform bedazzling feats of arcane mastery. Those who rise to the top would not only be eligible for rewards, but also an opportunity for employment. It is not just a recruitment drive, but also a festival that celebrates the magical abilities of Wittenlanders."
WIT_restore_austurian_guard:0 "Restore The Austurian Guard"
WIT_restore_austurian_guard_desc:0 "When Wittenland was subjugated and defeated, it was King Haysil II and his heroic band of deer mercenaries who freed our nation, and the same deer became the protectors of this realm. Yet this guard dispersed over the past centuries. To the south, Austurland has recently experienced a turmoil, and many of their nobles have been exiled. We can offer them a home, in exchange for service."

## Navy
WIT_Navy_Start:0 "Landlocked No More"
WIT_Navy_Start_desc:0 "Not since the days of King Haysil II has Wittenland controlled a large area of coastline. Recent developments in our favour have made this history a reality once more, and the possibilities are endless. The Wittenlandic trade fleet shall sail again, and more importantly, we can commence development of a modern naval force."
WIT_Destroyer_Tech:0 "The Destroyer Development Initiative"
WIT_Destroyer_Tech_desc:0 "Although building a ship is a simple matter, to create a decent warship is a different concern. To accumulate knowledge and experience for our further plans, we shall begin by constructing a humble destroyer. Fast and nimble, they can serve in many roles, depending on the situation. Most importantly, our new trade lanes need protection."
WIT_Cruiser_Tech:0 "To Cruise the Seas"
WIT_Cruiser_Tech_desc:0 "As naval warfare continues to increase in its destructive capabilities, larger vessels are required to hold the line. Thus, cruisers of varied weight and armament are vital for fulfilling the role of scouting distant waters and commerce raiding. With the continued questioning of heavy battleship value, cruisers will serve as our largest warships."
WIT_Navy_Base:0 "Designated Naval Bases"
WIT_Navy_Base_desc:0 "A suitable stretch of coastline must be found, adapted and placed into service as our center of naval operations. From there, ships will be stationed for repairing, refuelling and retrofitting. Additionally, the local economy of the area is certain to improve as new jobs and settlements are created."
WIT_Battleship_Tech:0 "The Pride of the Navy"
WIT_Battleship_Tech_desc:0 "We are committed towards restricting our investment in larger capital ships, however cruisers can be adapted with thicker belt armour. This added protection allows us to place more turrets on the ship without endangering the structural integrity. A limited amount of these vessels should greatly improve the prestige of our new fleet."
WIT_Dockyards:0 "One Rivet at a Time"
WIT_Dockyards_desc:0 "The naval installations we took over after our conquest have proven to be insufficient for our grand designs. Further ports, shipyards and drydocks must be built to facilitate the continued growth and maintenance of the Wittenlandic fleet."

WIT_Air_Start_desc:0 "The airplane may be a griffon invention, but it allows unprecedented options for waging warfare. No longer shall we bound to the ground, and neither will be the pegasi scoff at us for being unable to fly. One simple technology puts everypony at the same level, and we shall benefit greatly from it as a result."
WIT_Fighter_Tech:0 "Better Biplanes"
WIT_Fighter_Tech_desc:0 "In the past, some nobles have purchases biplanes from the west, not just to show off their wealth and connections, but for recreational purposes. Some of these airplanes ended up in service of the nation, where they showed great usage in scouting, but little else. The world has left the biplane behind long ago, and we must modernise."
WIT_Bomber_Tech:0 "Payload Delivery Options"
WIT_Bomber_Tech_desc:0 "Artillery has permanently changed warfare centuries ago, but despite continued improvements it was always limited by simple physics. What good is the most destructive shell when the range of the ordnance is insufficient to reach the target? Thus we look to the obvious solution in the form of a dedicated airplane for deploying bombs. It will be a scale of devastation not seen before."
WIT_CAS_Tech:0 "Multi-Role Aircraft Development"
WIT_CAS_Tech_desc:0 "So far airplanes have shown to be remarkably flexible in their options. However, a dedicated design is required to be able to properly support an ongoing ground assault. With their escort, ponies on the ground will achieve their objectives with higher chances of success and be emboldened to greater feats of bravery."
WIT_Air_Base:0 "The Roost"
WIT_Air_Base_desc:0 "Proper aircraft maintenance and supply is a surprisingly elaborate endeavour. We have several impromptu bases from which they take off and land, but they're reaching their limits as our airforce grows. A centralised airfield must be built to properly house our planes, and to coordinate all aerial operations."
WIT_Rocket_Tech:0 "To Top the Mountains"
WIT_Rocket_Tech_desc:0 "A long time ago, we used to believe that the mountains endlessly climb to the skies, and that the spirits would punish anypony who tried to overcome this insurmountable obstacle. Times have changed, and we know certain matters much better. A new technology awaits research, that could break all previous barriers, and ensure our supremacy."

WIT_invite_advisors_desc:0 "Wittenland may yet be great, but first it needs to rely on a helping hoof from our kin. [RCT.GetName] and [LCT.GetName] are farther ahead in industrial development, and this is evident by their growing wealth, population and production. Distasteful as we may be of foreign influences, we have little choice but to invite several captains of industry to help modernise Wittenland. For a price, of course."
WIT_hire_diamond_dogs:0 "Hire Diamond Dog Miners"
WIT_hire_diamond_dogs_desc:0 "The Diamond Dogs to the north are a brutish race, yet even beasts have their uses. They are experts without peer in excavation, and given their relatively undereducated standards, we can even pay them less than we would our earth ponies. A small price for uncovering the vast mineral wealth we possess, which is crucial for our further development."
WIT_ivanhorn_dam:0 "Build The Ivanhorn Dam"
WIT_ivanhorn_dam_desc:0 "The river near Ivanhorn is in a suitable position for the construction of a modern dam, which will provide new jobs and energy, but also fresh water for domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes. Cooperation with Lakeish engineers will be required, as we cannot manage this project on our own entirely, but the benefits more than make up for it. The ecological effect is also estimated to be minimal."
WIT_railway_tunnels:0 "Excavate Road Tunnels"
WIT_railway_tunnels_desc:0 "The mountains we call home, the same ones we worship, present a barrier towards connecting our nation. Although it is certainly possible to use winding roads crossing mountain passes, such paths are very inefficient.

WIT_food_problem:0 "The Food Problem"
WIT_food_problem_desc:0 "As population grows, so does the need for more produce. Wittenland itself is sparse on suitable land, however. While the simple solution would be to increase food imports, it would be costlier in the long run and subject to the whims of our trading partners.

WIT_restore_guilds_desc:0 "The guilds of old were confraternities of craftsponies that had control over their designated craft. They reduced competition and maintained good quality of work.

Now King Wulfic has issued letters of patent to refound guilds, and already thousands of craftsponies are joining."
WIT_patronage:0 "Patronage Of Arts And Sciences"
WIT_patronage_desc:0 "The monarch of Wittenland has traditionally offered his or her patronage to talented artists and scholars, gathering an entourage of intellectuals to elevate the prestige of the monarchy.

WIT_state_controlled_trade:0 "State-Controlled Trade"
WIT_state_controlled_trade_desc:0 "Trade is too important to be left entirely in the greedy hooves of the burghers. Instead, the royal government should oversee commerce and intervene directly whenever necessary, to ensure the state retains a secure supply of strategic goods and so the price of cereals doesn't rise too high.

#### EVENTS ####
wittenland.1.t:0 "The Springfield Festival"
wittenland.1.d:0 "Queen White Star cut the ribbon announcing the start of the Springfield Festival, a celebration of the end of winter in Wittenland. Unlike in other pony nations, here there weren't enough pegasi to properly manage weather, so the coming of spring was always a relief worth celebrating. The Queen's subjects stomped their hooves in approval, whilst conservative nobles stood beside her majesty, barely masking their distaste for the commoners. The mountain monks in their humble robes blessed the audience, and the feasting could now begin.\n\nWhite Star smiled. Attending a smaller festival in Ivanhorn, instead of the lavish square of Wittenburgh, has been an inspired choice. Lord Wulfric Grey, however, was furious. The old stallion had already been grumbling about the burdens placed upon him by granting peasants additional rights, and now he was forced to stand with former serfs and new money to attend alongside the Queen.\n\nShe briefly frowned, considering the problems it might cause, and then brightened. The head of the Calcrond Artificers was drinking wine, standing by a table laden with some of the finest produce of the last year's harvesting season. The nobles were hesitant to eat the peasant food, but commoners like the head artificer seemed to enjoy it. A little suggestion here and there, a trade concession or two, and Wulfric would find himself difficulty in getting priority shipping over some of the newer merchants from the lower classes. Wulfric would understand immediately. He knew the game as well as anypony.\n\nQueen White Star took a sip of wine as she approached the head artificer. This would be a long, but productive day..."
wittenland.1.a:0 "A strong start to the year."

wittenland.2.t:0 "The Gallant Gala"
wittenland.2.d:0 "Lyres were played as exquisitely dressed mage-nobles crossed the marble floors of the Wittenburgh Gala Hall. Centuries old silverware had been neatly arranged on the tables, while exotic foods from distant lands sat alongside traditional Wittenlandic peasant dishes.\n\nWhispers followed Queen White Star as she entered. There would be Tartarus to pay for her little stunt in Ivanhorn, and here, surrounded by the most elite of Wittenland at the most exclusive ball of the season, she would find little support from her new friends amongst the middle classes.\n\nHer mareservant, Dayne, returned with a glass of Vinovian wine, taking an opportunity to lean close. "My Queen, Steel Little has expressed openness to leaving the Count of Papaglia to work with you, but I've urgent news. Lord Wulfric and two of the Barons from Hengestdelu have secured exclusive trading rights with one of the new electronics manufacturers in Rijekograd."\n\nWhite Star turned in shock, before smiling as if she had mistakenly thought she had recognised someone as she hissed, "What?! How? Those contracts were supposed to be open bid!"\n\nShe calculated, her heart racing. Despite her previous successes, with the extra wealth and influence generated by these contacts, the conservative factions would be strengthened for years to come. Maintaining her existing reforms might become a battle, much less passing new reforms.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted as a smiling Lord Wulfric held out his hoof. "May I have the pleasure of a dance, Your Highness?" White Star worked to keep her composure. With Wulfric hosting this year's Gala, it would be an egregious breach of courtesy to refuse the invitation..."
wittenland.2.a:0 "This is going to be a long evening."

wittenland.200.t:0 "The Annual Queening"
wittenland.200.d:0 "The doors of the Royal Palace opened as Wittenland's most powerful unicorns strode into the throne room. The annual hearing of the challenges was a sacred Wittenlandic tradition - the foundation of their ancient meritocracy, the last remnant of a golden age where anyone with enough skill, learning and determination could challenge the reigning monarch to a magical duel and potentially become the new ruler, no matter their background. Yet even then, only those with the support of the Witenagemot could issue a challenge, and more often than not proper education in magic could only be afforded by the wealthy. One day, White Star hoped all this would change. But for now, she needed to remain secure in her rule to pass her reforms, so the number of challengers remained limited.\n\nShe sat on her throne, rubbing her forehead with her hoof and calming her nerves. No amount of skill could make a duel safe for either side, and her safety relied more on expedience than skill - a defeat would be politically devastating for Wulfric, and even should he win, the nobility might ignore his demands. Perhaps even worse for Wulfric, she could simply step down and grant him the throne, assemble her supporters, and return in strength later.\n\nHer mareservant Dayne addressed the crowd: "The Queen issues a call - let any who have the backing of the Witenagemot and the magical skill to claim the throne step forward." There was a small commotion at the back of the crowd, but no one spoke. Wulfric stood at the back of the hall, his face as motionless as stone. White Star relaxed. The ruckus was likely caused by a young hothead mage who had just been restrained by his peers. "Let it be noted that the Queen continues her rule as the legitimate, uncontested ruler of the Kingdom of Wittenland!" Dayne announced.\n\nWulfric glanced at White Star as he turned to leave. She frowned, and felt like she had seen an ominous grin on his lips."
wittenland.200.a:0 "Until next year, then."

wittenland.3.t:0 "The Debate"
wittenland.3.d:0 "The galleries of the Great Library echoed as Queen White Star outlined her plans for the year, with various nobles standing to make objections, comments and agreements. As usual, it was the topic of political reform that attracted the most attention. The argument became increasingly heated as the progressive supporters of White Star clashed with conservatives led by Lord Wulfric.\n\nThe grey-maned mage-noble grew tired of the bickering and rose up, speaking with a loud and raspy voice. "I do not see why you see reform as an urgent necessity. Wittenland has stood for a thousand years, outlasting both of its foes, the petty Princes of Jezeragrad and Rijekograd. Defended by our magic and our mountain spirits, it shall stand a thousand years more."\n\nWhite Star decided to counter him personally. "Lord Wulfric, may I remind you that after their monarchies ended, Lake City and River Republic surpassed us in military and economic power, modernizing rapidly? And I wonder what the ponies of Ivanhorn thought of the power of magic and mountains when Gryphian Cossacks burned their city to the ground, making it clear we were too weak to defend ourselves and had to join the River Coalition. Do you want us to fall behind even more and remain a rural backwater, or do you want us to catch up to our neighbours?"\n\n"Bah! You want to give the commoners a hoof, and they will take the entire leg. You are blind to the dangers of liberalism. River Republic recently had a crisis that brought their pathetic republic to a standstill and Lake City's government is a slave to its army. If we look further, we see what happened when Equestria, Aquileia and the Griffonian Empire allowed liberal ideas to flourish. Our western cousins lost one of their wealthiest provinces to a workers' revolt, the griffon King lost his head, and the Empire collapsed entirely.""
wittenland.3.a:0 "The audience murmurs..."

wittenland.300.t:0 "The Debate Continues"
wittenland.300.d:0 "The mage-nobles murmured. Wulfric was right. It could not be denied that liberalism, if taken to an extreme, was dangerous.\n\nWhite Star pursed her lips, persisting on the argument. "Those terrible things didn't happen because liberal ideas were 'allowed to flourish'. They happened because of the opposite. Repression and decadence led to unrest, and attempts to suppress that unrest ended in disaster. And regarding our neighbours, it cannot be denied that they have issues, but we should learn from them instead of disregarding their politics entirely because they're not perfect. In the end, Lake City and River Republic dominate the Riverlands, and that is because they embraced liberal and progressive values. They did so after abolishing their Principalities, but it does not need to be like that for us. If you don't want Wittenland to share the fate of all those monarchies you spoke of, the fate of revolution and even bloodshed, then yes, reform is not only necessary, but urgent."\n\nMost of the nobles nodded in agreement, and the rest remained silent. Even Lord Wulfric could do little more than frown. He still did not agree with White Star, but the counter-arguments he had in mind would not convince White Star and her sycophant supporters. He had no choice but to humbly bow and concede the debate. White Star allowed herself a rare smile, and the mage-nobles commended her arguments. Several conservative nobles promised to now be on her side and support her reforms, even if it meant limiting their own power. Perhaps they had finally realized the greater good of Wittenland was more important than securing their own position."
wittenland.300.a:0 "That went better than expected."

wittenland.4.t:0 "The Derby"
wittenland.4.d:0 "At the grand Hippodrome of Wittenburgh, ponies laughed, cheered and roared as athletes raced, leaped and posed in displays of athleticism. Bets were made whilst mage-nobles proudly posed for photographs with athletes from their provinces and Wittenland's newest import - the radio - broadcast breathless commentary to ponies who eagerly huddled around display units in electronics stores.\n\nQueen White Star made her usual rounds, soothing egos, making promises and twisting legs as necessary. She was in an especially good mood, having convinced Cuthberht Emeraldflame, one of Wittenburgh's finest tacticians, to consider employment with her. While the Derby was primarily an entertainment event, politics were entwined to it as well. It was a great opportunity to meet ponies from all societal classes and to discuss politics. Even the ever-growing divide in society could be seen in the most popular race teams: The Whites, who were cheered on by liberally minded ponies, and the Reds, who received the support of the conservatives.\n\nWine and beer flowed freely (as they always did) as the final event of the day, a championship race between the Whites and the Reds, took place. Ponies cheered loudly and stompted their hooves in excitement as they watched the Derby. White Star could see Wulfric himself in the audience, surrounded by members of his vast family. His beloved granddaughter was on his back, shouting "Go Reds!" at the top of her lungs. The Queen saw another side of the grumpy old stallion which she rarely, if ever, saw. He smiled, laughed, made jokes and enjoyed wine with his relatives. White Star could barely recognize him. It was clear he valued family greatly.\n\nHer majesty then looked at the race itself, and saw that the White team was about to lose. This seemed to make Wulfric and his entourage jubilant, and the Lord even glanced at her, smirking smugly. Seeing how happy he and his family were, White Star simply smiled back, and let them enjoy their victory. It didn't matter in the long run, anyways."
wittenland.4.a:0 "Good fun."

wittenland.5.t:0 "Independence Day"
wittenland.5.d:0 "White Star adorned herself in the formal battle regalia of a Wittenland mage-general, groaning as she did so. On this day 654 years ago, King Haysil II the Lakepony Slayer restored the Kingdom of Wittenland and declared independence from Jezeragrad's River Empire. It was an important celebration for all Wittenlanders, but for White Star, it was far too pompous, militaristic and nationalistic. She felt like independence was not worth much if the nation itself was a mere shadow of its former self.\n\nSince the days of King Haysil, the southern coast had been lost, the mercenary deer of Austurland and the tribes of Pònaidhean had declared independence, and Coltstream had been seized by the Rijekans. Wittenland itself was stuck in the past, failing to keep up with its northern neighbours, stuck with an archaic society with little social mobility. Yet on this day, you had to pretend to be proud of your nation, and criticism was forbidden. "Wittenland on ecnesse", Wittenland forever, as the ponies fanatically chanted.\n\nWhite Star took a deep breath and left the Palace to attend the military parade on the streets of the capital. The banners of the Kingdom were everywhere, fluttering in the cold mountain wind. Commoners and mage-nobles alike spectated the marching columns of soldiers as the army bands played patriotic tunes with their drums and horns. White Star held her head high. She was determined to make this day worth celebrating, so everypony could be genuinely proud of their nation. Maybe make it less about independence and more about their society itself. Tone down the militarism and make it a cultural festival. Yes, that is what she would do. And she would never let the selfish nobles hold her back. She would make Wittenland great again, but not in the way Wulfric and his lapdogs wanted."
wittenland.5.a:0 "A dream of a better future..."

wittenland.6.t:0 "The Grand Fair"
wittenland.6.d:0 "The Grand Fair, held in Wittenburgh's Merchant District, overflowed with abundance. This year's highlights included a magical self-filling wine fountain, a re-enactment of famous historical battles (inevitably, some poor pegasus servants were roped into playing as griffons) and a travelling troupe of Hippogriff performers from across the sea.\n\nIn the middle of it all, White Star sat glumly. Despite her success in the debate, Lord Wulfric had capitalised on his new trading rights to cement several alliances and increase his influence amongst the aristocracy. Eventually, she would undoubtedly face a choice between postponing some of her reforms or facing a leadership challenge.\n\nSo when a runner delivered notes on the morning's trade, White Star did not look up until the usually taciturn Lord Wulfric uttered a curse and hurriedly excused himself from the festivities. Despite their propriety, White Star and the assembled nobles, could not help but curiously crowd around the runner. Even the Hippogriff doing a surprisingly sophisticated double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the Wittenland national anthem failed to distract.\n\nWhite Star impatiently summoned a copy, reading. A successful venture led by Merchant Captain Honoria had returned from Equestria laden with high quality, competitively priced electronics, and with a guarantee from a New Mareland bank underwriting further deliveries.\n\nShe began to laugh. Wulfric's monopolies on obsolete equipment were now an expensive disaster, another victim of the new money in a new world. So distracted in her glee, she didn't notice the letter until her mareservant Dayne politely, but determinedly, levitated it inches from her face."

wittenland.601.d:0 "The river barge slowly approached the dock of Wittenburgh, and the vessel's captain, Honoria Goldmane, was already standing on the prow. She breathed in the clean mountain air. "Ah, it's good to be back home. Is it not, Voliare?" She looked behind her shoulder at her ginger-bearded companion, who was at the ship's wheel.\n"As always. It's a relief to be safely back home."\nHonoria hopped down from the prow. "Not just that. It also means another lucrative venture was successful!" She opened a hatch on the floor and looked down into the cargo bay, which was loaded with metallic machines and gadgets. "These crystal-powered computers from Sicameon will fetch a fine price on the market."\nVoliare smiled faintly. Honoria had known poverty for her entire life, so now, being able to attain wealth and influence despite being a former serf like him, made her very glad and confident in herself. But he hoped she would not let the desire for more overcome her.\n\nThere was a loud thump as the ship docked. Honoria already thought of her customers, of aspiring industrialists and middle class merchants, fellow members of a new generation who had earned their wealth from merit alone. She felt a strong bond with them, and thought that together they could make Wittenland a truly great realm. Meanwhile Voliare looked at the dozens of haulers who began to unload the ship, most of them earth ponies wearing little more than old rags. Despite being a unicorn, he felt sympathy for them. Serfs like him and her might have been freed, but Wittenlandic society still had those who were downtrodden and oppressed. Not everyone was as fortunate as he and Honoria had been."

wittenland.602.d:0 "Once the unloading of cargo and the associated paperwork had been taken care of, Honoria and Voliare headed to a nearby pub to celebrate their return home with tankards of ale. "Say, Honoria, what are your plans for the future?" Voliare asked. "I don't imagine you plan on hoarding more and more wealth forever like some dragon."\nHonoria chuckled. "No, no. I have... other plans. I want to do something meaningful instead of just dragging junk here from distant lands. You know how I've been practicing my magic lately?"\nVoliare nodded. "You've been buying all those expensive spellbooks, too."\n"My parents always said there was something special about me. That my magic was stronger than usual. Only now can I learn to wield that power."\n"And what on earth are you planning to do with it? Never saw you as some studious mage." Voliare shrugged and drank from the tankard.\nShe grinned. "With enough practice, I reckon I can challenge the Queen herself."\nThe stallion spat out the ale in shock. "What?! I thought you liked the Queen."\n"I do. I respect her greatly. But I feel like I could do an even better job than her." Honoria drank from the tankard as well and swiftly decided to switch topic. "And what do you dream of?"\nVoliare wiped the ale from his beard with a napkin. "Nothing much. A roof on top, a wife in bed and children in school. Soon I'll have enough coin to make that dream possible. I suppose we'll have to part ways at that point."\nHonoria smiled. "No, we don't. We can always stay in touch and remain friends." She lifted the tankard high. "A toast to our eternal friendship!"\nVoliare smiled as well and clinked her tankard, then downed the drink."

wittenland.603.d:0 ""I cannot believe you made a deal with your former master," Voliare muttered as he and Honoria left Lord Wulfric's manor in Calcrond.\n"I had to make a deal with a demon," Honoria said. "He'll get those fancy electronics and in return he and his friends will support my challenge to the Queen."\n"Why is that gods-forsaken duel so important to you? You're willing to sacrifice your principles and possibly even your own life for it! Don't forget how dangerous the duels can be."\n"I feel like I have to do it. To prove to everypony that anyone, even a former serf, can become a Queen. When did Wittenland last have a peasant monarch who didn't come from the ranks of the nobility?"\n"There's more to it than that. Be honest with me, Honoria."\nShe sighed. "I also want to prove to myself that I can do it."\n"And? You want to become the Queen for a reason. Tell me what you want to do if you get the throne."\n"Fine! I want to make Wittenland a truly meritocratic nation, where anyone can become great. White Star, for all her greatness, hasn't gone far enough. She leaves the mage-nobles alone. She wants to fix things. I want to tear the whole rotten thing down and build it anew from ground up."\n"Ambitious, as always. And what of the poor? Those who, despite being freed, are still struggling with poverty?"\n"If they can't improve their lives by themselves, then maybe they deserve to be poor."\nVoliare stopped and closed his eyes. Honoria raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong?"\n"Honoria, I cannot support this. Either you'll die or you'll turn into a Queen that I do not wish to serve. Please, reconsider."\nHonoria frowned. "You've stood by my side ever since we met all those years ago, and now when I need you the most, you abandon me, just like that?"\n"Honoria, please, I-"\nHer nostrils flared. "Whatever. I don't need anyone. I am more than capable enough to overcome any obstacle myself. Good bye."\nShe turned around and left, her head held high. Voliare knew she acted unreasonably, but couldn't help but feel regretful for speaking out against her."

wittenland.7.t:0 "Proving Day"
wittenland.7.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] moved through the various podiums as unicorns competed and demonstrated a variety of skills, from enchanting, planning, multitasking, to brute telekinetic strength.\n\nThe Proving Day was an ancient Wittenlandic tradition that Queen White Star had revived during her early reign. It was a day of contests and tests of magical and martial skill, rooted in the meritocratic values that the Kingdom was originally founded upon over a thousand years ago. Any unicorn could participate, regardless of background; the intent was to allow anypony to display their skills in public. This usually allowed ponies from the lower ranks of society to find an easy way to climb the ladder. Over the centuries, the Proving Day had deteriorated due to bribery, nepotism and cheating to the point where it became obsolete and was completely abandoned. The modern Proving Day had no such issues, and even conservative nobles had supported its return, as it had allowed them to find many useful mages and promising officers.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has managed to poach several promising mage-generals. The first new general of the Wittenlandic army is Archmage River Run of High Mane. He is a unicorn blessed with the ability to cast powerful defensive spells. He pioneered the magical bubble shield spell which is used to defend the fortress of High Mane from raiders, basing it on a similar spell used in Canterlot, the capital of Equestria.\n\nThe second general is Mysteria of Ivanhorn, a pegasus who used to lead a small group of lightly armed ranger militia. They would stalk through the forests to ambush cossack raiders, expertly using camouflage and long-range rifles to avoid direct confrontation, always retreating after striking. Her experience in using local terrain could prove useful to us.\n\nLastly, there was Spirit Fire of Wintershorn, a unicorn pyromancer. An eccentric but very mighty mage capable of casting potent fire spells. Her sanity is questionable, but her magical abilities are not. The smell of burning griffon feathers has become familiar to the ponies of Wintershorn thanks to her.\n\nAll three have gladly accepted [Root.GetLeader] offer of positions in the military and are looking forward to loyally serve their homeland on the front."

Notably, [WIT.GetLeader] insisted on having the meeting room refurbished and cleaned up, just to be certain that nothing will disappoint the valued guests.\n\nThe herald announced the names of the Nimbusian commanders, led by the experienced Iódis Avgí, and her entourage consisting of Grígoroi Ánemoi, Maínetai Tyfónas and Schíma Sýnnefou.

He smiled. "However, this does offer up opportunities for heavier armour enchanting," He pointed to the prototype, a training model with newly welded plates of highly durable enchanted steel.

wittenland.10.t:0 "Question of Food Security"
wittenland.10.d:0 "As Wittenland continues to develop, the issue of food security becomes ever more important. If we want our population and cities to keep growing, we will need to secure our supply of food. Currently, because of Wittenland's mountainous terrain, infertile soil and lack of pegasi to manage weather, we are reliant on limited food imports from neighbouring countries, primarily Lake City and River Republic. At the present, the price of food is high because there isn't enough of it produced and imported. Something must be done about the matter before malnourishment becomes a problem.\n\nThe leading advisors in our government have proposed two solutions to [Root.GetLeader]. First, we could sign additional trade agreements with other nations to increase our imports of food even further. This is a quick and easy solution that is, however, quite expensive, as we'll have to buy food from abroad. The other solution is to seek self-reliance on food with new farming methods. We could, for example, invest in terrace farming, which has traditionally been used in eastern Zebrica. This would allow our farmers to increase crop yields by exploiting marginal lands that are currently unused. However, it is a large-scale project that will require several years and thousands of workers to complete.\n\nIt is now up to [Root.GetLeader] to decide which solution to implement. The decision must be made soon, as the demand for food keeps growing."

We now have thousands of additional hectares of farmland ready to be used by our farmers, who have been educated on managing terrace farms so they can minimize soil erosion and maintain the channels and terraces in good condition.\n\nThe first harvest will be ready within a year, and it is expected our harvest will have almost doubled in size.

Modern combat is anticipated to revolve around contemporary rifles, hydraulically stabilised artillery, with specialist support. Our equipment and methods in these areas lags behind major powers. However, we can leverage our mastery of magic to improve our offensive capabilities.\n2. Our military doctrine, based around castles and defence from griffon raiders possessing more traditional weaponry, is ill equipped to the needs of the current era. This does not mean static defences need to be abandoned, but our tactics certainly need to be modernized.\n\nOn this basis, our Great Library has reviewed our current knowledge on various military theories around the world, and suggested approaches for integrating these with a unicorn army and an accelerated technology program matched to it.

wittenland.13.d:0 "When White Star ascended to the throne, she was vexed by the sheer amount of laws that were in effect. From the first codex developed during Wittenland's formation, to Theohooficus' reforms many centuries later, it seemed that nopony was bothered by the paradoxical and oxymoronical notion that laws did not become obsolete with the passage of time. This has led to courts deciding on their own whim which "branch" of the law is canonical, and which should be disregarded when it comes to passing judgement. Naturally, unscrupulous nobles were not above twisting the bloated jurisprudence to their own ends, and thus White Star commissioned a team of finest legal experts in Wittenland to compile and extract relevant royal constitutions, with the explicit authorization to modify and remove that which is outdated, archaic, contradictory, immoral, or simply irrelevant for today.\n\nSince then, a year and a half has passed, and White Star was presented with a collection of tomes containing the purified text of various jurists from Wittenland's history. A quick skim through the first chapters already confirmed that it was a drastic improvement on the current situation. The legal team assembled for this task have certainly earned their pay. Of course, the text would have to be revised again in a shorter and contemporary codification, as few ponies could grasp the intricacies of authors from ages past, but until then, the newly proclaimed Code of White Star would have the full force of the law."

wittenland.16.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader], the new leader of Wittenland, has presented us an intriguing offer: She wishes to pay a substantial amount of gold if we return the disputed region of Wild-Vodina to them.\n\nThe area had been taken from Wittenland by Princess Wild Water, the second last ruler of the Principality of Rijekograd, during a brutal war where most of the heirs to the throne perished in the Siege of High Mane. In the end, Coltstream was little more than a consolation prize, though it did allow Rijekans to control the river trade and create a buffer zone for Rijekograd itself.\n\nNow the question is if we want to accept the offer. While the amount of wealth we will receive is substantial, it might still not be worth it, for Coltstream is an important city strategically and economically. Not to mention that simply abandoning our claims to the area will hurt our prestige. However, if we refuse, it is likely Wittenland will be willing to break any treaties of peace between our nations.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] must now decide how to respond."

Our garrison must vacate the territory immediately, or otherwise Wittenland will secede from the River Coalition and consider using military force to reclaim the area.\n\nThis is certainly a shocking demand from a nation that we once considered our close ally. Even if we accept their brutish threat, how can we trust them afterwards?

Silence. The few ponies who were there remained still. Wulfric was there, but like last year he remained at the back of the hall. However, this time White Star saw a smirk on his lips.

A new generation of unicorns stand with me!"\n\nWhite Star paused briefly, and then motioned her Excubitors to continue. By dismissing the importance of the very classes she fought for, she embarrassed her cause, but such was politics.\n\nAnd yet again, the Excubitors stopped, risking White Star's wrath.

Smiling confidently, he spoke: "I will support Honoria's claim to the throne."\n\nShocked gasps rippled through the crowd quickly followed by awe at his cleverness.\n\nShould Honoria ascend the throne, any capable mage-noble would quickly challenge and depose her in turn, and with the scandal of Queen White Star defeated by her own freed serf, her cause would collapse.

This merchant mare could beat any mage-noble if she wanted.\n\nHonoria and White Star began conserving energy, firing energy bolts back and fourth, shielding and ducking. A foolhardy unshielded member of the audience was struck down and rushed to medical attention.\n\nHonoria decided to take a risk, casting a short range, energy-intensive teleportation spell to attempt to flank White Star."

But this time, there was not enough magic to sustain the exhausted pair for long. Both of them had been pushed to their limits, forced to use every trick they had learned, casting every cantrip and spell, pouring all their knowledge and energy into this fateful duel. They were both spent, unable to overcome one another, refusing to surrender. So now they were back at the beginning, using basic spells even foals knew how to cast. Yet it was these basic spells that would decide the fate of the two unicorns, and the fate Wittenland itself."

White Star loomed over her prone body, her horn shining ominously, engulfed by magical flames.\n\nHonoria closed her eyes, accepting her death. Queen White Star had proven the strongest and fittest to lead. The nation would be in fine hooves.\n\nWhite Star paused, regarding Honoria's composed resignation, and White Star began to reconsider once again. Wheels spun, gears clicked in her mind as possibilities played out, and the face of rage vanished as her usual unreadable smile snapped into place. She pulled Honoria to her hooves.\n\n"Ponies of the court. Today, we have seen something astounding. A mere serf, freed from her shackles, overthrew Wulfric's trade monopoly, mustered sufficient support to block the Queen's rejection, and almost succeeded in winning a duel for the throne. Wulfric has had decades in order to achieve the same, and yet he has failed."\n\n"Why? Because he cannot understand that greatness is found in every pony, and grows best in those who must seek it, not have it handed to them. I, like Wulfric, feared that truth deep down, and thus I rejected Honoria's challenge. I am shamed, for in showing such skill despite her upbringing, she has proven her worth.""

She could feel White Star's body still radiating heat from fire magic.\n\nWhite Star frowned with annoyance and hissed in her ear, "If you wish to leave this room alive, refuse the throne!"\n\nHonoria shook herself, clearing her head. Yes... right, that made sense.\n\n"My...My Queen, I must refuse. You have proven your strength, and this offer proves the sincerity of your commitment." She kneeled. "I swear my fealty to you and your cause."\n\nHonoria rose and turned to the audience. She saw Wulfric, and how he glared at her in anger and disappointment. Perhaps he had been plotting something, but now it did not matter. The throne now belonged to the mare who deserved it. She smiled, and exclaimed loudly and clearly:"

Soon her coat was burning too, and she was consumed by her own flames of anger. Honoria and nobles alike gasped, appalled at the sight. Panicking, White Star started galloping around the room and soon crashed headlong into a window. Her bright burning body fell down into the rocky ground below.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "The Witenagemot recognises Honoria as the new Queen of Wittenland." Honoria was panting, utterly exhausted from the duel, but smiled. She had done it. A former serf had beaten a noble Queen in a duel and deposed her.\n\nWulfric grinned. "With the support of the Witenagemot, I hereby challenge you to a duel for the throne, your majesty."\n\nFor a moment, Honoria stopped breathing. Had she understood Wulfric's words right? He was challenging her immediately after the duel, while she was still tired from it? "Excuse me? But I just won a duel!"\n\n"Indeed. However, nothing says the winner of a duel cannot immediately be challenged by another. Such is tradition. For example, poor King Alpferd III was deposed soon after he had earned his title. If you were a mage-noble, you would be aware of this ancient custom."\n\nHonoria was outraged by this betrayal. She knew Wulfric had sought to benefit from her, which is why he had agreed to support her in the first place. But she had thought deposing White Star and making a trade agreement would've been enough! Maybe she shouldn't have openly spoken against him before the duel...\n\nWhatever the case, she would not refuse. She had spent so much time, money and effort to defeat White Star, and now her former master wanted to take it all away from her? He would have to pry her title from her cold dead hooves!"

"Foolish serf," Wulfric said, contempt seeping from his voice. "What made you think you're fit to be Queen?"\n\nWith shaking legs, Honoria struggled to push herself up. She felt too weak to even cast a simple shielding spell. The only thing driving her onwards was her hatred of Wulfric, the cruel scoundrel who had oppressed her for so long. "At least I am more fit for it than you, senile wolf."\n\nWulfric's nostrils flared and his horn glowed again, ready to strike the final blow at Honoria. But the mare did something no one expected; she levitated a weapon from her pocket. Wulfric realized he was looking down the barrel of a gun. "What is this? A weapon? The rules of the duel strictly forbid them!" Wulfric shouted. "What legitimacy do you hope to gain from this?"\n\nHonoria grinned. "This is no regular weapon. It's a magical pistol I bought with my own hard-earned money."\n\nShe pulled the trigger, and it was as if a bolt of lightning struck Wulfric's forehead. The audience was in shock as Wulfric's lifeless and limp body collapsed on the floor. When the nobles realized what had happened, many of them began to protest loudly. Honoria calmly blew the smoking barrel of the pistol and put it back in her pocket. White Star's mareservant Dayne was already browsing through an old bulky rulebook. "I... I can't find anything about magical firearms. But the rules do forbid the usage of magical artifacts such as staffs-"\n\nShe squealed as Honoria took the book from her hooves and threw it out of the window which White Star had broken. "Those don't matter. Wittenland does not need to cling on to ancient rules and traditions! As your new Queen, I intend to make new and better rules." She turned to the furious mage-nobles. "If any of you dispute my right to rule, go ahead and challenge me. I may still be tired, but I'm wiling to shoot all of you one by one if I need to."\n\nThe nobles stood silent for a while.

Soon she was running around and screaming as she burned alive. She ran headlong through a window and fell down into the rocky ground far below.\n\nThe crowd stared in horror. A death in a duel was rare enough, but two? This was a disaster. Honoria's retinue backed away and fled, and the Excubitors stood in confusion, unsure what to do.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "This barbaric display is White Star's doing. She pretended civility, but beneath it lay brute rage. And now she lies dead, killed by one of her own freed serfs."\n\nHe swept his gaze across the crowd. "Her reforms were mad, and this is the proof - self-immolation in the palace? A jumped-up merchant thinking they can run a nation? Our ancient traditions stained with blood and barbarism?"\n\n"All here know that without White Star I now have the Witenagemot's support. Therefore, I have no choice but to take her mantle. Are there any challenges?"

But Voliare realized what had happened. Honoria was dead too. She had thrown her life away and doomed Wittenland. Yet somehow, he was the one who felt guilty. He felt like he should've been there, supporting Honoria, cheering for her. Maybe then she would've won the duel, or lost it without dying in the process. But alas, he had abandoned her.\n\nA spark set his heart aflame. He had to redeem himself, and oppose Honoria's former master. It's the least he could do to honour the memory of his best friend. He ran into the central square of Wittenburgh, grabbed an empty crate, stood on it and began to speak to the crowd. He spoke boldly of what Wulfric would do, and that they needed to form a united front to oppose him before it was too late. At first, only a few listened to him. Then, more and more ponies gathered around him. When the sun set in the horizon, he had gathered an audience of thousands. Merchants, workers, unicorns, pegasi, earth ponies and even a couple of griffons listened to him speak of the importance of resisting the mage-nobles, of the flaws of the succession system and the monarchy itself, of the need for democracy and equality. He only stopped speaking when a group of Excubitors warned him and threatened to arrest him if he continued. He fled, but the crowd had heard enough.

Some ponies had travelled here by hoof all the way from Hoofcester to grieve her unfortunate passing. Much of the mage-nobility was also there, except for the most hardcore conservatives and supporters of Wulfric. And of course, her majesty herself, Queen Honoria, who had organized the event. While she had paid her debt to White Star, she still felt regretful that the duel had ended in her untimely demise. She had hoped it would not have been a duel to the death, but that White Star could give her advice as a member of the Witenagemot after she had lost the duel. But alas, the mountain spirits had had different plans for her.\n\nThe vast funeral procession left the citadel of High Mane, following a group of monks who carried White Star's black casket. The sun had set, for it was custom to bury the dead during the night, so ten thousand torches carried by ponies illuminated the escort. Honoria walked beside the coffin, struggling to hold back tears. All of a sudden she felt like she had killed White Star herself, even if that was not the case. In the end, it was her fault that White Star had died.\n\nThe procession travelled through the town and beyond, reaching a series of funeral mounds of the Star dynasty. One freshly prepared mound was open, waiting for its occupant to arrive, laden with burial goods. Ponies had brought countless valuable treasures to White Star's tomb to accompany her in the afterlife. As the casket was carried inside the barrow, monks chanted mournfully and thousands of commoners wept, as did Honoria.

He felt like he should've been there, supporting Honoria and cheering her on. Maybe then she would've won. Initially he thought that her victory would've meant doom for Wittenland, but now he just imagined how happy Honoria would've been if she had defeated White Star and proven to Wulfric that even a former serf could become Queen. In the end, he realized he cared more about Honoria's happiness and dreams than of Wittenland and its ponies.\n\nHe downed another tankard.\n"Starting to get drunk yet, Voliare?" a familiar voice asked. Voliare almost choked on his ale in surprise and coughed loudly. "Honoria?"\n"That's my name, yes," she said and sat down opposite him. "Bring me as many tankards as you brought him!" she shouted to the waiter.\n"So... why are you back here again?" Voliare asked.

Now, anyone could challenge the ruling monarch without having support from the Witenagemot, the winner of the duel could no longer be challenged immediately by someone else and lastly, the use of magical weapons was forbidden, as it was meant to be a test of skill and power. Of course, these new rules made her own victory against Wulfric invalid, but they also invalidated Wulfric's challenge, so in the end only her victory over White Star mattered. Thus her own legitimacy was secured.\n\nThe royal mareservant Dayne once again spoke to assembled unicorns, calling for any challengers to step forth. Honoria sat on her throne, eagerly waiting to see what ambitious and talented individual would wish to claim her throne for themselves. After a moment of silence, a pale red-bearded unicorn emerged from the audience and issued a challenge.\n\nIt was Voliare.\n\nHonoria's eyes widened and she almost leaped from the throne. "Voliare? What on earth are you doing?"\n"I am challenging you to a duel, your majesty."\n"But you have no magical skills or talent to speak of! You have no chance of winning!"\n"I do have a chance. I intend to save Wittenland from your rule, and I want to see if you truly still are my friend. Do you accept the challenge or not?"\nThe audience turned to look at her.

I will stand here till I am dead, or you have lost. You will continue your reign of tyranny only when you have proven that our friendship is truly gone for good."\n\nHonoria's confusion slowly turned into anger. First Voliare abandons her when she needs him, and now this? She was no tyrant and was certainly a better ruler than White Star had been, bringing true justice to Wittenland and purging the ranks of the Witenagemot. Yet here Voliare stood, defying her rule, demanding her to kill him if she wanted to remain Queen. How dared he abuse their friendship?\n\nHonoria clenched her teeth and cast another spell. Voliare winced in pain, his body ailing from the blast of magic, but continued to stand. This defiance only angered Honoria more, and she cast stronger spells, yet each time Voliare stood back up, and continued to stare into her eyes.\n\n"Voliare, I beg you, surrender!" Honoria said, her voice suddenly breaking. She didn't feel like hurting his former best friend any more. "I don't want to do this!"\n"And I don't want you to oppress ponies like me, who have no special skill or talent. Ponies who you have doomed to lives of poverty and misery."\n\nHonoria remained silent. There was truth in Voliare's words. She began to feel regretful, even shameful for everything she had done, ever since the fateful day when they had parted ways. "Voliare... please..." she said quietly, almost whimpering.

You moron."\nShe angrily slapped his hoof away, stood up and galloped past him, holding back tears of both anger and sorrow. Voliare did not go after her and helplessly watched as his former best friend ran away. Perhaps they would never see each other again.\n\nAfter rightfully winning the duel, Voliare was recognized as new King of Wittenland, and a coronation ceremony was prepared for him. However, he ordered it to be cancelled, and even more shockingly, announced that he would immediately dismantle the ancient monarchy of Wittenland. As both White Star and Honoria had completely defanged the Witenagemot, there was no one to oppose him in this act. He would form an interim government, inviting many influential individuals to participate in reshaping Wittenland into a republic.

Coltstream also has symbolic significance as being the place where the Treaty of Coltstream was signed. For Wittenlanders, this was an insult for the Treaty was signed long before Wittenland itself joined the Coalition, when they considered it a threat.

Ponies of Wild-Vodina can already travel relatively freely to Wittenland and live in freedom and prosperity. In fact, the inhabitants are largely bilingual and the region is a shining example of a peaceful cultural melting pot. After 200 years, it is doubtful if anypony even wants to rejoin Wittenland.\n\nIt is a convincing argument, but [Root.GetLeader] is doubtful of the final claim.

Our mages would then get to work, undoing the damage and draining dark magic from the land. This would of course take decades, but would allow us to utilize local industry and govern the local populace. The other option is to simply evacuate the entire region, and moving all the magical machines to Wittenland proper. This would be a huge effort, but nopony should endure life in the devastated land of Barrad.

I cannot believe my own flesh and blood is responsible for such abhorrent acts. Don't you realize that by trying to escape from death, you have ran headlong into it?

She had invited representatives from all member states to attend and listen to her speech, and many foreign reporters had come as well.\n\nIn her speech, she spoke of the importance of Riverlander unity in these uncertain times, and of the value of cooperation in all facets of society to ensure mutual prosperity and security between members of the Coalition. This, she said, was especially important as western griffon states have begun to rapidly consolidate after the collapse of the Empire and possibly have ambitions in the east.\n\nShe acknowledged that the nations of the Riverlands are very diverse, having various races, cultures and forms of government, yet said that diversity was the strength of the River Coalition. Exchange of different ideas allows for new ones to be born, and each nation can focus on their speciality and share their advancements with one another. As an example, she spoke of Wittenland focusing on mastering magic and training unicorn soldiers, while Nimbusia has its elite pegasus units.\n\nHowever, she also said that in the end the foundation of the Coalition should be democracy: Even those nations with more authoritarian societal systems should have elected representatives in the Coalition itself, so that the alliance never becomes dominated by the leader of one member state. She warned that any cooperation will break apart if any member seeks to grow stronger than its allies, so a balance of power would need to be maintained as well.\n\nShe ended the speech by saying that any old grudges and rivalries between the Coalition members should be forgotten and buried, because it was simply more beneficial to have friendly relations one another. "United we stand, divided we fall" were her last words. The gathered audience cheered and stomped the ground with their hooves in approval. The representatives from other Coalition states did not necessarily share their enthusiasm, but all of them found at least something in her speech that they agreed on."

But then the local Baroness, Emeralda, announced she would be a candidate and proceeded to do anything she could to cling on to the power she had once held in the village. She had sent hired thugs to intimidate voters, bribed poor ponies to vote for her and blackmailed other candidates. Many wanted to report her electoral fraud but were too afraid to do so. White Star had ended her domineering rule on the village, but now she threatened to return with force.\n\nThat is when Rolling Pin had decided to take matters into his own hooves. Now he openly spoke of Emeralda's crimes, even as thugs eyed him in behind the corner. The crowd was furious and knew his words to be true. Rolling Pin himself had been threatened already, but he had immediately reported this to the County's officials who had sent Excubitors to guard his home at night. Now he fearlessly condemned Emeralda and said the ponies of the village should vote for him instead. He promised to be a good leader for the village, keeping the taxes low and starting public works to clear new farmland and renovate the old bridge across the river. Ponies cheered, and Emeralda's thugs retreated into the shadows.\n\nOn the next day, the elections were held, with Rolling Pin and Emeralda being the only candidates. County officials finished counting the votes within an hour, and announced that Rolling Pin had won a landslide victory. As jubilant ponies lifted Rolling into the air, chanting his name, the Baroness herself was nowhere to be seen. Everyone assumed she was brooding in her manor, but in truth she had already been arrested for electoral fraud and brought before the Royal Judiciary."

It'd remain an event where the reigning monarch can change, but the flashy and dangerous duels of old are to be gone forever.\n\nFrom now on, the Queening will be a public vote of confidence, if the monarch is alive. As long as it is passed, the Queen or King will remain on their throne, otherwise they still stand down and resign. What follows is a democratic vote for a new ruler, which is also held if the ruler passed away or resigned earlier. This means that Wittenland will now only be ruled by elected monarchs who remain in power only as long as their subjects allow them to.\n\nThis radical change, broadcast on the radio, was met with enthusiasm by the commonfolk. Now, truly, anypony could become the ruler of Wittenland, regardless of their magical talent. Only the most conservative individuals protested, while ponies like Honoria had mixed feelings about it.\n\n"What do you think?" Voliare asked as the broadcast ended, and turned off the radio.

Hopefully next year, or the year after that, the magical duels would be a thing of the past. All she had to do was make it through at least one more Queening.\n\nShe felt relieved when the throne room seemed fairly empty this time; after her duel against Honoria, many had lost interest in issuing challenges. In fact, most ponies seemed to think no one would challenge her at all and hadn't even bothered to attend in the event. White Star sighed, wishing it would be over soon.\n\n"The Queen issues a call," her mareservant Dayne announced like every year. "Let any who have the backing of the Witenagemot and the magical skill to claim the throne step forward." White Star looked at the potential challengers, and saw Wulfric among them. But that old stallion's hopes of opposing her and her reforms had been crushed. Surely he wouldn't-\n\nWulfric stepped forth. "I challenge her majesty," he proclaimed with his creaky voice. The small audience in the room gasped and White Star lifted an eyebrow. "If no one else can dare to oppose her and her dismemberment of our traditions, then I shall do so myself!" His eyes burned with youthful fury, which almost made him appear younger than he seemed. The members of the Witenagemot present expressed their support, most of them being Wulfric's allies. It seemed like none of the more liberal mage-nobles had bothered to turn up, having wrongly assumed that White Star did not need them.\n\n"So be it," White Star replied, recovering from her surprise, and boldly stood up from her throne.

But I am filled with determination that gives me the strength of a feisty young colt! I may still not win, but I refuse to simply fade away into irrelevancy. Let this be the last, desperate blow of old and glorious Wittenland which you have disemboweled!"\n\nWith that, his horn shone as bright as the sun, its light bathing the entire room. White Star winced and cast a protective aura around her, withstanding his mighty magic. Wulfric's spell soon faded, and he already panted heavily. Now it was White Star's turn. She channeled the energy of her shields into a spearhead of flaming magic and struck at Wulfric, who barely reacted to the attack in time and managed to block it at the last moment. The elderly stallion was slow, and before he could even consider a counter-strike, White Star pressed on, whipping him with a searing lash of magical flames.\n\nWulfric roared even as his clothes caught fire, and mustered all the strength left in his decrepit old body into a single strike. There was blinding light, focused into a ray of death. White Star, almost blinded, closed her eyes, then quickly and desperately cast a mirroring spell. Wulfric's magic was reflected and turned against its user, who was helpless to resist his own fury.\n\nThe stallion, or what remained of him, crumbled onto the floor. White Star slowly opened her eyes to see what had happened. The former supporters of Wulfric kneeled in deep respect and vowed to never again oppose her. This was a moment of triumph, the end of her age-old nemesis, but she suddenly felt hollow. She had robbed an old stallion of retirement and peaceful, respectful death. Yet in the end, it was either this, or allowing Wulfric to become King and undo everything she had done. She felt more disgusted than ever about the concept of magic duels, and was now even more determined to abolish the entire stupid tradition."

wittenland.76.t:0 "Queen Honoria's Speech"
wittenland.76.d:0 "Today Her Majesty, Queen Honoria of Wittenland, held a public speech in Wittenburgh about the River Coalition, Wittenland's role in it and its future. She had invited representatives from all member states to attend and listen to her speech, and many foreign reporters had come as well.\n\nShe began her speech by speaking of the inherent talents and specialities of all nations in the Riverlands, such as the martial abilities of Lakeish and Nimbusian ponies, the democratic traditions of River Republic and Bakara, the industriousness of the Diamond Dogs and the craftsponyship of the Pònaidh tribes. She seemed to forget mentioning Deponya, but continued: "So every country in the Riverlands has its strengths, and the potential to fully use them, but we are unable to do so. Why? Because of the River Coalition. Why would any of our nations bother? If we encounter problems or troubles, we can just run to our allies and ask them to solve everything for us, and in return promise to do the same for them. Thus each nation's unique advantages are wasted, and their traditions deteriorate. Just look what happened to Wittenland and its famed meritocracy! Even with White Star's reforms, their full potential was left unused.\n\n"Now you might say, the River Coalition is needed for mutual defence and cooperation. But that is related to what I said earlier. Instead of learning to defend against raiders better, we rely on others. Instead of actively aiming to create competitive economies, we make agreements to kill competition completely. All this creates complacency and weakness, and deteriorates the sovereignty of every member state.\n\n"You may disagree with what I have said, but it matters not. I will stand by what I said, and as Queen it is my responsibility to do what is best for my country. Therefore, I have no choice but to announce that Wittenland will formally secede from the River Coalition. All agreements previously signed will become null and void. This does not mean trade and peace between us will end, but it is time for Wittenland to learn how to walk with its own legs."\n\nThe room erupted into protests and questions, which Honoria ignored as she stepped down from the podium and decisively walked outside."

Not only does she want us to recognize them as their overlords, she says we must share all our magical discoveries so that "more competent and sane ponies can utilize them".\n\nShe has given us a limited amount of time to respond to this ultimatum.

Not only has Barrad been reclaimed, but we now have a powerful ally. If they get any ideas about breaking free again, Queen Honoria will make sure they'll regret it."

wittenland.83.t:0 "How The Tables Have Turned"
wittenland.83.d:0 "Not long ago, Rolling Pin was but a humble baker, living in the sleepy rural village of Hwicna east of Buckthorn. He and the other commoners lived under the rule of Baroness Emeralda who owned most of the land and workshops, charging them high rent for everything. Back then, Rolling Pin was an ardent supporter of White Star, hoping she would improve the lives of the villagers. All his hopes were dashed when she perished in a duel - but then, his hopes were rekindled.\n\nHonoria's reforms swiftly stripped Emeralda of her powers and titles due to her incompetence. Rolling Pin was content with this, but then something even better happened: In the national examinations he achieved high scores and was made the leader of the entire village. Now he lived a life of luxury and prosperity, living in Emeralda's former manor and managing the village's administration.\n\nOne day he was walking down the road to visit a meeting in the village when he saw Emeralda toiling in the fields. He motioned his entourage of servants to stop and approached the former Baroness. Chuckling, he said "It seems the tables have truly turned, have they not?"\nEmeralda turned to glare at him, continuing to till the soil with her hoe. "Yes. What of it? Do you want to rub salt to my wounds by laughing at me?"\n"No. I just found it amusing how much things have changed. Before you were so wealthy, and now you are but a poor farmer."\n"And now you're an oppressive tax collector, demanding ever higher prices. You're no better than I was." Emeralda spat on the ground and kept working.\n\nRolling Pin's smug smile faded. He looked down at his clothes, made of fine Pònaidh textiles, and at his sparkling jewellery. She was right. Now he was the Baron, even if he didn't have the title. Emeralda must've hated him as much as he had once hated her.\n"Sir? Is everything alright?" one of his servants, dressed in rags, asked.\nHe shook his head and took out a golden coin from his pocket. "Yes. Yes it is," he said and threw the coin to Emeralda. "Here! So you can pay your rents for the next year."\nAs Rolling Pin and his followers continued their journey, Emeralda took the coin, her mouth open in astonishment. Perhaps Rolling Pin wasn't as bad as she had been."

wittenland.84.t:0 "Honoria Denounces Democracy"
wittenland.84.d:0 "A large audience gathered to hear Queen Honoria's speech, held in the central square of Wittenburgh. By this point, she had grown accustomed to public appearances, and even enjoyed basking in the admiration of the crowd. Of course, her speeches were always controversial, and not everypony cheered, but in the end she was confident that her own views were the right ones. If her speech managed to make those opposed to her at least briefly reconsider their values, she'd consider it a success.\n\n"My loyal subjects! Today, I wish to speak on the matter of democracy, as more and more ponies talk of it. Wittenland, of course, is not a democracy and never has been, but some individuals think we should follow the example of other countries and adopt it. I feel like it is my responsibility to address this foolish notion.\n\n"Democracy, at its core, is about empowering the masses. This is why it is sometimes known as the 'tyranny of the majority' or 'mob rule'. It gives power to everyone, regardless if they are actually qualified to have any power, and allows them to influence decision-making. When the unfit are allowed to choose their leaders, they often make poor choices, and are easily fooled by those more shrewd than them. So many times in democracies, the leader becomes that who makes the biggest promises and spends the most money on campaigning, instead of that who would actually be the most capable leader.\n\n"This is the fundamental flaw in democracies, and why so many republican movements have failed. Their leadership is composed of the popular instead of the competent. This is why so many republics around us are led by weak-minded fools with no business sense, no determination and no talent. I do not recognize their rule as legitimate! I've always believed that power should only be bestowed upon those who can use it wisely.\n\n"This is why we must do everything we can to stop the spread of democratic values! It leads to degradation of nations, to rule by the weak and the unfit, and if allowed to grow too strong, the republicanist movement will engulf us too. We must act now and begin to actively fight against democracies! Victory is assured, for we are led by the competent, unlike them."\n\nThe crowd began to cheer and stomp the ground with their hooves. Some ponies, of course, did not do so, but Honoria did not care for them. They would realize their folly eventually."

wittenland.85.t:0 "A Heart Of Stone"
wittenland.85.d:0 "Honoria sat in her royal chambers, lost in thought. In her hooves she held a framed picture of her and Voliare. It was over a decade old by this point, and the only image she had of him. It had been taken to commemorate their first successful business venture. As she looked at Voliare's smiling face, she felt her eyes becoming increasingly moist.\n\n"Your majesty?" Mareservant Dayne's voice gently asked.\n\nHonoria snapped out of her thoughts and turned to glare at her. "What is it?! You're supposed to knock before you enter."\n"I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's an urgent matter. Members of the Witenagemot want to discuss about your plans for dealing with increasing inequality and unrest."\nHonoria frowned and turned to look at the picture again. She had genuinely cared for Voliare, despite his lack of talent and ambition, and his dull mind. And in the end, Voliare had used it against her. Now she felt like the lower classes were trying to do the same. But she wouldn't allow herself to be manipulated. Voliare perished because of his arrogance and foolishness. Why should the rabble's fate be any better?\n\nShe stood up and threw the framed picture through the window, shattering the glass and making Dayne scream in shock. Then, she marched out of the room with determined steps.\n"Y-your majesty?" Dayne asked, concerned.\n"I am fine. I will tell the Witenagemot what we will do about this "inequality". We will intensify the competition and make sure those who can't keep up will die off. I've ran out of sympathy for them, and they're dragging down the rest of us."\n\nDayne stood in silence, and questioned her servitude to such a monarch. At the very least, Honoria recognized her competence, so she'd allow her to resign and find a better employer. Preferably one whose heart hadn't turned to stone."

wittenland.86.t:0 "The Annual Queening"
wittenland.86.d:0 "Since the tragedy of the last Queening, Honoria had implemented even more changes to the event. Now there were once more restrictions on who could issue a challenge to the reigning monarch, but this time it would be a series of examinations, each harder than the last. The tests were meant to measure the actual rulership skills and talents of potential challengers, allowing only one pony with the highest score to fight the Queen in a magical duel, which would function as a final trial.\n\nThis year, a pegasus stallion called Brisk Breeze managed to pass every test, gaining high scores in charisma, intelligence, magical talent and other metrics. Honoria was very pleased to see some previously unnoticed commoner perform so well and formally invited him to the Royal Palace in Wittenburgh. She looked forward to putting his skills to the test in person. However, when Brisk finally arrived, he seemed hesitant about the whole affair.\n\n"Your majesty," he asked and bowed before her in the throne room, "I wish to inquire you, why is this magic duel necessary? The examinations already prove I am more than fit to be the ruler, and would likely perform better than even you."\n"It's not enough," Honoria said bluntly. "The magic duel is an important trial by fire. If you're not able to use your magic to defend yourself and defeat an opponent, and if you cannot fully use your skills under pressure, then how do you expect to survive as a ruler?"\n"I am a firm believer in pacifism. Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, in my opinion."\n"It's not just about violence. You need to show to all that you are willing to fight for your throne, to the death if need be. Then no one will dare to question your legitimacy."\n\nBrisk Breeze shook his head. "I fundamentally disagree with this being part of the tests."\n"Too bad. I made the tests. If you want to depose me, you'll have to play by my rules."\n"And if I don't want to play by your rules, then I suppose I no longer want to depose you. Remember, your majesty, that if you alone dictate the definition of merit, then this is not a meritocracy, but a tyranny."\nWith that, he turned around and walked out of the room. Honoria rolled her eyes. "Oh well. Maybe next year there won't be a coward who makes excuses...""

wittenland.87.t:0 "Whispers In The Shadows"
wittenland.87.d:0 "The news of Wulfric's latest reforms spread like wildfire amongst Wittenland's ever growing mercantile class, raising alarm and concern. All the limitations on commerce that White Star had lifted were going to be re-imposed on everypony who was not part of the mage-nobility. Expensive licences for trade and business ownership now needed to be bought and restrictions were placed on those who did not do so. Any large-scale or long-distance trade now had to go through the nobility or the state. Banking was now entirely in the hooves of the nobles. The list went on.\n\nVoliare, a merchant himself, could sense the discontent and outrage brewing, and decided to take advantage of this. He contacted his and Honoria's old trade partners in the country, saying that something had to be done about Wulfric and his posse of greedy nobles. If they did not act, then eventually they'd be pushed into bankruptcy and forced to sell their businesses to the mage-nobility. He did not outright say what they needed to do but told them that they should keep in touch and begin organizing a resistance of some kind. He adviced them to secretly begin stockpiling weapons while they could. Soon enough, there would be a need for them.\n\nThere was one pony that he decided to meet in person, for he needed their help more than anypony else's. Eadberhta Featherwing, one of the few pegasi in Wittenlandic society who had managed to climb the social ladder, was the head of a delivery company that almost exclusively employed pegasi. They could easily fly across the mountains of Wittenland and so would be vital in Voliare's plans.\n\n"So, you want our help in your little resistance movement?" Eadberhta said to Voliare, who was sitting in their office, and grinned. "Well, that's going to cost you. But because I am sympathetic to your cause, I am willing to offer a hefty discount."\n"I sold all me and Honoria had. I can pay as much as you want."\n"Good. Still, this is a risky venture, and I'm not as willing to sacrifice everything as you are. If things start going down south, don't expect me to stick around. Other countries are much friendlier to us merchants."\n"I understand. We still need any help we can get. Thank you for your time, Eadberhta. Don't tell anypony I was here."\n"My lips are sealed, old friend.""

wittenland.88.t:0 "Keeping Promises"
wittenland.88.d:0 "For several years now, the pace of reforms that had once been so quick had slowed down greatly. The main cause for this was increased opposition from Wulfric and his supporters, forcing White Star to spend an increasing amount of time and money bargaining with them. But now at last, the tide had turned in her favour and a majority of the Witenagemot now supported further reforms. White Star could finally fulfill all those promises she made years ago. She decided to happily announce this news in a public speech, and for the first time in Wittenlandic history it would be broadcast on radio. Most peasants, of course, did not own one yet, so many of them flocked to Wittenburgh to listen to it in person.\n\nAs White Star appeared on the balcony of the Royal Palace, the crowd below erupted into joyous cheers. The Queen smiled and waved to them, which made them even more excited. Once the enthusiasm had died down a little, White Star cleared her throat and began to speak to a microphone, recently imported from the River Republic.\n\n"My dear friends and subjects! I bring good news to you all on this beautiful day. After years of deadlock, I have finally rallied enough support in the Witenagemot to pass more reforms, which I once promised to do. In the coming moons and years, great change will begin to take place as the last shackles keeping us stuck in the past are broken, once and for all. I will do my best to improve the welfare of you, the common ponies, and safeguard your golden liberties. I will stay true to my word and bring prosperity to all who are in need. Land shall be given to the landless and bread to the breadless!"\n\nA roaring cheer rang out, echoing in the entire city, and ponies stomped the ground in glee. Thousands began to chant her name and shout "Long live the Queen!". White Star sighed happily, confident that Wittenland's future was bright."

wittenland.89.t:0 "A True Meritocracy"
wittenland.89.d:0 "Honoria took a deep breath. Then, she took another. She hated to admit it, but holding a public speech was much more stressful than she had expected. "Your majesty, what is wrong?" the royal mareservant Dayne asked. "Your speech is supposed to begin in a minute."\n"Nothing's wrong!" Honoria exclaimed. "Why would it be? I am a strong and confident self-made mare, risen from serfdom to queendom. Why would anything be wrong?!"\nDayne frowned. "Nevermind me asking. Anyways, you must go. The crowd awaits you."\n\nHonoria went out to the balcony of the Royal Palace with confident steps, her head held high, and looked down at the ponies below. It was mostly rabble, and they made no sound as she appeared. They did not know anything about her, and had probably come here so they'd find out who she was. Honoria had to make a good first impression. She opened her mouth, and nothing came out.\n\nSomehow, the words she had in mind were gone and she could not find them. Thousands of eyes were staring at her. Suddenly, she felt angry at herself for not living up to her own high standards. If she could not speak to her subjects, how could she rule them?\n\nShe had an idea and took control of the anger, channelling it into words, so she could at least say something. "Ponies of Wittenland! For too long have we been ruled by incompetent and foolish monarchs, who never deserved their titles. But it was not always like that. Long ago, before the decay of the meritocracy, Wittenland was ruled by true philosopher kings and queens, finest rulers one could hope for. I wish to bring back that long-forgotten golden era. No more will the corrupt, the unjust and the incapable have any power in our society! Wittenland's society will be greatly changed so everypony receives exactly what they deserve, no more or less. True justice will finally come to our nation!"\n\nThere was deafening silence, and Honoria's confidence wavered. But one by one the ponies in the crowd figured that they, of course, were the best, and would receive everything. The approving stomping of hooves began slowly and spread, until much of the audience was doing so. Honoria breathed a sigh of relief, and decided she would keep practicing until she became the best public speaker in Wittenland's history."

The door opened, and Wulfric's granddaughter came barging in, followed by her mother. Wulfric turned to her and laughed as the small filly jumped onto him and hugged him. "Hi, grandpa!" she said happily. Wulfric smiled and patted her head. "Hello there, young rascal. Did you come here to hear my speech?"\n"We did," her mother said dryly. "She wanted to."\n"Well, you came just in time. I am getting ready to go in a moment. Now please, don't mess up my mane, little one. Miss Dayne here was very careful about brushing it."\n\nWulfric stepped forth onto the balcony in the Royal Palace, a confident and regal expression on his face. Some ponies in the crowd below immediately began to boo at him, but went silent as he glared directly at them. "My subjects! I know that you are upset about White Star's unfortunate and untimely passing. But fear not! Wittenland is in safe hooves now. I intend to save our country from decadence and decay and prevent doom which was swiftly approaching us. The old order shall be restored and traditions reinstated. Above all, I wish to bring back the good old times of the past, when Wittenland was a mighty kingdom. The age of humiliation is finally over! Rejoice!"\n\nSome ponies in the crowd cheered, but most of them remained utterly silent. Wulfric felt offended and frowned. "The king has spoken," he muttered and turned around to leave. Someone from below threw a tomato which splattered on the back of his head as he entered inside. His daughter gasped, but the granddaughter giggled. Despite feeling furious, Wulfric smiled. "Heh, silly peasants, aren't they? Don't worry, child, I'll remind them who is the king.""

wittenland.91.t:0 "Peasant Protests"
wittenland.91.d:0 "Soon after the announcement that land which formerly belonged to the nobility and had been nationalized early in White Star's reign would be given back to the original owners, the peasants became furious. Not just those who would lose the lands they had gained less than a decade ago, but others as well who protested in support and were afraid this was only the beginning. Perhaps all land which had previously been owned by the mage-nobles would be eventually returned, regardless of the legality of the acquisition. The demonstrations became nation-wide, with a large column of angry farmers gathering to march in Wittenburgh.\n\nVoliare and his merchant allies immediately contacted the leading figures among the peasantry and arranged secret meetings. The peasants were not particularly fond of the traders, but distrusted the mage-nobles and the monarchy far more. Soon enough covert deals were struck, and the two groups agreed to cooperate in opposing King Wulfric and his government.\n\nAmong the fiercest leaders was Violet Plough, an earth pony mare who had once been a serf with a particularly cruel lord. Since gaining her freedom, she had learned to read and acquired the texts of Caramel Marks, which made her a fiery revolutionary. In her eyes, the peasants were not petty burghers but proletariat, and would form the backbone of an upcoming revolution. She had loudly condemned the appropriation of peasant land, holding speeches to ever larger audiences of disgruntled peasants and rallying them to her cause. Voliare saw the fire in her and met her in person.\n"We could use your skills at speaking," Voliare said to her. "We need all the public support we can get, to legitimize our movement."\n"And what is your movement about, exactly?" she asked. "After Wulfric has been dealt with, what will you do?"\n"That remains to be decided. But ideally, we bring an end to this tradition of dueling unicorn monarchs."\nViolet Plough nodded, slowly. "Well, an enemy of my enemy is my friend, as they say. And you're a former serf too, are you not? We must fight together to preserve our rights, or else we'll return to life in Tartarus." She grabbed Voliare's hoof and vigorously shook it. "It's a deal. Down with Wulfric!""
wittenland.91.a:0 "The resistance grows stronger."

wittenland.92.t:0 "Mutiny In The Ranks"
wittenland.92.d:0 "The expansion of the fyrds of the mage-nobility meant that the national army itself was downsized and its importance reduced. Many ponies who would've served in the army were transferred to regional fyrds and military funding was reduced. A number of soldiers and officers were disgruntled, albeit most of them did not dare to protest openly in fear of being accused of being traitors. However, a mutiny did break out in the garrison near Hoofcester, which was eventually put down by loyalist units.\n\nAfter the incident, Voliare and his movement continued to expand their influence, even if it was increasingly risky. Secret messages were sent to high-ranking officers who had not openly condemned the Hoofcester mutiny and several responses soon arrived. Everything went even better than expected when Sigeweard Spellshield himself answered the call to arms and was willing to side with the resistance when the time came. Other officers either did the same or promised to at least turn a blind eye to the rebels. However, the gamble had likely resulted in many army officers becoming aware of the resistance movement, and it was not known how many of them were loyal to King Wulfric. It would not be long before a crackdown would begin, so they needed to act fast.\n\nAn urgent meeting between Voliare and Sigeweard Spellshield was arranged. The marshal was widely respected among the officer ranks, so his support for the resistance would be vital. Plans had to be made before it was too late.\n"Mister Sigeweard, I am glad you could come," Voliare whispered. "We must prepare now or never."\nSigeward levitated a pipe, slowly lit it and smoked it. Only then did he speak. "Patience. Before we do so, I must warn you to not be too hasty."\n"What do you mean? If we do not act quickly, our movement will fail before it can even begin!"\n"Yes, but you must still act carefully and not rush into action before you are ready. You must not only avoid failure, but also keep the radicals in check. If you do not do so, they will act like blood-thirsty hounds when they are let loose. I will do all I can to give you time. Use it wisely. The fate of Wittenland rests in your hooves."\nVoliare nodded. "It is a heavy burden, but I am willing to bear it. Thank you, marshal.""

wittenland.93.t:0 "The Return Of Serfdom?"
wittenland.93.d:0 "When King Wulfric planned to restore serfdom in Wittenland again, the resistance saw this as the perfect time to strike. Many ponies were now openly hostile to Wulfric's government and were more willing to support them. This was the final straw for them. Clearly, Wulfric had gone too far and had to be stopped.\n\nHowever, King Wulfric was well aware of the discontent among the commoners. As little as he cared for them, he knew they were plotting something and had to be dealt with. The army and the fyrds of the nobility were mobilized in advance. Wulfric had long planned to crush the liberal resistance in a single blow once they began an uprising, for then his actions would be justified by law. In this, he was not only supported by the mage-nobles, but also by the clergy and the masses of landless poor, who were swayed by the King's generosity and the preaching of the monks. They had little sympathy for the land-owning peasants, the rich merchants and the rebellious soldiers, and would eagerly defend the rightful King of Wittenland.\n\nUnfortunately for Wulfric, the rebels were one step ahead. On the day when serfdom was to be reintroduced, the radio station in Calcrond was seized by armed rebels who began to broadcast a message on multiple frequencies. Wulfric and his allies listened closely.\n"Your majesty, we, ponies of the United Republican Front, regret to inform you that your family's bodyguards have betrayed you. We have taken your daughter and granddaughter hostage here in Calcrond. Isn't that right?"\n"You will not get away with this!" shouted a mare in the background. A filly could be heard crying, too. Wulfric's eyes widened in shock.\n"But there is no reason to worry, your highness. We simply ask you to revert your decision to bring back serfdom, disband the Witenagemot, step down as King and recognize our own provisional government as the legitimate one. If you accept, your darlings won't be harmed. Please, work with us so we avoid unnecessary bloodshed, for the greater good of Wittenland and its oppressed ponies."\nWulfric's horror was quickly replaced with seething anger. His nostrils flared and he muttered a curse.\n"M'lord, how shall we respond?" his mareservant Dayne asked."

"Welp, I guess that's a no," Violet Plough said and pullet out a pistol. "Let's shoot the mother first, as a warning. Maybe then he will take us seriously."\n"No!" Voliare shouted angrily. "I may be willing to sacrifice my own life for the cause, but not the life of innocents. We proceed with our back-up plan.

"The loyal units await your command to seize control of towns and vital strategic locations," the marshal told, while the merchant said "My pegasi will keep an eye on the royalist units and move swiftly to relay messages. We will know their every move."\n"Good," Voliare said, and took a deep breath. "Let the battle for Wittenland begin, then. Violet, broadcast the message."\nShe adjusted the radio's frequency to the channel of the resistance movement and simply said: "Break the throne.""

wittenland.95.t:0 "The Northern Expedition"
wittenland.95.d:0 "Ever since White Star's death, the ponies of High Mane have opposed King Wulfric more than citizens of other regions. It was no surprise then that they extensively supported the resistance, allowing them to swiftly seize control of Calcrond and the rest of Cemricia when the insurgency began. They have thus isolated the entire region of Hengestdelu from the capital, leaving its Barons stranded. For now, they are holding off the rebels with their fyrds, but if the encirclement is not broken they will soon be overwhelmed by the rebels who were far better prepared for conflict.\n\nThe King has ordered the royal army to secure Calcrond, his home town, first. Regaining it is vital because of its symbolic significance to Wulfric's rule. His daughter and granddaughter are still held hostage there, however, so the attackers must exercise caution. Gilded Gale, the leading officer in the attack, plans to secure the countryside first and surround the town, then force the rebels to surrender and thus give up the hostages safely. This plan is not without risk. Not only can the initial attack fail, but the rebels have many pegasi on their side who can simply fly above the encirclement at night, supplying the town and allowing it to hold out before a counter-attack from the Darnish Highlands can be launched. If Gilded Gale wishes to succeed, she must find a way to effectively blockade the town and force its surrender as soon as possible."

wittenland.96.d:0 "With Cemricia and Hengestdelu secured, the royalist forces could now move on to the Darnish Highlands and pacify the territory. Gilded Gale's forces moved from village to village and town to town, capturing dissidents and retaking government buildings. The rebels used hit-and-run tactics to harass them as they went and pulled back before any effective counter-attacks could be made. But at best, they could hope to only slow down the advance of the loyalists.\n\nFinally, the forces approached High Mane, the capital of the region. Its garrison would not give up as easily as in Calcrond, as High Mane was protected by a famous citadel which had repelled Rijekan invaders almost two centuries ago. Taking it would not be easy, but first they had to secure the surrounding city.\n\nGilded Gale decided that a prolonged siege would be a waste of time and lives. They had to strike swiftly and decisively before the rebels could properly entrench. She gave civilians in the town 12 hours to leave before starting a preliminary artillery barrage followed by a full-scale assault of the town. After the defences had been weakened by a roaring cascade of explosions, elite groups of Excubitors charged into the breach, using spells to shield themselves from incoming fire. Other troops soon followed and poured into gaps in the enemy lines, forcing them to abandon the settlement and retreat into the fortress proper.\n\nBut they were not quick enough. Some of Gilded's soldiers teleported ahead the retreating rebels and reached the gates before them. Rather than leave their comrades stranded outside, the enemy refused to close the gates and attacked the teleporters from two sides. Their sacrifice allowed the rest of the royalists to catch up and enter the citadel from the front gate. In the end, the entire fortress was cleared out within several days. Hundreds of prisoners had been taken and many more killed or wounded. High Mane had fallen."

wittenland.97.t:0 "The Second Expedition"
wittenland.97.d:0 "Gilded Gale's initial excursion into northern rebel territory had been a failure. This only made her more determined to succeed. She gathered more ponies and more weaponry. This time the expedition would not be a simple pacification mission, but a full-scale military campaign. The north had to be liberated from the hooves of the rebels before they could grow too strong. As soon as her forces were ready, she ordered a rapid march north into the Darnish Highlands and Cemricia.\n\nAs they went, they met surprisingly little resistance. Villages and towns which had been occupied by the rebels were deserted. They soon discovered that the granaries and food storages had been emptied as well. Nevertheless, Gilded Gale told the soldiers to continue the march towards the main strongholds of the enemy in Calcrond and High Mane. But when they arrived, those too were completely empty.\n\nGilded Gale figured that the rebels had retreated all the way to Buckthorn, so they could have a single place to defend. It was a wise move, but would not save them from the justice of the King. And so the forces kept marching to Hengestdelu. However, by now their supplies were running low, and there was nowhere to resupply. Gilded realized what the rebels were plotting. They wanted to force her to turn around and go all the way to Wittenburgh, exposing her flank and possibly run out of supplies entirely before reaching the city. But she had a different idea, though her officers condemned it as foolishly dangerous. She could attack Buckthorn anyways and destroy the rebellion in a single savage blow with the little supplies she had left. Either way, the fate of Wittenland would be determined by her actions."

wittenland.98.t:0 "Up The Griffking River"
wittenland.98.d:0 "The first time the garrison of Hoofcester had mutinied, it had been put down quickly. But this time the mutineers were better prepared and managed to overwhelm the loyalists and take control of the town. General Marigold led the army on a punitive expedition to restore order in Papaglia, even as insurgents occupied more and more villages and towns.\n\nThe army marched along the Griffking river, headed straight to the epicenter of the uprising in Hoofcester. Their supplies were transported on river barges upstream and were closely guarded. However, what they did not expect was insurgents crossing the river into Pònaidhean and striking at the barges from there. After the first attack which caused the sinking of several supply barges, Marigold's forces had no option but to abandon the river and carry supplies themselves, which slowed down their progress. But the attacks across the river did not stop. Pegasi flew across and harried them by dropping bombs. From the mountains to the west, raids were launched, with the attackers pulling back before an effective response could be organized.\n\nWhen the force finally arrived in Hoofcester, they had lost many of their supplies and soldiers. Unfortunately, Hoofcester turned out to be heavily fortified, with the local rebellious garrison armed to the teeth. Marigold's force was too weak for a proper siege and their supply lines were cut. The situation was desperate but Marigold did now waver. They could not pull out, so the only option was to attack Hoofcester. If they managed to take the town, they'd gain all the supplies within and could then focus on securing control of the Griffking. If they would fail, they'd have to fight their way back to Wittenburgh, which would be bloody and difficult."

wittenland.99.t:0 "Up The Mountain"
wittenland.99.d:0 "After their defeat at Hoofcester, the remaining rebels in the south abandoned Papaglia and pulled back to the mountains in the west. They quickly endeavoured to turn the region into a death trap, with Wintershorn being turned into a true stronghold. The insurgents knew their chances of victory were slim, but were determined to take down as many royalists as they could with them.\n\nMarigold gathered her forces to pacify the south-west. She knew that a direct attack on the region would be suicide, as the rough terrain provided a clear advantage to the rebels who could harry and ambush them at will. So instead, she decided not to attack at all. She ordered her troops to set up defences around the region, boxing the rebels in their mountains. Any transport of supplies into the region was forbidden. Marigold knew well that the region had little food to provide, so the rebels couldn't hold out forever. As long as they were contained, they would not be a threat to the Kingdom.\n\nAfter several days, the rebels realized what was happening. They were blockaded, and so now they were the ones who had to go on the offensive if they wished to accomplish anything. Plans were changed and rebel units reorganized. They would concentrate their forces into a single breakthrough attempt. It was desperate, but they had no other option.\n\nWhen the attack came, Marigold and her soldiers were ready. The rebels were equipped for guerilla warfare, not direct combat, and lacked the firepower to weaken their defences. Once the initial assault had been broken, Marigold's units went on a counter-attack and took hundreds of prisoners. She then used these as a bargaining chip, threatening to execute them if the remaining rebels did not capitulate. The insurgents reluctantly agreed to their demands and capitulated. The south was back in King Wulfric's control."
wittenland.99.a:0 "Excellent work."

wittenland.100.t:0 "A Two-Pronged Offensive"
wittenland.100.d:0 "Marigold managed to lead her soldiers through a gruesome gauntlet and reached the capital. The rebels had proven far more tenacious and dangerous than they had first seemed. Now, after their victory in Papaglia, they had moved into Ivanhorn and seized the entire surrounding region from monarchist hooves. This time, a larger force would be assembled to restore law and order in the south. So large, in fact, that it would be split in two. One force would march west and retake Ivanhorn, while the other would once again go south to Hoofcester. The rebels could not possibly resist them in both areas simultaneously, could they?\n\nTurns out, they could. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the rebels used terrain to their advantage, harrassing both forces and raiding their supply lines. Progress slowed down to a crawl, and they were in danger of being encircled. But Marigold did not abandon the offensive. She knew the rebels were stretched thin by their two-pronged attack, so all she needed to do was stretch them a little more, and their defences would snap. She contacted loyalists in Ivanhorn, which the rebels had recently seized, and urged the local clergy there to preach to the locals and incite a counter-uprising of sorts. The rebels could not possibly fight on three fronts, and by being overextended they could easily be surrounded and destroyed. Marigold prayed to the mountain spirits that the ponies of Ivanhorn could repel the insurgent occupiers. If they failed, Marigold's forces were the ones that would likely be cut off and destroyed, leaving Wittenburgh free for the taking."

Local merchants and peasants aided the rebels in forcing the garrison to surrender and stormed the Royal Palace in a frenzy. The Excubitors tried to hold back the tide but were overwhelmed. Finally, the rebels reached the throne room, where King Wulfric himself was waiting. He was surrounded by several loyal mage-nobles.\n\n"Foolish rebel scum," Wulfric muttered. "What chance do you think you have against our magical power?"\nVoliare, who was leading the mob, pulled out a pistol and aimed it at Wulfric's head. "Times have changed, old mule. Guns will bring an end to the age of magocrats and despots. Isn't it ironic that gunpowder was invented by a mage?"\nWulfric frowned and looked at the several dozen rifles and revolvers pointed at his head. "It would be honourable of me to refuse to surrender and die a glorious death defending my throne, but I still wish to see my daughter and granddaughter. It is clear you have won. Let them go and I will step down."\n"I thought you didn't care for them," Eadberhta said.\n"I said my love for Wittenland is greater. Not that I do not love them. And now, Wittenland is lost. Family is all I have left."\n"If you make any wrong moves, soon you won't have family either," Violet said. "Now come! You will be the first prisoner of the newborn Republic of Wittenland."\n\nWulfric's head hung low, and he let out a deep sigh. The stallion was weary of politics and power struggles. "So be it.

wittenland.102.d:0 "Monarchist forces have successfully defeated the rebels of the United Republican Front who rose up in various regions. Thousands upon thousands of merchants, peasants and soldiers have been taken prisoner, among them some of the leaders of the revolt. Most shockingly, Sigeweard Spellshield had betrayed his king and country, and would now face justice along with his comrades. It remained unclear if the suspected leader of the resistance, Voliare Gingerbeard, was among the prisoners.\n\nThose ponies who were the likely candidates to be Voliare were gathered before the Royal Palace, to face the King himself. A crowd of loyalists had gathered there to mock the prisoners, with some of them throwing rotten vegetables at them. Without the Excubitors, it is likely the crowd would've beaten the prisoners to death, such was their fury. They went silent when the King appeared on a balcony above.\n\n"Rebel fools," he said. "You thought you could overthrow a monarchy that has lasted for centuries? That you could bring an end to ancient magocratic rule so easily? What imbecile convinced you that your pitiful rebellion would've been able to accomplish such a miraculous feat?"\n\nThe prisoners remained silent.\n\n"All of you deserve punishment, that much is certain. But death will teach you nothing. No, the punishment of death is reserved to the head of the snake, the treacherous and vile plotter who organized this entire ordeal. If you do not admit to me which one of you is this 'Voliare', then I will have no choice but to impose his punishment on somepony else. More specifically, on Sigeweard Spellshield, the arch-traitor." The marshal was dragged onto the balcony by a hooded executioner. "Reveal yourself, Voliare, and your friend here will not perish needlessly!"\n\nThe prisoners remained silent. Then, one of them stepped forth. "I am Voliare!" they shouted. Wulfric seemed pleased at first, but then another one rose up. "I am Voliare," they repeated. More and more rebels stood up and claimed to be Voliare. Even Sigeweard grinned and said "I am Voliare."\nWulfric's lips twisted into an angry grimace. "You dare mock me, your King? Fine then. If all of you are Voliare, then all of you will die."\n"Death is preferable to life under your reign, Wulfric," Sigeweard spat out.

The Wittenlandic embassy was recalled, trade between our nations was limited and annual diplomatic meetings were cancelled.

These oaths of fealty and servitude were never broken, simply ignored as centuries passed and Wittenland became isolated and decadent. This means that Pònaidhean, de jure, is still a vassal of Wittenland. No one, not even [Root.GetLeader], can deny that this claim is righteous and true.\n\nHowever, oaths are made by individuals, and for generations now the Taoiseachs have not re-affirmed the oath by swearing it again. [Root.GetLeader] can choose to simply refuse to swear any oaths and thus keep Pònaidhean independent. But it is clear King Wulfric would not be pleased.

wittenland.118.d:0 "Shocking news spread like wildfire across the mountains of Wittenland. Wulfric Grey, the High King of Wittenland and the restorer of its glory, has passed away. Some already expected this to happen, especially his relatives and advisors, as he was an old stallion and his health had been steadily deteriorating in recent times. However, the public was kept completely uninformed and thus was unprepared for the news. Three days of mourning would be held and the High Kingdom came to a standstill as businesses and factories closed temporarily. On the third day, a funeral was held in Calcrond, Wulfric's home town. His vast family gathered there, as well as the mage-nobles, monks and many commoners. They participated in a procession that quietly carried his coffin to his burial mound outside the settlement. Monks chanted and his beloved granddaughter placed edelweiss flowers on top of his coffin while sobbing. Soldiers in black uniforms carried treasure from the lands he had subjugated inside his tomb to accompany him in the afterlife. Finally, once his coffin had been placed inside, a large stone was pushed to seal the mound shut.\n\nShortly after the funeral, a tournament was held to determine the successor, as was tradition. All capable unicorns were allowed to participate in this grand test of skill. After several weeks of magical duels and several unfortunate deaths, a victor emerged, having defeated all her opponents. Spirit Fire, a pyromancer from Wintershorn, had proven herself worthy of the title of High Queen, and gladly accepted it. Some mage-nobles were concerned by her questionable sanity, but because Wulfric had empowered the nobility they would be able to keep her in check. Hopefully."

wittenland.119.t:0 "The Birth Of A Republic"
wittenland.119.d:0 "Shortly after gaining power, Voliare immediately wished to create the foundations of a proper republican government. Hesitantly, government officials and bureaucrats got to work to erase all traces of monarchical rule. Wittenland would become a democratic republic, with Voliare as its first interim president. A parliament would eventually be established and parties of various ideologies would be allowed to form. However, he had no experience in politics and invited various advisors, both domestic and foreign. Notably, some of them were socialists from River Republic or Bakara. With their aid Voliare planned to bring freedom and equality to the ponies of Wittenland, who had suffered more than enough.\n\nWhile it would take time to arrange proper elections, for now Voliare gave an equal amount of power to every political party which was formed, allowing them to cooperate with him on reshaping Wittenland in the newly established coalition government called the Council of Deputies. Soon enough, three parties arose, led by influential republican sympathisers: Communist labour party of GAB led by Violet Plough, moderate centrist party of HEF led by Marshal Sigeweard Spellshield and libertarian capitalist HCG led by Eadberhta Featherwing. All three had radically different ideas for policies, but were willing to work together in a democratic fashion. Majority votes in the Council would decide what kind of republic Wittenland would become. Of course, each party also began campaigning, despite there being no set date for future elections. It seemed the current cooperative atmosphere was only meant to be temporary as each party sought to push the others into opposition. This concerned Voliare, but he firmly trusted that in the end every party would remain loyal to republican ideals."
wittenland.119.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

wittenland.120.t:0 "On The Matter Of Magocrats"
wittenland.120.d:0 "The Council of Deputies held a meeting to discuss what should be done about the thousands of mage-nobles who remained in the country, still in possession of their ancestral titles and holdings. What should their role in the Republic be? Should there be any role at all? Different parties had different views on the matter, and Voliare asked them to present them for all to hear.\n\nViolet Plough of the communist GAB broke out into a vehement rant about the nobles, how they had done nothing but abused the lower classes for millennia. She spoke how noble titles should be abolished entirely and all noble property redistributed. She even proposed cutting off the horns of all nobles, though the rest of the Council shot down that proposal quickly. Voliare said that if they were to dismantle the nobility as an institution, the former nobles would likely flee the country en masse, taking as much property with them as possible. This had to be taken into consideration.\n\nNext Sigeweard Spellshield of the HEF spoke. He condemned Violet's radicalism and instead said they should adopt a moderate, friendly approach. Many of the nobles, after all, had once been White Star's supporters, advocating liberal reforms. While not every mage-noble could be convinced, those who did end up supporting the Republic could provide beneficial advice, having decades of experience from politics. In response, Violet claimed he was biased due to being a unicorn himself. Sigeweard was angered, but Voliare managed to diffuse the situation and prevent a fight from breaking out.\n\nHaving patiently waited for the other two to speak, Eadberhta Featherwing of the HCG stood up and expressed their own opinion. They said that the nobles' property rights should be respected, but their titles could be rendered meaningless by simply making everypony equal before the law, no matter the background. Nobles would thus lose their influence and privileges, but could still have their economic wealth.\n\nVoliare thanked all party leaders for speaking and asked all deputies present to cast their votes. The lives and fortunes of the nobles were no longer in their own hooves, but in the hooves of the elected deputies, almost all of whom were commoners."
wittenland.120.a:0 "Nobility has no place in our Republic."

wittenland.121.t:0 "On The Matter Of Monarchists"
wittenland.121.d:0 "Not everypony in Wittenland welcomed the republican rule. Many still remained loyal to the monarchy, even after it had been dismantled. While monarchist support among the general populace was unimportant as the reactionary party lacked influence, it was far more dangerous in the army. It had been renamed the Army of the Republic, but many soldiers and especially conservative officers still called it the Royal Army. There were rumours of a plot to overthrow the government and hold a traditional magic tournament to find a new monarch to rule the country. Clearly something had to be done about the matter, and it had to be done quickly.\n\nThe Council of Deputies convened to discuss what to do about the monarchist supporters. Sigeweard Spellshield, being a marshal of the army, spoke first. He said they could negotiate a deal with the army officers: The republican government would leave the army alone, and in return the army would swear loyalty to the Republic. This agreement would benefit both sides and ensure stability. Violet Plough denounced the marshal however, saying that the reactionary officers and soldiers could not be trusted. Instead of allying with the enemy of the new regime, a swift purge had to take place as soon as possible. The gaps in the army would be filled with new ponies recruited from the proletariat. Violet claimed Sigeweard just wanted his friends in the army to keep their jobs, even if they ultimately plotted the destruction of the Republic. Sigeweard smoked his pipe and did his best to remain calm.\n\nNext, Eadberhta Featherwing stepped forth. They said the monarchists could still keep their jobs in the army, but the army itself would be reformed. Pay for soldiers would be increased and a new generation of officers would be hired, bringing fresh young blood into the army that would be more loyal to the new government.\n\nEadberhta sat back down as Voliare expressed his gratitude and said the deputies could now vote on the fate of the monarchists."

wittenland.122.t:0 "On The Matter Of Monks"
wittenland.122.d:0 "Ever since the foundation of the Kingdom, the monarchs of Wittenland had been the greatest patrons of the secluded mountain monasteries. Now the monarchy is gone, and the monks have difficulty trusting the new government. The republicans were progressive and stood against tradition, while tradition was the very foundation of the Wittenlandic faith. As such the monks saw the republicans as dangerous enemies and riled up the ponies to restore the monarchy of old.\n\nThe Council of Deputies assembled to decide what should be done about the dangerous clergy. Eadberhta of HCG spoke first, which was unusual of them as they preferred to have the last word. They said that, like River Republic and Lake City, their republic should adopt secularism as the official policy of the state. The government would be neutral on religious matters, allowing complete freedom of faith and leaving the monasteries alone. While some monks would be unhappy, most of them should learn to trust the Republic. As long as they don't act against the state, the state will leave them be in peace.\n\nViolet of GAB was not pleased with this proposition in the slightest. She said religion was opium for the masses and the clergy abused it to keep the commoners loyal to the old order. It was the duty of the Republic to impose enlightened atheism on the populace, tearing down monasteries and stripping monks of any special privileges and protections. This was a radical solution, but would deal with the issue swiftly and effectively.\n\nSigeward of HEF denounced Violet's dangerous idea and said Eadberhta's idea was unwise as well. Majority of the populace in Wittenland was religious, so any actions taken against the monks would anger them. Secularism, on the other hoof, distanced the republic even more from the old monarchy. To gain the support of both the clergy and the commonfolk, the Republic had to assume the same role the Kingdom had once held: A generous supporter of the monasteries. This way the status quo on religious matter could be maintained, and they could reap the benefits of cooperation with the wise monks.\n\nVoliare thanked the speakers and allowed the vote on the matter to begin."

wittenland.126.d:0 "Many moons of preparations are finally over, and the entire country is abuzz as citizens vote on who should represent them in the newly formed unicameral parliament. Voting stations were filled to the brim with ponies in many towns, and even rural villagers participated actively. The three main parties, communist GAB, centrist HEF and libertarian capitalist HCG, had all campaigned across the nation, gathering support and encouraging ponies to vote for them. The temporary Council of Deputies had also been a battleground between the parties, as each one sought to increase their popularity by pushing through reforms that appealed to their voting base. Now it remained to be seen which party had the most public support among the populace.\n\nAfter the elections, President Voliare would appoint ministers in the government and, as his last act, choose a successor. He never intended to be the head of the nation for long, as he lacked political acumen and experience. Having to herd the squabbling parties for so long only made him tired of politics. He has been very open about his desire to resign and return to simple civilian life as a humble merchant. The ponies of Wittenland have for the most part respected his wishes, albeit some towns have commissioned statues depicting him and news reporters continue to harass him.\n\nAs soon as the voting results came in, Voliare wrote down a list of ministers and the name of his successor, then left the capital, sailing his ship down the river, headed to distant lands. Ponies hope he returns home one day. Time shall tell if he will be disappointed or proud."

She denounced them as soon as they were revealed and claimed the vote had been rigged by "reactionaries and capitalists". GAB would renounce support of liberal "burgher" democracy and instead lead an immediate revolution to overthrow the government and impose a true dictatorship of the proletariat. Violet rallied the peasantry and workers of Wittenland with the words "Through struggle you will attain your rights!"\n\nConsidering how rapidly the coup began, it was clear it had been prepared for a long time, and that the communists had planned to execute it should they lose the elections. Government buildings in many towns came under siege and in some cases surrendered to armed communist militants. Units in the army mutinied and raised red banners above their barracks. A large riot broke out in Wittenburgh itself, setting fire to homes of merchants and factory owners.\n\nThe Republic was in crisis, its democracy threatened. But most of the army remained loyal to the Republic, or at least, fiercely opposed the communists if they still supported the restoration of the monarchy. Sigeweard Spellshield led his units to crush the communists before it was too late. The fate of the young Republic stood on a knife's edge."

That was something Violet Plough was determined to change.\n\nThe ceremony took place in the repurposed Royal Palace which was now the Presidential Palace.

Today is a day of great celebration, as at last the proletariat of Wittenland have risen to power for the first time in history. Yet this is nothing surprising. Caramel Marks herself theorized that all societies would inevitably decay due to feudalism and capitalism only to then have the oppressed workers come to power. The next stage he made very clear as well: The age of communism and equality, where nopony is impoverished or hungry, will now begin. As your President, I shall bravely lead us toward the utopia of tomorrow!"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and began chanting Violet Plough's name.

We should be proud of our past, our rich history and our traditions. Do not listen to those who say we should be ashamed of them, that we should abandon it all! Progress and tradition must co-exist. It is from harmony and balance of the two that a better nation is built. Too much of either leads to ruin.

She had charged them rent for using her land and workshops, draining the villagers dry and keeping them poor. Rolling Pin, the local baker, had once been a supporter of White Star, and hoped reform would set things right. But then she perished. Emeralda's reign only got worse and Rolling Pin feared for his life.\n\nWhen the Republicans came, he happily welcomed them with other villagers and offered them free bread. The Baroness now faced justice and lost much of her possessions, but she still lived in the village in her old manor. None of the ponies liked her, but so far tensions had not boiled over.\n\nThat was before Violet Plough urged peasants to hunt down nobles and cut off their horns. To beat them, to show them who were the true masters of Wittenland, to drive them away. Rolling Pin remembered all of Emeralda's mistreatment and soon joined a raging mob which surrounded her manor. They set the house aflame, and when the Baroness tried to escape by jumping out of a window, she was met with savage blows from pitchforks, butcher's knives and Rolling Pin's rolling pin. She begged for mercy and received none from the furious peasantry.\n\nOnce the lifeless mare was dumped into a river, Rolling Pin said he and his bakers would bake pastries to celebrate the occasion. But the other ponies seemed unenthused. By communist definition, Rolling Pin was a petty burgher, as he owned a business. Who was to say he would not become an oppressor like Emeralda? The villagers raised their pitchforks, and Rolling Pin realized he had to gallop.\n\nDesperately, he galloped north and plunged into the Griffking river, swimming across into the lands of the River Republic. He had lost everything except his life. As he looked at his mountainous homeland in the distance, he began to weep."

But the party members said Wittenland needed strong leadership in these uncertain times, so she could secure the communists' grasp on power.\n\nViolet felt like this is not at all what Caramel Marks had meant by "dictatorship of the proletariat". It was clear to her that the party members themselves sought to gain her favour and have her serve their own interests in return for this "gift". But was she so easily corruptible? Would she truly become what she had always opposed?\n\nShe couldn't help but admit it was all very tempting.

Now she had faced justice and lost much of her excessive property, which was redistributed to the villagers themselves. The local baker, Rolling Pin, was happy to finally own his bakery.\n\nBut in the end, life returned to normal, and it was almost like nothing had changed. Emeralda lived in her manor, brooding alone, and the villagers worked on the fields and occasionally purchased the odd machine from Buckthorn. Yet one day the Cultural Preservation Act was passed, and something changed once more. The disgraced Baroness, wishing to acquire government subsidies, hired workers to renovate her manor and opened it for public. It was now a museum.\n\nAt first the villagers were distrustful and refused to visit. Passing travellers, not being familiar with Emeralda, were not so hesitant. Each day some ponies would go to the museum, and thus the curiosity of the villagers grew. Rolling Pin decided to investigate and see what attracted strangers to enter her manor.\n\nHe entered free of charge and was welcomed by Emeralda herself, who acted much friendlier than before, giving a warm welcome to all who visited. Rolling Pin assumed the Institute of Cultural Heritage paid her a reward for every pony who came. Once inside, Rolling Pin's eyes widened and he realized why the place was so popular. The intricate walls were decorated with hundreds of paintings, part of Emeralda's vast collection. Some of them were centuries old, and a few came from other continents. There were also statues of marble, furniture decorated with gold leaves, and jewelry-encrusted dresses. It was astonishingly beautiful, and Rolling Pin realized Emeralda had a passion in art collection, having used high rents to fund her purchases. Now, she was displaying it for all the world to see, free of charge.\n\nPerhaps the Baroness wasn't as bad as he had once thought."

In Wittenburgh the situation worsened so much that the Excubitors were sent in to pacify the rioters, and the government briefly considered mobilizing the army once again.\n\nHowever, Eadberhta took control of the situation and went on radio, addressing the disgruntled workers. They promised that rioters would not face persecution or punishment for their actions if they agreed to return to their homes at once. They also said taxes would be reduced greatly in the near future. This calmed down majority of the protesters, though some demanded that GAB be legalized again. The remaining ponies were too few in number to resist armed mercenaries which had quickly been hired to restore order.\n\nPeace had returned to Wittenland, at least for now."

wittenland.140.d:0 "An emissary from Wittenland has crossed the Griffking and come to visit [Root.Capital.GetName]. They have presented our leaders with an offer they claim to be "irresistible": Wittenland will generously invest into our economy, helping us industrialise and modernize quickly. However, there was a catch. In return they would become our "guardian" and turn us into their dominion. They also require free access through our lands and unlimited use of our ports. It seems that above all, the Wittenlanders wish to gain access to the sea, but it cannot be denied that the offer is indeed very tempting, and we would still retain a good amount of autonomy.\n\nBut is Pònaidhean's sovereignty for sale?"

It seems they'd rather remain free and independent in their mud huts rather than embrace modernity by becoming a protectorate."
wittenland.142.a:0 "Foolish tribals."

wittenland.143.t:0 "Economic Boom"
wittenland.143.d:0 "The sleepy village of Hwicna, located east of Buckthorn, had seen little change over the decades. The local Baroness, Emeralda, had owned most of the property and demanded high rents from the villagers, who in turn had little wealth left spare, barely enough to sustain themselves. Queen White Star's reforms had helped a little and the Republic even more, but it remained a rural, silent village, even when the peasants and the local baker, Rolling Pin, owned most the land and workshops.\n\nYet Eadberhta's decision to drastically lower taxes, especially for the lower class, finally brought change and growth to the village. Rolling Pin was a relatively successful baker with several assistants, but until now he didn't have enough funds for expanding his business. Now at last he did, and soon enough he bought modern equipment and hired employees. The locals now had all the bread they could ever desire, yet Rolling Pin felt like this wasn't enough. He started a marketing campaign advertising his beloved baked goods in other nearby villages and Buckthorn itself. Curious ponies visited, praised his bread, and spread the word to their friends and family. More customers meant more money, and more money meant new bakeries. Within several moons Rolling Pin would have a prosperous bakery chain, and Hwicna grew rapidly as workers moved in.\n\nYet despite his success, the wages for the workers remained low, and each time the profits increased, Rolling Pin's own salary grew. Soon enough he bought out Baroness Emeralda's manor and moved in to live there. Then he started buying out the farms too, securing his supply of grain and turning them into efficient industrial farms. The original villagers either became his lowly-paid employees or they moved out elsewhere.\n\nIn the end, Rolling Pin had a prospering business empire, yet he felt lonely. His workers despised him, his village had become unrecognizable and ponies who had once been his friends were now far away.\n\nPerhaps another salary raise for himself would make him happy."
wittenland.143.a:0 "Can money buy happiness?"

wittenland.144.t:0 "A Rare Sight"
wittenland.144.d:0 "On the snowy slopes of the sacred Mount Norbeak, there stood an isolated monastery. And there it had stood for almost two thousand years, since the ponies had first arrived in Wittenland, migrating from the cold windigo-infested north. It is said the monastery was founded where the mysterious mountain spirits were first seen, and thus the mountain of Norbeak became a holy site.\n\nUnlike some other monasteries, the Norbeak monastery did not hoard wealth gifted to it by pilgrims and locals. Instead, all was offered as a votive sacrifice to the local spirits. And each time an offering was given, the goods vanished, as if the spirits had accepted and taken them. Some ponies were sceptical if that was truly the case, but so far nopony could prove where the items had gone.\n\nIt was on this foggy day when something miraculous happened. A lone monk was carrying gifts to the sacrificial altar when he saw a shining creature standing there, as if it was waiting for him. He froze in shock as the equine creature looked him in the eyes. It was quadruped and had a pair of curved horns, a long and flowing mane and a scaly tail. Its eyes were as black as the night, yet had glimmering pupils that looked like gems. An aura of cold surrounded the being, coating the stone in frost.\n\nThe monk came back to his senses and dropped all the goods he had on his back and carefully walked away from the creature. It remained still, unmoving as a rock, as long as it remained in his sight. So he decided to return to the monastery and bring fellow monks to see the being, but once he came back to the altar there was nothing. Both the creature and the offerings were gone. Yet the frost remained.\n\nThe monk was confident that he had seen a mountain spirit, and cried tears of joy. Only here, far from the capital and its meaningless power struggles, could a Wittenlander truly be blessed and witness something so holy."
wittenland.144.a:0 "Truly a miracle."

wittenland.145.t:0 "A Hero's Return"
wittenland.145.d:0 "News spread like wildfire across Wittenburgh. After many years, Voliare Gingerbeard, the hero of the republic, had finally returned from his journeys. The President Eadberhta Featherwing flew directly from the Presidential Palace to the city's riverside docks as soon as they heard the news.\n\nA huge crowd had already gathered there, cheering as Voliare disembarked from his ship. He seemed older yet wiser than before, having travelled far and wide. Eadberhta could only imagine how much wealth he had amassed during that time. When Voliare saw them, the smile on his lips faded however, making Eadberhta lift an eyebrow.\n\nThe crowd parted as Voliare walked to the president. "Is it true, Eadberhta?" he demanded.\n"What is?" they responded, unsure what he meant.\n"That you've neglected the lower class and keep wages low to increase profits for companies -- including the one you own."\nEadberhta's eyes widened and they became nervous as the crowd stared at them. "I mean, admittedly that is true, but-"\n"How come? The republic was meant to be a haven of equality, yet all you've done is replace the mage-nobles with merchants. Why did you let that happen?"\n"Look, Voliare, I did make Wittenland equal. Everypony has the same rights, same liberties, same chances. If they want a higher standard of living, they just have to work for it."\n"Then how do ponies remain impoverished despite working forty hours a week?"\nThe crowd's stare became increasingly angry and frustrated, and Eadberhta started to feel like Voliare had the upper hoof. "Okay okay, look, let's make a deal. I do not want to quarrel with the hero of the Republic who is my old friend. How about this: I put in a limit for how low the wages can be. A minimum wage. That way the workers get paid fairly yet the companies can still make a profit."\nVoliare smiled again. "I always knew you were a good negotiator. So be it, I like the idea." He offered his hoof to Eadberhta, who shook it as a sign of friendship."
wittenland.145.a:0 "It had to be done."

wittenland.146.t:0 "Wittenland Seeks To Integrate Us"
wittenland.146.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader] has proclaimed that the old High Kingdom of Wittenland is restored, and has been crowned as its new ruler. Now our overlords are using this as a justification for integrating our lands which once belonged to the High Kingdom about a millennium ago. There is little we can do, but perhaps weak resistance is better than no resistance at all?"
wittenland.146.a:0 "We have no choice but to give up."
wittenland.146.b:0 "Keep resisting integration as long as possible!"

wittenland.149.t:0 "The Wittenlanders Retreat!"
wittenland.149.d:0 "We've been fighting the soldiers of [WIT.GetNameDef] for a while now, as they've tried to reclaim their lost territory. But after facing our creations on the field of battle, while enduring the chaotic weather of our lands, the morale of the Wittenlanders began to waver. They underestimated our might and have been unable to break decisively through our defensive lines, taking numerous casualties. They were simply not ready to face the horrors we had created.\n\nBecause of all this, the army of Wittenland has decided to pull back and retreat from our lands, and any of their possible allies have done the same. We now have time to breath and regain our strength, though it will not last for long. Eventually, Wittenland will be back, and we must prepare."
wittenland.149.a:0 "They'll never retake Barrad!"

wittenland.150.t:0 "An Unexpected Link"
wittenland.150.d:0 "For many centuries now, there has existed an obscure theory among the scholarly circles of Wittenland, proposing that Wittenlanders have shared culture and heritage with that of the northern Hillponies, evidenced by similarity in language. However, it has not been particularly popular as most mage-nobles prefer to see Wittenlanders as a superior culture that has no connection to "barbaric" Hillponies.\n\nNow, however, a breakthrough has been achieved. Using latest methods in Hippological studies, a group of scientists from the Great Library have completed an extensive research comparing Hillpony culture with that of Wittenland. Some of the members even travelled to the desolate north and conducted interviews and other research with the locals. A scientific paper was made using all the evidence and the conclusion was clear: Wittenlanders and Hillponies are indeed related, not only in language but likely in blood as well. While the cultures had greatly diverged after the migration period, their root was one and the same.\n\nFor the first time in Wittenlandic history, a scientific study became mainstream as the media published it in newspapers and on the radio. It was a controversial study and as such easily attracted attention from all societal classes. Some mage-nobles tried to refute the study but could not truly debunk it, while others accepted it as clear truth. A new fascination with Hillponies was quickly born, and many ponies already wished to travel north and visit Farbrook and other settlements to meet their "distant cousins". Some aristocrats who owned Hillpony cultural artifacts now proudly displayed them for all to see, while others began to debate which nobles had the purest Hillpony blood. It seemed to be the beginning of a new cultural movement, which would later be called "Hillponyism"."

wittenland.151.t:0 "Comet Sighted"
wittenland.151.d:0 "The appearance of a bright comet in the night sky caused a panic among the [Root.GetRaceMembers] of our nation. This panic turned out to be justified as the comet landed near our capital city, causing a massive bright explosion that could be heard hundreds of kilometers away, wiping out entire villages and towns. Even our capital city itself suffered from the powerful shockwave caused by the impact. Thousands have died, many more injured, numerous buildings are damaged or destroyed. It is a national disaster.\n\nCuriously this event happened just as we were fighting the unicorns of Wittenland. Some have suggested it was Wittenlandic witches who brought down the falling star upon us, but most folk dismiss this claim as nonsensical and believe it was simply a terribly unfortunate event."
wittenland.151.a:0 "The horror!"

wittenland.152.t:0 "Redemption"
wittenland.152.d:0 "It is difficult for a person to change. During the first weeks of life in the Royal Palace, Silver Star still acted the same as before. He remained in his personal quarters and only spoke with his sister, barely eating anything as he believed the food could've been poisoned by ponies who wanted him dead. Worst of all, an undead rat was discovered by a maid, so Silver continued to experiment with forbidden necromantic spells.\n\nAt first White Star felt resigned and desperate. It would've been simpler to lock up her little brother in a safe and isolated prison cell and leave him there. But in the end she refused to give up, feeling determined about saving her brother.\n\nShe entrusted her mareservant Dayne with some of her royal duties to spend more time with Silver. She invited him to banquets and encouraged him to chat with nobles and the staff of the palace, to get him to come out of his shell. She taught him various spells that had nothing to do with dark magic. Most importantly, she invited a Gryphian cossack to come for a visit. At first, Silver Star was terrified and hid behind a curtain, but the cossack proved to be a friendly and warm individual who loved to make jokes and laugh. Some of his jokes were so good that even Silver showed signs of amusement (mostly because White Star was the butt of the jokes).\n\nAfter several moons, Silver Star was a changed stallion. While still an introvert, he now openly talked to other ponies in the castle and regularly met with his new cossack friend. He even started to write a book on healing magic. White Star was so proud of her brother that she offered him a high-ranking position in the Royal Army."

#LEADER Desc
POLITICS_HONORIA_DESC:0 "Honoria Goldmane was a serf bound to the land until she was freed by Queen White Star's reforms, who spoke fateful worlds that Honoria has never forgotten: "Not anyone can become great, but a great person can come from anywhere".\n\nShe quickly saw some success in trading products that were unappreciated by the nobility, and invested her entire savings into a trade mission to New Mareland, purchasing modern equipment to resell in Wittenland. Her initial ventures have grown, and she became suddenly wealthy.\n\nHonoria sees greatness in Wittenland's future, if only every unicorn can be freed to achieve their potential just as she has. She fumes over the oppression of incompetent nobles and believes Wittenland's meritocratic traditions can form the foundation of a truly just society, where only those fit to rule rise to the top."
POLITICS_WHITE_STAR_DESC:0 "Queen White Star is in many ways an exceptional mage-noble. Coming from a relatively unnotable family in High Mane, she genuinely cares for the common ponies, respects democracy and does not seek power for its own sake. She is ambitious, determined and has a strong will; those who argue with her soon realize what a futile effort it is. These make her a polar opposite to most mage-nobles, as well as her estranged brother, Silver Star, who is cowardly and power-hungry. Instead of defying his sister who condemned his dabbling in the dark arts, he fled and joined the Pentarchy of Barrad. Yet those who agree with White Star and her values soon learn how generous and caring she is, with a strong sense of empathy. It is no surprise she felt pity for her family's serfs and freed them, before deciding to become Queen and free all the other serfs of Wittenland as well.\n\nShe gained power the same way as every Wittenland monarch - by gathering the support of the nobility and issuing a challenge to the current monarch, who stepped down rather than face her in a magical duel. White Star is a skilled mage indeed, her determination making her a dedicated learner, always seeking to improve her abilities.\n\nA reformist, White Star is working to improve the antiquated society that has oppressed the common pony and enriched unproductive nobles. She has already implemented some key reforms, freeing peasants from serfdom and encouraging the expansion of the middle class. However, her greater ambitions of turning Wittenland into a true haven of liberty and prosperity remain incomplete."
POLITICS_VOLIARE_DESC:0 "A former serf who took to a life as a smuggler on the rivers and coasts of east Griffonia, Voliare was a trusted companion of Merchant Captain Honoria. His life on the water instilled a certain egalitarianism in him - everypony is equal before the unforgiving waters. Unlike Honoria, he sympathises with those former serfs who weren't as successful as they were.\n\nConcluding that the Wittenland's pretensions about duels, meritocracy, unicorn supremacy were merely another tool of oppression, he works to overturn the entire Wittenland system and realise a world where all races must work together to steer the ship of state. However, he has no experience or knowledge of politics, and wishes to act in a guiding role more than anything. Time will tell if he wishes to remain in his position for long."
POLITICS_VOLIARE_2_DESC:0 "Voliare has returned from his journeys to distant lands, and seems to have grown more wise and confident. His values are more refined and he is a better speaker. After seeing Violet's descent into despotism, he decided to finally steer the ship of state himself. Under his guidance, democracy and equality shall prevail in Wittenland."
POLITICS_WULFRIC_DESC:0 "Wulfric of Cemricia is an old stallion, the head of the large and ancient noble family of Grey, and has been influential in Wittenland's politics for decades. He has always acted as an opponent to radical change and reform, but also thinks Wittenland has grown weak and complacent. This is why he backed White Star when she challenged the previous, decadent King, but soon began to regret this as the new Queen proved to be an ardent reformist, capable of outsmarting him time and again. Now White Star is dead and he has decided to take matters into his own hooves. If no one else can restore Wittenland's long lost glory and might, then he will. And he won't let anyone stand in his way. Especially the former serfs who have grown all too arrogant."
POLITICS_VIOLENT_DESC:0 "Violet Plough is an earth pony mare, which meant that even as a serf she was below other serfs who were unicorns. Her former master took full advantage of this, abusing her and mistreating her daily. Yet Violet Plough was powerless against her magocratic master and his mighty magics. Only White Star's abolition of serfdom could save her, giving her freedom which she had dreamt of for so many years.\n\nAfter becoming a free pony, Violet quickly learned to read despite being above thirty years old, and managed to get her hooves on the writings of Caramel Marks. These texts were swift to radicalize her due to her past life, and she was filled with determination to save the proletariat (which in her mind included peasants) from oppression. Wherever they were abused, Violet was the first to speak up and condemn it, allowing White Star to quickly crack down on any such cases.\n\nAfter White Star's death, Violet abandoned her tolerance of the monarchy. She became the leader of a widespread peasant movement that opposed land requisitions. Her influence continued to grow after she joined Voliare and his anti-monarchist alliance in their struggle to overthrow the oppressive monarchical regime.\n\nNow she has leveraged her influence to become the leader of the Republic of Wittenland, which she wishes to purge of any and all unjust oppression, no matter what it takes. Nopony should ever experience what she had to endure in her youth."
POLITICS_SIGEWEARD_DESC:0 "Having faithfully served the monarchy for many decades in the Royal Army, nopony expected Sigeweard Spellshield to become a supporter of the republicans. Yet he did, shocking many in his betrayal. But Sigeweard did not see it as such. His loyalty lies not in the government, but in the ponies themselves. He had vowed to defend them, so if the government were to turn against the common pony, he would fight back.\n\nSigeweard is not only a warrior, but a scholar and skilled mage, like most officers in the army. He is capable of summoning large magical shields that can even withstand modern weaponry to some extent. He is regarded as well-read, sophisticated and wise, and is respected by most of the military. Whenever he speaks, he does so calmly while smoking a pipe.\n\nHowever, Sigeweard is anything but calm when it comes to new radical ideologies such as communism. He sees them as dangerous for the ponies of Wittenland, luring them with false promises of a better future but in the end oppressing them. Radical change is foolish and traditions should never be fully forsaken. He is determined to be a voice of reason in the new Republic, keeping it from tipping over too far into either side of the political spectrum."
POLITICS_EADBERHT_DESC:0 "Pegasi in Wittenland are often regarded as no better than earth ponies, meaning they belong in the bottom of social hierachy. Yet Eadberhta is not there. They are firmly in the middle class, having risen there from poverty with their negotiating skills. White Star's liberalizing reforms allowed free trade and helped commoners secure loans. Eadberhta took one loan, founded a small delivery business and started making deals. Soon enough, it was the biggest delivery company in Wittenland. Yet not a single unicorn was employed, as they lacked the pegasus' ability to fly over rough terrain.\n\nEadberhta is a firm advocate of liberty and equality, yet they are not a socialist. Instead, they want society to be free and fair, without intervention from the government. Everypony should get exactly what they deserve, nothing less and nothing more. Just because a pony is a unicorn or poor doesn't mean they should get more than others. This is why Eadberhta was happy to support Voliare in his cause, but more than values, Eadberhta cares for their business. And sometimes, conflict is profitable.\n\nNopony is quite sure what gender Eadberhta is. They themselves don't seem to care, and said ponies are free to use "he" or "she" or anything else when referring to them. The only person who truly knows what gender they are is their husband. Eadberhta is happy to keep it that way."

WIT_national_spells_cat:0 "National Spells"
WIT_national_spells_cat_desc:0 "Wittenland is a nation of unicorns, and many of them are powerful mages. By pooling their power together, they can cast potent spells with expansive effects. Legend says unicorns once raised and lowered the sun and moon, after all. Though we are unable to accomplish such a feat any longer, we can use our magic for various other purposes - both beneficial and harmful."
WIT_study_in_library:0 "Study In The Great Library"
WIT_study_in_library_desc:0 "The Great Library of Wittenburgh contains many ancient scrolls and tomes from all across the world. Studying and deciphering them will allow us to relearn mighty spells long forgotten."
WIT_frozen_water:0 "Freezing Aura"
WIT_frozen_water_desc:0 "Pegasi might be able to control weather, but we unicorns can control temperature itself. Our battle mages will cast enchantments on our soldiers, creating an aura of cold around them that freezes any water they step on, which allows them to cross bodies of water with ease."
WIT_lead_into_gold:0 "Lead Into Gold"
WIT_lead_into_gold_desc:0 "Transmutation spells have long been studied by alchemists, and by far the most useful spell is the one that turns lead, a fairly worthless metal, into shining gold. However, we must be careful with using this spell, as it results in inflation in the value of gold itself. In limited amounts, it can be an economic boon."
WIT_magic_mystery_cure:0 "Magical Mystery Cure"
WIT_magic_mystery_cure_desc:0 "With the use of magic, illnesses and wounds can be healed, and ponies saved from the brink of death. A potent nation-wide blessing is even more powerful than smaller healing spells used by individual mages."
WIT_disarray:0 "Confusion"
WIT_disarray_desc:0 "Some see mind-altering spells as immoral, but there is nothing wrong about using such spells on our enemies. With this powerful curse, we will cause havoc in the ranks of the enemy, making civilians lash out at each other and clouding the minds of their soldiers."
WIT_magical_automatons:0 "Clockwork Automatons"
WIT_magical_automatons_desc:0 "More advanced spells can temporarily make unliving things filled with life, eager to do the bidding of their creators. Automaton workers are clockwork constructs capable of completing tasks far more efficiently than their living counterparts."
WIT_they_shall_know_no_fear:0 "They Shall Know No Fear"
WIT_they_shall_know_no_fear_desc:0 "The terror and stress of battle is often too much for soldiers to handle. If we use a mind-altering spell to dissuade such fears and make even the greatest coward bold and courageous, can it be called immoral? We don't think so."
WIT_blight:0 "Blight"
WIT_blight_desc:0 "It is widely believed that the best way to demoralize an enemy is by targeting their civilian populace. We shall do so by casting a curse on their crops and stored food, making plants diseased and rotten. Thousands will starve, but hopefully this will weaken their ability to wage war."
WIT_rust:0 "Curse of Rust"
WIT_rust_desc:0 "By casting a spell on the equipment used by our enemies, we can make it rapidly rust away. Rifles will malfunction and shatter, barrels of artillery guns will crumble into nothing and tanks will fall apart."
WIT_tame_ursas:0 "Tame Ursas"
WIT_tame_ursas_desc:0 "Ursa Minors are monstrous bear-like beasts composed of stardust who live in the caverns of our mountains. Long have they preyed on our ponies, but now it will come to an end. We will cast a powerful spell to subdue the minds of these beasts, making them obey our every command. We can then use them in battle against our foes."
WIT_tame_dragons:0 "Train Dragons"
WIT_tame_dragons_desc:0 "The ancient mountains of Wittenland are home to dragons, who slumber on piles of treasure gathered over the centuries. The elder dragons are too mighty for our spells, but with the help of magic, we can capture eggs from their nests. We can train these young dragonlings and then unleash them in the field of battle against our enemies."
WIT_marble_warriors:0 "Marble Warriors"

WIT_summon_falling_star_desc:0 "We might not be able to wrestle control of the Sun and Moon from the Equestrian Princesses, but we can pull a star down from the sky, making it land near the capital of our accursed enemy.

However, instead of outright civil war they have decided to fight a guerilla war, meaning that crushing the rebels will be a difficult task."
WIT_crush_northern_insurgents:0 "Crush The Northern Rebels"
WIT_crush_northern_insurgents_desc:0 "The misguided resistance has managed to seize control of his majesty's home town of Calcrond, taking members of the royal family hostage, and have also occupied High Mane with the support of the local populace.

WIT_hire_merc_3:0 "Hire Nimbusian Hoplites"
WIT_hire_merc_3_desc:0 "The Nimbusian pegasi are regarded as some of the finest warriors in the world, even if their rifles can be outdated. Some of their hoplites offer their services to foreigners, although they charge quite a hefty sum for their quality service."
WIT_hire_merc_4:0 "Hire Diamond Dog Ironpaws"
WIT_hire_merc_4_desc:0 "Our fellow mountain-folk in the north do not live among mountains like we do, but inside them.

WIT_hire_merc_5:0 "Hire Gryphian Cossacks"
WIT_hire_merc_5_desc:0 "The cossacks of Gryphia have long been our enemies, raiding us for loot. But what if instead we offered them wealth for free, in return for military service? Not only would that put a stop to the raids, but also gain us a valuable unit to use in battle."
WIT_hire_merc_6:0 "Hire Changeling Panzers"

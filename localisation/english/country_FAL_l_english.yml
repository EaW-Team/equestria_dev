#industrial path
FAL_educate_farmers:0 "Dissolve Feudal Archaisms"
FAL_educate_farmers_desc:0 "[FAL.GetName] has never been a particularly developed nation, but the loss of our prized capital has seemingly put any progress to a halt. To address the various issues that concern our nation, serfdom and tithes are to be abolished, and a more contemporary system emulating ones in Aquila and Griffenheim shall be established. By no means will this solve all our problems, but it is a painful start."

FAL_new_factories:0 "New Industrial Base"
FAL_new_factories_desc:0 "Outside of Falcor, beyond our grasp, industrialisation has been sporadic and incomplete, only pursued by those with the means to generate a profit. The government will commence the funding of state sponsored factories to resolve the lack of jobs and goods."

FAL_new_military_factories:0 "Expand Military Workshops"
FAL_new_military_factories_desc:0 "The nation needs arms. The only certainty of our future is that there will be strife, and we must be ready to protect ourselves. We might be weakened, but we will never yield as long as we can fight, and fight we shall!"

FAL_better_farmers:0 "Implements of the Modern Age"
FAL_better_farmers_desc:0 "Iron ploughs, rusted tools, broken pickaxes shall be a thing of the past. To truly bring our nation to industrial revolution, we require sturdy implements for our workers. Only that way can they efficiently perform their duties! Although we do not have the means to produce such instruments, we are capable of importing them from the north."

FAL_stabalize_economy:0 "Increase Living Standards"
FAL_stabalize_economy_desc:0 "Initial reforms have given their yield, and the former serfs now breathe the air of freedom. Many now flock to the cities in search of a better life, but the conditions are cramped and squalid. We should act before the problem exacerbates."

FAL_better_factories:0 "Improving the Process of Production"
FAL_better_factories_desc:0 "Factory work is a novelty to many griffons, and a lot of our tools and machinery are dated and potentially hazardous. Investments should be made in this area, to encourage our labourers to work harder, with the contemporary technology."

FAL_better_intel:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
FAL_better_intel_desc:0 "Radios, computers, anything that runs on electrical power are very hard to find in the Falcor of today. Lagging behind in such inventions would be devastating for our nation, which is why we must make strides in importing these gadgets, and reverse-engineering them so that we can produce our own variants."

FAL_new_trains:0 "Double the Railway Lines"
FAL_new_trains_desc:0 "At the current state of development, trains are the fastest method for civilian transport, military redeployments and moving goods around. However, our steam locomotives are slow and need to be replaced. Additionally, we shall look into building new railway lines for the new trains, which will also use a different gauge compared to the Wingbardian ones."

FAL_improve_illiteracy:0 "Combating Illiteracy"
FAL_improve_illiteracy_desc:0 "Most griffons pay no heed to books and knowledge, for their burdens are great, and their time is precious and little. As such, a dedicated campaign towards teaching everygriff how to read and write will be funded: employers will provide basic training, access to libraries will be improved, and we'll reach out to farflung communities."

FAL_industry1:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
FAL_industry1_desc:0 "First steps towards progress have been taken. The city of Matton has successfully implemented telegraph lines, electrical based machinery and more. It would only be logical to extend these advancements to the rest of Falcor, so that we all may benefit from novelty."

FAL_science1:0 "A New Pursuit for Science"
FAL_science1_desc:0 "As Falcorians slowly become more and more literate, new possibilities are opening. Higher degree schools can be opened, jobs that don't involve heavy physical exertion are becoming commonplace. All this and more will ensure our place in the world as a nation of literate griffons."

FAL_scientific_greatness:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] University"
FAL_scientific_greatness_desc:0 "[FAL.GetLeader] has proudly announced the opening of the first higher learning institute in our nation, the [Root.Capital.GetName] University. It will provide our best and brightest citizens with the prospect of greater learning. At the present moment, this facility will offer faculties in history, engineering and mathematics."

FAL_more_schools:0 "Compulsory and Complimentary"
FAL_more_schools_desc:0 "Education shall be the right of all griffons dwelling in this nation, regardless of their position. It shall also be made mandatory for everygriffon, with no charge attached to it. The government will have to cover the cost of it, but it is the only way illiteracy can be eliminated."

FAL_can_read:0 "A Literate Falcor"
FAL_can_read_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off and now almost every Falcorian is able to read and write. Illiteracy in major cities has decreased under 1% for both adult and children, and even in the countryside the rates don't go over 3%. The nation as a whole will benefit from our learned citizens."

FAL_farmers_can_read:0 "Feudalism Abolished"
FAL_farmers_can_read_desc:0 "All traces of serfdom has been eliminated, and every Falcorian lives as a free griffon. Farmers now own the land they work, and a majority of our population now lives in the bustling, growing cities. Although the former elites bemoan the loss of their privileges, the nation as a whole has prospered as a result. Falcor stands tall as a modern nation!"

FAL_more_factories:0 "Invest in Growing Businesses"
FAL_more_factories_desc:0 "Encouraged by our reforms, many citizens have started their own small scale companies, and factory owners have increased their wages. With careful backing of select establishments, we can increase the rate of growth while maintaining a stable economy."

FAL_more_mil_factories:0 "An Armed Society..."
FAL_more_mil_factories_desc:0 "Dangers lurk in the world, both nearby and distant. The only way a proud Falcorian can preserve his freedom is with a weapon - and that requires the expansion of our firearm facilities to ensure everygriff, soldier or civilian, has a way to defend themselves."

FAL_more_trains:0 "Connect the Countryside"
FAL_more_trains_desc:0 "Our initial campaign in expanding the railways has been a success, which makes it only senseful that we expand these lines to smaller communities. No matter where a griffon is, he shall be able to find a nearby train station and reach any city in our state."

FAL_new_banks:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] Central Bank"
FAL_new_banks_desc:0 "As griffons seek new lives in cities, they find themselves without a sufficient capital to live a decent life. To prevent them from falling prey to loan sharks, a central bank shall be established to regulate the loan giving, serve as a gold repository, and regulate our currency. Of course, the banks will be regulated to ensure the interest rate isn't crippling."

FAL_science2:0 "Falcorian Research Laboratories"
FAL_science2_desc:0 "Our scientists clamour for specialised facilities to perform experiments and research without being disturbed. While it is a great expense, they have shown promise and given the results we needed, giving us a solid reason to fund these laboratories so that we may continue achieving new heights in science."

FAL_industry2:0 "Greatness Achieved"
FAL_industry2_desc:0 "From humble beginnings, we have achieved what nogriff thought to be possible - a modern, literate and prosperous Falcor. [FAL.GetLeader]'s success shall be remembered for future generations, and our nation state shall persevere for ages to come."

#military trees

FAL_military_start:0 "Review the Falcorian Army"
FAL_military_start_desc:0 "We have a large amount of soldiers ready to fight for Falcor, but their equipment and tactics are woefully outdated. Our priority should be catching up with the other military powers on the continent, by any means necessary."

FAL_land_doctrine_1:0 "Lessons of the Wingbardian War"
FAL_land_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Although the war of Wingbardy aggression ended in a defeat, it was not a complete failure. Those who survived learned crucial lessons, both officers and soldiers. Using their knowledge to fortify Falcor to an even greater degree would guarantee our victory, should war arise again."

FAL_infantry_weapons_1:0 "Thunderous Applause"
FAL_infantry_weapons_1_desc:0 "The tried and true methods are called such because they work in any conditions - and that is our approach to warfare. The standard battle rifle of the Falcorian soldiers needs modernisation, to keep up with the ever changing struggle, as well as their other equipment, grenades and protection."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics:0 "Modernise Ordnance"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_desc:0 "Artillery is progressively becoming deadlier. Rifling, recoil mechanisms and breech-loading have all allowed for the barrage to continue without delay, while maintaining accuracy. Our existing pieces should be brought to latest standards, and a new design shall be made to begin production in the following years."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics_2:0 "Support Equipment"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_2_desc:0 "War isn't just about shooting the other griffon, but to prepare adequately for battle so that losses can be minimised and victory assured. This takes form in the support batallions, who do vital tasks such as reconnaissance, bridge building, hauling supplies and maintaining heavy equipment. Ensuring our soldiers have the best equipment for such tasks could mean everything."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics_3:0 "Shell After Shell"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_3_desc:0 "Military thought adapts and evolves constantly to the changing aspect of warfare. What was revolutionary a decade ago is now but a note in history books, and new technologies complicate the matter even further. Our strategies and tactics must reflect the reality."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics_4:0 "Cost Saving Designs"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_4_desc:0 "Cheap does not have to mean crude - with sufficient experimentation and funding, our firearms can be made easier and quicker to produce. As our forces are increasing at a steady pace, this investment should resolve the issue of inadequate and missing equipment."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics_5:0 "Shock and Awe"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_5_desc:0 "Utilising rapid dominance tactics, we can impose an overwhelming level of shock and awe against an enemy quickly enough to paralyze their will to carry on. This will allow us to seize control of the environment and paralyse the enemy's perceptions and understanding of events, leaving them incapable of organised resistance."

FAL_infantry_support_tactics_6:0 "Motorised Infantry"
FAL_infantry_support_tactics_6_desc:0 "Motorisation will greatly increase the strategic mobility of our infantry units, which would otherwise be forced to rely on arduous marches or railroads. Motorised infantry have an advantage in agility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, and the ability to outmanoeuvre the enemy."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics:0 "Improved Battlefield Support"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_desc:0 "Griffons would fight much more effectively on the field, if they knew that their needs would be fully accomodated for. Scouts, supply troops, repairgriffs and battalion runners - they all play a vital role in battle. They must be equipped and trained to the latest standards."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics_1:0 "Artillery in Supporting Role"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_1_desc:0 "Although a massed barrage certainly has its murderous efficiency, the resources spent on developing and producing such high amounts of ordnance would be effectively wasted. The common soldiers need their equipment far more, but it would still be a missed opportunity cost to neglect our artillery development. Restrict their budget and choose the best model they can make."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics_2:0 "Study Foreign Defences"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_2_desc:0 "There were many occurences in history, in which a smaller force defeated a greater, much superiour army. Falcor should emulate these heroics of the past by learning from their tactics, even if we can't always rely on luck to befuddle our foes."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics_3:0 "Intensive Training"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_3_desc:0 "To withstand any assault, to protect Falcor, to the last griffon standing - that is the creed our soldiers need to live by. Stricter, more thorough drills will ensure the griffons on the fields are prepared for any occasion and aren't afraid to spit directly in the face of Maar. Falcor does not break, nor does it bend."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics_4:0 "Fortezza Falcor"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_4_desc:0 "Having learned from others and ourselves, we can put this knowledge of fortification and planning to the test. The high command wishes to implement our doctrinal efforts as widely as possible - from officers extensively planning and coordinating their assaults to engineers designing bunkers that can withstand an even higher amount of barrage."

FAL_mobile_war_tactics_5:0 "Falcorian Engineering Corps"
FAL_mobile_war_tactics_5_desc:0 "The profession of a military engineer may not be the most glorious one - nogriff dreams of digging trenches in the mud and rain as their ideal - but their role is certainly the most important in an army on the move. If we were to present their corps with additional accolates and commendations, it would incentivise more to join. Further development in the field would follow soon."

FAL_land_doctrine_2:0 "Might of Falcor"
FAL_land_doctrine_2_desc:0 "We now stand as a great power in our region. Our forces are disciplined and well-equipped, and the number of recruits has exceeded many recruiters' quotas. Let our rivals know that Falcor is not to be trifled with, and we will defend our freedom to the last griffon. "



FAL_air_start:0 "Take to the Skies"
FAL_air_start_desc:0 "In the ages past, valiant griffons would engage each other in spectacular sky battles, where bravery and steel decided the outcome. Such duels are now only ceremonial, but the invention of the airplane could bring them back in a more modern approach. Our efforts should be placed in forming a contemporary airforce."

FAL_new_airports:0 "Construct Airstrips"
FAL_new_airports_desc:0 "The first step towards forming our airforce shall be the construction of hangars and airstrips. Suitable sites far away from urban centres, where there is no risk of civilian involvement, have been located and approved. Once they are completed, we can start the recruitment drive."

FAL_air_doctrine_start:0 "Study Aerial Warfare"
FAL_air_doctrine_start_desc:0 "It is not enough for pilots to know how to fly a plane, although it is a good start, but to also understand their role. Only with quick thinking and keen sense of strategy can they perform to their fullest potential, and our training program should reflect that."

FAL_fighters:0 "Silver Falcons"
FAL_fighters_desc:0 "Quick, nimble and agile - our airforce shall be based around utilising the most out of fighter planes. Our dated design, inherited from the fallen Empire, shall be modernised to have larger firepower and maximum operational distance. Finally, to instill a sense of patriotism, our new planes will painted in the Falcorian colours."

FAL_heavy_fighters:0 "Black Eagles"
FAL_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our existing fighters cannot be equipped with heavier weaponry without sacrificing their speed and mobility. As such, we shall adapt a bomber chassis, a twin-engined multi-place crew airplane, to instead carry arms intended to fight other bombers and fighters. This will secure our control of the skies."

FAL_air_doctrine_f:0 "Integration of the Land-Air Forces"
FAL_air_doctrine_f_desc:0 "Airplanes and their firepower should be bound to perform in tandem with our ground forces. As our nimble fighters engage the enemy's planes, the close air support will swoop in, devastating fortifications and formations. This shall be our strategy in regards to the growing importance of sky control."

FAL_cas:0 "Preying Hawks"
FAL_cas_desc:0 "Although conventional fighters are capable of assaulting ground based targets, it is a very risky and inefficient procedure that does more harm than good. As such, a modifier fighter plane that can perform dive bombing operations, directly supporting our troops in the field is required."

FAL_fighter_doctrine:0 "Optimise Battlefield Support"
FAL_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "No plan survives first contact with the enemy, but we can prepare our pilots for anything they might face. A strict regimen of flying exercises and additional courses will ensure that the flygriffs are always ready and knowledgeable."

FAL_bombers:0 "Murder of Crows"
FAL_bombers_desc:0 "A strong deterrent is needed to defend Falcor - and what better way to induce despair than a sky blotted out by a vast fleet of bombers? Focusing on producing the optimal design will give us the edge we need, should a war occur in the future."

FAL_bomber_doctrine:0 "Rethinking Our Approach"
FAL_bomber_doctrine_desc:0 "Throwing bombs on our foes might seem straightforward, but there exists a certain finesse about it. Many factors can influence the success of our missions, such as sending them exclusively at night, and the high aerial command is eager to put new strategies to the test."

FAL_naval_bombers:0 "Address the Sea Threat"
FAL_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Falcor's navy stands inadequate against its neighbours, who all can boast to own a far superiour fleet. To counter this potential threat, we shall redesign our bomber model so that it can fly longer and carry a larger payload, while remaining safe from ships' anti-aircraft defences."

FAL_bomber_doctrine2:0 "Trained Bomber Crews"
FAL_bomber_doctrine2_desc:0 "Following the success of our newly implemented bomber tactics, high command has decided to expand the training regimen to include them for all new recruits. With newest bombers at our disposal, no building, unit or ship will be able to withstand our fury."

FAL_strat_bombers:0 "Misery and Ruin"
FAL_strat_bombers_desc:0 "To effectively deprive our foe of infrastructure, supplies, shelter and industry, an advanced bomber is required. It will require a larger frame to carry more powerful engines, more space for the payload, and the ability to fly higher than other planes, bypassing enemy defences. The destruction will be on a scale previously unseen."

FAL_air_production:0 "Peace is Our Profession"
FAL_air_production_desc:0 "War is not our preference, but our place in the world demands that we need to be ready for anything. Our advancements in aerial development, combined with the enthusiasm griffons show for joining the airforce, has convinced us that further investment and expansion of our aircraft designers is worthwhile."



FAL_naval_start:0 "Rebuild the Falcorian Warfleet"
FAL_naval_start_desc:0 "Our navy is a shadow of its former self. While never equal to Wingbardy, it has been reduced to virtually nothing. This must be addressed as we cannot expect Wingbardy, or whatever other threats we will come to face, to ignore this gaping hole in our defences."

FAL_large_fleet:0 "Match the Wingbardian Navy"
FAL_large_fleet_desc:0 "Falcor's navy was once a mighty force and it can be so once again. Wingbardy's great navy is intimidating, but if we commit ourselves to an ambitious expansion project we can well create a warfleet that in time can break even them on the high seas."

FAL_small_fleet:0 "Rely on Existing Capabilities"
FAL_small_fleet_desc:0 "Ambitious flights of fancy will be our doom. While our navy is tiny, that does not need to be the handicap it seems unless we decided to slug it out on the high seas. Other, more indirect forms of naval warfare may well give Falcor a much better return on investment."

FAL_battleship:0 "The Maximilliana Class"
FAL_battleship_desc:0 "The centrepiece of naval warfare is the great warship built to go forth and take on whoever dares to cross it. As we start designing our own battleships, the name for them seems evident. Who else has been a greater heart for our nation in these last years than the then young girl who rose to lead her nation when all others had failed?"

FAL_battleship_doctrine1:0 "Naval Might"
FAL_battleship_doctrine1_desc:0 "Naval combat is no simple slugging match. Positioning, coordination and precision will carry the day and it doesn't matter how far we come, we cannot lightly deploy our heavy ships when careful planning can multiply their efficiency."

FAL_aircraft_carrier:0 "Naval Aviation"
FAL_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "War changes constantly. Where once ships were built out of wood and driven by sail and the air contested only through griffon wings, now the great powers of the world are building metal behemoths from which metal birds can take off, bringing the full force of the modern airforce wherever needed in the world."

FAL_battleship_doctrine2:0 "To Rule the Ocean"
FAL_battleship_doctrine2_desc:0 "A patient and courageous admiral, wielding his ships carefully but decisively, has the power to change the course of not just battles, but wars. As we work to master this art, we are making our admirals heroes like few ever seen before."

FAL_battle_cruiser:0 "Princesses of the Seas"
FAL_battle_cruiser_desc:0 "Battleships are very expensive to build, but their firepower is unquestionable. We have decided on a compromise between these factors in the shape of battlecruisers, ships meant to be much less expensive to build, yet with firepower and armor almost equal to the queens of the ocean."

FAL_submaries:0 "Stalking Below the Waves"
FAL_submaries_desc:0 "A ship that is built in less time to build even a destroyer, with minimal griffonpower and the ability to hide under the waves for hours and indeed days and which can strike without warning against the enemy's weakest spots. That is indeed the ships that will see us to victory."

FAL_submarine_doctrine1:0 "Strike and Dive"
FAL_submarine_doctrine1_desc:0 "We aren't going to take on Wingbardy head on, that would be insanity. Instead we are going to act patiently and cunningly, keeping our distance and striking only when we can get away with it. Call it cowardice, but Falcorians aren't wont to throw away lives in vain."

FAL_submarine_doctrine2:0 "Silent Killers"
FAL_submarine_doctrine2_desc:0 "As we master this new type of warfare our capacities will only grow. In the end, we will be able to strangle our enemies at sea, without him ever being able to deliver any of the decisive blows he might hope for."

FAL_cruisers:0 "The Little Reliables"
FAL_cruisers_desc:0 "We must build our cruisers not to be giant sluggers, but cost-effective ships that can serve in any role, no matter what we call them for. Be it on the seas, below them or above, these vessels are going to be able to deliver."

FAL_heavy_cruisers:0 "Breaking the Enemy Escorts"
FAL_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "Though our navy is light, it should not lack striking power where needed. Well escorted convoys or transports might be too much for our lighter ships to handle, but not for our heavy cruisers."

FAL_dockyards:0 "Subsidise Sudfolc Dockyards"
FAL_dockyards_desc:0 "Naval strategy is built strategy, and our capacity is pitiable. Heavy investments into Sudfolc will give us the capacity to begin producing ships in earnest."

FAL_better_landingcraft:0 "Striking Across the Seas"
FAL_better_landingcraft_desc:0 "The war needn't stop at the enemy's shores. If we have the ships for the job, we can strike even beyond them, bringing our army to bear not just over land but over sea."

FAL_aquatic_fighters:0 "Sea Knights"
FAL_aquatic_fighters_desc:0 "Attacks across waters have happened ever since the olden days, but this method too is turning into an artform. Specially trained griffons can negate the difficulties inherent in such attacks and make sure that water no longer is a shield for our foes."

########################################## Fash Path #######################################################

FAL_demand_changes:0 "Appeasers No Longer"
FAL_demand_changes_desc:0 "The sham of a vote has shown that Falcor cannot continue anymore on its present path. Gabriele d'Artiglio has the right idea how to restore Falcorian greatness, and we would be wise to side with instead of the stagnant Princess and her council of fools and cowards. Glory to Falcor!"

FAL_fash_propaganda:0 "Patriotic Propaganda"
FAL_fash_propaganda_desc:0 "Maximilliana's scheme has done more harm than good, and now Falcor is broken apart even more, if such a thing were possible. What this nation needs is a strong unifying force, one that only we can provide. Remind the people of their love for their homes, their families and their Falcor."

FAL_promote_nationalism:0 "Why Falcor Matters"
FAL_promote_nationalism_desc:0 "Falcorians do not fight for more land, they fight for what is rightfully theirs! Our people need to know our goals and ideals. Spread the word in every town square, print posters, hold more demonstrations!"

FAL_flame_revanchism:0 "Galvanise the People"
FAL_flame_revanchism_desc:0 "The crowd is fickle, d'Artiglio knows this well, but if they were told what they want to hear, we'd have them in the palm of our claw. Speak to the Falcorians of the terrible Wingbardians who would defile our nation, of the indecisive Princess who does nothing but wait, of the underequipped soldier guarding the border post alone. Incite the flames of anger within the Falcorians."

FAL_take_care_of_princess:0 "The Last Holdout"
FAL_take_care_of_princess_desc:0 "The weak Princess and her husband are all that stand between us and glory. We take no pleasure in this objective, but they need to go if we want to realise our dreams. Maximilliana was never decisive or strong willed enough to see that only tough measures seize the day. Ensure the sick Queen does not hear of this, as well."

FAL_make_schools_spread_propaganda:0 "Proper Values"
FAL_make_schools_spread_propaganda_desc:0 "d'Artiglio has many followers and adorers, but a particular number of them are employed in various schools across Falcor. It would be a trivial matter to use these connections to push subtle propaganda to our young minds."

FAL_recover_depression:0 "Mourning is Over"
FAL_recover_depression_desc:0 "Falcor has gone through some very difficult times recently, but we cannot flounder and continue despairing. We must reassure the citizens that despite everything, our goals will come to realisation. But only, and only if everygriffon pledges support to the cause."

FAL_blame_wingbardy_for_killing_princess:0 "Pin the Blame"
FAL_blame_wingbardy_for_killing_princess_desc:0 "The assassination of a Princess is no trivial matter. It was a shameful act, and we must completely conceal our involvement. It is fortunate, however, that we have very convenient targets to frame, a couple Wingbardian citizens we abducted near the border. A few forged letters and forced confessions will result in much greater public support for our plans."

FAL_revenge_plan:0 "Planning for Retaliation"
FAL_revenge_plan_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our grand endeavour, then everything must be accounted for and noted. We must make a precise estimate of our foes' forces, the general staff will prepare an invasion plan with numerous contingency options, and we shall rally the nation itself for war. Only with our full effort and might do we stand a chance."

FAL_we_need_jesus:0 "Falcor or Death"
FAL_we_need_jesus_desc:0 "Regardless of their actual opinion on the matter, we require every Falcorian to give their all! Recruitment quotas will be expanded and factory hours will be extended. No price is high enough to ensure our victory. May Arcturius give us his blessing, for our cause is just and noble."

FAL_train_falcorian_resistance:0 "Partisans and Resistance"
FAL_train_falcorian_resistance_desc:0 "[WNG.GetLeader] would have you believe that the city of Falcor has converted to Wingbardian culture, but we know better. We've heard stories of native Falcorians being treated like cattle, overlooked in favour of immigrants. We shall reach out to our contacts in Falcor and have them commence insurrections against the hated occupiers."

FAL_defenders_of_the_black_eagle:0 "Black Eagle Defenders"
FAL_defenders_of_the_black_eagle_desc:0 "Salute the flag of Falcor! Salute the proud Falcorian soldiers, who are putting their lives at risk for the ultimate sacrifice. Remind them all what we fight for, and why our cause is patriotic and righteous! Let nogriff say that Falcorians have no honour."

FAL_volunteers_from_farmers:0 "Press Farmers into Service"
FAL_volunteers_from_farmers_desc:0 "The business of war requires numbers, and our numbers are shamefully low compared to the wretched, debased Wingbardians. The conscription quotas have already passed over everygriff not employed in a crucial service, which leaves us with a painful choice to expand it over our bread baskets. However, one bad harvest will mean little once Wingbardy lies broken and ruined."

FAL_bunker_down:0 "Emergency Fortifications"
FAL_bunker_down_desc:0 "One of the causes of the previous defeat was a lack of sturdy defences along the frontline. To avoid the same scenario repeating itself, the d'Artiglio Line will be built near the border, so that we have an option for a tactical retreat should things go sour."

FAL_wingbardy_war:0 "Abrogate the Shameful Treaty"
FAL_wingbardy_war_desc:0 "The treaty of Asbolus has been the most humiliating, demeaning, disgraceful event in the entire history of Falcor itself! We shall see its terms undone as we proudly march to battle against the arrogant scum! We shall cross the Piumave, we shall enter Karthin, they have no chance against the might of Falcor! Follow d'Artiglio to war!"

FAL_reunite_falcor:0 "Our Grand Return"
FAL_reunite_falcor_desc:0 "Nearly two decades have passed, but we have arrived home. Falcor has, for the most part, remained unchanged. The only thing marring our beautiful city are the immigrants, but that can be easily resolved. For now, our primary concern is to relocate all vital industries to Falcor itself, and move the government to the old royal palace."

FAL_our_revenge:0 "Burn Karthin to the Ground"
FAL_our_revenge_desc:0 "Vengeance! The Wingbardians lie at our mercy and we have none to spare. To teach them a lesson they will never forget, Karthin will be reduced to rubble. The population will be forcibly relocated, train tracks shall be ripped, national treasures stolen, and anything of value moved back to Falcor, the true jewel of the south."

FAL_make_wingbardy_teach_falcor_way:0 "Stealing Science"
FAL_make_wingbardy_teach_falcor_way_desc:0 "Karthin contains some of the largest repositories of science in Griffonia, numerous libraries containing original manuscripts, to state of the art research facilities. It would only be appropriate that this ingenuity is added to our capable claws, where it will find much greater use."

FAL_make_falcor_great:0 "Public Works Project"
FAL_make_falcor_great_desc:0 "With an influx of new citizens, we find ourselves facing the issues of rising unemployment and poverty. Quick measures must be taken before the situation deteriorates, and our first act shall be to commence a series of large scale construction projects, primarily focused on expanding infrastructure in the reunited Falcor."

FAL_move_industry_home:0 "Appropriate Wingbardian Industry"
FAL_move_industry_home_desc:0 "Our campaign to reduce Karthin's prestige has been a great success. Now comes the final step: to transport its industrial might. Machinery shall be loaded on trains and trucks and transported back to Falcor. What can't be moved, shall be destroyed. Leave nothing of value, leave them nothing to be proud of."

FAL_force_wingbardy_to_convert_to_falcor_culture:0 "Syncretising Cultures"
FAL_force_wingbardy_to_convert_to_falcor_culture_desc:0 "This war has shown an undisputable truth - if Wingbardians were so mighty and strong as they claimed, they wouldn't have lost against a supposedly inferior nation. Indeed, by this fact it is obvious that the Falcorian culture is superiour! Our new subjects must accept this reality and adapt, or be scorned."

FAL_expand_nation:0 "Exacting Further Vengeance"
FAL_expand_nation_desc:0 "With the Wingbardian tyrants and their petty lackeys defeated, we now turn our attention to the ones who repudiated us so long ago. If they had supported us, we would have been the ones to dictate the terms in 989! We Falcorians have not forgotten this disrespect."

FAL_attack_sicameon:0 "Crossing the Arahno Mountains"
FAL_attack_sicameon_desc:0 "Much like the fabled Grover II, we shall recreate the invasion of Sicameon. In full Falcorian might shall we march across their borders and put an end to their delusions of federalism and democracy.

FAL_attack_the_cow_people_desc:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion stand in our way of assuming dominance across southern Griffonia. The feeble ponies cannot harm us, the mountain clans are but a nuisance.

FAL_princess_wins_election_desc:0 "Despite d'Artiglio's machinations, Falcor's most influential have given the monarchy one more chance.

FAL_calm_revanchists_desc:0 "The revanchists' hearts are in a good place, but their methods are crude and would only doom Falcor.

FAL_join_karth_pact_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, but we have found surprising friends in those we once called enemies.

FAL_ask_for_falcor:0 "Request the Return of Falcor"
FAL_ask_for_falcor_desc:0 "Wingbardy's new harmonist cabinet has been receptive to our overtures, surprisingly so considering our mutual past. It is easy for all to see that no one, Wingbardian or Falcorian, wants war to break out between our nations.

FAL_seek_aid_to_rebuild_desc:0 "Falcor does not have to be alone in its struggle. Many of our neighbours could be sympathetic, should our arguments be convincing enough. Most importantly, nogriff wants to see Wingbardy lording over the entire region, and this is our strongest justification."

Rushed home from her boarding school after her mother grew weak and ill, she was forced to become the acting ruler at the age of 14, with only the assistance of a noble council who often had different ideas on what was best for Falcor during the tumultuous years after 989. In spite of many difficulties, the young Princess has navigated through the circumstances and brought the nation a relative degree of stability. She has even found love, in the form of a local noble named Alberto, who now acts as Prince-Consort, although he very rarely participates in politics.\n\nBut the peace was not meant to last. Over the years, a large number of griffons, veterans and exiles from the war, have begun clamouring for retribution to what they perceived as Wingbardian tyranny. Thus they threaten the monarchy's rule, with their protests and strikes, and a large number of bystanders supports their side. Princess Maximilliana must find a way to placate the extremists while dealing with a hostile foreign presence, lest the line of Falcor extinguishes."
revenge_fucking_now_desc:0 "Former colonel in the Falcorian army, Gabriele d'Artiglio has served with distinction in the war against Wingbardy. He took part in the battle of Asbolus Forest, where he was grievously wounded by an artillery shell. Dragged away from the battlefield, he could do nothing but hear news of imminent defeat, which prolonged his recovery, as he believed Falcor was just one battle away from achieving victory. To this day, he still blames neighbouring Sicameon for not intervening in their favour, although the truth is that they were unwilling to assist a despotic monarch. In spite of everything, d'Artiglio was personally commemorated by Queen Maximilliana for his valour and bravery.\n\nConsidered unfit to continue serving in the forces due to his crippled leg, d'Artiglio turned his personal attention to the arts. He became renowned for his poetry and paintings, although art critics have noted that his works were rather heavy on misery and gloom. Over the years, he became a rallying point for Falcor's many veterans and exiles, who likewise thought to have unfinished business with Wingbardy, and organised them into a paramilitary force. d'Artiglio has a personal distaste for the Wingbardian dialect, believing it to be an unwieldy, ugly language unfit for literature. In his opinion, Falcorian should be the dominant dialect of the southern griffons instead.\n\nNow with the pacifist opposition removed, Gabriele d'Artiglio will go through any obstacle to achieve the dream of a restored Falcor, exacting swift retribution on all who have done his nation harm."
long_live_the_queen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of October, 947 in Falcor\n\n§YBiography§!: The reign of Queen Maximilliana began auspiciously, coming during a time when relations between Falcor and Wingbardy were peaceful, and close cooperation between the two nations was the status quo. Maximilliana met her eventual husband at a young age, the two becoming married shortly after her coronation in 969. She gave birth to her only child eight years later, but by that time Falcor's situation had become dire.\n\nFollowing the death of King Gumberto, Wingbardian relations with Falcor began to deteriorate, as the newly-crowned King Talonuel was focused on his nation's internal affairs. The eventual secession of Wingbardy and the chaotic collapse of the Griffonian Empire left Falcor geopolitically isolated, and the once nearly nonexistent border with Wingbardy had become a flashpoint of tension.\n\nAfter Meranclawo, war was the only option—so said her advisors—and the four year slog of the Falcorian War began. Although there were brief flashes of hope, the Falcorian army was overmatched and eventually defeated. In the face of protestations, Queen Maximilliana remained in Falcor throughout the entire course of the war, and suffered every bit of hardship along with her people. The Queen's hardships not only included shortages of food and clothing, but also the death of her husband during the city-wide plague of 988.\n\nAfter signing the Treaty of Asbolus, Maximilliana became chronically ill with a sickness doctors were unable to identify, although most griffons believed it to be a variant of the plague. After an extremely long period of rest, she has fully recovered, seemingly prompted by renewed hope for Falcor's future. The Queen has said she views the Falcorian War as a painful lesson in the value of diplomacy, and vows never to repeat the same mistake again.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Fev_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of April, 967 in Bäumedorf, south of Appengen, Barony of Angriver\n\n§YRank§!: Maggiore General\n\n§YBiography§!: Erika von Feveros was born to a minor noble family in the logging business near the Scheißwald forest. She lived a content childhood. Her father held a commission in the Angriver army as an artillery officer and one of her favorite pastimes was to listen to her father's tales of his time in the army.\n\nBut in 978 her life was turned upside down when chaos came to Angriver and Gerhart Bluhm's Republicans attempted their coup. With her having relatives in Wingbardy, her family attempted to flee the country. For almost 6 years they traveled through lands of Eyrie and Griffonstone even being caught by Blackrock Bandits for period of time before escaping by pure luck. Those harsh times spent in constant danger changed Erika's way of seeing the world and gave her a lot of knowledge despite her young age.\n\nThe journey south however, ended in Falcor in 985 with Erika and her family being caught in the offensive of the Wingbardian army. Unfortunately, in a few months from start of the war her parents were killed as many of the civilian casualties of the war. With no money, no support, and nowhere to go, Erika, using chaos in the military bureaucracy, signed up with the Falcorian army, taking part in their 987 offensive. Despite not being from Falcor, her achievements in both command and developing strategies had her receive praises from the Queen and honorary citizenship.\n\nWith her charismatic demeanor, adapt command of griffons and with experience acquired during her journey, she used her pragmatic nature to rise up the command ladder, following in her father's footsteps to command artillery in the conflict. She emphasises the tactics of attack and the concentrated use of firepower to back up the offensives of the regular soldier. Always one to have a mug of ale in claw she hasn't grown rusty over the years and remains once more as one of Falcor's primary commanders.\n\n§Y"What you truly need, is a good piece of ordnance."§! - Erika "Queen of Shells"\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

falcor.1.t:0 "Nobility Issues a Vote of No Confidence"
falcor.1.d:0 "The reign of [FAL.GetLeader] and Prince-Consort Alberto has not been without issues. Although they work tirelessly to preserve Falcor's borders, a growing number of extremists led by Gabriele d'Artiglio, an old war veteran, has obstructed the government at every opportunity and threaten our peace. Combined with high amounts of poverty, illiteracy and unemployment, many griffons in the nation - both lowborn and highborn - are believing d'Artiglio's rhetoric. This has culminated in the largest organised protest to date, which lasted for a significant part of the previous month. Matton Residence found itself under siege by the highly organised members of the Falcorian Eagles, although they did not attempt to fight the outnumbered Royal Guard.\n\nThus the high council of nobles, sensing the monarchy's weakness, have formally issued a declaration of no confidence. However, this could not go through without the vote of the full council, which also included notable captains of industry, who were known to be supporters of Maximilliana. The Princess could count on her own vote, alongside her husband's, of course, but the outcome seemed uncertain. Was this a simple power grab, or d'Artiglio's scheme? He was known to court nobles who had estates near the Wingbardian border. In the end, the result was..."
falcor.1.a:0 "Maximilliana has the majority's backing."
falcor.1.b:0 "The council of nobles does not trust the Princess."

falcor.2.t:0 "The House Divided"
falcor.2.d:0 "A saying has developed over the years, "put two Falcorians in a room and you'll get three opinions". It is not a distant truth, rather it seems that divides permeate many aspects of Falcorian society. The primary conflict concerns itself with the legacy of the Wingbardian War, and what came after it.\n\nThose who are loyal to the royal family would prefer a peaceful settlement above all else. In the absence of such, a strictly defensive war would suffice otherwise. Their arguments are based on the facts that Falcor has been greatly weakened and must focus inward in order to have a chance. This, of course, does not endear them to the nationalist faction, who view them as cowards and traitors.\n\nThe Falcorian Eagles, under the leadership of Gabriele d'Artiglio, are the primary opposition to the monarchists. Veterans of the war and exiles from the lost territory, their staunch belief in the Falcorian superiority borders on zealotry. They would gear the nation for war above all else, consequences be damned, and lead us to either death or glory.\n\nOther movements are virtually unknown, save for the Falcorian syndicates, who receive little attention due to the lack of a working class. They are seen as a foreign, Prywhenist influence who have no business in Falcor. Needless to say, if this nation is going to remain independent in the near future, it will need to resolve its fractured society."
falcor.2.a:0 "We cannot falter again."

falcor.3.t:0 "Brief History of the Falcorian War"
falcor.3.d:0 "The fates of the Falconi and Wingobardi have been intertwined for centuries now, thus it was no surprise when the nations clashed after the Griffonian Empire collapsed. We were perfectly content to stay within our historical borders, but it was the Wingbardians who shot first at Meranclawo, and we were forced to defend ourselves from this unwarranted aggression. And yet everygriffon knows how the remainder turned out - the so called "miracle" at Piumave (we suspect Wingbardians paid off unicorns for the job), the slaughter at Asbolus Forest, the enemy at the gates of Falcor.\n\nDespite all these setbacks, we have persevered and learned from our mistakes. Falcor itself may be poor and underdeveloped, but in each of our hearts is a yearning desire to return home. Even if we all disagree on the method, we all share the same goal. Falcor shall not be humiliated again! With the recent strife within Wingbardy comes an opportunity to secure our borders. The few gentle voices insist that we can make amends and peacefully resolve our woes, but the majority has no ear for that and gears for war."
falcor.3.a:0 "Falcor will be ours again, one way or the other."

falcor.4.t:0 "Ars Moriendi"
falcor.4.d:0 "The Falcorian War demonstrated that it would be foolish for us to count on any other nation to defend us against Wingbardian aggression. Our so-called allies may talk a good game, but when the time comes to meet the Wingbardians in battle, they will abandon us. We can not rely on anygriff else to save us; we will have to save ourselves.\n\nWe must dig in and prepare to fight a defensive war. This is Falcor's last stand. It is the greatest challenge we have ever faced and it comes at our darkest hour. If we are to survive, our people will have to pay a heavy price of blood. It may seem grim, but this is our only realistic path forward. Boreas help us all."

falcor.6.d:0 "We stand a crossroads, where the avarice of our neighbours threatens to fatally undermine our Queendom. We must regard the next few years as the most important period in our history. I have witnessed Falcor suffer setbacks in my lifetime, but I have never once seen reason to lose faith in the indomitable spirit of the Falcorian nation. If any malicious invaders intend to take what is ours, I am certain that our brave griffons will make them pay dearly for every inch they gain. It will take our every ounce of resolve, but this is a time for everygriff to stand together, and hold firm.\n\nWe have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long years of struggle and suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that Boreas can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival."
falcor.6.a:0 "Let this be our finest hour!"

falcor.7.t:0 "[MIT.GetNameDef] Accepts Proposal"
falcor.7.d:0 "To our great relief, the minotaurs of Asterion heard our pleas loud and clear. They too are concerned about Wingbardian expansionist, and believe that together we can hold them off. They're expecting concrete reforms and modernisation from our side before they will commit to any large scale support, however."
falcor.7.a:0 "We are safe now."

falcor.8.t:0 "[MIT.GetNameDef] Rejects Proposal"

falcor.8.a:0 "Spurned again, just like eighteen years ago."

falcor.9.t:0 "The Reunification of Falcor"
falcor.9.d_harmony:0 "The peaceful settlement of [FAL.GetLeader] and [WNG.GetLeader] had come as a surprise to many, who expected a second war to engulf southern Griffonia. Extremist elements in both nations lost their support as a result. The final conclusion to the mediation was the return of Falcor to our care, as the gracious Queen requested.\n\nThe day was marked by a joyful ceremonial parade held in the city of Falcor. The column started marching from Matton, but instead of arms and equipment, they carried flowers and flags. The event was concluded with the Wingbardian mayor of Falcor relinquishing the ceremonial keys to the city to [FAL.GetLeader].\n\nFestivities continued late into the night, with many setting aside their rivalries and hatred to have a jolly time. The next day, the King of Wingbardy announced a special postal stamp would be printed to commemorate the occasion."
falcor.9.d_neutral:0 "Many could not believe it, even fewer could suppress their tears at the sight. After nearly twenty years, the city of Falcor has been returned to us, through a show of arms. Our plan for the resurgent conflict was to prepare a defensive line and avoid the mistakes of last time. The Wingbardian invasion stalled and got bogged down, despite their superiour numbers, and eventually we counterattacked and pushed them out of our nation, followed by the retake of Falcor itself, with many native Falcorians warmly welcoming the return of their countrygriffs.\n\nThus after the war, with the peace settled and the Wingbardians pacified, the time had come for the seat of our capital restored to Falcor. The event was commemorated with a large scale military parade, showcasing the disciplined Falcorian soldiers, as well as captured enemy combatants and equipment.\n\n[FAL.GetLeader] announced a time of national healing, where rebuilding and mediation would be the focus of the government. Peace is expected to follow for the near future."
falcor.9.d_fascist:0 "Many could not believe it, even fewer could suppress their tears at the sight. After nearly twenty years, the city of Falcor has been returned to us, through fire and fury. d'Artiglio's plan hinged on the successful surrounding of the city through use of underground partisans - which turned out to be a great victory. In a matter of weeks, Wingbardian forces stationed in the city were beaten and broken, with many native Falcorians warmly welcoming the return of their countrygriffs.\n\nThus after the war, with the peace settled and the Wingbardians ruined for all times, the time had come for the seat of our capital restored to Falcor. The event was commemorated with a large scale military parade, showcasing the might of the Falcorian Eagles, as well as captured enemy combatants and equipment.\n\nWar hero Gabriele d'Artiglio, who personally led the charge into the city proper and tore down the Wingbardian flag from the city hall, has announced that he would be retiring again from active combat service, returning to manage the more tedious aspects of statesgriffship."
falcor.9.a:0 "Our people and our state are whole again."

falcor.10.t:0 "[FAL.GetNameDef] Seeks Aid and Alliance"
falcor.10.d:0 "A most curious request arrived to our foreign ministry on this day - [FAL.GetNameDef], a somewhat distant nation seeks to align with our interests. It is known to all that the griffons have been suffering ever since their war against Wingbardy ended 18 years ago, and they fear they would finish the job in the near future. We do not suffer lightly griffon imperialism, but the Falcorian motives are suspect. What makes them better than Wingbardians? They would do the same actions in their place.\n\nTheir primary argument for an alliance rests on the potential threat [WNG.GetName] would pose to us should they overrun Falcor. While we are not blind to the possibility, is it a wise idea to expand resources on a weak state? Falcor is not known for its strength of arms or multitude of factories, regardless of their ferocious fighting spirit. [MIT.GetLeader] and his cabinet will have to discuss the matter thoroughly."
falcor.10.a:0 "The Wingbardian threat must be contained."
falcor.10.b:0 "Our concerns are more pressing, and we cannot offer help."

falcor.11.t:0 "A Royal Bash"
falcor.11.d:0 "Raucous celebrations consumed the streets of Falcor today, prompted by the ceremony [FAL.GetLeader] performed in front of the Royal Palace, symbolising the full integration of Falcor back into its rightful home. The city-wide festivities ground business to a halt, not that anygriff felt like complaining. All the pent-up energy of the Falcorian people was released in a burst of unrestrained partying and festivities. All through the day there was much merriment; for one day, the anguish and loss of the past decades was forgotten, and griffons across Falcor sang the praises of [FAL.GetLeader]."
falcor.11.a:0 "Long live Falcor!"

falcor.12.t:0 "To Forgive and Forget"
falcor.12.d:0 "Falcorian envoys have arrived in Karthin bearing gifts and expressing Falcor's desire to put our rivalry behind us and make amends. In line with the policy of Queen Maximilliana, they wish to see our nations enter a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. In fact, they have even expressed an interest in joining the Karthinian Pact!\n\nIt goes without saying that a prerequisite for any serious agreement with the Falcorian Queendom would be our eventual ceding of the city of Falcor. Many Falcorians still resent us for taking the jewel of their nation, and an alliance between our nations would be fatally undermined as long as this source of resentment remained.\n\nTheir offer sounds tempting. If we work with them we could peacefully resolve the tensions between us and be rewarded with a beneficial new alliance."
falcor.12.a:0 "Let us forge a lasting friendship!"
falcor.12.b:0 "This seems suspicious..."

falcor.13.t:0 "Falcor wishes to join the Karthinian Pact"
falcor.13.d:0 "As of this morning, Falcor has formally requested to join the Karthinian Pact. This is the latest and most crucial step of the Falcorian programme to cooperate with us and heal the wounds of the past. Accepting their request would bring our two nations inextricably closer together, and show the Falcorian people that we are absolutely committed to making things right between us."
falcor.13.a:0 "We shall welcome them with open claws!"
falcor.13.b:0 "We can't trust them."

falcor.14.t:0 "The d'Artiglio Trials"
falcor.14.d:0 "Recent developments have made it painfully clear that the greatest threat to Falcor was never Wingbardy, but rather the suicidal nationalists who would have us place pride above reason. This was demonstrated dramatically when police investigators uncovered evidence linking the Eagles of Falcor to planned acts of terror throughout the country.\n\nGabriele d'Artiglio himself was implicated in the plot, which would have involved carrying out a series of false flag attacks and assassinations with the intention of ginning up nationwide anger towards Wingbardy. It seems there are no depths the Eagles are above stooping to in their misguided quest for vengeance.\n\nAfter a series of highly-publicised trails, d'Artiglio and his co-conspirators all received lengthy prison sentences. With luck, the resentment that fueled their rise will dissipate as relations with Wingbardy continue to improve."
falcor.14.a:0 "Truly shameful."

falcor.15.t:0 "Homecoming"
falcor.15.d:0 "Our great city had been returned to us: Falcor is whole again. In the end, kindness has overcome greed and hope has triumphed over fear. [WNG.GetLeader] is a griffon of honour, whom I am proud to call my friend. I know both of us want nothing more than to see our children live together in harmony, and I am proud to say that the reunification of our homeland has put us on that path.\n\nOur two nations have forged a friendship upon the ruins of our past conflict, and now we stand together on the threshold of a new era of prosperity and harmony. On this day the Falcorian people celebrate our shared covenant of peaceful coexistence and mutual defence of our Wingbardian allies.\n\n—[FAL.GetLeader]'s first Day of Concord address"
falcor.15.a:0 "Let us never again be separated."

falcor.16.t:0 "To Kill a Princess"
falcor.16.d:0 "Falcor is at an impasse. The humiliations inflicted upon us since the Treaty of Asbolus continue to mount, all the while our feckless leaders refuse to honour our veterans and stand up for our nation's pride. And so we were forced to take decisive action, and permanently eliminate the blockage.\n\nThe griffons we selected for the job were two of the most unquestionably dedicated to our cause, recommended by d'Artiglio himself. He knew them well from his time as a colonel during the war, and knew that they would not hesitate to pull the trigger when the time came.\n\nOur spies close to Princess Maximilliana informed us that she often made unscheduled visits to her sick mother in the hospital, alongside her dear husband. Our agents staked out the area nearby, and waited for an opportune moment to strike. After several days, the moment came. Under the cover of darkness, they ambushed the unsuspecting Princess and Prince and fatally shot them using Wingbardian-made pistols. By the time anygriff realised what had happened, our agents had already escaped to their designated safehouse. In the end, our plan was executed without a hitch.\n\nThe Eagles of Falcor have publicly expressed outrage over this cowardly act, and have pledged to assist police efforts to track down the perpetrators."
falcor.16.a:0 "Boreas, forgive us, it is for the good of Falcor."

falcor.17.t:0 "The Cause of Every Woe and Misery"
falcor.17.d:0 "The somber procession that was the funeral of Maximilliana and Alberto was attended by many griffons, their numbers countless and their sorrow endless. Misery made good company as many have made peace for the day, carrying flowers to the tombstones.\n\nSuch tentative peace could not last for long, for on the very next day, [FAL.GetLeader] has presented evidence of who had their claw in the murder of the royal pair. Two Wingbardians were detained after being found skulking near the Royal Palace, carrying concealed weaponry and suspicious coded letters. d'Artiglio has announced that the investigation will be swift and decisive, followed by prosecution of anygriff involved. He has not shied away from the idea of officially cutting all diplomatic presence with Wingbardy, as well."
falcor.17.a:0 "They will pay!"

falcor.18.t:0 "The Soaring Eagle"
falcor.18.d:0 "Throughout the city of Falcor, buildings were plastered with Falcorian flags and griffons were raucously celebrating Falcor's many glorious triumphs. In the heart of the city, a massive crowd had gathered to hear Gabriele d'Artiglio's grand address to the nation. It was obvious to all watching that d'Artiglio was in high spirits. Even as he limped to the podium in preparation for his speech, he seemed to have a spring in his step.\n\n"Years ago, I fought alongside Falcor's finest and witnessed first-claw our darkest hour," d'Artiglio began. "In the aftermath, I saw those same griffons betrayed by our weak-willed leaders. I saw our Princess slain in an act of despicable skullduggery. But we did not succumb to despair: we steeled our resolve and regained our pride!" Cheers and shouts of approval came from the crowd.\n\n"This very city was estranged from us, but we fought to make our nation whole. We avenged every lost soul and every shattered family." d'Artiglio raised his claw emphatically. "Falcor has been vindicated, and we have taken our rightful place in the world. This vindication saw us victorious over our mortal rival: Wingbardy." Laughs and jeers came from the crowd, but d'Artiglio quieted them.\n\n"I tell you that the time has come to put that rivalry behind us. No longer will Falcorian and Wingbardian eye one another with suspicion." d'Artiglio spread his claws out wide. "From this day forward, we shall be one people, working together to build one future!" The crowd erupted into lasting applause."
falcor.18.a:0 "To a hundred years of peace!"

falcor.19.t:0 "Queen Maximilliana Passes Away"
falcor.19.d:0 "Today is a sad day, as news comes to us that this morning Queen Maximilliana passed away peacefully, finally succumbing to the sickness that left her confined to the hospital and bedridden. We all mourn the loss of a great leader whose courage and determination were indispensable to our nation's survival. We resolve to always honour her legacy by ensuring that [FAL.GetNameDef] never falls, no matter what challenges we face."
falcor.19.a:0 "The queen is dead, long live the queen!"

falcor.20.t:0 "Positive Responses From Wingbardy"
falcor.20.d:0 "Good news out of Karthin! Our envoys were graciously received by state officials upon their arrival in the city and [WNG.GetNameDef] seems receptive to our overtures. [WNG.GetLeader] met with our representatives personally and has publicly stated that he is committed to peacefully resolving the tensions between our nations. We still have a long way to go until things are fully righted between us, but these are undeniably encouraging signs."
falcor.20.a:0 "The first step towards friendship."

falcor.21.t:0 "[WNG.GetNameDef] Humiliates Our Envoys"
falcor.21.d:0 "We thought [WNG.GetLeader] was a reasonable griffon, but apparently we misjudged him. Our envoys got a chilly reception from state officials in Karthin, and rather than hear us out personally, he sent one of his minions to stonewall our representatives. These signs are highly discouraging, it seems [WNG.GetNameDef] has no interest in peaceful reconciliation."
falcor.21.a:0 "This insult cannot be tolerated!"

falcor.22.t:0 "A Husband's Reassurance"
falcor.22.d:0 "[FAL.GetLeader] did not always cherish the broad responsibilities she was given. She was more than happy to act in her mother's stead, and she loved Falcor like every other countrygriff, but sometimes the burden became overbearing. Even the most wisest griffs would bemoan to be in Falcor's situation. But Maximilliana did not intend to give up. As the Princess paced in her study, her brooding was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n"You may enter."\nIt was none other than Alberto, her beloved husband. On many days, Maximilliana yearned for nothing more than his comforting embrace, after a long day in court. It is what gave her the strength to persevere.\n"Cuore mio, you have been in your chambers all day. Is something giving you grief?", he asked, removing his feathered hat. She always thought it looked ridiculous, but only Alberto made it look good.\n"It is nothing you should worry about. Merely the future of our nation."\n"That is something we should both be concerned about, dearest."\nHe was correct, but the Princess hated appearing weak. For the long years of her rule, she had to earn respect, one difficult decision at a time.\n"I am merely contemplating if our choices are good for Falcor, Alberto. We all wish to be grand again, yes... but the road is winding and uncertain. I can't let everygriff down." Maximilliana looked outside the window, to the many griffs milling outside on the streets of Matton. For now, they are happy and safe. How long, though?\nThe Prince-Consort seemed impervious to her miasmic doubt, slowly embracing his beloved. "If I know one thing, Maximilliana, it's that you never let anything stand in your way. Anything the fates threw at you, you stood your ground and came out on top. I know that the griffon I love will make the best choice."\nThe Princess had nothing to say except a few whimpers. Truly, she had the best spouse anygriff could ask for."

falcor.23.t:0 "Completion of the Shrine Of Victories Of The Falcorians"
falcor.23.d:0 "After months of hard labour, the Shrine of Victories of the Falcorians was finally complete. It was set into a hillside near the city of Falcor, providing an excellent view of the glorious city. While it was smaller than the destroyed Altar of the Fatherland, it was far more aesthetically pleasing and artistically designed. There were tall towers, imposing archways, grand stairways and elaborate halls. It was truly a wonder to behold, and Gabriele d'Artiglio was already proud to call it home. Of course, any Falcorian citizen could feel free to come and visit the site and witness the wondrous monuments to Falcorian culture with their own eyes.\n\nWhen Gabriele entered and looked around the decorated rooms, he sighed happily, and finally felt at peace. The echoes of artillery shells went quiet in his mind. Now he truly felt like his work was finished."
falcor.23.a:0 "At last, a wrong has been righted."

falcor.24.t:0 "The Destruction of the Altar"
falcor.24.d:0 "The so-called Altar of the Fatherland stood before Gabriele d'Artiglio like a grisly monument to decadence, desecrating the site of an ancient Karthinian temple of Arcturius. He sneered as he looked at it for the last time, before turning away from it.\n\nEnormous explosions rocked the structure as his soldiers detonated carefully positioned charges. Marble pillars were torn asunder, and as they collapsed, the roof came down with them. Walls crumbled and elaborate reliefs cracked and shattered. Carefully built mosaics were buried beneath a massive pile of rubble. A grey cloud of dust quickly covered the devastation, as if hiding it from shame.\n\nGabriele d'Artiglio smiled as he looked at the shocked faces of Wingbardians who were spectating the demolition. Revenge was a dish best served cold. Yet this wasn't enough of a humiliation. He'd go a step further, and build something far superior near Falcor..."
falcor.24.a:0 "Nothing of value was lost."

falcor_news.1.t:0 "Karthin Devastated After Recent War"
falcor_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Since the successful conclusion of [FAL.GetLeader]'s crusade to avenge his country's defeat in the First Falcorian War, the Falcorian occupation of Wingbardy has taken a brutal turn. After so many years spent stewing over their past disgrace, it did not take long for elation at restoring Falcor to morph into an all-consuming need to exact revenge on the Wingbardians.\n\nThis revenge culminated in the large-scale, systematic burning and pillaging of Karthin. Falcorian soldiers went house-to-house looting valuables, as well as inflicting heavy damage to the city's infrastructure. Precise casualties are not known at the moment, but they are estimated to be in the thousands."
falcor_news.1.a:0 "Ours is the fury!"

Representatives from both sides claim this new accord paves the way for a new era of peace and prosperity in southwest Griffonia.\n\n[WNG.GetLeader] and [FAL.GetLeader] cemented the friendship between their nations during a grand summit in Karthin. As part of their agreement, [FAL.GetNameDef] has regained control of the city of Falcor, reuniting their once fractured nation."
falcor_news.2.a:0 "Peace has prevailed."
falcor_news.2.b:0 "Cheers to our new friends!"

He is known for his baking skills, which he uses to provide food for the less fortunate griffons, doing his best to prevent starvation among the destitute. However, Alberto participates very rarely in the ongoings of the Falcorian politics, for he is not interested in them and wants nothing to do with the extremists."

FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_in_freefall:0 "Total Freefall"
FEA_in_freefall_desc:0 "The situation is rapidly deteriorating, as constant warfare has scorched the continent of Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it faith in any and all financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremists both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PVdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."
FEA_bank_runs1:0 "Bank Runs"
FEA_bank_runs1_desc:0 "Decreased confidence in the economy leads to distrust of every economic institution, and this distrust manifests in total panic. Banks are lending at unprecedented and predatory rates, investments are falling through across the board, and if this wasn't frightening enough, the lack of confidence in these institutions has led to people withdrawing their savings en masse. Given that banks use their clients' money for investments and loans, which are then falling through, the money simply is not there to take out, which drastically worsens the problem. This is a horrific cycle that must end very soon or the entire country may come down around us!"

### National Focuses ###
FEA_its_over:0 "It's Over"
FEA_its_over_desc:0 "It has never been more over for Feathisia than it is right now. Everything that could of gone wrong, has gone wrong, and Feathisia's political and economic string of misfortunes would be funny if it wasn't tearing the fabric of our society apart. Parliament has locked itself out of compromise, and the crisis worsens by the day. The Duke must intervene, and fast!"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions:0 "Prevent Bank Repossessions"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions_desc:0 "In addition to falling wages, Griffons have been threatened with the loss of their homes, their farms, and their livelihoods. The banks, in an effort to make good on their debts, resolved to take what little our citizens have left. If this happens, there will be no hope of salvaging the situation!"
FEA_trade_union_visit:0 "Visit The Trade Unions"
FEA_trade_union_visit_desc:0 "In times of crisis, leaders usually meet those with influence for solutions to the current issues. Duke Gerlach has instead opted to meet with the workers whose lives have been affected the most by those with influence. Moreover, he refuses to act unless the voice of the worker is heard."
FEA_price_controls:0 "Institute Price Controls"
FEA_price_controls_desc:0 "In these difficult times, the price of staple goods has soared well beyond the reach of the common griff. These prices cannot stand. Duke Gerlach has passed a law dictating strict price controls for these goods so that no griffon goes hungry or cold."
FEA_investment_gamble:0 "The Investment Gamble"
FEA_investment_gamble_desc:0 "Feathisia won't survive without an injection of wealth, and it doesn't need to rely on private groups to get it. Duke Gerlach has taken advantage of his reputation to offer mutually beneficial investment opportunities to an assortment of nations."
FEA_tax_corporations:0 "Hike Corporate Taxes"
FEA_tax_corporations_desc:0 "One of the standing truths of our economy, precluding the current disaster, is the concentration of wealth into the claws of the few. Duke Gerlach has already demanded higher taxation of their wealth in this time of crisis."
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers:0 "Crack Down On Smugglers"
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers_desc:0 "With the breakdown in Feathisia's merchant class, bandits have taken to seizing goods and selling them back at exorbitant rates. Regiments of the Feathisian Army have been deployed to shut down this immoral enterprise."
FEA_cut_federal_salaries:0 "Cut Federal Salaries"
FEA_cut_federal_salaries_desc:0 "The representatives and administrative workers of the government are living well above the average Griffon. In order to balance the budget, this gap must be closed, and their salaries cut. Whether this reduction in salary is more to balance the budget, or a act of principle by the Duke, is up to interpretation."
FEA_save_the_banks:0 "Save The Banks"
FEA_save_the_banks_desc:0 "As though Feathisia did not have enough problems, there are frequent runs on the banks which worsen our situation even further. This, in addition to out of control lending and the loss of investments by the banks, means that our money supply is quickly evaporating. If this situation is to be mended, then all deposits must be ensured and all losses covered."
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes:0 "Moratorium On Estate Taxes"
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes_desc:0 "If this crisis is to be resolved, it will take the effort of Griffons from all walks of life. Favors and kind words to the Nobility will soothe their worries, and gain their backing in our other political actions. A temporary stay on estate taxes will accomplish just this. Besides, the estates aren't producing much value in these trying times anyways."
FEA_eight_hour_workday:0 "The Eight Hour Workday"
FEA_eight_hour_workday_desc:0 "The Duke believes we are not dealing with an economic, or a political crisis, but a societal one. The only way to prevent the breakdown of Feathisia is to offer confidence in the hearts of the people, and allow them to live their lives. The Eight hour workday limit is a good start to affording more time to the personal lives of the people, and healing the divides of our Duchy."
FEA_not_so_different:0 "Not So Different"
FEA_not_so_different_desc:0 "Moldernik, the leader of the FNV, has proven to be quite more open to cooperation than most in the LDP first believed. Prime Minister Talonsley and Moldernik, at the Duke's request, have discussed common goals of both parties, like increased veteran benefits. Such legislation, no matter how minor, can ease tensions between the parties."
FEA_bank_nationalisation:0 "Nationalize The Banks"
FEA_bank_nationalisation_desc:0 "The simple answer to our banking woes is a direct nationalisation of the financial institutions of Feathisia. Bringing credit under federal control has effectively already been accomplished, and would bring much needed faith in the banks."
FEA_bank_regulation:0 "The Kogchel-Moldernik Act"
FEA_bank_regulation_desc:0 "A proposal from the unlikeliest of duos, the leaders of both the PvDA and the FNV have offered a joint-bill to Gerlach to separate investment banking, dealing with corporations and stocks, from commercial banking, which offers services to individuals. Such a proposal is seen as a middle ground to preserve investment, and offer much needed regulation."
FEA_a_square_deal:0 "A Square Deal"
FEA_a_square_deal_desc:0 "Gerlach has met with workers and employers alike to serve as a mediator of their issues, and has successfully secured concessions for both parties involved! The working griff enjoys higher wages and increased benefits, and the employers can utilize a returning supply of labor to their workplaces!"
FEA_tempering_extremists:0 "Tempering Extremists"
FEA_tempering_extremists_desc:0 "Anton Moldernik and Gerben Kogchel may be the leaders of opposite ideologies, but a strange show of mutual respect has risen between the two throughout the crisis. Collaborating to present a manner of ideas, Gerlach has agreed to work with them... in exchange for their help in the suppression of their more unsavory political allies."
FEA_we_are_back:0 "We're So Back"
FEA_we_are_back_desc:0 "The Duke's active role in solving this crisis, as well as parliament's full collaboration, has elevated him from a beloved monarch into a national hero. With a stable economy and increasing optimism from the people, it's like we never left."
FEA_rallying_moderates:0 "Rallying Moderates"
FEA_rallying_moderates_desc:0 "Members of the LDP and FHP have had their faith tested throughout the crisis, but with the confidence and eagerness to work with the moderate parties, their numbers have seen a resurgence!"
FEA_fireside_chat:0 "A Fireside Chat"
FEA_fireside_chat_desc:0 "With a year passing since Gerlach's first action to solve the crisis, Feathisia has been brought back from the brink of collapse. Believing that the crisis was caused by lingering doubts that go deeper than strictly economics, the Duke has scheduled a nation-wide radio address directly to the citizens of the Duchy, to address their fears, their questions, and their hopes."

### Pre-Federalization Focus Tree ###
FEA_grand_estate_party:0 "Grand Estate Party"
FEA_grand_estate_party_desc:0 "Today the twin duchies of the Feathisia and Strawberry have taken a gallant step forward together in unity just as its two leaders have in matrimony! While there is still work to be done finalizing the terms of unification and integration, this is tomorrow's task. Tonight, the whole region celebrates the union of lands and leaders!"
FEA_twelve_days_in_bronzekreuz:0 "Twelve Days In Bronzekreuz"
FEA_twelve_days_in_bronzekreuz_desc:0 "Bronzehill has remained a fiercely loyal subject of the Empire since the days of Grover II, but the tides are changing both inside the Bronze Mountains and in the Herzland as a whole. If we are to minimize the bloodshed in unifying the region under one banner, we must convince the Diamond Dogs of our legitimacy and commitment to peace and stability!"
FEA_approach_the_peasant_democracy:0 "Approach The Peasant Democracy"
FEA_approach_the_peasant_democracy_desc:0 "One of the most resilient and shining examples of democracy in the Herzland comes from the Peasant Democracy in Greifenmarschen, and we see no reason why a vote cannot be held in both of our lands to unify without a drop of blood being spilled!"
FEA_shake_claws_with_romau:0 "Shake Claws With Romau"
FEA_shake_claws_with_romau_desc:0 "Romau has always enjoyed a great deal of autonomy in the Empire, but its history is one of instability, codependence, and stagnation. While the thought of independence is great on paper, the reality is that integration without war would be best for both our sake and the sake of the Herzland overall."
FEA_appeal_to_angriver:0 "Appeal To Angriver"
FEA_appeal_to_angriver_desc:0 "The Barony of Angriver is a rare case of a nation where history has stood completely still, and while it somehow marches on, it does so on borrowed time. We must appeal to its people and its leadership for unification before it's too late."
FEA_the_greenback_convention:0 "The Greenback Convention"
FEA_the_greenback_convention_desc:0 "As though it were a mirror image of the Empire, Yale is a nation in decline and its leadership struggles to provide meaningful answers to or progress on any of their most glaring questions. However, all of these issues can be solved through direct integration with our lands, and it wouldn't cost them a single bullet. Thus, a convention must be held to quickly unify our territories!"
FEA_restore_the_order_in_katerin:0 "Restore The Order In Katerin"
FEA_restore_the_order_in_katerin_desc:0 "One of the most desolate, unstable, and hopeless regions of the Herzland is the sorry state of Katerin, and its people deserve far better. A letter has been dispatched with demands for immediate annexation for the good of the region, for the good of its people, and the good of the Herzland as a whole."

FEA_federalization_of_the_reichspakt:0 "Federalization Of The Reichspakt"
FEA_federalization_of_the_reichspakt_desc:0 "The Herzland is finally back in one piece after so many years of turmoil, but even still, it is far from being united. As of now, we have many overlapping governments, economies, and legal codes functioning at the same time, and this is on top of cultural dissonance across the region. They must be brought under a single banner, the Empire must be federalised!"

### Harmonist/Centrist Gerlach Focus Tree ###

To this end, every worker in every industry will be allowed to join a union and make his voice heard without threat of retaliation!"
FEA_office_of_public_integrity:0 "Office of Public Integrity"
FEA_office_of_public_integrity_desc:0 "It stands as no surprise that the years of decline and conflict in the Empire have created a hotbed for corruption among its officials, which only further adds to the problem. We've found limited success in our efforts to uproot this issue so far, so we must double down and create a public institution charged exclusively with rooting out corruption!"
FEA_fruits_of_our_labor:0 "Fruits of our Labor"
FEA_fruits_of_our_labor_desc:0 "What good is unity in the Herzland if we simply ignore the very states that make us whole? From the classrooms of Yale to the fields of Greifenmarschen, from the forests of Angriver to the marshes of Feathisia, we must cultivate the rich potential of the region!"
FEA_bail_out_noble_industries:0 "Bail Out Noble Industries"

FEA_small_in_number:0 "Small In Number..."
FEA_small_in_number_desc:0 "It's true that our air force is very small compared to the rest of our neighbors, but that isn't necessarily an disadvantage. A small force means a heightened need to preserve that force by way of training the pilots to fly and engage cautiously, the plane's builders to put an emphasis on safety and longevity, and our officers to utilize our pilots accordingly!"

FEA_spirit_in_the_sky_desc:0 "The shill whistle of a bomb falling from the bays of an aircraft down to the earth is perhaps one of the most frightening things one can hear, but hearing it at night or with your guard down is perhaps the only thing more terrifying.

  FEA_progressive_income_tax_desc:0 "Until now, the tax rates of the population have been the same across the board, but it's becoming increasingly clear that this is an outdated model. The poor have less to pay, and tend to spend more money, while the wealthy have much more to pay and tend to save their money. It follows then that the more money one has, the more taxes they should pay!"
  FEA_consistant_public_works:0 "Consistent Public Works"
  FEA_consistant_public_works_desc:0 "Two problems have been plaguing the nation that have been somewhat difficult to mend: A lack of public buildings and infrastructure, and considerable unemployment. But, if we hire on these unemployed workers to build these projects, we can provide them with a valuable job, skills, and income while also meeting our construction needs!"
  FEA_fair_market:0 "Fair Market"
  FEA_fair_market_desc:0 "One of the most fatal errors of the free market is the callous disregard for its failures, which it blames on individuals rather than assume responsibility. This is not the case in the Herzland, as we've created a market that is as free as the people, while managing to safeguard any of its shortcomings and ensure its fairness!"

  FEA_economic_nation_building:0 "Economic Nation Building"
  FEA_economic_nation_building_desc:0 "If the nation is to be strong, then it must have an economy to accommodate that strength! The direction of how exactly to go about this are up for debate among the FNV, but the main proposals are thus: the Agrarian Approach or Syndicalist Approach."
  FEA_class_synchronization:0 "Class Synchronization"
  FEA_class_synchronization_desc:0 "The inequality between the classes is not something to be ignored until the schism boils over into hostility, as nobles desire, nor is it something to be fused together the nation is one impoverished class as socialists desire. No, the inequality of the hierarchies must be balanced and made to serve the interest and stability of the state."
  FEA_pay_off_family_mortgages:0 "Pay Off Family Mortgages"
  FEA_pay_off_family_mortgages_desc:0 "Among the bills that most families have to pay to keep their heads above water, the mortgage bill is the most dreaded and expensive of them all. The nobles have their titles, and the wealthy have their estates, but the working classes only have their homes to pass down, and we shall grant them this ability by allowing the state to assume and pay off that debt!"
  FEA_revised_arbeidsrecht:0 "Revised Arbeidsrecht"
  FEA_revised_arbeidsrecht_desc:0 "The National People's Constitution ensures the rights to every individual throughout the nation, and Parliament ensures that their given regions have an important say, but this kind of protection does not extend to their workplace. The time has arrived to correct this error!"
  FEA_proportional_military_sector:0 "Proportional Military Sector"
  FEA_proportional_military_sector_desc:0 "For all the growth to civilian industry that has been accomplished, we've not put the same kind of attention to our military industrial sector. The strength of our nation depends not just on our prosperity, but our ability to defend it, therefore, every success in the domestic sphere must be matched in the military sphere!"
  FEA_the_destiny_of_all_creatures:0 "The Destiny Of All Creatures"
  FEA_the_destiny_of_all_creatures_desc:0 "All creatures in the Empire, from ponies to changelings, diamond dogs to griffons, and everything in between enjoy a newfound sense of pride, prosperity, liberty, and stability and this has always been the goal of the FNV. The backward cries of bigotry fall on deaf ears today and grow quieter each day still. We are fascism for the many, not the few."
  FEA_nationaal_welzijn:0 "Nationaal Welzijn"
  FEA_nationaal_welzijn_desc:0 "Despite our best intentions and widespread success, there are still those among our populace that are needy, and we must not turn up our noses and balk or tell them their poverty is their own fault. We must act! It's a failure of the state to provide for their wellbeing, and it stands that the state should correct this failure posthaste!"
  FEA_agricultural_mobilization:0 "Agricultural Mobilization"
  FEA_agricultural_mobilization_desc:0 "The farmlands of our nation are rich and fertile, but they're still being cultivated with the tools of our grandfathers rather than the tools of modernity. Further, the connection between the people and their homeland are becoming increasingly distant with the trend of urbanization, and we must set to remedy both quickly and decisively!"
  FEA_open_the_green_steel_mills:0 "Open The Green Steel Mills"
  FEA_open_the_green_steel_mills_desc:0 "Steel is the lifeblood of the Empire, but its production causes wanton waste and pollution. Strict standards must be enacted both to refine the quality of steel and its process while also protecting our sacred and historic homeland!"
  FEA_knownledge_is_power:0 "Knowlegde Is Power"
  FEA_knownledge_is_power_desc:0 "The true strength of the nation doesn't come from the barrel of a gun, but from the passion in their minds and hearts. Certainly, serving the country in uniform is a heroic act, but it is not the only way to contribute. Scientists make the country just as great as the soldier, and we'd do right to foster this attitude among the public!"
  FEA_reward_model_citizenship:0 "Reward Model Citizenship"
  FEA_reward_model_citizenship_desc:0 "Large families, military service, exemplarary performance at work, and a surplus of pride in one's country. These are only some of the many qualities we'd like to bring out of the people and this can be accomplished naturally through a simple, but ingenious system of recognition and reward for exhibiting those most honorable qualities!"
  FEA_service_over_self:0 "Service Over Self"
  FEA_service_over_self_desc:0 "It's a noble mindset to put the wellbeing and security of others over oneself, but it is a great triumph of the country if nearly every citizen embodies it as our nation does! As the sun rises over the Empire, the factory worker and the noble baron, the restaurant chef and the entrepreneur, all wake up with service of the nation over service of self."
  FEA_eco_fascism:0 "Eco-Fascism"
  FEA_eco_fascism_desc:0 "The wellbeing of the land is just as vital as the wellbeing of its people, and as such we shall not sell our homeland to the highest bidder, but do everything in our power to protect its welfare!"

  FEA_strict_wildlife_protectionism_desc:0 "What good is preserving the land if we allow overzealous hunters, ruthless poachers, and careless corporations to kill off the wildlife that inhabit it? The creatures of the wilds are just as deserving of explicit protection as the land is, and we will not allow either to perish!"
  FEA_harness_magical_biology:0 "Harness Magical Biology"
  FEA_harness_magical_biology_desc:0 "Every part of the country and the ocean teems with life that is just as infused with magic as we are, and some of these creatures can be the key to breakthrough innovations like medicine or military equipment. While we cannot harvest these creatures like we would a field of grain, we can certainly harness their quirks for our benefit harmlessly!"
  FEA_utilize_marshland:0 "Utilize Marshland"
  FEA_utilize_marshland_desc:0 "The marshlands of Feathisia are paradoxically the most full of potential and the most underutilized land in the region. We'd do well to cultivate them to grow rice, carrots, and even cranberries so that they may no longer sit dormant!"
  FEA_introduce_pollution_controls:0 "Introduce Pollution Controls"
  FEA_introduce_pollution_controls_desc:0 "There exist few insults to the majesty of our homeland than willfully destroying it in search of profits or higher production. But, pollution is not something that can be completely avoided, so we must limit pollution as much as possible, and find ways to clean up contaminants wherever they appear."
  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights:0 "Restrict Drilling Rights"
  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights_desc:0 "Puncturing holes in the earth to drain it of its oil should be just as insulting as puncturing the flesh and draining its blood! There are other ways to produce oil that don't involve the mass piercing of the beautiful nation, and we must incentivize them and limit all others!"
  FEA_ban_unsustainable_farming:0 "Ban Unsustainable Farming"
  FEA_ban_unsustainable_farming_desc:0 "The way crops are grown can sometimes tarnish otherwise fertile farmland due to unsustainable practices, and the same is true for overgrazing with livestock. Thus, a crackdown must be initiated to prevent the wanton destruction of the beautiful homelands!"
  FEA_limit_meat_consumption:0 "Limit Meat Consumption"
  FEA_limit_meat_consumption_desc:0 "Meats like fish or pork are just as much a staple food as grains or vegetables are, but we cannot let the production and consumption of meat run away from us. Ranching and fishing, however valuable and necessary, are the legal mass-murder of animals, and this must be reined in if we are to live fully in admiration of our home."
  FEA_nationalize_plantations:0 "Nationalize Plantations"
  FEA_nationalize_plantations_desc:0 "It's often said that an army marches on its stomach, but this is not the whole truth. In reality, the entire nation marches forward on its stomach, and failure to feed the people will be the undoing of even the mightiest state! It stands to reason that the state should be in control of all food production so that the people may never go hungry again!"
  FEA_one_with_nature:0 "One With Nature"
  FEA_one_with_nature_desc:0 "The wind blows through the trees like breath comes through the lungs, and just as the waters flow in the rivers and the oceans so too does the blood of our people flow in their veins. It was not easy work to unify the welfare of people and their homeland, but we have fully preserved and enhanced both!"
  FEA_national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
  FEA_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "The economy is too vital to the security of the nation, and too essential to the wellbeing of the people to ever entrust it to the private sector. Furthermore, the gain of the nation ought to strengthen the nation, not fill the treasuries of the already wealthy. Thus, the state can control sections of the economy whilst retaining private business."
  FEA_dictate_prices:0 "Dictate Prices"
  FEA_dictate_prices_desc:0 "We do not agree with the PvdA on many things, but price controls are an exception to this general rule. If commodities are essential for the people to live, then they shall never be priced out of their means. However, this may also lead to market forces deciding to never produce these goods, which we must prevent through subsidy or through state purchase!"
  FEA_economic_vitalism:0 "Economic Vitalism"
  FEA_economic_vitalism_desc:0 "The people are full of a yearning for action and productivity, and this goes with the goals of the nation like a claw into a glove. If we are to take some control of the economy, it stands that we must then give its workers some direction by way of production goals so that we may put this economic vitality to good use!"
  FEA_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
  FEA_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Steel mills, oil fields, plantations, dockyards, fisheries and firearm factories are essential to the wellbeing and funding of the state. We are not barbarians who simply seize the property we want under a false claim of serving the people, but fervent believers in private enterprise, thus, we shall purchase and run these industries for a fair price!"
  FEA_absorb_smaller_businesses:0 "Absorb Smaller Businesses"
  FEA_absorb_smaller_businesses_desc:0 "If we are to control the vital points of our nation's economy, then it stands to reason that we shouldn't have to compete with clearly less-equipped, less refined, and less capable businesses, as doing so would be needless. These smaller businesses must be merged into the larger state-ran apparatus for the good of all, with compensation of course!"
  FEA_form_the_state_syndicates:0 "Form The State Syndicates"
  FEA_form_the_state_syndicates_desc:0 "While the state runs most of the vital industries, this doesn't mean that their management is unified or streamlined. To accomplish this we'd need to split the different sectors of the economy into their own syndicate with their own state-management in order to best consolidate production!"
  FEA_werkgevers_vereniging:0 "Werkgevers Vereniging"
  FEA_werkgevers_vereniging_desc:0 "Why is it that only the lowest of workers get to form unions to dictate their demands, rob the employers of their due profits, and bring the entire economy screaming to a halt, while the employers are simply left defenseless? This is backwards! The employers must have a voice just as the workers do, and the state ought to be their mediator!"
  FEA_create_the_staatsvaksbond:0 "Create The Staatsvakbond"
  FEA_create_the_staatsvaksbond_desc:0 "It stands to reason that if the employers have their own association, and if the state is to mediate between them and the workers, that the workers themselves should be apart of a united union to make their demands heard. The state will stand between the two as an objective and fair arbiter for labor!"
  FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons:0 "Form Arbeidsbataljons"
  FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons_desc:0 "For as many workers toiling away in the factories and workshops across the country, few will leave the cities and towns where they live lest they leave their families behind. But the work is still desperately needed. So, just as a soldier is conscripted when he's needed most, so too will workers be drafted to work these areas!"
  FEA_splendid_tripartism:0 "Splendid Tripartism"
  FEA_splendid_tripartism_desc:0 "The state, the economy, and the people are all one collaborative and energetic union, and the interests of one are the interests of all! We have turned the economy away from a disorderly entity spreading aimlessly in all directions into a cohesive and vigorous machine that acts with the best interests of the people and the state in mind!"

  FEA_betoverde_landbouw_desc:0 "A curious and ingenious breakthrough has been made at a farming co-op in Klauwermack through the help of a farmer named Scarlet Star: Enchanted agriculture. Fertilizer that provides the exact nutrients needed to grow, seeds that always germinate and grow faster, yield more, and taste better while also being impervious to disease and pests, are just some of this enchantment's power!"
  FEA_class_collaboration:0 "Class Collaboration"
  FEA_class_collaboration_desc:0 "Class warfare, the eternal struggle between those with and those without, is not absolute. The Empire is inseparable from its traditions of Nobility. These Lords and Ladies, though some enemies of the people, mostly comprise of those such as Gerlach and Gabriela. These Nobles, their estates, provide us with the political power and legitimacy necessary to achieve Socialism, and are thus our comrades."
  FEA_universal_union_membership:0 "Universal Union Membership"
  FEA_universal_union_membership_desc:0 "Forged in the bonds of labor, unions are the most powerful tools in the worker's arsenal.

  FEA_revolutionary_privileges:0 "Revolutionary Privileges"
  FEA_revolutionary_privileges_desc:0 "The privileges the nobility have enjoyed before provided the governments of old with a sense of legitimacy recognized by the people, and enough political and financial capital to make great things happen.

  FEA_transformation_of_nature:0 "Transformation Of Nature"
  FEA_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Vast ecosystems decorate our Empire, and no force of Economy can be allowed to harm it.

  FEA_eradicate_parallel_development:0 "Eradicate Parallel Development"
  FEA_eradicate_parallel_development_desc:0 "Many companies have the wasteful habit of developing the same innovation, but spending their own funds with their own crews to accomplish it. In other words, each company will spend vast amounts of money and time to create the same thing, and we must implement a system for companies to share information to both save money and better innovate!"
  FEA_harness_magic_biology:0 "Harness Magical Biology"
  FEA_harness_magic_biology_desc:0 "That which we refer to as magic is something immaterial. Beyond the constraints of science, it operates beyond time and space.

FEA_execute_rozenkampfists_desc:0 "Among the most arrogant, incendiary, and incoherent voices in the now disbanded Parliament was Rozenkamp, and as such he was the first to die. This has made him a martyr, and his followers have gained considerable ground and legitimacy as a result, but it's all for naught. Every last one will be rounded up and shot to avoid further agitation."

FEA_clamp_down_on_unions_desc:0 "Feathisia's darkest hour has arrived, and instead of answering the call and laboring on the production front to improve the economic situation, the unions across the country have decided that now was the time for a general strike.

FEA_arrest_harmonists:0 "Arrest Harmonists"
FEA_arrest_harmonists_desc:0 "One of the most useless things we could have right now is pacifists and dissident protestors, and that's exactly what LDP members have mutated themselves into.

FEA_absorb_the_bronze_sentinels:0 "Absorb The Bronze Sentinels"
FEA_absorb_the_bronze_sentinels_desc:0 "Among the most fanatical voices in the FNV was a bad-tempered griffon named Godfried Heeren and his band of Bronze Sentinels.

FEA_jail_disloyal_officers:0 "Jail Disloyal Officers"
FEA_jail_disloyal_officers_desc:0 "The recent necessary actions taken by Duke Gerlach have sparked outrage and condemnation across the country, especially in the officer corps of the military.

FEA_in_defense_of_autocracy_desc:0 "It appears that our most recent and necessary actions have drawn animosity from nearly every pampered member of society, from the furthest left to the furthest right.

If one and their family are given better housing, higher quality medical care, and admitted into better schools for being in the party, then membership will become irresistible and their loyalty obtained!"
 FEA_venerate_the_veterans:0 "Venerate the Veterans"
 FEA_venerate_the_veterans_desc:0 "Soldiers are the sturdy bedrock of all societies, and especially our glorious People's State. Without them, there can be no foundation on which to build society, no prosperity to be shared, and no peace. It's high time that a new culture of veneration for our armed forces be cultivated so that no soldier goes without his due appreciation!"
 FEA_raise_the_bar:0 "Raise the Bar"
 FEA_raise_the_bar_desc:0 "What passed for acceptable standards during the civil war was laughable, and either side had to conscript both the schoolhouse and the retirees to fill their ranks. But that desperate time is over, and the future of the army isn't one of children and geriatrics, but hardened, elite soldiers, so standards must come up!"
 FEA_experiment_with_submachine_guns:0 "Experiment with Submachine Guns"
 FEA_experiment_with_submachine_guns_desc:0 "The progression of weaponry employed by the army has changed drastically over the years, and with every advancement, the face of warfare changed. The next stage of firearm evolution has arrived in the form of fully-automatic small arms that will bring our army further into the future!"
 FEA_paint_it_black:0 "Rolling Thunder"
 FEA_paint_it_black_desc:0 " Some of the most crucial battles of the civil war were won through the use of artillery, and it's doubtless that our next victory will be achieved without them. However, if we are to gain a decisive edge in using these cannons, we must look into enchanting the barrels and their shells so that they may fall upon the enemy like thunder!"
 FEA_birth_of_the_bliksem_soldaat:0 "Birth of the Bliksem Soldaat"
 FEA_birth_of_the_bliksem_soldaat_desc:0 "It is not enough to provide our troops with improved armaments, we must also sharpen their mindset so that they become that much more deadly. Empathy and restraint in combat is a lumpen disease, and adhering to these ideals is adhering to weakness and treason! The enemy will show us no kindness, and so we shall not show them any either!"
 FEA_politicize_the_general_staff:0 "Politicize the General Staff"
 FEA_politicize_the_general_staff_desc:0 "It is not enough for an officer to be competent in their duties, they must also be a loyal and partisan patriot! Allowing anything else into the army is allowing for its enfeeblement, so for an officer to reach the height of his ability and gain rank, he must also walk the party line to get there!"
 FEA_standardize_officer_training:0 "Standardize Officer Training"
 FEA_standardize_officer_training_desc:0 "While flexibility of command has granted us many victories in the past, the future of command is order and discipline. If every officer receives the same training, then they can all be relied upon to respond properly in the face of the enemy and always triumph!"
 FEA_random_loyalty_tests:0 "Random Loyalty Tests"
 FEA_random_loyalty_tests_desc:0 "It isn't enough to require party membership of our officers as they can still have disloyal intentions, therefore, they must always be subject to a loyalty test at any time. Failing this test is grounds for discharge and subsequent arrest, which will guarantee loyalty and obedience to the party!"
 FEA_centrally_planned_offensives:0 "Centrally Planned Offensives"
 FEA_centrally_planned_offensives_desc:0 "War is politics taken to its most brutal and logical conclusion, and as such, politics should drive military operations. Any operational plan, or subsequent adjustment in the field, must get the approval of the Commissariat for Defense before its implementation to ensure a properly proletarian offensive!"
 FEA_storm_of_steel:0 "Storm of Steel"
 FEA_storm_of_steel_desc:0 "The future of warfare isn't merely ruthless soldiers with enchanted armaments, but waves upon waves of armor and mechanized units swarming across the battlefield and utterly annihilating the enemies of the Fatherland. To secure the future of our glorious revolution, we must invest in this next stage of war!"
 FEA_patriot_commissars:0 "Patriot Commissars"
 FEA_patriot_commissars_desc:0 "Every officer marches in lockstep along the party line, educated in proper strategy and political orthodox, but there still remains a gap between the state and the army that must not be exploited. Any chance to break from the lines is unacceptable, and so, we will appoint Patriot Commissars to serve as superiors to officers and a bridge between state and army!"
 FEA_esprit_de_corps:0 "Esprit de Corps"
 FEA_esprit_de_corps_desc:0 "With the dramatic improvements to the soldier's way of life, his arsenal, and the general staff that commands him, the average rifleman is unrecognizable from what he was just a few years ago. Every soldier goes into war like into a crucible, freed from cowardice and weakness to answer the Fatherland's call!"
 FEA_for_the_fatherland:0 "For the Fatherland!"
 FEA_for_the_fatherland_desc:0 "The Crimson Army has advanced from a disloyal force of ill-equipped youths into a force of elite and patriotic liberators. Woe upon the forces of reaction, and woe upon the forces of degeneracy for their days are now numbered. The entire army cries out in one triumphant voice, for the Glorious Revolution, for the Volksleider, for the Fatherland!"

Exhaustion, doubt, and fear for the future plague the minds of every griffon throughout the Duchy, but now that the war is over, every day will be better than the last. Hope is not yet lost!"
 FEA_prioritize_housing_construction:0 "Prioritize Housing Reconstruction"
 FEA_prioritize_housing_construction_desc:0 "The damage of the conflict has ripped countless families from their homes, and we cannot look them in the eye and tell them that we need to rebuild the factories first and condemn them to suffer in the meantime. No, we will instead put our focuses on temporary shelters and then onto apartment buildings until no one is without a home!"
 FEA_emergency_wealth_distribution:0 "Emergency Wealth Redistribution"
 FEA_emergency_wealth_distribution_desc:0 "Among the things rifle and artillery fire did not target in the conflict was the bank accounts of the wealthy nobles and industrialists, but there has never been a time where their fortunes are needed the most. Since the workers were the ones that generated the wealth, it's only fair to seize this money and use it to fund reconstruction efforts."
 FEA_temporary_mandate:0 "Temporary Mandate"
 FEA_temporary_mandate_desc:0 "One of the greatest hurdles to reforming the country isn't lack of funding, materials, or willpower of the people, but a labyrinth of red tape.

 FEA_trade_arms_for_necessities:0 "Trade Arms for Necessities"
 FEA_trade_arms_for_necessities_desc:0 "For as much wealth as we've taken back, we only had enough funding for the materials and labor to rebuild the country, but not enough leftover for food, water, blankets, and other necessities. While it may leave us weaker in the present moment, we need to sell off our weapons in exchange for these essential goods."
 FEA_a_second_chance:0 "A Second Chance"
 FEA_a_second_chance_desc:0 "Those in the FNV and those of the nobility who took up arms against us had their reasons for doing so, and it would be both backward and merciless to turn our backs on them. Instead, we should endeavor to understand them, and show them the error of their ways, and then offer a better path forward. Everyone deserves a second chance, even fascists."

 FEA_bring_in_the_soldiers_desc:0 "The soldiers that fought in the civil war have mostly been on edge since the last shot rang out, and as such they've been taking the time to recover.

 FEA_priceless_cameraderie:0 "Priceless Cameraderie"
 FEA_priceless_cameraderie_desc:0 "The shared hardship, diligent teamwork, and unbreakable connections that have been formed in the civil war have cemented a sense of cameraderie and unity across almost everyone in the country. Ponies work side by side with griffons who work side by side with changelings and diamond dogs, and not a shred of animosity can be found between them!"
 FEA_horizontal_rebuilding_efforts:0 "Horizontal Rebuilding Efforts"
 FEA_horizontal_rebuilding_efforts_desc:0 "The speed and organization of reconstruction is in need of improvement if we want normalcy back in a reasonable timeframe. To this end, democratic councils have formed to plan out each day's labor, organize materials, and place workers in positions most suitable to their abilities. Moreover, this streamlined process can be a valuable model once we're done!"

 FEA_noble_co_ops_desc:0 "Among the most wealthy and most responsible for inequality before the civil war was the aristocratic class. However, now that their wealth has been fairly shared amongst all workers, the question comes of what to do with the nobility. The answer, naturally, is to allow them the same freedom of enterprise and labor that everyone enjoys!"
 FEA_red_banner_democracy:0 "Red Banner Democracy"
 FEA_red_banner_democracy_desc:0 "As life across the country gets better by the day, it's becoming increasingly clear that the state of emergency is no longer needed.

So, we must devise a series of systems and incentives to enable aid for everyone in need unconditionally."
 FEA_the_great_gunsmith_allience:0 "The Great Gunsmith Alliance"
 FEA_the_great_gunsmith_allience_desc:0 "As more and more workplaces transition to worker self-management and union membership, it's only natural that this would extend to arms and munitions factories. While some limits must be put in place, as a union that makes firearms would have unique power over those that don't, arms shall now be produced in a better, horizontal fashion!"
 FEA_jeugdgeleerden:0 "Jeugdgeleerden"
 FEA_jeugdgeleerden_desc:0 "While rebuilding the schools across the country is a great feat, it doesn't go far enough to spark a love of knowledge in the youth. In other words, if we can inspire the schoolchildren today, then the future is that much brighter, and to accomplish this, a new youth program and youth science centers must be built to nourish the future!"
 FEA_the_educator_federation:0 "The Educator Federation"
 FEA_the_educator_federation_desc:0 "A rather curious development has occurred across the Union: A majority of teachers from grade school instructors all the way to the most influential college professors, have unionized!

 FEA_voluntary_literacy_programs:0 "Voluntary Literacy Programs"
 FEA_voluntary_literacy_programs_desc:0 "One of the greater tragedies of the country before the war was, and still is, illiteracy. Every griffon that cannot read or do basic math should be counted as a failure of the Union to provide for them, thus, we must set up voluntary programs for all those seeking to learn to read, taught by volunteers who have the desire to teach them!"
 FEA_communal_living_projects:0 "Communal Living Projects"
 FEA_communal_living_projects_desc:0 "When envisioning ways to improve the living situations of the workers, the most promising proposal comes from a Buckmour construction syndicate: An apartment complex with necessities like a barber, a grocery store, and playgrounds among other things built right into the facility so everything a family needs is always within reach!"
 FEA_evenredigheid_kogchel:0 "Evenredigheid"
 FEA_evenredigheid_kogchel_desc:0 "Prosperity isn't merely making enough to meet the cost of living without much wiggle room, it's having enough money to thrive!

 FEA_the_militia_system:0 "The Militia System"
 FEA_the_militia_system_desc:0 "For as much as we abhor fighting, we understand that we simply cannot depend on the goodwill of our neighbors for our safety or stave off invasion by wishful thinking. We must form an entirely voluntary military capable of defending the Union from outside threats!"
 FEA_volksofficieren_kogchel:0 "Volksofficieren"
 FEA_volksofficieren_kogchel_desc:0 "Since the end of reconstruction, the crime rates across the Union have sharply declined and continue to fall, but this doesn't mean that we can simply rely on workers to follow the law. No matter how great the society, there will always be those compelled to crime, so there must be a community ran and worker managed policing force to uphold order."
 FEA_arbeidswetten:0 "Arbeidswetten"
 FEA_arbeidswetten_desc:0 "Until now, we've relied upon slightly modified laws from the previous government, and while it has worked for a time, the Union is becoming something beyond that, and so, a new series of laws and regulations must be drafted. These newly dubbed 'Arbeidswetten' or Labor Laws, are only implemented once a majority of Unions across the country vote in approval of them!"

 FEA_publieke_inlichtingen:0 "Publieke Inlichtingen"
 FEA_publieke_inlichtingen_desc:0 "Similarly to how we cannot rely upon good will for our safety, safeguarding the integrity of our Union must also primarily be for self-defense. While some call this a statist plot, most are in agreement that a worker-managed, horizontal intelligence agency is vital to our sovereignty!"
 FEA_the_shipbuilders_league:0 "The Shipbuilder's League"
 FEA_the_shipbuilders_league_desc:0 "Before the civil war, the port city of Rottendedam was so prosperous that it rivaled the commerce of Skyfall.

 FEA_the_minimal_courts:0 "The Minimal Courts"
 FEA_the_minimal_courts_desc:0 "If there is to be community police and laws they execute, then there must also be a community-based justice system. Now statist courts are but one arm employed to oppress the people, but we will not repeat that error. Every part of society must be ran by direct input of workers, and the courts, the lawyers, and the prison system are no different!"
 FEA_achtklauwmuziek:0 "Achtklauwmuziek"
 FEA_achtklauwmuziek_desc:0 "A common expression used during reconstruction was, 'it takes eight claws to play the piano,' meaning that we must use every means and every worker to build a better society.

 FEA_democracy_in_the_armed_forces:0 "Democracy In The Armed Forces"
 FEA_democracy_in_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "One of the glaring flaws of statist militaries is the reliance upon dictatorship and harsh punishments to keep order, but this is not the syndicalist way. Indeed, democracy must come to the armed forces the same as it has come to the whole of the Union! Officers, operations, and the use of the Army's funding must all be decided by vote, not mandate!"

FEA_emergency_deal_with_skyfall_desc:0 "For as much as we're producing and mobilizing, clearing up our weapons deficits needs to happen now, not gradually, not even quickly. It needs to happen now. On top of that, we can't just buy arms because our coffers are low, so we must strike a deal using credit, loans, and promissory notes with Skyfall for the desperately needed arms."
FEA_government_contracts:0 "Government Contracts"
FEA_government_contracts_desc:0 "Workers, even dedicated and driven workers, don't work for free, and neither do industrialists. While we don't exactly have enough to pay them right now, we do have the ability to strongarm them. When the factories are at risk of being destroyed anyway, we can cut them a contract on credit, and they'll have no choice but to accept."
FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons_pechvogal:0 "Form the Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons_pechvogal_desc:0 "For as many workers are toiling away in the factories and workshops across the country, few will leave the cities and towns where they live lest they leave their families behind. But work is needed desperately outside these areas to repair the roads, construct bridges, and maintain supply trains. So for this, we need to conscript a subset of militarized laborers."
FEA_merge_the_paramilitaries:0 "Merge the Paramilitaries"
FEA_merge_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Evidently, the divides between the PvDA and FNV paramilitaries go deeper than we previously thought, and a firm peptalk didn't mend the schism between the two. If we're to stop the infighting within our ranks and fully come together as a whole, we need to put sincere effort into addressing their issues, and then uniting them to fight together for the time being. "
FEA_tighen_our_belts:0 "Tighten Our Belts"
FEA_tighen_our_belts_desc:0 "As the war drags on, it's become increasingly apparant that food supplies are running low. With the enemy bombarding our fields, and harassing our supply shipments without any way to really stop them, we must implement a strict rationing program until things get back to normal. "
FEA_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"
FEA_war_bonds_desc:0 "Running on empty coffers to fund the war effort puts us in an absolutely miserable situation, but maybe we can turn that into our advantage. By issuing debt to the population in the form of war bonds, we can get rid of our debt for liquid capital and be able to pay workers back with interest once we've won!"
FEA_youth_reconstruction_league:0 "Youth Reconstruction League"
FEA_youth_reconstruction_league_desc:0 "With school out, and children either safe at home or running about the cities with nothing to do but cause trouble or sneak off to help in some way, we can focus their efforts on something safe and productive: Clearing rubble out of harm's way, far from the front. "
FEA_concessions_to_the_unions:0 "Concessions to the Unions"
FEA_concessions_to_the_unions_desc:0 "The harder we keep pressing the average worker to toil away long and difficult hours, the more we invite a union wildcat strike and our production crawls to a standstill. We need to nip this problem in the bud before the unions can organize the disgruntled workers, and preemptively offer to meet them halfway on many pressing issues."
FEA_deploy_jeugdwind_volunteers:0 "Deploy Jeugdwind Volunteers"
FEA_deploy_jeugdwind_volunteers_desc:0 "From all across the country, from Buckmour to Klauwermack, the youngest of our fighters have organized and stepped up to fight for Feathisia! As soon as we're able, we must officially deploy them to the front!"
FEA_raise_the_volunteer_brigades:0 "Raise the Volunteer Brigades"
FEA_raise_the_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "From every out of work schoolteacher, every grieving loved one, and every youth who wants to fight alongside their fathers have stepped up to join the fight for Feathisia! Who are we to deny these brave patriots their right to defend their homes?"
FEA_waco_bills:0 "WACO Bills"
FEA_waco_bills_desc:0 "It's no secret that our coffers are nearly almost empty, but that doesn't mean we're out of tricks. If we issue credit bonds to pay for armament factories to operate, and promise to pay payment back at 6% more than the bonds are worth, funding through the war would be resolved!"
FEA_emergency_conversions:0 "Emergency Conversions"
FEA_emergency_conversions_desc:0 "Perfumes, watches, candy, and trinkets all have one thing in common: They can't win a war! Every factory devoted to these unessential luxuries is a factory devoted to our defeat. As unpopular as the action may be, and as hard as it might be to undo, we have no other choice but to end luxury, and convert the factories"
FEA_the_united_front:0 "The United Front"
FEA_the_united_front_desc:0 "There's a saying in Feathisia, 'wie de bal kaatst, kan hem terugverwachten,' or, 'who throws the ball can expect it back.' Our enemies have shown us no quarter when we were the most defenceless, and now that we're armed, united, and ready to fight, it's time to pay them back in kind. "
FEA_in_defense_of_the_vaterland:0 "In Defense of the Vaterland"
FEA_in_defense_of_the_vaterland_desc:0 "Every morning across the Duchy of Feathisia, millions of men, women, and children wake up and start their days with one thing on their minds. No matter if they're clocking in, waiting in the bread line, or aiming on the firing line, everyone is thinking the same thing: I am working for the defense of my Fatherland! "
FEA_temporary_command_economy:0 "Temporary Command Economy"
FEA_temporary_command_economy_desc:0 "The production lines hum to the rhythm prescribed by Pechvogel. The people eat as much as he allows, the workers endeavor to meet his quotas, and the industrialists take his deals because they have no choice, and because it's a good deal all things considered. In other words, he's clawed our economy out of freefall, and into his command."
FEA_together_for_victory:0 "Together for Victory!"
FEA_together_for_victory_desc:0 "Every citizen from across all walks of life do their part to help the war effort. While they aren't gleeful about it, they certainly are not discontent in the least. The soldiers who were at each other's throats just a year or so ago now fight side by side for a common goal. Everyone has come from less than nothing to gather together and cry with one voice: Together for Victory! "
FEA_peace_in_our_time:0 "Peace in Our Time"
FEA_peace_in_our_time_desc:0 "It's... Over? After the years of tribulation, the seemingly unending string of sacrifice and hardship, and the agonizing days that would never end we... Won? "
FEA_send_them_home:0 "Send Them Home"
FEA_send_them_home_desc:0 "Now that the war is over and we are victorious, it's time to send the mass of conscripts, volunteers, and Juegdwind members back home with the utmost honor, and bury those that cannot make the journey home with the utmost respect."
FEA_clear_the_rubble:0 "Clear the Rubble"
FEA_clear_the_rubble_desc:0 "While the Youth Reconstruction League handled the worst of the civil war's destruction, the time has come to send them back home and let the adults take over. We've got a lot of work to rebuild not just the interior destruction, but all the desolation between the old front and Griffenheim, but we do so with our helds held high!"
FEA_reopen_the_schools:0 "Reopen the Schools"
FEA_reopen_the_schools_desc:0 "Among the most unpopular actions taken by Pechvogel during our greatest trial was closing the schools and employing children to work. But now that the last shot has been fired, we can finally open the doors to the school and never close them again. This war robbed the young generation of their childhoods, and we must do our utmost to give it back. "
FEA_pay_back_our_debts:0 "Pay Back Our Debts"
FEA_pay_back_our_debts_desc:0 "The debts accrued during the war, domestic and foreign, are nearly completely crushing the economy. But we borrowed it all, and now we must do our utmost to pay it back in installments without managing to send everything into freefall once again."
FEA_sunrise_over_griffonia:0 "Sunrise over Griffenheim"
FEA_sunrise_over_griffonia_desc:0 "The worst is over, and things have only begun to get back to normal again. For an entire country scarred by conflict, by tyranny, and by horror, the sun rises and brings a new day, and a promise from Pechvogel that every day will be better than the last."
FEA_a_new_curriculum:0 "A New Curriculum"
FEA_a_new_curriculum_desc:0 "The state of education in Feathisia, and indeed across the entire Herzland, lags far behind the modern standards that we're capable of. We have the funding now that we've taken Griffenheim, and we have the bright minds and eager student body to make a new and lasting education system!"
FEA_adresses_the_divide:0 "Address the Divide"
FEA_adresses_the_divide_desc:0 "Now that the war is finally over, the glue that has held the PvDA and FNV radicals together has come undone, and now they're at each other's throats once more. We can't have our streets and neighborhoods become a battleground again, so we need to intervene and address their concerns before things get out of claw."
FEA_send_the_diplomats:0 "Send the Diplomats"
FEA_send_the_diplomats_desc:0 "Now that we're no longer fighting for our lives and in a position of authority, our ambitions have become clear: Herzland Unification. But, we can't risk going to war all over again if we don't have to. So we'll have to do things the right way and use good old fashioned political pressure!"
FEA_halt_arms_production:0 "Halt Arms Production"
FEA_halt_arms_production_desc:0 "It would be ludicrous to ask the citizens who've been working in arms factories for the past few years to continue making weapons for a conflict that no longer exists. We're not at war, so we no don't need to produce as many weapons any more, so we can go back to making essential goods again."
FEA_guarantee_the_8_hour_workday:0 "Guarantee the 8 Hour Workday"
FEA_guarantee_the_8_hour_workday_desc:0 "After working 12 hour shifts around the clock for months on end with scarce day-offs and no vacation time at all, it's time to cut the workers a great deal of slack. From now on, the shifts not only come back down to normal hours, but the workers now receive higher pay and better conditions!"
FEA_fund_the_rottendedam_university:0 "Fund the Rottendedam University"
FEA_fund_the_rottendedam_university_desc:0 "Our recent improvements to the education system have come a long way and done a great deal for students and teachers across the country, but, even this isn't good enough. Every crown needs its shining jewel, and in this case, that great shining gem will be a university in the very heart of Rottendedam!"
FEA_concessions_to_the_radicals:0 "Concessions to the Radicals"
FEA_concessions_to_the_radicals_desc:0 "Both sides have at the very least laid down their arms and come to the table to talk. While we can't give either side everything they want, as that would only drive the country asunder yet again, we can agree to concessions on either side. Now they may not be entirely happy with these agreements, but they'll be content enough to not rise up again!"
FEA_standardize_the_legal_code:0 "Standardize the Legal Code"
FEA_standardize_the_legal_code_desc:0 "Thus far there have been conflicts between the law of the Herzland states and Feathisian law, and it's led to some challenging questions coming across our desk. We cannot keep going on like this in perpetuity, so a new legal code must be amended from the existing law and agreed upon by all parties."
FEA_sweeten_the_deal:0 "Sweeten the Deal"
FEA_sweeten_the_deal_desc:0 "While we have ambitions to integrate the rest of the Herzland into our control, we cannot simply expect them to roll over and accept the terms we give them without question, and we definitely cannot go to war unless we absolutely have to. So let's sweeten the deal for each state so that reunifying is an irresistible offer. "
FEA_bring_back_luxury:0 "Bring Back Luxury"
FEA_bring_back_luxury_desc:0 "With many factories being demobilized, we now have enough production freed up to begin producing luxury goods once again! With these products hitting the shelves, a new market has opened up to promote economic growth, but it's more than ticking numbers on a graph. It's a sense of normalcy again."
FEA_arbeidswetten_pechvogel:0 "Arbeidswetten"
FEA_arbeidswetten_pechvogel_desc:0 "It isn't enough to improve the means and conditions of the average worker, we must go a step beyond and show that we truly care about their wellbeing. To accomplish this, a new set of laws have been drafted especially to protect the worker and  their right to organize as well as tying their wages to inflation!  "
FEA_a_fresh_start:0 "A Fresh Start"
FEA_a_fresh_start_desc:0 "The slate has been wiped clean, and a new, sturdy foundation has been built on top of it. The radicals are content with the current rule, things are becoming more and more stable by the day, and the new curriculum is going to ensure that every student can have a bright future. For as bad as things were, they're finally beginning to look up."
FEA_demand_integration:0 "Demand Integration"
FEA_demand_integration_desc:0 "Throughout all the talks, concessions, appeasements, and guarantees we've made great progress with the other Herzland states, and their public opinion is swayed more towards joining than not! The time has then arrived to pose the important question: Integrate into the Empire, or face the consequences. "
FEA_a_return_to_form:0 "Return to Form"
FEA_a_return_to_form_desc:0 "Demobilizing an army is a tall task, but it can be done in a reasonable timeframe. Demobilizing an economy, however, is a much taller task that takes a up a much longer timeframe. Despite this, the conditions have not only returned to normal, but drastically improved from where they were! The fruits of our labor have flourished, and now we can feast upon them in peace."
FEA_a_question_of_emergency:0 "The Question of Emergency"
FEA_a_question_of_emergency_desc:0 "The war is over, everything is not only back to normal, but far better than it ever was. As Pechvogel has been operating under emergency powers this entire time an important question about the future of the newly established Griffonian Empire must be asked: Are we still in a state of emergency?"

### Harmonic Reformation ###
FEA_transition_to_harmony:0 "Transition to Harmony"
FEA_transition_to_harmony_desc:0 "The state of emergency has been lifted, and dictatorship can officially end across the Empire! Although we cannot snap our claws and have the entire nation, and everything that governs it, magically change, we can begin to quickly transition towards Harmony and towards democracy!"
FEA_tax_the_churches:0 "Tax the Churches"
FEA_tax_the_churches_desc:0 "Faith has always been a bedrock for Griffonian society, but this does not mean that the temples and archons are untouchable. Allowing tens of millions of Idols to flow into their coffers every year without taxation will only allow them to grow powerful enough to destabilize us, thusly, a new tax code must be written to include temples."
FEA_establish_local_governments:0 "Establish Local Governments"
FEA_establish_local_governments_desc:0 "Until very recently, the way the Empire operated was entirely top-down, and local administrations and their citizens had almost no say in how their own affairs were ran. This has to change. From here on, every single town, village, and city will be able to govern themselves and have a voice on how things are ran at the national level. "
FEA_shatter_monopolies_pechvogel:0 "Shatter Monopolies"
FEA_shatter_monopolies_pechvogel_desc:0 "Throughout the state of emergency, Pechvogel had seen it fit to merge companies together to streamline production and drastically increase output, however this has created a monster. These merged companies have become monopolies that wield tremendous power and influence, and they must be broken up before problems arise."
FEA_tempering_extremists_pechvogel:0 "Temper Extremism"
FEA_tempering_extremists_pechvogel_desc:0 "While we've brought the tensions of extremists on either side below a boiling point, we've only done a passable job in mitigating their dissent. 'Good enough' is unacceptable, and we must go further beyond to address the issues of society whenever they arise to deny any unrest from rising and giving the extremists a platform."
FEA_curb_noble_influence:0 "Curb Noble Influence"
FEA_curb_noble_influence_desc:0 "Throughout our main conflict and Herzland Unification, the nobility were left untouched by any legislation, and this has granted them an undue amount of influence over our political situation. We cannot allow our new democracy to be shackled to the whims of aristocrats, and as such, we must put forth honest efforts and legislation to curb their powers."
FEA_rebuild_the_legistrature:0 "Rebuild the Legislature"
FEA_rebuild_the_legistrature_desc:0 "During the temporary dictatorship, Pechvogel had suspended the legislatures across the country as they weren't necessary at the time. But now that the emergency has passed, it's high time to build a stronger legislature that works for the entire Herzland!"
FEA_assemble_the_new_cabinet:0 "Assemble the New Cabinet"
FEA_assemble_the_new_cabinet_desc:0 "A new government means new people to lead it and new ministers to administrate, and luckily we won't have to wait long to find qualified candidates. Many of those during the emergency who had their jobs revoked are eager to take their place in government once again!"
FEA_progressive_taxation:0 "Progressive Taxation"
FEA_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "Since the end of our initial conflicts, our wealth has only ever increased. However, this prosperity isn't equitably distributed, and many remain hungry, cold, and even homeless. This cannot stand, and those that have far too much must see their wealth taxed to provide for the wellbeing of all citizens."
FEA_a_fair_market:0 "A Fair Market"
FEA_a_fair_market_desc:0 "While we're in the process of breaking up monopolies, it would also be a great move to incentivize and subsidize small businesses to pick up operations at the same time. Moreover, granting tax breaks to any company that donates a certain high amount to charities will not only create a robust free market, but a fair market as well!"
FEA_anti_discrimination_law:0 "Anti-Discrimination Laws"
FEA_anti_discrimination_law_desc:0 "The pony soldier that fought during our greatest trial fought just as hard as the griffon soldier, as hard as the diamond dog soldier, as hard as the changeling soldier. As such, it would be an insult to have these brave souls rejoin society only to be face discrimination, and new laws must reflect that."
FEA_disband_the_paramilitaries:0 "Disband the Paramilitaries"
FEA_disband_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Content as they are, we cannot have paramilitaries running around on either side harboring the potential for trouble. In other words, dangerous people with dangerous ideas cannot have dangerous weapons as well, so we must legally dismantle and disarm every paramilitary to deny them the chance to start anything."
FEA_reinstate_parliament:0 "Reinstate Parliament"
FEA_reinstate_parliament_desc:0 "Just a few years ago, the country was in flames, ruled by a dictator with everyone at each other's throats, but today we are free. Democracy reigns across the Herzland, and the new legislature provides everyone with laws that suit their regions, but today we complete our democracy by giving everyone a voice. By reinstating Parliament!"
FEA_open_door_policy:0 "Open Door Policy"
FEA_open_door_policy_desc:0 "Anyone who is willing to live and work in the Empire is welcome in the Empire. Immigration is a great boon to our economy, our culture, and our livelihoods, and as such, we must open the doors to any seeking a better life!"
FEA_price_controls_pechvogel:0 "Price Controls"
FEA_price_controls_pechvogel_desc:0 "It does us no good to prosper if the average worker doesn't have much spending money, moreover, most of what the common citizen buys is essential goods and rent they can't do without, so, these prices must come down through subsidization and tax on the wealthy, so they can spend on what they want without compromising what they need."
FEA_bedrock_of_prosperity:0 "Bedrock of Prosperity"
FEA_bedrock_of_prosperity_desc:0 "The foundation of all stable societies is founded on cooperation and moderation, and after all of our efforts, no one's interest is represented above everyone else's, and none of our policies are extreme anymore. On this rock, we have built a society in which everyone prospers!"
FEA_sociaal_vangnet:0 "Sociaal Vangnet"
FEA_sociaal_vangnet_desc:0 "The realization is quickly dawning on us that a privatized approach to the wellbeing of our citizens may be great for profits, but not for outcomes. Education, healthcare, disabilities, retirement pensions, and child-care all must be provided by the state for the benefit of all, not the private firm for private benefit!"

### The New Duke ###
FEA_willing_despot:0 "The Willing Despot"
FEA_willing_despot_desc:0 "The saying goes that if you give an inch, they'll take a mile, and that is precisely what will happen if the state of emergency is lifted. Every threat who'd been waiting for the slightest bit of weakness will pounce at the chance to plunge the country into chaos once again. The dictatorship stays and we must begin to cement its position!"
FEA_absorb_the_paramilitaries:0 "Absorb the Paramilitaries"
FEA_absorb_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Radical voices cannot be tolerated in the Empire any more, and least of all the armed radicals... However, perhaps we can take these groups across the Herzland and integrate them into the army with good enough treatment that they won't even consider rebelling."
FEA_authoritarian_democracy:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
FEA_authoritarian_democracy_desc:0 "Naturally, the voice of the people must make itself heard, but the Empire only has ears for certain voices. The PvdA and the FNV will no longer be allowed to hold office, and the LDP can be on the ballots, but never achieve a full majority. That right is reserved for the FHP from now on."
FEA_invest_in_the_country:0 "Invest in the Country"
FEA_invest_in_the_country_desc:0 "It's foolish to rely upon corporations and private citizens to donate to charity in order to solve the critical problems with society. No, instead, tax rates will increase across the board and the improvement of the country and where the money goes will be decided directly by the state."
FEA_exile_the_extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
FEA_exile_the_extremists_desc:0 "It was a mistake to concede to the extremists over and over again just to keep them from raising their weapons. In fact, this process can only ever be repeated until we're overrun by socialists or fascists, so we're just going to pull the rug out from under them. Any radical in the PvdA or FNV with a criminal record will be thrown out of the country."
FEA_end_the_archons:0 "End the Archons"
FEA_end_the_archons_desc:0 "Among the most radical voices who wish to see Pechvogel overthrown are the three Archons across the Herzland. Not only do they seek the power Pechvogel holds, but they're capable and popular enough to overthrow him at any moment. For this, we shall gather them up and their most radical supporters, and simply make them disappear."
FEA_tighten_the_binds:0 "Tighten the Binds"
FEA_tighten_the_binds_desc:0 "Since the emergency powers first came into effect, the parliament has been a hollow institution without any function. As efficient as an iron claw is, it cannot be everywhere at once, and it isn't as well liked as a genuine parliament. So, to lend legitimacy and stability to the Empire, a new, shackled Parliament will be reinstated to ostensibly represent the people!"
FEA_appoint_loyal_magistrates:0 "Appoint Loyal Magistrates"
FEA_appoint_loyal_magistrates_desc:0 "The legal and justice system cannot run solely off of one iron-clawed griffon, but we also cannot appoint just anyone to uphold and execute the laws either. To solve both of these issues, and streamline justice in the Empire, we must appoint loyal, incorruptable magistrates to uphold the law."
FEA_state_patronage:0 "State Patronage"
FEA_state_patronage_desc:0 "There are few things more important to society than culture and the arts, and until now artists have had to endure poverty to produce their works in hopes they get discovered. This will not continue, and from here on, the artist, the writer, the musician, and so on will receive a stipend directly from the state!"
FEA_de_leerplicht:0 "De Leerplicht"
FEA_de_leerplicht_desc:0 "Up until this point, it was the parent's choice on whether or not their child attended school, but this decision no longer rests with them. Every child from the age of 5 up to the age of 18 will now be required by law to go to public school, with penalties for parents who refuse or truant children."
FEA_the_short_leash:0 "The Short Leash"
FEA_the_short_leash_desc:0 "Keeping every Herzland state under our control and denying them their own culture is just begging for unrest to creep in, but we also can't grant them too much freedom either. So we will grant each part of the Herzland slight control over itself, but not too much. There must never be question over who holds their leash."
FEA_secularisatie_pechvogel:0 "Secularisatie"
FEA_secularisatie_pechvogel_desc:0 "The prevalence of religion in society takes away from Pechvogel's authority, and makes citizens more focused on being good believers than good citizens. Faith has its place in society without a doubt, but it should be subordinate to the country, not undermining its authority or its people's civic duties."
FEA_the_new_duke:0 "The New Duke"
FEA_the_new_duke_desc:0 "Every part of the government is now as efficient as it is loyal to Pechvogel's leadership, but as we look forward into the future, the term dictator seems wholly unsuited to what he's become. Duke Gerlach IV was beloved by the people, and now Pechvogel enjoys the same admiration. Therefore as of today, we are no longer led by a despot, but a Duke!"
FEA_de_centrale_bank:0 "De Centrale Bank"
FEA_de_centrale_bank_desc:0 "Private banking only leads to greedy profiteering off of the people, who put their trust in the banks to hold their money and issue their loans. Instead of relying on private firms to not gamble the people's money away or cause a financial crisis, we can step in and centralize the banks into one state-ran institution. Pechvogel is a banker, after all."
FEA_algemeen_ziekenfonds:0 "Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_algemeen_ziekenfonds_desc:0 "Due to the wealth disparities in the Empire, many cannot afford a doctor or emergency treatment, and some even have to ration out their medications. To rectify this great ill, we must provide for the people's health using a general fund that is free for all to use."
FEA_dismantle_the_press:0 "Dismantle the Press"
FEA_dismantle_the_press_desc:0 "Throughout the emergency, Pechvogel saw it fit to restrict the press so as to not spread defeatist sentiments or cause civil unrest, but the press has been in limbo ever since without clear direction. Today, we give it direction by shattering it into a thousand pieces. Instead of several large papers, there will be dozens of small ones that each pertain to their own social group."
FEA_sociaaleconomische_raad:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad"
FEA_sociaaleconomische_raad_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to improve the economy during our greatest trials, many remain in the clutches of poverty, having to choose between food or rent, and some even have gone homeless. This is a failure of the state that must be rectified immediately."

feathasia.13.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbours, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessgriffs and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whom he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More worryingly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendedam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organisation, and considers them to be the safeguards of Feathisian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Do' novel."

feathasia.18.d:0 "Gerlach loved public appearances. Stage fright was an imaginary concept to a Griffon whose version of heaven seemed to be in front of the cameras. Initially there to gain the perspective of yet another group of his people, he soon found himself atop an impromptu stage hastily arranged in anticipation of his arrival by the dockyard workers. A routine stop soon turned into an hour-long rally in one of the hardest hit cities of the Economic crisis, its residents eager to hear the words of their Duke.\n\nAscending the steps of the stage in front of hundreds, Gerlach IV came to a stop right before the podium. He spoke under his breath. "...Thanks for coming here with me."\n\nAt his side, his fellow Noble, and best friend, Gabriela Eagleclaw. "I did have to rearrange some things, clear out a schedule or three.." She shrugged. "But support is built everywhere in the Empire. Not just in those places we find convenient. Even if it's a bit..." She kept up her smile. "...Rustic."\n\nAn understatement, to be sure. As some Griffons and ponies of the urban center crammed to hear their Duke, Gabriela watched as Gerlach began to speak. Despite towering on the stage, his inflections and words spoke to the hard-hit creatures on their level. As if crafting a story, he weaved together the crowd's hardships, their fears, and their common identity, bringing into their eyes a sense of hope. Gabriela couldn't help but be impressed.\n\nShots.\n\nTwo, three, Gabriela Eagleclaw stopped counting as Gerlach collapsed onto the stage and panic rushed through the crowd. Adrenaline rushed in the Duchess' veins as she wrapped her wings around him, and Feathisian Soldiers surrounded them both. The crowd shifted with panic heads turning to find the shooter until soldiers of the Feathisian army returned fire and ended the threat.\n\nOut of the huddle, Gerlach IV rose to his claws and brought up a wing in triumph, to the cheers of the unbroken crowd.\n\nGabriela's worried eyes met Gerlach's. "...Are you alright?"\n\nBlood dripped from the side of his head. "Hospital. Please.""

All that changed when the news of the brute murder of the Child Emperor by parts of the Imperial military rippled through the Grand Duchy. There was no Grover left and Gabriela Eagleclaw was now technically the next in line to the throne. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, a dictator, had usurped the Empire.\n\nIn the evening candlelight wakes were held in every city and town in honour of Grover VI. Many cried, many others vowed that this could not go unpunished. Some still prayed for peace.\n\nThe next day, political scheming continued in earnest, there was no time for mourning with a power-hungry general at the gates. The so called Regency Debate had started since the death of the Sick Emperor, but had now exploded, with no griffon showing any true leadership. While the Grand Duke has locked himself in his Estate, privately grieving the death of his friend's son, the coalition of liberals and monarchists has broken in parliament. Dark times were ahead, and as long Feathisia remained disunited, the country could not stand against Dawnclaw." # RUBY Check if it suits you or you want it changed. Copied from Pre-Rework

feathasia.41.d:0 "Sitting down in the bleachers, Gerlach wasn't exactly sure of what to expect. Surrounded by an assortment of Naval, Army, and Air officers, each with a colorful variety of medals earned from various campaigns, he certainly felt out of his element. Even Gabriela sitting next to him remarked about the 'tough crowd'. His tour of the most extensive military base in Feathisia was supposed to end with a 'presentation' of some sort, but all he could see was a two-story concrete building, a river, and the surrounding trees, shrubs, and rocks of the Feathisian countryside.\n\nThen, an explosion.\n\nA mock one, of course, but it didn't prevent Gabriela from jumping in her seat and instinctively clutching Gerlach's claw with her own. A simulation round jolted all in attendance, even in the officers, as Griffons and even a pegasi descended from the sky and landed on the roof of the building. Hooking up some sort of contraption, they managed to rappel down the building and crash through the window, as blank rounds were fired inside.\n\nWith smoke rising from the blank rounds and a simulation explosion round covering the air, it was broken by the headlights of a vehicle, which roared over the rocky countryside terrain and skidded to a halt, the car still in motion when three soldiers stepped out and began firing on the building. To add even further confusion to Gerlach, soldiers rose from the river, seemingly submerged the whole time, and approached the building.\n\nAs the mock gunfire died down, a dozen soldiers took up positions around the building, aiming all around and even at the bleachers. As the military officers began to clap, one Griffon stepped out from the building, holding a smoking rifle, wearing sunglasses in the middle of the day, and clearly disliked by the Generals. He approached the bleachers and took off his Officer's cap.\n\n"Afternoon sir, ma'am. Major Moerman, commanding officer of the Commandotroepen Korps."\n\nIt was at this moment Gerlach noticed, to his and the audience's surprise, that the entire forest seemed to shift, as shrubs, rocks, and leaves stood with their weapons raised, camouflaged the entire time. Out of the dozen seen, there must have been two hundred in front of them. With a grin, he gave a nod to the Duke and Duchess.\n\n"We're professional Archon killers.""

feathasia.42.d:0 "In what is to be considered the grandest, most expensive 'fake war' in the history of the continent, The Great Herzland War Game was an event with dozens of participatory military units, each from the states of the Empire. Proposed by Gerlach himself, it was sure to be a month-long event that allowed the former divided states to compete, and work with, their comrades. To his credit, the divided Imperial Military units were enthusiastic about the challenge and worked extensively to expand it to its largest potential.\n\nGerlach should have known they would get too carried away.\n\nWoodlands belonging to Noble estates became sites of supervised blank-fire exercises, Cliffsides and National Parks were superficially disrupted by Diamond Dogs and their (albeit impressive) trench systems, not to mention the frankly unsportsmanlike conduct of the Katerin and Angriverin units against eachother, clearly not reading the rules that throwing rocks was not a sanctioned tactic under the wargame. Even the city of Romau wasn't spared, as Grifenmarschen 'troops' (peasants with large sticks) continually harassed the police, who were not apart of the exercise. Yale's military hardly fought, instead publishing the locations of units and pushing them to fight eachother. In the North, Feathisian and Strawberry troops frequently attempted to wage psychological warfare against the other about the private romantic life of the Duke and Duchess, and to top it all off, each and every event was able to be spectated by the Civilian populace.\n\nAlthough the whole spectacle was an absolute success in terms of gaining popular support for our military, in addition to the fantastic military lessons learned, the appearance of the Feathisian Commandos atop of the Imperial Palace signaled the end of the exercise. Of course, not after The Duchess gave them a stern talking to."

feathasia_iron.1.d:0 "As violent and frantic as the parliament building was, Gerlach hardly moved a muscle. Attempts to reason, of dialogue between the members of parliament were only interrupted by the newest arrival of reports of Ferdinand Dawnclaw's latest actions. But Gerlach didn't move. He hadn't since the first report.\n\nIn the corners of his muffled hearing, along the edges of his unfocused vision, Gerlach saw an entire shift in the room like a rogue wave upon the seas. Rising to speak from the far corner of the parliamentary benches, Rozenkamp laid both his claw and his hateful words bare for all around him.\n\n"In playing with delusions of so-called equine morality, this great country has been reduced to a sham." His eyes were fiercely locked upon Gerlach, his accusatory words causing some even seated next to him to create distance. "We sold out our honor to the equine, and plunged the country into freefall because of it, and you have done everything to aid this."\n\nGerlach's eyes emerged from their trance, now locking upon Rozenkamp. No emotion was worn upon his face, at least any that could be ascertained by the representatives of the room. The Duke leaned up out of his chair at the head of the Parliament and reached across his body under his wing.\n\nRozenkamp showed no attention to the Duke's movements. "Even now amongst our own parliament," He paused to gesture around himself, pointing towards some ponies in the room, who uttered words of defiance under their breaths. "The powers of republicanism and international cliques have produced the final blow to this husk of an Empire, and he sits in living flesh in Griffenheim ready to devour us all. Is it any surprise this happened when you've done everything to court it? Moreover, his tools hide amongst-"\n\nA bullet cut off his speech, then two, then three. Gerlach closed the distance between himself and Rozenkamp swiftly, emptying his pistol into his corpse on the floor of the Parliament. Silence gripped the room, terror upon all of their faces. The Duke turned to Prime Minister Talonsley, who stood horrified mere feet away from the Griffon he no longer knew."

Above every mill, workshop, factory, and dockyard hung a tension in the air like thick smog, choking out the words of their workers and steeling them for the task ahead, until a voice came through the radios of the nation and shook them from their battle trance.\n\n"Beloved workers of Feathisia," The tinny voice of Duke Gerlach IV clawed its way through the static on every frequency, "For the past year, I have worked tirelessly to remedy the ills of freefall, and it was because of your help that we managed to avoid hitting the bottom. But I fear that if nothing is done about the planned general strike, we will sink to a level even worse than the bedrock of freefall and into servitude. I ask for you to lend me your ears."\n\nProduction halted as millions of anxious laborers turned their eyes up to listen. "I'm not blind to the animosity or fear reserved for me or to the dreadful conditions martial law has placed you in, but I would hazard against an outcry. Were there no maniac in Griffenheim, my actions would have no justification, and you would have every right to overthrow me. But it is precisely because there is a madgriff not far from our borders intent on destroying us that harshness is required."\n\nThe Duke cleared his throat and continued, "How does a devastating general strike help the situation? When we need to be at our strongest to face down our greatest foe, the unions would have us weakened. When we most need labor for our defense, the unions would leave us defenseless. When you are in dire need of better conditions and pay, the union declares that only by causing mayhem will they retrieve them for you. Let me tell you now, they are wrong. The only thing they can give you is bondage, while I can grant your every demand immediately without the anarchy. However, I cannot leave you vulnerable and I refuse to offer up the country in chains."\n\nHis voice choked, failing to hold back the tide of his emotions. "Unity is demanded of everyone in Feathisia's darkest hour, and for this reason, all unions are hereby forbidden to strike, and any attempt to do so will be met with harsh reprisal. It is through your labor, beloved workers of Feathisia, that we can defeat the madgriff! Thank you.""

Its only counter were the meager number of police who still pledged their loyalty to their Duke, standing guard at the entryways to certain streets to direct the flow of dissidents and keep them peaceful.\n\nAmong the chants, which came from across the political spectrum, were cries for a return to democracy, for an end to tyranny, and for bread and work. However, the more radical voices in the crowd eventually took command with calls for Duke Gerlach to abdicate the throne entirely and face justice for his crimes. However, this too was hijacked in the frenzy quickly overtaking the demonstrations.\n\nProtestors began slamming into the walls of police, who held their own against the tide, enduring the threats against their life and standing as a bulwark of order. Soon, the innocent and peaceful calls for democracy mutated into violent cries for Duke Gerlach's head.\n\nBefore long, a boom followed by a shrill, piercing, bloodcurdling scream shattered the sound of the demonstrators. As everyone fell silent, a griffon, barely over the age of twenty, lay trembling on the cold bricks of the street, clutching her wounds and sobbing quietly.\n\nThen everything came undone. In just an instant, the protest became a riot, and the wall of noise descended upon the officers like a tidal wave onto a small ship. In the resulting melee, over three dozen protestors lay dead in the streets, though most of both parties fled once the gunshots started ringing out.\n\nDuke Gerlach had since banned public protest to prevent such a riot from ever taking place again, while also making sure to compensate the families of those involved to set things right."

feathasia_iron.4.d:0 "In a small back room, tucked away in the parts of the De Vleugels train station that the overhead lights don't touch, history was being made. Duke Gerlach IV sat with his back to the wall across from the beast in black known as Heeren, both griffs flanked on either side by antsy soldiers. Talking to the paramilitary leader was like trying to disarm a bomb with words. Convincing him wasn't the hard part, as he'd take any chance to bolster his ranks. Rather, it was containing his collateral damage.\n\nThe dim light above flickered as the two adversaries stared into each other eyes with glares that twisted like knives. "Let's get one thing straight," Gerlach was the first to speak, reaching into his coat pocket and producing a pipe, which he held in his beak without lighting it, "Were the circumstances any different, I would have your head, but as it happens, we need one another. Feathisia is in an uproar, and what little ability I have to contain it is dwindling. I need you to cut a path to law and order."\n\nHeeren drew a breath in and nodded slowly, refusing even to blink from the moment he sat down, "The feeling is mutual." His voice was low and coarse like gravel, and his eyes were fiercer than a thousand hawks, but Gerlach faced down the monster without flinching.\n\n"Make no mistake, I'm not giving you free reign. You are to enforce my laws, you are to disappear my enemies, and you are to follow my command. The state's purse is open to you for as many griffs and as much equipment as you need, but the instant you deviate from my word, or begin purging your personal enemies, the Bronze Sentinels and their leader, will cease to exist."\n\nWere the ferocity of Heeren's gaze any more intense, he would've turned Gerlach into stone. "We're on the same page, Gerlach, but you're naive if you think I'll leave my back open to be stabbed. I'll take your money and do your dirty work, but you have to promise me something in return."\n\n"And that is?" The Duke raised an eyebrow."

Opposed to the usual crowd-violence typical of the political extremists, Heeren's thugs moved through the Duchy as a surgeon's scalpel moved through flesh, carving small pieces of communities out, whether they be sole buildings or people.\n\nOne group of Bronze Sentinels had pursued their mission far beyond their instructions, and had looted a group of businesses and homes operated by ponies. Before the sun rose, Gerlach IV made sure their names were crossed off the lists as well.\n\nThere was no use in keeping it quiet, and Gerlach made no effort to do so. Using the muscle of the most militant wing of the FNV, the Duke had allied himself with the strongest head of the hydra and was using it to rip the throats of the others. Dragged into a transport truck by his own soldiers, General Vorst tot Vorst and other officers suspected of posing a threat to the Duke found themselves in nooses on the streets of De Vleugels.\n\nIn the capital city of Feathisia, gallows were constructed in plain view of the various city centers. In no particular order, criminals, less-known politicians hostile to the Duke's rule, uncooperative industry heads, and a minority of the Officer Corps had their names crossed off the Duke's lists.\n\nGerlach watched each and every one of them hang. Not a mass killing, or murder on a grand scale, he didn't watch more than a couple hundred necks snap by sunrise. Precise, methodical, every execution removing a roadblock on his path."

The loss of Grover VI had previously made her an emotional husk, as she tried to bury it all inside. The horrible news from Feathisia had brought it all out again. "It's a lie!

The streetlights all flickered on in response to the oncoming dark clouds that rolled in, but otherwise, the city did not stir. The citizens that once rushed forth to meet their Duke whenever he was in public hid behind their curtains and locked doors as though he were a storybook villain.\n\nThis did not phase him when in fact he'd done everything to earn this reputation. He would suffer the people's fear so long as they were safe. Then, just as the half dozen armored vehicles made their stop around the fountain before Gerlach's estate, the situation flipped on its head. Hundreds of griffons descended upon the trucks and surrounded it entirely. Some were armed with rifles, others with pitchforks, and some with only the fury burning in their hearts. The soldiers of the convoy met them back with their own machine guns and magic rifles, and the city was silent once more.\n\nA cry came from somewhere in the crowd, which worked its way to the front in the form of a frenzied chant. "Bring us the Duke! Bring us the Duke!" There was no question in his mind what they wanted to do, nor any doubt that he could suppress this band of would-be insurrectionists right where they stood. However, there was also a chance that his beloved people could see reason as they always had, and so with a deep breath in, Gerlach flipped the hatch on the roof of the military truck he was in and came face to face with the mob.\n\n"My beloved subjects, I implore you to listen to what I have to say with an open mind to the very end." The crowd was hushed, staring out with rage and apprehension, as though they were expending the very last amount of loyalty they had for the Duke by letting him speak. "If by then you are not convinced and you do not find me in the right, I grant you every permission to fire upon me at will. I'll even step out among you and make it easy."\n\nHundreds among them turned and looked to one another, the thick tension in the air diffusing by the instant, then they all turned back to him in silence once more. Gerlach muttered to himself."

But when the news arrived that he had slain our Emperor Grover VI to do so, we were enraged." Duke Gerlach felt an anger within him bubble deep from his heart up to his throat and out his mouth as he spoke. "When I looked to our failing parliament, our economy that was on the brink of ruin, and an Empire that has done nothing but crumble and wither apart since I was young, I knew it was not up to the task of doing what needed to be done."\n\nPlacing his claws on the rim of the hatch, Gerlach leaned forward, letting the hate brewing within him for months finally take form as words. "Perhaps our ineffectual democracy could've been reformed, perhaps our shattered economy could mend itself quickly enough to put up a fight, but even if there was a chance that it could, it would do so far too late. For every moment we wasted in reform or reconstruction, we could've been arming ourselves for the struggle ahead. For every instant of claw-wringing and pearl-clutching we have done for so-called 'democracy', an instant that could've been used to prepare against our real enemy has been wasted!"\n\nNow the Duke climbed out from the hatch and stood tall atop the armored vehicle, gesturing wildly at the crowd, who looked back at him with fury and vengeance in their eyes that was quickly turning away from him and towards another enemy. "If there was another way that I could've prepared our country for the fight, I would have done it that way, but because my beloved subjects, there was no other way I did what needed to be done! I had to become the harsh tyrant and the brutal murderer, not because I wanted to, but because I had to! And for this I am sorry."\n\nThe eyes of the crowd were so angry that they were practically on fire as they stared at Gerlach walking down the top of the truck onto its hood before raising his claws to the sky. "If there is any griffon who believes their Duke is wrong, that he has not looked out for them or done everything in his power to keep them safe, let them fire upon me!"\n\nOnce again, the city did not stir. The mob one by one lifted their weapons to the sky, and just as before, a cry from the back rippled through the entire crowd, and later through the entire country like a stone in water."

Serving as a magnet for all of the world's ills, the people of Feathisia and scattered throughout the Herzland had begun to place their faith and labor in the only Griffon who could stop him.\n\nGerlach IV was revered as the manifestation of the people's rage, the titan of what little hope was left for the Empire. Perhaps too late to save the Empire, but still with enough time to avenge it. The Duke's armies swelled with resources and volunteers from across the land, with every avenue of life personally invested in the coming war against Dawnclaw. Citizens in every province trained in groups of spontaneous militias, each of them positively sure that they would not squander the opportunity if they were lucky enough to have their own claws around Ferdinand's neck.\n\nThe fires of rage in their minds swelled with the gasoline of despair in their hearts, with the melancholic look and slight tinge of despair in the words of their Duke in his radio addresses in public appearances, serving as the closest reminder to the once-living child-Emperor. This was no longer an assault upon their Empire, but an attack upon the people themselves. It wasn't hard to imagine the young chick as one of their own."

Clad in his royal armor and gripping his sword in claw, citizens inside the palace dragged an already bleeding, bruised, and wide-eyed Ferdinand Dawnclaw before the opening of the palace, and the staircase that led up to it.\n\nSmoke from distant fires plagued half the sky, and the gentle smoldering of coals throughout the damaged palace sizzled as the Griffons and ponies around Gerlach fell silent, anxious to hear the judgment of their Duke.\n\nFlares of rage, of mad fury, of horrific imagination unfolded in the eyes of Gerlach IV. But even in the cold echoes of what once used to be his hopeful heart, the reminders of what he used to be made their appearance in all new twisted form, turning his eyes away from Dawnclaw on the floor and down the steps.\n\nThe city was wounded, gunfire still echoing. Public displays of violence and sheer brutality inflicted on this city by Dawnclaw had gathered what must have been thousands of its starving, despairing citizens onto the streets below, looking up at their liberator.\n\n"You have all suffered, as I have suffered." Gerlach IV said, to the thousands who wished to hear him. "I will not deprive you of your justice."\n\nIn his final moments, the Lord Protector had to be dragged kicking and screaming down the steps and out onto the street, as Gerlach ordered his soldiers to deliver him to the justice of the city which he terrorized.

Cities and towns had begun stockpiling food and water, ensuring that if any conflict were to pass, her subjects would endure. Though no concrete military threat had been laid against the Strawberry Duchy, she hurried from Readewetter to every corner of the countryside, from villages large and small, to schools, to farms, and to castles. She had visited military installations, outposts and checkpoints, as her and her staff constructed plans and protocols to resist imminent invasion. Though it was never written down or spoken aloud, all preparations dealt with an invasion from Feathisia.\n\nVitalius Moonbill was always an odd griffon out from the rest of the crowd, and it made no difference to him now. It had been a debacle tracking down Gabriela, who must have been on her sixth inspection of the day. Out in the forests of Osnabeak, standing at the ramparts, she was silent.\n\n"My friend," He began, "You're working yourself to death."\n\nShe didn't turn away from the ramparts.

"Many of the fires have been put out before touching many residential areas, and armed resistance in the city has been eliminated."\n\nThe Duke weaved around citizens, some wounded and bandaged, who perked up either in admiration or alarm at his presence, or the sword he still carried in his claw. He stopped, resting his gaze on the flowing Griffking river that cut the city in three. "A significant portion?" He asked.\n\n"Much of the fighting occurred in the Industrial district. Dawnclaw's forces were based out of there, and the surrounding residences were all practically destroyed. Some ten thousand citizens are without shelter."\n\nGerlach raised his claw to point across the river. "I'm looking at intact shopping centers across the bridge."\n\nGeneral Best nodded. "We've set up food and water distribution from there sir, but the shops themselves are all locked and boarded from the battle."\n\n"Break in." Gerlach IV leaned on the handle of his sword as if it were a cane, as he looked back to the streets. "I've spoken to many of your forces personally. They have all done our Duchy proud in our crusade, but this is far from over. If the creatures of the Empire are to look upon tomorrow with any remaining shard of hope after this, they are to be cared for as chicks ought to be after tragedy."\n\nWith those words, both Gerlach and General Pieter Best looked to the streets, crews of civilians and soldiers both pushing aside torched automobiles and trucks from the roads, sweeping broken glass off the sidewalks, and even removing a corpse from a lamppost."

"Some of my waiters and cooks showed up later when the soldiers started shooting at the houses." He looked up, wiping his eyes. "Are... Are you sure I'm not holding anyone up?"\n\nIt looked like entire new neighborhoods had been constructed overnight out of tents on the streets of Griffenheim, but these makeshift towns operated as one organism that spanned across all three sectors of the city. With the inner streets cleared and reconstruction efforts now aimed towards repair of infrastructure, the city's core had become a hub for those residents with nowhere to flee.\n\n"Not at all, Riverbill." Another Griffon, Silverquill said. "The hospitals have all the injured under control. Your care is just as important as any other." He leaned in. "You said you hid in the restaurant with others?"\n\nRiverbill nodded. "Yes, as uh... as long as we could. We couldn't continue making boiled pasta-" He said, with a dry laugh, "So eventually we had to search for something to eat. Some of us came back... Some of us didn't." Sensing he was about to break, he tried to switch the conversation. "...Where are you from, Silverquill?"\n\n"Allwerder." The medical griffon nodded. "Griffons across Feathisia answered the Duke's call down here." He scribbled something on his clipboard.

The mission of the day was just as it had been the past week or so: scout ahead for any signs of the enemy and report back any relevant intel without being spotted or captured.\n\nBorn a pegasus to two earth pony parents, Hard Cap was closer to the griffons she grew up around than she was to any equine custom, and it showed in her aspirations. Like most young chicks in the Herzland, many dream to be a knight, or a policegriff, or whatever their parents were, Cap had wanted to be a knight more than anything. She dragged her parents to parades where they would march, made a habit of finding sticks that most resembled a sword, and fashioning armor out of cardboard or pots from the cupboard.\n\nHowever, Cap never grew out of this desire, unlike most chicks, instead she placed a full focus on it, and once she reached the age, joined up in the Duke's army. Her parents had begged her not to, and it was hard to leave them behind, but the siren call of that little filly in her proved louder and more convincing.\n\nDuke Gerlach had given her more than a chance to be a knight, he'd given Hard Cap the dream she'd been working for her whole life, a purpose and a flag to lay down her life for, and the sword to carry out the justice the nation demanded. Before Cap had thought of knights as being a more elite soldier, but in the rush of combat the full truth of the title revealed itself."

It went onto say that because he'd worked less than 45 hours a week for the past two months, he was no longer covered by the National Health Redoubt. But that was flat out impossible, he was one of the last griffs out during the siege of the Imperial Palace, there was no way they'd deny him care!\n\n"Next!"

Ludwig shakily pressed the letter down on the counter and tapped his claw against it several times.\n\nThe mare slid the paper down to her level and pushed up her glasses, her eyes darting to the most relevant places of the document, a practiced motion she'd done thousands of times.

For as grueling as prison labor was some days, most were like any other day on the job, which was still difficult, but far better and fairer than he expected. As Lindert chewed his food slower now that he'd all but inhaled half of the meal, he looked out to the giant wooden posts he was fixing wires to and couldn't help but think of home.\n\nFive children and a wife, all had to depend on his paycheck, which was smaller under the command economy. Sure, he knew striking would lead to jail, but with less food coming to the table, something had to be done.

Though the guards of the estate looked on with contempt, his own company carried no weapons apart from the sword which never left his claw. His approach was slow, methodical. Against the advice of all around him, he had ventured alone through the gardens and to the front doors, moving at a snail's pace.\n\nThe Duke brought up iron walls around his heart and gently pushed open the doors. Curtains fluttered from the cold breeze flowing through the doors, the sound of the outside rain leaking into the dark halls. The guards had all been allowed to stay, but most were relieved of their duties by her. Her offices and rooms lay empty, save for the sound of Gerlach walking through them.\n\nRounding the top of a staircase, Gerlach saw her. The Duchess of Strawberry, Gabriela Eagleclaw, turned her eyes from the window where she'd watched him approach. Before now, there was some inkling of hope within her heart that he would at least look the same, but absent from the Duke's eyes was the optimism she so loved to indulge in.

Gabriela's eyes narrowed. She was never one to hold back words from Gerlach. Her frankness had always carried a legitimacy in conversation that he had admired. Before, it had served him as a reality check, but now, it was his greatest opponent. "One ruler with absolute power rests in Griffenheim now, and it makes no difference what his name is! You have become everything you hated!" She tightened her beak in rage. "You killed more than just him."\n\n"And I'd do it again," Gerlach said, leering back at the Duchess.

His youngest, a sporty young griff with dirt perpetually on his face no matter how many times you scrubbed it off, held his head high as he spoke, "That's what Mom said!"\n\nA chant of 'yeah!' and 'that's right!' came shortly after, which brought a chuckle from both Lindert and Rose, the latter of whom was pulling her beloved from the swarm of children. "I think you owe us some stories," She said with a wink. \n\n"You're not mad at me?" Lindert stopped the walk back inside and cocked his head.\n\n"Well, at first I was furious." Rose started with a nod, "But the more time that passed the more I understood, and the more I forgave you. It was not easy taming this pack of chicks, but we made it work, and the checks that came in kept us afloat.""

feathasia_iron.23.d:0 ""Bill, bill, coupons," Conrad shuffled the small stack of letters he'd skillfully pulled out of his mailbox with one claw while the other held a bag of groceries, something he'd gotten good at from the years of repeated routine during the martial law, "bill... Letter from the Imperial Government?"\n\nThe slim amount of attention he gave the envelopes suddenly became total. The Imperial Government didn't send letters to just anyone, and if they did, the matter would have to be of high importance. Holding the letters in his beak for a brief enough moment to open the front door to his quaint one-story house, Conrad went straight for the couch to the immidiate right of the door and plopped down, setting the groceries and every letter but one down on the coffee table before him. "Hey honey, you might wanna come here for a minute." He called to somewhere in the home.\n\n"What is it, dear?" The voice of his wife called from the kitchen, along with the sounds of vegetables being chopped.\n\n"The Imperial Government saw it fit to send us a letter, must be big." Conrad called, getting a little quieter once he saw his wife enter the room, along with their daughter and son from the room they shared down the hall from the kitchen. Silently, Conrad looked at each one of them and heaved in a heavy breath as he tore open the letter and unfolded the paper within.\n\nHis expression told the whole story, first apprehensive, then relief, and then utter joy all within the span of a moment. "I... don't believe this." He looked up, tears welling up in his eyes before flowing down. "They say they're going to be paying off the home, our mortgage is going to be paid for by the government from now on."\n\n"What!?" Conrad's wife bolted forward, quickly grabbing up the letter before quickly succumbing to the same wave of emotions her husband had. She took him in the thightest embrace they'd had since their wedding day, before kneeling down and including the children in the hug too. "That's unbelievable!""

feathasia_iron.24.d:0 "The writing was on the wall, written in Gerlach and Gabriela's claw-writing: The Bronze Sentinels had outlived their usefulness. Tonight, these words would become historical fact.\n\nThe insidious group led by the even more insidious Godfreid Heeren had outposts all across the Herzland, but most were located in central Griffenheim and deployed as needed. Usually, this would make the task of crippling or arresting their leadership difficult as it'd require a nationwide coordinated effort to strike all at once, but their headquarters in the capital decided to hold an uncharacteristic banquet. In other words, all the eggs were in one basket for the taking.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had discussed issuing a declaration to simply dissolve the group and rescind their authority, but almost instantly, they both realized Heeren wouldn't take it sitting down and would likely respond with hostility. So instead of going through a costly and destructive skirmish with the Bronze Sentinels, they decided to use the banquet to behead the snake.\n\nNearly a hundred soldiers followed their Duke into the Sentinel's headquarters, arrested the guards at the door, and any on their way to the hall as they entered. Shockingly, most accepted their fate, likely thinking that their dear leader would avenge the injustice. Then the strike force cam to the large set of double red doors that the feast was being held in, laughter could be heard coming from within as the troops got into position.\n\nThen all at once, Gerlach kicked the doors in and the hundred soldiers with him rushed in and fixed guns on everyone in attendance around a long black table. The response was immediate as every Sentinel, including Heeren himself, drew their firearms right back. "I wouldn't if I were you. There's one hundred guns trains on you and many more waiting outside." Gerlach's voice was laced deeply with venom as he strolled into the chamber, like he'd been waiting to say these words for years. He stared into those hawkish eyes of Godfreid and smiled, feeling his old self return for just a moment. "The Imperial Government no longer recognizes the Bronze Sentinels as their secret police, but instead as a terrorist organization. You are all under arrest."\n\nOne by one, the Sentinel leadership surrendered, and the look on Heeren's face when the cuffs went around his claws was worth every Idol in the Empire. Every one of them would be placed in a different prison, and every one would never see daylight again."

feathasia_iron.25.d:0 "Much was changing across the Empire, the hard and commanding nature was giving way to a more free and fair society, but something that never changed was the respect the soldiers gave to their beloved Duke. Starting from one end of a sea of soldiers gathered in the stone-brick ground of the De Vleugels Military Academy, every few steps saw the pair of soldiers stood before him turn and stand at attention to make a path for him.\n\nFinally, after passing by hundreds of soldiers, Gerlach climbs the small set of stairs to a circular wooden stage prepared for just this occasion, and once he stood center in it, every soldier clicked their heels and saluted in one united motion. The aging griff looked around, nothing stirred under that bright sunny sky but him observing it. Finally, gulping down his anxiety, the Duke could feel the wheels of history turn just as he had when he spoke to the people from atop a military vehicle years ago.\n\n"Until very recently, many of you would've called me the Iron Duke, and some of you still think that way of me, but today I come to you seeking to reform the armed forces the same way that I was reformed not long ago." A certain tenseness washed over the crowd, and the heaviness of it threatened to choke the words right from Gerlach's beak, but he pushed through. "For the time of martial law, you were the sword that cut a path to freedom and the shield which protected the people, but those were different times, and we now must adapt to the present."\n\nHis stomach began to tie itself in knots as he could see confusion growing among the troops, but he persisted. "The former army which commanded you has since been abolished, and in its place, I hereby announce a standing army of honour, of mercy, and of order. No longer will your arms be pointed at your fellow countrygriffs, but out towards any enemy who dares encroach upon our nation!" Gerlach gulped, and suddenly the knot unraveled, the tightness in his throat vanished, and instead a fire rose in their places. "From now on, the laws that govern you will be fair instead of cruel, the common soldier will be given a say on what happens to them and how their military is organized right on down to the unit level, you will be given back the respect that all free griffons deserve! Soldiers of our new free army, do you accept my proposal?"\n\nFirst there was silence, then in an instant, like a firework going off, the mass of troops exploded in one voice as they once had moved with one action."

feathasia_iron.26.d:0 "Duke Gerlach drummed his claws against the handle of his cane, which leaned against the large, long table in the studio booth. Next to him was his beloved Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, and next to her was a volunteer voice actor, and so was everyone else around the set of microphones. The idea was genius: Read out the newly passed Economic Bill of Rights to the people of the Herzland in multiple different voices.\n\nThe thought was, at least according to Gabriela herself, was that by reading it out this way, it would show that it gives everyone a more powerful voice than they had before. To the slightly grumpy Gerlach, it meant having to share a bit of the spotlight he'd grown so used to.\n\nThen the short tune playing petered out, and that was the Duke's cue to start, which he did after quickly clearing his throat. "My beloved subjects, for the past few years your way of life has been kept in the grip of an iron claw, which has only recently released you and thrown away the gauntlet. Parliament is back and martial law has been lifted."\n\nHe glanced over to the griffon across from him, who picked up the verbal baton without missing a beat. "However, the realities of the command economy of those tough times has illuminated certain truths which have become accepted as self-evident. The hours you had to work were not sustainable, the conditions you had to live under were not acceptable, and the uncertainty thrust upon your families was not permissible."\n\nThe mare next to Gabriela spoke in a thick Buckmour accent, "To remedy the ills that the command economy has caused, it is not enough to simply lift it, the same way that healing a stab wound is not to pull out the knife. The wound must be tended to, the blood must stop flowing, and it must be sewn shut completely."\n\nNow it was Gabriela's turn, who began before pausing after hearing her own voice, only to then resume. Gerlach couldn't help but admire her as she spoke, "In other words, instead of passing token, piecemeal reforms that don't go far enough and are always under threat to be reversed, a bill has been passed which is built right into the new constitution. This will guarantee everyone with inalienable economic rights that will entitle everyone to..." Everyone in the booth took a breath in and spoke at the same time with a rehearsed cadence."

"Hey, you're gonna lose the race at this rate!" The voice of his beloved Gabriela brought his head out from the trees that lined the old railroad the pair were skipping along, and back to the task at claw.\n\n"What are we, chicks?" Gerlach rolled his eyes, but couldn't hide the smile coming across his face as he took bounding steps between the gaps of the rail, only ever touching the wooden planks. In their youth, before either of them had any real power or responsibilities, this was where both of them snuck off to. Then he could hop between the boards with ease, but in his age he could only settle for large steps. "Besides, you're cheating, you know?"\n\n"Ooh, check it out, a snail!" Gabriela gasped, ignoring the attitude coming from her other half and pointing to it.\n\n"Cool, I'm sure there's none other like it." He smirked, before letting his expression and his gaze fall to the ground, as though a sense of guilt was tugging him down. "I feel like we've said this before. After everything, we're still the same old griffs, huh?"\n\n"Wrong!" She said scooping up the creature in her claw, "We're stronger, like everyone else."\n\n"Gabby, do you think I did the right thing?" Once more, Gerlach's frankness was his own worst enemy, having doused a bucket of cold water on a warm moment for possibly the hundredth time in his life. "Do you ever think about how things would've been if Dawnclaw never..."\n\n"We'll never know, dear. They might've been better, or things might've been way worse." Gabriela glanced away from the snail and to her love, "But what I know is that we did the best with what we had. Neither the tyranny of Dawnclaw or the Iron Duke could crush that seed of hope which blossomed forth from the bloodiest of grounds. So yes, Gerlach, I think you did the right thing in the end. But I'd be remiss if I didn't say...""

feathasia_iron.28.t:0 "All Is Lost"
feathasia_iron.28.d:0 "A large bed in the Imperial Palace was Gerlach's prison, and his sentence had started a week ago. The life of the Duke was one of loss, seeing the Empire around him decay, his beloved country and people fall to ruin, and then hearing the news of the young Emperor's passing. It was all almost too much to bear.\n\nBut seeing the love of his life's eyes lock onto his in desperate fury, fighting for the very same things he was, only to fall by his own claws was too much to bear. Now there was nothing left and nothing that could be done, and the once small part of Gerlach that blamed himself had grown into an all-encompassing, all-controlling behemoth. The punishment for these crimes was to be carried out by laying in bed until death by hunger or a broken heart, whichever decided to take him first.\n\nThe words of his departed love, Gabriela, pounded through his head like a vengeful spirit, pouring salt and alcohol into the wounds he caused. Tyrant. Murderer. Liar. Each one hit their mark with perfect accuracy. He'd won over Dawnclaw and restored peace to the Herzland, but it cost everything he ever wanted to protect.\n\nTears flowed down from his eyes onto the sheets like blood from the open wound of his heart as he stared into the same ceiling he had for the last six days, waiting for death to take him. Then came a knock on the door, a worker in the palace that dropped meals off by the door only to pick them up cold and untouched hours later. Each wrap of knuckles against the wood shook thoughts loose from his head like apples from a tree, until one knocked square against his temple.\n\nWhat emerged was the realization that not all was gone. Nearly everything was, but beneath all the mountains of loss and grief and pain were the people. The people he had sworn to protect, the ones he had fought so valiantly for against all odds. In those knocks against the door, the Duke's purpose came flowing back to him.\n\nThere was indeed nothing left at all, but there was much to be done. His heart lay shattered, but all its pieces were intact. Everyone in his life that he loved was gone, except for the people."

feathasia_iron.29.d:0 "Of all the materials and resources in short supply during the last few years, the one that hurt the most to do without was criticism. Doing so would earn one punishment of all varieties, from a simple fine to extensive jail time depending on the nature of the offense. While this was essential to securing peace in the region, critique could no longer be done without.\n\nTo this end, the even-clawed Duke Gerlach ordered the construction of public forums in every town and city, no matter how small or hostile to his rule, to replenish the supply of criticism and utilize it for the better of the Empire. In a speech over the radio, the Duke declared, 'A tyrant rules with a deaf ear to his people, but a ruler reigns only hearing the words of his citizens.'\n\nThe words still tasted sweet on Gustaaf's tongue, once a mayor of the city of Katerinburg, now the head of its public forum, as he seated himself in the large chair that presided over the great hall. Next to him, in an equally large chair, sat a bright blue griffon before a typewriter. Outward, rows of curved benches, all facing towards the tall podium where Gustaaf sat, each filled with griffons, ponies, and all other manners of citizens from the Empire looking back at him.\n\n"Now," The aging griffon announced, clanging a gavel against the podium's dark surface, "One at a time, please come up and state your issue, and my lovely assistant next to me will catalog them, and send them straight to Griffenheim. Who's first?"\n\nWithout missing a beat, as though he were waiting for his moment, a gray griff with long black hair flew to the stand in between the podiums and benches, "What I demand is an end to the rationing program! We have Greifenmarschen to grow us all we could eat, so why must we starve ourselves?" A chorus of agreement came from behind him.\n\nTaking his seat, a red pegasus slowly walked to the stand, "I, uhm, I'd like it if we could get rid of curfews. Thank you!" She practically squeaked before returning to her seat with applause. More of the same repeated throughout the day, with Gustaaf and his assistant meeting it all with a smile. It was strange to hear nothing but negative things all day and feel happy about it. But it was the voice of the people."

His voice echoed in the huge, dim warehouse, "I'd like to th-thank you for coming to this m-meeting. Are th-there any concerns you want to tell me?"\n\n"Yeah, I got one!" A griffon nearly three times the size of Aart stood up, "Are you actually gonna help us out? 'Cause we've had a couple griffs come out here and promise to help us, and they didn't do a thing!"\n\n"Yes!" Aart pushed his glasses up, "D-Duke Gerlach has decreed th-that a link between state and worker must be made. Th-the command economy left no room for growth or change, so we're taking any su-suggestions to improve."\n\n"How about some more time off, for starters." The hulking griffon announced, to cheers and hollers from his fellow workers. "I mean, I got two kids at home, and I can't even see them grow up because I work too much!"\n\n"Oh, and how about a few smoke breaks!" Another griffon from the back piped up, eliciting another round of loud agreement. "Can you do that for us?"\n\n"Th-that and more!" Aart smiled, something he thought he wouldn't get to do in their presence. The expectation going in was that they'd rip him apart for the poor state of things, and considering his size, he couldn't put up a fight. "I'll get word to the Duke right away! You sh-should have these benefits by next week."\n\n"Get down here bud!" The large brawny griff who first spoke out motioned for Aart to come down, only for the shrimpy representative to be picked up and tossed into the air, and caught by a forming crowd of strong griffs below."

Garrit, an earth pony whose family moved from Rottendedam, was a natural when it came holding his breath, but Flip, a stout griffon from a nearby town, had practically grown up in the water.\n\nThe pair sucked in a huge gulp of air and dived below, and several moments passed of nothing but a few bubbles escaping to the surface, Flip was the first to emerge, followed almost immediately after by Garrit. "I win!" He declared, only to be met with a splash of water by his friend. Retaliation was instant, and the two were now engaged in the next improvised competition of who could outsplash the other.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest which were decided in short order, this one would be cut short with the all-important cry from the docks nearby, "Supper's ready! Come on back now!" The two kids looked at one another, and narrowed their eyes, as though reading the other's thoughts and accepting the challenge. The score for the day was tied. It was now or never as the two broke for the shore, heaving themselves into the water like a fish that escaped a hook.\n\nWhoever reached the shore would be crowned top swimmer, and neither was about to give up the title. Just as the sun met the horizon, Flip touched his claw to the sand and cried out in victory, only to swallow a mouthful of water and cough. Still, his opponent conceded, and slapped a towel around him and then himself, laughing as they started their trek back to base camp."

It was early in the morning, with the sun barely beginning to crest over the horizon, but the Duke had been there for hours even before that.\n\nRottendedam was hosting a grand festival, and the leader of the Empire could hardly earn his title if he weren't present, but the night before the big day, the Duke couldn't sleep. And instead of letting his mind wander beneath the covers, he took a walk to try and clear it instead. The years hadn't been kind to him, developing a cough from his pipe and a limp from the times he foolishly tried to lead from the front.\n\nSparking up the bowl of his pipe and taking a long drag, his thoughts drifted to Rozenkamp, the first casualty of martial law. That one moment of mania which sparked everything. The chaos that ensued, and the order that followed. The wars which came to pass, and the unbridled peace that they brought. The ire and admiration of his people, both of which he more than earned through his deeds.\n\nIt wasn't long before these thoughts sank into guilt. For as much as he'd done for the people, he couldn't ever shake the truth that every deed was done to earn the admiration of someone whom he killed. That everything was simply an attempt to exorcise the ghost of his beloved.\n\nGerlach gripped his pipe tighter, a single tear flowing down from his blind eye, as he finally arrived at the crux of his insomnia. Were she alive today, would Gabriela be proud of him and his actions? That every hard decision he had to make on the road leading to this moment was worth it?\n\nSorrow mixed with certainty in his heart to form a bittersweet cocktail of emotions as the Duke hurled his pipe down into the waters below, hung his head in his claws, and sobbed. As the sun rose over Rottendedam, the answer couldn't be any more clear."

feathisia_rozen.4.d:0 "Of the half-hearted resistance to our new order, none has been a bigger thorn in our side than the so-called 'United Front'. Consisting of disparate forces of the unpatriotic wing of the PvdA and the FNV, as well as the few Harmonists with spines, the United Front was led by a rather unstable council called The Big Three. Gerben Kogchel, Godfreid Heeren, and Dobbelsteen Moerman all fought our government in separate parts of the country to little avail.\n\nThankfully, the terrorists of this organization were scattered and unorganized, making them easy prey for the Crimson Army. One after another the prominent leaders had been hung, with the riff-raff beneath them imprisoned without hope of release. Justice had been rendered before it could be stolen away once more. \n\nHowever, the last execution scheduled for this particular day was for General Moerman. Before the civil war, he was a faithful soldier of Duke Gerlach's army, forming the elite Commandotroepen. Were they not in league with the lumpen, they'd certainly be an invaluable force. None of that mattered for the towering griffon, his number had come up, and he refused all attempts to join our cause. Thus the floor dropped out from under him, but curiously his neck didn't snap.\n\nOnlookers watched with shock, which grew to horror as time passed and Moerman still clung to life despite the tight rope squeezing away his life force. The hulking soldier held on for nearly ten straight minutes, his expression never wavering from the steely determination he walked onto the platform with.\n\nHowever, after the twentieth minute, life finally began to drain away from him, and he uttered his final words before slipping into the silent embrace of death."

Every day in the building was like being back in the trenches until the terrorists were finally crushed. In that newfound and fragile peace within the Parliament building, one of the first meetings among what remained of the government took place.\n\nIn a dark room, lit only by candles and whatever sunlight bled in through the only window at the end of the chamber, Herman Rozenkamp spoke to the motley government for the first time. "Gentlegriffs, I do not wish to sugarcoat the situation. Everything is on fire, the people detest us, and even our armed forces do not trust us." He began, pacing around the long table that housed the few remaining FNV and PvdA MPs who remained loyal out of a mixture of fear and desperation. "Worst yet, this revolutionary council cannot get along! If we do not improve the situation quickly, Feathisia will plunge into another conflict. We've been given a mandate from the people, and we must not let them down."\n\nThe old griffon was precise and held his usual command over words, but given the situation, he sounded like a young boy playing pretend more than a strong leader. "For this reason, " he continued, stopping to stare out of the solitary window, "I ask that you put aside your differences and come together for what is right for the people. Rozenkampfism speaks to the best parts of the FNV and the PvdA, patriotism and socialism, liberation and unification! You don't have to like one another, as I'm sure you won't, but for now, follow my lead, trust where I take you, and we will build a Feathisia that shall satisfy both of your interests."\n\nThe remaining griffons of the Provincial Revolutionary Council looked at one another with utter fatigue. The right hated the left, and vice versa, but they'd been fighting one another for so long that they didn't have another battle in them. Thus, they begrudgingly agreed to Rozenkamp's demands."

When the civil war began, he had expected the soldiers flying his banner to perform well, but he never thought that they'd pull supporters from either side. Much less to become a fighting force large enough and capable enough to wrest control of the country.\n\nBut there he was, looking out into an ocean of loyal griffons all staring back at him. Rozenkamp turned his head up, studying the crowd, letting the full extent of silence rest upon their shoulders before he finally spoke. "Working griffons of Feathisia, nearly a year ago the entire country was in flames. Many of you were without homes and without food, forced to bear the full brunt of the war that hereditary reactionaries started. Many of you in the military also doubted our intentions, as was your right to. If the administrations before leveled the country, then it's only right to be wary of ours today."\n\nThe way his voice echoed through the streets of De Vleugals was uncanny. Absolutely no one made a sound. "Now, every worker is housed, fed, warm, and safe owing to the work you all have put in. I am both humbled and proud by what the working griffon is capable of, but even this much I am not satisfied with." Rozenkamp slightly shook his head, and the audience began to murmur in hushed tones, only to stop when their leader continued speaking. "Indeed, I am not content with reconstruction, but a rebirth of the Herzland and its people!"\n\nThe griffons exploded into applause, which the aging Rozenkamp couldn't help but relish in. Nodding, he hoisted his fist into the air and bellowed over the crowd, "For all that we have accomplished, there is still not justice as long as impurity taints our lands. There is no security if we cannot defend ourselves. And there is no freedom so long as reaction and equine-capitalism remains. I ask you, working griffons of Feathisia, will you aid me in the construction of a true worker's state?""

feathisia_rozen.7.d:0 "Among the most brilliant ideas of Caramel Marks was her definition of those deemed unfit even to be proletarian. These were the lowest dregs of society who perpetuated nothing but brutality and poverty, but worse yet, through their idiocy and degeneracy serve as an invaluable asset of the hereditary reactionary and the parasite. The Lumpenproletariat, as she dubbed them, were the criminals, the homeless, the deeply mentally unwell, the workshy, and the antisocial. However, her definition does not go far enough.\n\nThe truest form of socialism is not the kind that worships the works of Marks like a religion, but the kind that expands and improves upon her works as material conditions demand. In this way, the lumpenproletariat of Griffonia are also the equine, in a cruel twist of irony to Marks, the nobility, and those griffons who are in league with either of them. The wealthy of Feathisia, even in our most desperate times of freefall, were the equines and the nobility, not the honest griffon who worked his life away. While they struggled to keep food on the table, and had no choice but to descend into homelessness, the equine and the noble alike got fat off of the work of others. How else is one to look at them but like a leech or a tick?\n\nBut more importantly, how else is one to treat them but like a leech or a tick?

There are more complications and contradictions that must be ironed out if we are to navigate through the issue, and the order of the day is to ascertain the fate of those griffons who have been ensnared by the reactionary, the parasite, and the lumpen.\n\nThere is nothing more heartbreaking than hearing a story of an upstanding griffon being laid off from his job only to hear about that company owner giving himself a bonus for the action days later. Through no fault of his own, the working griffon descends from his rightful proletarian place to the bottomless pit of degeneracy. Society has failed the griffons who turn to crime to get by, who become homeless after losing their livelihoods, or those who go without rehabilitation or counseling because the problem is invisible to the powers that were.\n\nWhile there is no question that presently, in function, the griffons who qualify as lumpen serve the purposes of the hereditary reactionary, the question that needs answered is whether or not they can be saved. Can the state reach down into that unfathomable pit and pull back the honest griff from its clutches? Can the spirit of the griffon be unchained from parasitism?

feathisia_rozen.9.d:0 "The mind of a child is among the most imaginative, the most honest, and the most curious, but frighteningly enough, it is also the most susceptible to corruption. Because a child is like a blank slate, it is our duty to make sure that how they're brought up and what they're taught is proper so that they gain immunity to the vile poison of the lumpen.\n\nHowever, this only pertains to the children born into the next generation, not to the current one. Most children of today have been liberated from the systemic brainwashing of the equine-capitalist education system. This machination, which saw fit to seize the minds of our youth, the most promising and most vulnerable among our people, and warp them into an unthinking, obedient machine has been thoroughly smashed! Most schoolgriffs today are now experiencing an education that is unlike anything before in history, and in this way their minds are truly free.\n\nFor as fortunate as the current generation is, this does not apply to all children in the country. Foals of the equines, as well as children of the nobility and reactionaries, are barred from school, and cast to facilities that only educate their kind, but this presents an interesting dilemma. While the equine is a hereditary reactionary that will only grow up to serve the fetid interests of equine-capitalism, the child of the reactionary, the nobilty, or the lumpen are different.\n\nJust as regular griffons, their minds are blank slates, and moreover, if we could save the current generation of children from corrupting education, then it follows that we can do so for the children of our enemies. However, hardliners in the party say that the line must be drawn somewhere, and that we can save the youth now out of necessity, but extending our claws to the parasite only invites it to be cut off. In the end, a decision must be made, and we choose:"

Make no mistake, this policy is not taken out of love for them or compassion for their kind in the slightest, but pure pragmatism. For as much work as we've continuously put into unshackling the economy from lumpen control, we must acknowledge that for now it still is inextricably linked to them. In other words, if we were to simply begin the industrial slaughter of our enemies, the results for our economy, our military logistics, and our political apparatus would be absolutely devastating.\n\nFor every one death, one job in the economy would be taken down with it, and worse, several soldiers would have to be taken from the front to tend to them. This is especially true for those of the nobility and the wealthier equine, as their deaths would leave a considerable power vacuum. This is something we cannot afford. Beyond that, why would we flagrantly and voluntarily destroy everything we've worked so hard to stabilize when doing so would also deny us an invaluable opportunity. The lumpenproletariat must not be killed, they must not even be harrassed in their daily lives. Instead, they must be chained to the same servitude that they've chained griffonkind to. Anything less is a miscarriage of justice and anything more is sheer brutality whose blowback would destroy us from within.\n\nThe issue of the day is not to enslave the lumpenproletariat or not, but how should we treat them once they are in bondage. Treating them with some degree of care may result in less of them dying off, more productivity, and overall an easier supervision over them. It may not be easy to convince the common soldier fighting the forces of equine-capitalism to then treat them well, but it could lead to better outcomes overall.

If we are to save Griffonia from degeneracy and all the rest, then we must have an answer for every issue that arises.\n\nThe particular order of the day is on whether or not we should expand the definition of lumpenproletariat and hereditary reactionary to the diamond dogs and the zebras. In theory, the nobility has had no greater ally, no fiercer protector, and no more adamant supporter than the diamond dogs, so they might as well be lumped in with them. However, they can also be shown a better path and become just as fierce defenders of Rozenkampism as they were for crown and country.\n\nThe issue becomes much more hazy when talking about zebras. On the Griffonian continent, there are not many of them to be found, and where they can call home is a small stretch of territory not far from the embrace of the vile equine refuge known as the riverlands. While our reasons for detesting the equine are justified and founded in fact, and though the zebras are of an equestrian ilk, we have no real reason to hate them. This is not to say that we shall leave them alone, no, if they are to present themselves as an ally to reaction or capitalism, then we shall present ourselves as an enemy to them. But if they present themselves as an ally, then we shall embrace them as such. The question cannot be answered on a broad racial basis, but instead handled case by case.\n\nA motion has just been called in the party on the treatment of diamond dogs, and the vote has turned out:"

A soft tune, a wordless guitar ballad of the national anthem floated through the speakers before being cut off abruptly. A tinny voice came through speakers across the nation, the strong words of Herman Rozenkamp.\n\n"Before us, working griffons of Feathisia, are the works of the enemy. These seemingly benign pages are in reality the insidious tools they used to brainwash us, corrupt your children, and destroy the country. The rifle and the artillery cannon can inflict catastrophe, as the civil war taught us, but the book of the lumpen can erode the very soul of a nation and its people, making it perhaps the most devastating weapon in history."\n\nThe wind picked up, sending shivers through the residents of the nation, who stared on at the books they've read all their lives with newfound fury. "The action we are about to take is a symbolic act as well as a necessary material action. When we destroy these works, we  deny the parasite their most dangerous weapon. They cannot hurt us, our children, or our country any more! Working griffons of Feathisia, I have only one thing to ask of you: Will you claim this victory?"\n\n"Ja, mijn Volksleider!"

Have a seat!" The griffoness on the opposite end of the room had only recently been promoted to her post, having taken it from an older stallion, and still hadn't gotten used to speaking as a superior yet. "So, like, we have to go through a couple questions, should be really easy, ok? Oh, and shut the door behind you, if you would."\n\nSlipping the door shut behind her, she sat in the rightmost chair in front of the desk, which squeaked in protest. The buzzing of the lights above her, the stiffness of the chair, and knot quickly forming in her stomach all made it harder to sit still or think clearly. "I'm not in trouble, am I?" The mare said, looking to the perpetually flowing snow globe on her bosses desk instead of the griffon herself.\n\n"Oh goodness no! You're one of our more productive equine employees, we wouldn't dream of firing you!" Star wondered if anyone actually fell for that saccharine sweetness in her voice. "We just wanna know— Look at me."\n\nSugar Star felt like she'd just swallowed a cannonball. The subtle, but cordial, anxiety in the air suddenly shifted and the office now felt more like an interrogation room. Slowly, young mare pried her eyes from the desk and into the bright, gentle eyes of her manager. "That's it, not so hard, huh? Now, the folks upstairs already know your family information, but we just need a teensy bit more so we have a full picture. Think of it like a census!

Typically a bustling spot in the heart of Rottendedam, business had slowed down lately owing to the change in sentiment across the country. There was still enough to get by, but her family barely made a profit anymore because of the boycotts to 'equine capitalist enterprises.'\n\nAll of that political stuff went over her head though, all Flower knew was that she needed to work twice as hard for the customers she did get. On this particular sunny day, a party of three griffons flew down, likely on a lunch break from their job at the docks, and took their seats. As Flower took their orders, a couple snide remarks here and there turned what would otherwise be a routine ticket into an ominous feeling in her gut. Still, money was money, and she was in no position to turn them away.\n\nTime passed and the young mare had come back with a variety tray of shrimp on a stick. Some were spicy, others leaned more on citrus, and some were just grilled with the usual seasoning. As soon as she set the tray down, the little prawns still sizzling on the platter, one of the griffons seized Flower by the mane and held her head down onto the order. The heat scorched her fur, and she could feel it singing her skin beneath, and all she could do was scream as the three griffons laughed. Another, not satisfied with the display, took a glass full of alcohol and smashed it against her head, the shards cutting into the side of her face and the booze making each cut feel like it was on fire.\n\n"Alright, that's enough," A coarse, commanding voice boomed from behind Flower Crown, causing the insipid trio to immediately halt what they were doing. Taking the chance, the mare crumpled to the ground and wept. "You three are under arrest for harrassment, destruction of property, and vigilantism."\n\n"They didn't hurt you too bad, did they dear?"

But then Rozenkamp, that cunning old griff took command of the country and brought it back from the brink of death.\n\nIn his past life as a drunk, no one would give him a job or even the time of day, but Rozenkamp's government got him off the bottle and into the workforce. He had to admit, a shovel felt much better in his claws than a glass, and the feeling he got from finishing an honest day's work was unlike any buzz he'd experienced before.\n\nSitting on a sturdy bench overlooking a clean street, Clyde watched schoolgriffs cross the street, with their teacher following close behind, to the Buckmour Center for Science and Culture. A novel new facility thought up by the big names down in De Vluegals to enrich the minds of the young ones and inspire a passion for their culture. At least, that's what they said on the pamphlet.\n\nWhile he wasn't a particularly smart griffon, and while his life up until now was fraught with misfortune and tragedy, he could finally feel proud of who he was and what he was doing.

Everything froze. The captain had stopped walking, and the inspector silently pinpointed the source of the noise in his mind. Marching right over to the source of the commotion, Benito found a crate labeled as crab meat and knocked his claw against it. Hollow. \n\n"Captain."

For decades, the continent has rotted owing to the putrefying malice that the equine and the lumpen have leveled upon griffonkind. Our country just a few years ago was driven low, down into disgrace and despair, or in other words, precisely where the equine wanted us. But no longer!" His voice boomed across the city, carried by loudspeakers and radios strategically placed all along the streets. The crowd which took up the bulk of the city exploded into a deafening tidal wave of applause.\n\nWith a single raise of Rozenkamp's claw, the noise came to a stop, his ears ringing from the clamor. "The outside world has given us every expression of vitriol, but we do not care! We do not need their approval to do what is right, we need only to know that it is justice! Beyond this, what we are doing is not cruel to the lumpen or the equine, we are merely reversing the roles!" Another explosion of applause, broken up only by another sentence from the Volksleider.\n\nPointing somewhere in the sky, Rozenkamp let fury take up his voice, as though he were ordering the last charge of a triumphant battle."

Since before the civil war, the only griffon who truly understood the ideology was its inventor, and this simply wouldn't do.\n\n"So we're socialist, but also nationalist, and despite that, we're not reactionary?" A young party clerk asked, tilting his head.\n\n"Correct, but we're not above using reactionary methods to achieve socialist aims," Rozenkamp replied matter-of-factly without the slightest hint of impatience in his voice or ire for a lack of understanding. Rather, he addressed the room like a schoolteacher. "The economy is jointly planned by worker and state with expansive welfare. While at the same time, we maintain a strong national pride and cultural purity, a degree of chauvinism with other countries, and the utilization of lumpenproletariat as a valuable labor source."\n\n"And that doesn't go against the spirit of equality that Marks spoke of?" The clerk spoke up again, looking as though the answer he just received spawned more questions.\n\n"Not quite." Rozenkamp scratched his head in thought. "Marks spoke of equality, but also of lumpen, which is to say, two tiers of equality. There is the proletariat, who in our country are untainted, honest griffons, and the lumpen. No inequality can be found among these classes. Certainly, our vertical way of governing and compulsory labor may appear unequal, but it is productive inequality. In short, we simply have two tiers of equality like Marks intended."\n\nThe young pupil massaged his temples, seemingly straining to process the information, when another griffon across the table from him spoke up. An older griffoness with a scar running across her beak, "Can you help me to understand what a Proletarian Nation is?"\n\n"Easily done, my dear, just as the proletariat have a right to revolt against exploitation and tyranny, nations themselves have that same right. Feathisia was once mighty, but then it nearly disintegrated, and now, after our reformation, it stands far weaker than it once was. Moreover, we're hated the world over for actually taking the equine to task, which provides the conditions necessary for our nation to revolt against this unfair treatment and seize our destiny the same way the proletariat does!""

While he is in great health and even better spirits, there will come a time in the future when he will die. Hopefully, this date is far on the horizon once every ambition has been fulfilled, but when it does arrive we must be prepared.\n\nFailure to establish succession law, however worrying it may be to establish, will result in greater chaos down the road. Hypothetically, if our dear Volksleider dies, the country is liable to have a crisis over who takes his place, and in this anarchy, our Glorious Revolution may very well come undone. So for this reason a meeting has been called within the party to ascertain this uncertainty.\n\nThe provisions on the table are as follows: The successor can be named directly by Rozenkamp himself, and this choice is subject to change at any time, which is the more orthodox option. Alternatively, the new Volksleider can be decided by a vote within the party itself, which is the preferable and more stable option.\n\nThe vote has been tallied in the party, of which Rozenkamp himself abstained, and in the end, the final count was:"

Claus had the benefit of being a quality assurance worker at the local candle factory, which in his city of Grieslein only worked him for 7 hours a day, 4 days a week, leaving him with a considerable amount of free time.\n\nToday was a special day though, not only because it was his day off, and not only because he finally figured out how to get himself drier than usual, but because later that day a new movie was going to be released. I Married a Noble, he believed the papers called it, was the story of a veteran coming home to his wife after a grueling tour at a Lumpen Work Facility only to find out that she was of noble blood.\n\nThe movie practically wrote itself, but also spoiled itself. Everything good that was bound to happen was given away in its title, but despite that, Claus still wanted to go and see it.

Beside Ernesto was his defense, who whispered he was sorry in his ear.\n\nBefore the wars, Ernesto had been in love with a mare named Stained Glass, who used to work in the temple near across the street from where he used to work. They quickly fell for one another and got married soon after. When the Rozenkampfists took power, this all changed. The two couldn't bear to part, even if it meant certain death for the both of them, so Ernesto took to hiding his beloved in the basement of his home. Their plan worked for a long while, but things ultimately came crashing down around them.\n\nBreaking his gaze from the table, the entire room becoming watercolor from his tears, he watched as a soldier dragged Stained Glass down from the witness stand and across the courtroom to an exit. She wore a muzzle, as did Ernesto, and the two screamed as loud as it would allow them to, their eyes stinging red from hours and hours of crying. The pair never broke eye contact with one another, despite the objects being hurled at them, as she was dragged out of the door, never to be seen again. It didn't matter if she was going to prison or a a labor facility, as soon as that heavy door clicked shut, she was dead and so was he.\n\n"And as for you, Ernesto, the court finds the evidence against you overwhelming, you are a culture traitor."

Haven't you noticed your out of breath more often? That you're antsy when you ought to be calm, and wide-awake coughing when you should be sound asleep? Haven't you noticed your beloved turning their nose up at you because of that rancid smell?\n\nMore than this, honest griffon, when the authorities looked into it, they actually found that cigarettes were one of the first goods sold by equines in the country.

Tour guides would pose as professors and give a distorted version of an equine-capitalist or reactionary seminar, libraries would be on full display so anyone could read the preposterous works of yesterday to see just how far we've come. In this way, the campus itself would become the spectacle.\n\nWhile not much use today, it will serve as an invaluable time capsule for the future generations of the state, and allow them imagine how worse things would be had degeneracy gotten its way and fully appreciate all that the Volksleider has done for them."

Ever since she transferred to the Angriver Lumber Front, she'd been plagued with nightmares, but this was common among her fellow slaves.\n\nThough she'd been having a terrible dream about pulling all of her teeth out one by one, what woke her was loud music being played from the speakers around the camp. Every pony in the cramped tent had the same thought at the same time, and sprang from their beds and scrambled into formation in the center of camp.\n\nThe sky was gloomy, the ground was muddy, and towering trees loomed over the camp along with the vengeful guards pacing around the prisoners like predators. Then that voice came through the radio that made Flower's heart sink straight to her feet, Herman Rozenkamp, the Volksleider, or the most successful slave driver in the world.\n\n"Griffonia, lend me your ear! From the icy shores of New Skynavia to the bustling streets of Karthin, from the wineries in Aquila to the ricefields in Lushi, from every working griffon to every laboring lumpen. Today we claim final victory!" The soldiers scattered throughout the camp let out a deafening cheer, shooting celebratory gunfire into the sky, only deepening the pit in Flower's gut.\n\n"When we first began our crusade against degeneracy years ago, we hadn't a prayer of success. The deck was stacked against us, with the equine and the parasite unleashing everything in their arsenal to keep us shackled. But the forces of the noble, the lumpen, and the equine failed to defeat us when they were at their strongest, and now their power has been shattered and the continent has been reborn!"\n\nThe pieces fell into place. Flower let the tears run down her face as the rest of the speech became muffled and distant. No matter what had happened, from the harassment and humiliation at her work, to the relocation of her family away from their homes, to the first day at the facility, she'd always held onto the hope that things would get better. That her labor would set her free or that the regime would fall. But as she quietly sobbed, the realization could not be more clear."

The party is completely split on whether or not to redeem the boy, with either side entering into screaming matches whenever the other so much as speaks.\n\nProponents for the redemption of Grover VI say that he is far too young to be rendered reactionary, and that he is no different from other griffons in their ability to learn. Moreover, they posit, Grover VI would be an invaluable figurehead for the People's State, and a legitimizing force for the party if he were to come out in support. Beyond this, if redemption is not possible, then what would the party's plan be for dealing with him?\n\nHowever, proponents against his redemption say that he represents a long line of feckless, reactionary emperors that sold out griffonkind for the equine-capitalists, and to offer their claw to him is to offer the equine a puppet to destroy everything our Glorious Revolution has accomplished. These hardliners say he is incapable of redemption, and even if that wasn't true, the risk is not worth the reward.\n\nThe votes have been cast and resulted in a tie, meaning that the Volksleider himself will have to break it for either side. If one side wins, the other will be bitter about the defeat, but ultimately concede to the will of their leader. After a tense moment of silence, the decision has been made:"

But, the ardent fighters in the Bronze Sentinels stayed behind their leader, Godfreid Heeren, and followed him to the capital in De Vleugals. On a cloudy day, with rain just beginning to sprinkle over an audience of thousands of the elite, black-clad griffons, Marshall Heeren stood atop the roof of a local business that hadn't been leveled by bombs and spoke to his troops.\n\n"Sentinels, I am humbled and honored that you would follow me from the fire and chaos of the civil war to where we currently stand now. But I have one thing to ask of you if you are to stay under my command. Are you afraid of the dark?"\n\nThe crowd cried in one voice, "No, Marshall, we fear nothing!"\n\n"Excellent!"

They abandoned the country in its most desperate hour of need before, during, and now after the war. Instead of helping Feathisia back to its former glory, they insist on tearing it down and utilizing the destruction to further their ends. Is there anything more cowardly?"\n\n"No, Marshall!" The audience boomed once again, refusing to budge as the rain began to pick up and the sky darkened.\n\nHeeren paced from one end of the roof to the other, his voice carrying louder over the rain, "On my orders, the provisional government has seen it fit to issue bounties for the heads of these traitors, and sentinels I tell you now that it is your job to plunge into the dark and brighten it with gunfire. Do you get me?"\n\n"Yes Sir!"\n\nLightning tore a blinding white scar across the sky, and the thunder exploded with such noise that it shook the very city as Heeren concluded his speech."

Nightfall had shrouded their approach to the mansion of a wealthy and influential baron, which was surrounded by brick walls and long lines of hedges. The sight of such decadence would've driven the soldiers to nausea were their mission less important.\n\nAll of them nodded, and promptly flew over the walls in formation before scattering to the different sides of the estate that were lit up from the outside. Light meant someone was there, and that's precisely what they were after. Marshall Heeren had given them a covert and personal order to seize the stolen wealth of all nobility, by any means necessary, both to fund the reconstruction efforts and to set an example for the affluent industrialists in the country. They were not about to let him down.\n\n"Now!" Captain Shortclaw bellowed, and all at once, the sentinels crashed through the mansion's windows and began destroying everything in their path not of value, screams of the home's staff and family shattered the tranquil quiet of the night. For the Captain though, he simply kicked in the tall front doors and marched straight in through the havoc. There, rushing up the stairs before freezing in place, was the griff of the hour.\n\n"Baron Cloudfall," Gustavo grinned in stark contrast to the screams as he slowly made his way towards him, "just the griff I wanted to see. Now, you have something we want, and if you, or anyone alive in this gorgeous estate, wants to see the sun rise, you're going to give it to me." \n\nA dark spot spread across the baron's gaudy purple pants, and it took all of Gustavo's strength not to burst into laughter from the pitiful sight. After a few futile pleas, more than a few tears, and a crack across the head from a rifle stock, the baron slowly slinked into one of the lavish rooms, and pointed to the bed. Without hesitation, Gustavo flipped the bed over to reveal a hidden trap door, and upon opening it, a stash of gems, gold, and jewelry looked back at him. "Thank you, Cloudfall for your generous donation! How kind of you!" He said with a wide smile as he shot him between the eyes. Strolling down the stairs with his packs laden with loot, he gave one final order for the night."

Gathered here, ostensibly invited to discuss terms of contracts for reconstruction, was all of what remained of Feathisian industry: Mine owners, mill tycoons, and the union leaders for a range of different key industries from textile plants to food production. Each had a paper in front of them signing control of their enterprises over to Heeren specifically. As the Marshall in question began walking to the end of the room, he let the thumps of his footfalls punctuate the silence, before he stood over his chair. "This is not a negotiation."\n\n"Then why are we here?" Walter Aldus, head of the union for grain mills, asked with a twinge of annoyance, tapping his claw against the paper before him. \n\n"You are here, Mister Aldus, and everyone in this room is here, to bend the knee. You've come here to pledge fealty to me." Heeren glared at Aldus with such intensity that a hole might bore through the poor griff. \n\n"Yeah right," Marcel Vouwe, owner of nearly all coal mines in Feathisia, rolled his eyes, "You really expect us to sign these? What do we get in return?"\n\n"You and your family's lives." Heeren turned his piercing gaze over to Vouwe, the room becoming deathly silent and increasingly tense, "what I am offering you is a chance to live on the right side of history. Join me, not the FNV, not anyone else, and you will be amply rewarded. Go against me, tell anyone what happened here, or violate my will in any way, and I will hang you and your family's bodies up from the production floor until you rot away to bones. You know who I am and you know what I've done. Make the right choice." \n\nWere Marshall Heeren any less imposing, any less menacing, or any less brutal than he was, this coercion would fail. But precisely because he was a maniac of his word, because the provisional government was toothless, and because they had no choice, each and every griffon in attendance signed the paper without hesitation and passed it to the end of the table.

Today, in the sleepy town of Klauwermack, a story told many times across the Grand Duchy repeated itself once again. \n\nA Bronze Sentinel officer flew in place, overlooking what was once a peaceful street from his hometown that had been annihilated in the civil war. Progress on its reconstruction was coming along surprisingly well owing to the order and discipline imposed upon the workers, despite how much they protested the treatment. A little under half of the buildings that once stood proud were restored to their former image, and hardly any rubble remained in sight, but from the corner of his eye, he saw a girl throw down her tools and storm off.\n\nWith a sigh, the officer flew down and landed in front of her in one swift motion. Eyeing her up and down, he saw that she wore an ornate necklace and asked, "Are you a noble?"\n\n"I was," She huffed, trying to rush past the officer, who merely shifted back in front of her and prevented her passing. "Look, I'm so done with this! I need a break!" \n\n"Careful now," He warned her, taking a menacing step towards her, "That sounded an awful lot like insubordination. Break time isn't for another three hours, so resume your duty. I won't repeat myself." \n\n"As if!" The noble spread her wings and tried to take off in flight, only to be cracked across the face with a rifle by the officer. She crumpled to the ground and started sobbing almost immediately, which enraged the officer.\n\n"I warned you, now get back to your post immediately."

 feathisia_heeren.6.d:0 "One of the guiding philosophies that served Heeren well both during and after the civil war was, 'all is fair in love and war.' Although now in the ashes of the conflict, he saw it fit to add 'and politics' onto the end.\n\nWhen the last shots were fired, a provisional government was established on an uneasy and tense foundation. For the first few weeks, decisions were made by a de-facto council of three, Anton Moldernik, Baron Herman of Voorst tot Voorst, and Marshall Heeren himself. In this immediate stage, their goals to stabilize and rebuild were identical, but as reconstruction progressed, the Marshall had begun to drift from their vision for a new Feathisia. More than this, the writing on the wall, written in their claw-writing, was that Heeren was living on borrowed time.\n\nThen Voorst tot Voorst made the biggest tactical error of his entire career, and Moldernik agreed to it: Holding elections for provincial leadership. On his own, Marshall Heeren was wildly unpopular, and only remained in office before the war thanks to his sentinels continually voting him in and intimidating those in his district to do so as well. Without a proper electoral or government apparatus, the Bronze Sentinels could stuff the ballot box, threaten voters, bribe officials to look the other way, and destroy votes against them as they saw fit. After all, it's not the votes that matter, but who counts them.\n\nSurprisingly, this wasn't necessary for some towns or provinces that Heeren and his soldiers had fought valiently to defend or liberate from the socialists, and with a few speeches made by the Marshall to win them over, he had enough organic support to make the forced elections look genuine.\n\nPolitics was no different than warfare, and often the same maneuvers that worked in combat worked in governing. By the end of the first elections, Heeren had amassed 55% of the popular vote through a combination of his methods, not enough to take over completely, but enough to build a foundation to do so once reconstruction was complete. For now, his sentinels sat on over half the provisional government seats, allowing him to act with impunity over the whole country, and rebuild it in the exact image he wanted."

"Your Sentinels were harassing reconstruction workers and issuing them with quotas for the day, which they faced harsh punishment for not meeting."\n\nOn the opposite end of the long, dark table was Heeren who clasped his claws together and listened, "Sounds right so far."\n\n"Glad we're on the same page," Herman spat, "the report then goes on to say that one such worker, upon receiving his quota, complained that he would be unable to meet it, prompting the Bronze Sentinel overseeing the town to pull out his rifle and strike the worker multiple times. The workers were then in an uproar, which was quelled by, again, your Sentinels drawing weapons on them and ordering them back to work."\n\n"This is standard procedure, and it's impossible to argue that it hasn't gotten results."

Most storefronts in the country had two floors, with some having three, where the first floor served as the actual place of commerce while the others served as a home. That is, many store owners worked where they lived, and while a boon to productivity, it also presented a unique vulnerability.\n\nAfter picking the lock to a particular pony-owned grocer, Frederick snuck in and fastened the door located in the back storage room shut, so no one could exit from it no matter how badly they wanted to. As casually as a walk in the park, the city planner skipped out of the store back to the quiet street he entered from, making sure to grab an orange on his way out. The sun had yet to rise over Arwie, and most of its populace that weren't soldiers were still fast asleep. There were no witnesses.\n\nThe spry, young soldier picked up one of two bottles resting on the sidewalk, each of them filled with gasoline and topped with a soaked cloth, and lit it before hurling it into the upstairs window. His favorite part of the job was watching as the fire spread from a dim light in the window to an inferno, and the screams of the equines that woke to find themselves engulfed in flames was just a bonus.\n\nLike always, instead of jumping out of the window to safety, the ponies simply ran to the door that had been rigged only to open from the outside, and that's precisely when Frederick threw the second bottle inside. The particular mixture inside these bottles was set to burn out on their own after about 20 minutes of burning, so as to not damage the perfectly innocent griffon-ran businesses that may neighbor the pony-ran ones.\n\nWith a whistle, now punctuated only by silence instead of shrill shrieks, Frederick brought out a notepad with dozens of names and crossed four of them off."

Sour remarked colorlessly, placing his hooves on the table out of reflexive servility. Julius uncorked the vial and pressed it to Mint's lips, which he readily opened, letting the brew flow straight down his throat. Nothing appeared to have changed as the griffon fastened the equine's hooves to the machine with small belts.\n\n"Ok, first question, just to calibrate the lie detector: What is your name?" Julius asked, staring intently at several parts of the instrument.\n\n"Sour Mint." He replied without delay, as though he were reciting something he'd said a thousand times.\n\n"How old are you?"\n\n"38."\n\n"Ok, perfect. Now, where is your resistance group set up?"

His father worked the overnight shift at the textile mill that sewed the uniforms for soldiers, while his mother worked the day shift, each of them working 12 hours and ensuring someone was always home for little Sebastian.\n\nBut today was different. When his father came through the door, he looked as though he'd been wrung out, and instead of hugging his son or spinning him round as he loved, he simply collapsed onto the short couch in the cramped living room of their apartment. Sebastian's mother, who nearly dozed off in the chair next to the sofa, barely had the energy to greet him. "I've had it up to here with work!" His father yelled but was muffled by cushions.\n\n"Tell me about it, dear." Sebastian's mother lit a cigarette and took a long drag, expending just about half of the stick. "I can barely feel my claws anymore. I wish we had more time together, but..."\n\n"But country comes first!" Sebastian leapt forward onto the couch expecting his father to be happy to see him, but when he poked his head out from the sofa, his father looked aghast, as though that was the last thing he wanted to hear. "That's what the Volksmaarschalk says!"\n\n"Son... I love you, but please don't say things like that." Exhaustion and dread lined his father's voice, "That griff is a monster, and I won't have his name spoken in our home."\n\nSebastian merely cocked his head in confusion. The things he'd heard in school about the Volksmaarschalk were the opposite of the treason his father spat, making any love he had for his family drain out from his heart. "I... Should be getting to school now, Papa." He hopped back to the floor and started for the door before turning around and taking one last look at his mother and father.\n\nWithout a hint of remorse, Sebastian slipped out the door and hurried to the nearest soldier to report them for treason."

Two Bronze Sentinels, one in-training and another who was training her, were told that this farm was hiding nobles. Only, the trainee couldn't break through the windows, even after shooting at them, or kick in the door despite dozens of kicks. It was as though the entire structure was enchanted to resist her.\n\nHer trainer, who had been off eating lunch finally returned, and flew down beside the griff under his wing. "So, what's the problem? This should've been a big pile of ash by now, why isn't it?"\n\n"I just can't break in!" The griffoness stomped and huffed, "I tried busting the windows and the door, but nothing works! I swear, when I get that door open I'm gonna bathe in their blood, YOU HEAR THAT IN THERE?"\n\n"Whoa there, little miss berserker," The trainer teased, nudging her with his shoulder as he pulled out a lighter from his pack with his other arm, "let me show you a little trick I learned in the civil war."\n\nTaking a moment to pull out a cigarette, the old soldier casually lit it and breathed in, but kept his lighter ablaze. "See, them communists in the civil war, they'd usually have ponies on their side, and they'd enchant everywhere a soldier would think to hit. But, they wouldn't protect it..." He calmly strolled over to the straw lining the cottage and caught it on fire, which quickly spread across the building. "From fire."\n\n"Is it really that easy?" The girl laughed in disbelief as screams rose from inside the hut, "I feel so dumb! I should've known that!"\n\n"Well now, don't beat yourself up over it, champ, you know now." He cast his smoke into the smoldering cottage and turned to his protege. "Now, what do we say?"\n\n"Thank you for the lesson, Sir."

We have search parties combing through the city, but we suspect a repeat of the republican revolt has occurred and he's been escorted out of country."\n\n"Unbelievable." The marshall drew in several heaving breaths, letting silence permeate the spacious, if but ransacked, office they stood in. Heeren stormed over to the large window in the back of the room and looked out into Griffenheim, a smoldering city still engaged in combat. "Right there," He pointed to a clear spot on one of the streets, likely a busy intersection where general stores and cafes sat, and spoke through clenched teeth, "If I don't have that little pest in my claws tonight, that city square will be your grave."\n\n"Sir?" The courier's voice sounded as though he were about to cry. "We will bring him to you."\n\n"I hope you do, private, for your sake."

Weeks had turned into months, and still, there was nothing. There were no clues, no leads, and no witnesses. The prevailing theory within the administration was that just as Archon Eros had hidden Grover V away during the republican revolt, he had done so again for Grover VI. \n\nFrustration was growing within the Legion's high command, as more and more competent leaders were being executed for their failure to locate either the Archon or the young griffon. More desperate and expensive measures had been taken to find some kind of result, only to come up empty. Today, an emergency meeting had to be called on the topic due to these shortcomings. Officers and generals from across the country met in the Imperial Palace over a meal of smoked fish and rice to discuss the matter. \n\n"And what do you suggest we tell the public?" One older artillery General practically shouted between mouthfuls of fish, which he barely even chewed, "Our mistake, but we let the boy emperor slip through our claws? Have you gone mad!?" \n\n"That is not what I'm saying, Sir," A younger Major from the secret police replied calmly as he sawed through the head of his fish with the side of his fork, "Of course, we tell the masses that Grover VI is dead, I'm merely saying that the search should continue more covertly and without the expensive collateral damage of reprisals. It's not as though we aren't looking, more that there aren't any leads. Trying to grasp Grover VI is like trying to grasp smoke!"\n\n"I've heard enough." Volksmarschalk Heeren grasped the tail of his fish and picked it up, swallowing it whole and standing up, prompting every officer in attendance to spring from their seats and salute.

Sometimes it was easy to power through it, but as the week dragged on, the twelve-hour shifts began taking their toll, and it became impossible to ignore.\n\nThroughout it all, two things kept her fighting spirit up: Her children, the disparate resistance fighters in the forests, and the rumors that Grover VI wasn't dead. The press had gone to great lengths to say that he was, even showing off the body, but gossip travels quickly in a society with many secrets, and within a few months, the entire nation knew. \n\nNo matter how powerful the weapon, or devastating the army, nothing can dislodge a free thought. No one dared to utter the rumor, lest they and their family were to disappear to Penal Detail, but the working griffons of the Legion rallied around the battle cry of patience. \n\nIt didn't matter if they worked Sylvia twelve hours or twenty, and it didn't matter if she collapsed from pain on the job, because she was patient.

But, the prospect of being raised by traitors was far more frightening to young Sebastian, and so he took the risk.\n\nHowever, much like the fear of the Boogeymare, or the equine under his bed, this anxiety proved to be nothing more than a childish fantasy. In reality, the care the Youth Barracks gave Sebastian was far better than his own blood. Rather than being a parent with whatever energy remained after a grueling twelve-hour shift, the sole job of the caretakers was raising the youth of tomorrow. \n\nInstead of bland, unsatisfying meals, he got as much as he wanted to eat from the mess hall! Instead of never getting to play, the caretakers and his fellow orphans got to spend every day in total glee! Instead of pleas never to join the army, he was taught to shoot and even given a Junior Sentinel uniform! His parents had always taught him that the Legion was something to be endured, and feared, but the Legion had more than earned his trust and his admiration. \n\nEvery day was more exciting than the last, with camping trips to the wilderness, trips to military bases to learn from the best, and even a trip to the Penal Detail facilities where he got to throw rocks at the toiling equines!

The extremely crucial rescue mission was losing its gravity every time the young boy asked, 'Are we there yet?'\n\n"Not quite yet, Grover," The Archon reassured the emperor with a sigh and a sideways glance to the guard whose shoulders Grover sat atop, expecting the same frustration and finding none. "But I must remind you that your very life, and the life of the Empire, depend on us getting you to the Bronze Mountains safely."\n\n"Doesn't feel like it. Can I have ice cream when we get there?" Grover VI asked, completely unfazed by the weight of the situation. "Oh, and we left Sir Steelbeak back home, can we go back and grab him?"\n\n"Most likely not," The wizened old griff looked to one of the guards with a look that silently asked who Grover was talking about.\n\n"His plush knight, sir." The stalwart dark blue dog responded in a voice like slate, his armor clinking as he marched forth. \n\n"No, Grover. We need to focus on your safety and well-being above everything else. The Empire is under attack, and our lives would be forfeit should we return to Griffenheim."\n\n"Awww, you're no fun, Uncle Eros." The young griff pouted, puffing out his cheeks in defiance.\n\n"I agree with the Emperor," The soldier who Grover rode repeated, chuckling heartily to himself, causing the other guards to join in as well.\n\nIt would only be a few more hours until they reached their emergency hiding place in the mountains, but it would feel like days before they actually arrived.

This was how it was to raise the now thirteen-year-old Grover VI, with all the stress and rebelliousness of youth. \n\nAs though this was not difficult enough, the Gods saw it fit to bless the young emperor with both an insatiable appetite for reading and debate, frequently wearing down the old Archon Eros with discussions that lasted for hours. The books that were retrieved by supply runs to the outside, thanks to a few remaining loyalists and resistance movements in the country, were never enough for him. While this was great to alleviate the agonizing bunker blues and pass the time, it proved exhausting to match the young griffon's conversational pace.\n\n"I don't understand, Uncle Eros," Grover VI practically bounced in his rickety wooden chair as he moved his rooke into position on the chessboard, which was worn from the thousands of games they'd played. The tunnel, for being a fortified and hidden bunker, was surprisingly comfortable, with multiple small rooms, and lighting in the form of portable lamps and glowing fungus. There were a few boardgames, and by this point, hundreds of books about the tunnel, but nothing perked Grover's attention quite like chess, "if Heeren is such a bad griff, why don't the people just overthrow him?"\n\nThe Archon, now showing his age with bald spots throughout his coat, responded by taking Grover's rooke with a knight. "They've tried, but with an army that size everyone rebelling at once couldn't stop him."\n\n"Then why doesn't the army rebel?" Grover VI beamed as Eros, in his exhaustion, had taken the bait for his next move. His queen swooped in and demolished the Archon's queen.\n\n"They're simply too loyal, Grover. No force on earth could dislodge that." The old griff sighed as he scanned the board for the next move. He simply moved his knight out of harm's way only for Grover to snap his rooke across the board as though he were expecting that move."

Grover had insisted on cremating him, or at least marking the grave, but eventually gave into his guards' caution. Anything that what could be used to find him would be used to find him, so he couldn't even properly mourn the griff who had raised him so far from home. \n\nThat proved to be the final straw. Standing over that grave, the tall and calculating Grover VI stared on in the direction of Griffenheim, buckled a satchel at his side, and spoke to his guards through ground teeth. "I've had about enough of hiding. The whole continent has been held hostage by that madgriff for far too long. I'm going to free it."\n\n"Sir!" One guard blocked the path in front of Grover just as he began to walk. "I cannot let you march to your death."\n\nGrover VI's chest swelled with fire and his eyes filled with frenzy as he leered down at the dog, "Your orders are to march with me through fire and water, to the ends of Griffonia and to the grave." He pushed past the soldier, who had been one of his lifelong friends, and raised his voice as he kept moving. "I know I might die, but if there's any chance that the people can be saved by doing so, then I'll take it. I'll be damned if anyone stands in the way of my birthright or my people any longer. You will take me to meet the resistance and you will march behind me to Griffenheim."\n\nThe two guards exchanged a look on the hill, grass dancing in the wind, before joining rank behind their emperor. "The first Grover forged the Empire," Began the Emperor, turning his gaze over to the setting sun, "the second expanded it, the third made it whole, and the fourth reformed it." \n\nThe fire in his voice was enough to burn down the whole Legion.

He and his troops were the last free griffs in the Legionary State, and he intended to keep it that way. \n\nIn the forests of Katerin, hidden in caves or tunnels or treetops, Olaf led the last disparate resistance group that split off from the Three Day Brother War. Some troops that were supposed to have been assembled in the city square that was massacred were late to join up, or got the wrong instructions, or were just too cowardly to answer the call. But once news had reached them of what happened, Olaf, like many of the comrades under his leadership, rose to the occasion and took to the trees to wage a guerrilla war against Heeren's forces.\n\nWhen they started, they numbered in the thousands, but by the time the Legionary State had declared itself, they were down to just over five-hundred. Now, they were fifty. Slowly, through raids, ambushes, or air-strikes, their numbers were cut down, but as if this wasn't enough, the Legion had seen it fit to destroy any sources of food like farmer's fields or small villages. Starvation, not bombs or rifles, proved their strongest weapon.\n\nSo when Olaf and the dozens of griffs under his command stumbled across an abandoned supply truck on a hunting expedition, their hunger clouded their judgment, and they ransacked it. Little did they know, or rather, little could they know that the water within the truck was laced with a special, potent obedience serum and that they'd set off an invisible, magical tripwire that alerted the Legion to them. \n\nAs Olaf sat looking up at the stars that night, he drank deeply of the freshest water he'd tasted in years, and felt a warm sensation wash over him and a fog descend over his mind. Peace radiated out from his heart, and the caution towards the approaching sounds in the forest melted away. \n\nAll at once, Bronze Sentinels, clad in their black armor with glowing red eyes descended on the camp with their rifles drawn.

What if he actually did manage to make it to the capital of the most fortified, militaristic state on the planet? How would he make his voice heard amongst the people? And what would they even rise up with? But just before his thoughts could descend fully into total defeatism, his nose caught the smell of smoke and cooking meat.\n\nPoking his head out from the tree, he couldn't believe his luck. A fire glowed some ways in the distance, close enough to see that there were three figures around it. He frantically motioned for his guard's attention, and upon getting it, ordered them to surround and neutralize them.\n\nIt wasn't but a few moments later that Grover saw one his guards twist the neck of one soldier as the other smashed the remaining two together, killing one and knocking the other two out cold. Sitting down around the fire and feeling the cold melt away from his body, answers to his worries began to come to him one by one. If he took the uniform of one of these soldiers, which hid his face completely, he could sneak into the capital with his two guards posing as slaves... \n\nAll at once the plan came to him so quickly he felt as though he'd been struck by it.

The top of every other building was staffed by a throng of guards and a modern anti-air cannon, all of which pointed themselves at the Emperor.\n\nPart of him thought that they already knew who he was, and were just waiting for the approval to shoot him down, but a larger, louder part of him told him to keep moving towards the Imperial Palace. Silently he said a prayer to Boreas that his guard's directions were correct and that the sentries by the long, tall staircase that took notice of him weren't about to open fire.\n\n"Halt!" Boomed a voice that sounded far too young to be a soldier. "State your name, rank, and purpose for approaching the Hexagon."\n\n'Is that what they call the Imperial Palace now?'

This would not only save the trouble of waiting on the slaves to finish constructing one from scratch, but also accelerate the speed at which faith disappears by denying a place of worship.\n\nThe second proposes to transform the temples into monuments of griffonian strength and griffonkind overall, and in so doing, transform the worship of Gods into the worship of strength and heroism, which will undoubtedly embolden our troops. Though, this sentiment is only shared amongst a minority of officers, as the worship of griffonkind could just as easily mutate into a new religion, or allow the secret praying to Gods.\n\nHowever, the final proposal is shared by a small minority of officers, but the vast majority of common soldiers throughout the Herzland: Simply level the temples.\n\nAfter a few days of thought, the Volksmaarschalk has decided the fate of the temples:\n"

Leaning on the railing of a high guard tower to a prison in Buckmour, Kiel stared down at just over a hundred troops marching in perfect formation like a director, their steps moving as one thundering boom after another. Only, these griffons had been captured from a raid on one of the few remaining resistance camps set up in the forests of Katerin and Angriver, and now, just a week later, they were perfect, disciplined soldiers in the Legionary Army.\n\nThe credit for this miraculous accomplishment went to a young sentinel in Luxwingburg named Julius, who just months ago had developed a 'truth serum' that chemically altered subjects' brains to prevent them from telling a lie. With a few tweaks to the formula, and some added stimulants that were meticulously enchanted, a serum was concocted that attacked the brain's ability to disobey authority figures, and elevated the part of the brain that controlled submission.\n\nHowever, its uses didn't end with guerrilla fighters or captured enemy troops. While it's true that model behavior is rewarded within the Legionary State, that doesn't mean that workers suddenly love it. For every one act of open defiance, there are a million acts of quiet opposition by the laboring population, creating a hotbed of opportunities for treason. However, spiking the water supply of workplaces with the obedience serum will eliminate every last trace of aversion to the new order.\n\nIn short, the Legion had created the most perfect weapon in response to subversion and dishonesty that history had ever seen. Gone were the days of interrogation and occupation as the state marched boldly into a new frontier of liberation for griffonkind!\n\nThe scientist couldn't help but laugh as he called the ex-resistance fighters to a halt, or keep himself from laughing even harder once they saluted him on instinct. First the Legion had conquered the land, then it conquered their people, and now from the work of an ambitious trainee..."

 feathisia_heeren.27.d:0 "An interesting quirk resulting from Volksmaarschalk Heeren's leadership, owing to dwindling compassion, heightened aggression, and the legalization of violence up until murder under certain circumstances, is the rising prevalence of duels to the death over a wide range of disputes.\n\nTake for instance the case of two captains who were vying for the position of Major in the Romau Guard. Their commanding officer, instead of making a selection based off of merit declared that 'whoever is the strongest shall be promoted.' What followed was a brutal brawl in the CO's office, ending in the death of one Captain and the subsequent promotion of the other. \n\nHowever, this also happens frequently for feuding Sentinel Overseers in the Arbeidsfront, where two or more Sentinels attempt to get the same position, only to descend into a bloodbath to determine who gets it. But perhaps the most peculiar of examples would be what happened in the De Vleugals Legionary Academy not long ago: A girl was courting two griffons at the same time, and when these two, one male and one female, grew tired of competing for her attention confronted her bluntly and asked who she was really after. She only replied, "Whoever is the strongest of course."\n\nAnd there on the brick entrance to the university, the two griffs fought each other for the span of an hour, ending when the griffonness had slain her competitor. While a rare incident, it illustrates that violence has gone from being shunned to being venerated to now being a cultural institution that decides advancement."

The order given to thousands of soldiers was to burn every book in every school throughout the country, and while it had sounded great on paper, the task of actually executing it proved much more difficult.\n\nRogier Nelles had been a Bronze Sentinel since before the civil war, and he'd been flying crates of books from one end of Greenback to a central bonfire for nearly thirteen hours nonstop. When he'd volunteered for the task, he thought they'd simply throw firebombs into every school and call it a day, but the Volksmaarschalk wanted to retain the university buildings and repurpose them into prestigious military academies. So instead of doing the monumental task of burning every single book in the region known for its literature the easy way, they had to do things the hard and tedious way.\n\nSo many books had been incinerated that the sky itself was blacked out from the smoke and ash, and since they'd started so early in the day, the sun never rose over Yale, so the sky only grew darker and darker as the day went on, as though a testament to the darkness to the deed itself. Never before had so much knowledge across so many different fields been destroyed so quickly. \n\nFor as achy as every one of his muscles was, and how his wings begged him to take a rest, pride in his duty prevented him from stopping. He drew a deep breath in of the ash and the devastation and pushed forward into the black day with renewed purpose."

 feathisia_heeren.29.d:0 "It hurt Fine Print to struggle against the rope, her wings and her hooves scraping against the odd mixture of thread and fiberglass that was engineered to prevent movement. The last in a dozen long line of the most defiant ponies in the Legion, each lashed to their own ring at equal distances from each other, Fine Print had been here for what felt like an eternity. \n\nA review of her life would reveal a list of problems with authority, far before the Legion ever took over: A firebrand, a thief, and one of the final resistance fighters. Even when she was put into Penal Detail her fight didn't end, as she led dozens of escape attempts and one failed slave rebellion. Obedience serums were the only thing that seemed to douse her fire, but those were hard to come by in the Penal Detail, and the brew that had to be mixed for it to work on equines made their labor practically useless. So the great minds of the Legion had to think of a suitable punishment for her and equines like her.\n\nThe solution came from a lowly medical scientist who suggested live weapons testing that doubled as medical training for both soldiers and doctors, which was unanimously approved by every panel it came before ending with approval from the Volksmaarschalk himself. This routine of firing on test subjects, then bringing them back from the brink of death through experimental healing techniques, would come to be known as Fire Labor. \n\nA few soldiers marched in from the opposite side of the cavernous concrete room of the bunker Fine Print was in, and took positions behind a line of sand bags, and without hesitation, fired. The rounds that tore through each of the ponies in the line, one by one, were a searing bright red, a magical bullet that the Legion had been trying to perfect since before her sentence.\n\nPain lanced through Fine Print's hooves as she frantically thrashed against her bindings, and miraculously, they came undone. A burning cry of fury from the deepest parts of her, slowly crafted after months of cruelty and torture, streamed out from her mouth in a gutteral scream. She charged the line armed with nothing more than the desire for vengeance and the freedom to die."

Dr. Hinnin, a renowned expert in the Public Hygiene field, read off the results from a chart with disdain. The already cramped office, lined with degrees and propaganda posters the practitioner helped to design, felt even smaller with the news. "What is your combat record?"\n\n"Well," The tiny, timid griffon squirmed in his seat, trying to think of all the times he'd been in fights growing up. The uniform he wore, despite being the smallest adult size, still looked baggy on him. With a sigh, and pity soaking his voice, "I've been in fourteen fights in my life, sir, and I've lost every one."\n\nThe doctor leaned back in his chair, wearing a look of disgust one might reserve for a cockroach, before he laughed uproariously. "Let me get this straight. You have the physique of a child, your strength is less than that, and you've not won a single fight in your entire life. Your disgrace to the Legion is comical," he said, wiping a tear from his eye as he snatched the phone off his desk and quickly dialed a number, "Send the Junior Sentinel in my office to arrest the griff I'm seeing."\n\nIt felt as though the whole world had come crashing down around Abeltje, he wouldn't last a day in the labor camps they'd send him to, assuming he even made it there to begin with. He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry, but more than anything else, he wanted anything except the camps. Gulping down his sorrow, he lunged for the doctor across the cold, steel desk, and slung his fist across his face, inflicting no noticeable damage, but filling his soul with pride. \n\nThe Junior Sentinel burst through the door and pulled Albetje away by the neck, but even this didn't stop the young griff, who bucked his back legs into the soldier, knocking the wind out of him just long enough to thrash out of his grip. Rearing back he went in for another punch, only for the Sentinel to pull out a long knife, and stab the meek griffon under his neck, clean through to his brain."

 feathisia_heeren.31.d:0 "Lieutenant Karl Jonker loved to smoke, not only because of the head rush it gave him, or the empowerment he felt breathing the fumes in, but because it was a valuable investigation strategy. The same mind that made the truth serum and the truth detecting device had also invented a cigarette that assaulted the noses of any ponies that breathed its smog in.\n\nA routine part of his inspection of cargo ships, large and small, was first an interrogation of the captain, followed by a tour of the ship with a cigarette. Usually, these interrogations were short and dull owing to these inventions, and on one such day, the captain of a vessel shipping heaps of enchanted bandages and poultices refused to be questioned. After pinning the griff down, he was fed a truth serum, and divulged that he was smuggling ponies to the Haukland islands, where they then would be shipped to Equestria. \n\nDragging the captain along, Jonker deliberately blew smoke into his face as they traveled below decks, and towards a particular crate against the back of the left wall, hidden by the crates in front of it. With reluctance, the captain pulled the crates back one by one until only one stood alone, which Jonker promptly blew smoke towards, eliciting a round of coughing fits from inside. "Perfect, captain, load up these ponies onto the docks." \n\nSluggishly, and with tears streaming down his face, he pushed the crate full of coughing ponies bound for Penal Detail to the deck proper, and then flew it onto the awaiting docks. The sailor hung his head as he slowly floated back down onto his ship. "One more thing, captain." Lieutenant Jonker leered down at the cowering griff. "Have any ponies successfully made the journey across the ocean?"\n\n"Yes. Dozens." The griffon hung his head in utter shame and despair, only to be stabbed through the top of the head by Jonker, who slunk the knife out and threw the captain into the sea where out of pure rage, the Lieutenant pulled out his pistol and emptied his magazine in the sailor's corpse."

Vast rows and columns of black-clad Sentinels stood side by side with one another facing a stage as far as the eye could see, as though the entire city itself were at attention. \n\nThen the griffon who was carnage and fury stuffed into a uniform took the stage, Volksmaarschalk Heeren. Gripping either side of the dark podium emblazoned with the Legion's symbol, he wasted no time speaking, "My Sentinels, the victories that the Legionary State has claimed throughout the years have been delivered by you! The triumph over equinity, over parasitism, and over weakness could not have been achieved without your bravery to face them head-on and bring them to heel" \n\nNothing stirred and no one moved, as iron discipline kept everyone still in place, save for the grins that they couldn't help but wear. "But for as much as we have accomplished, the Legion's ambitions are not yet satisfied! So long as there remains a single bloodsucking pony on the continent, or a weak and spineless griffon somewhere in hiding, and so long as there is a single degenerate thought in the minds of anyone, our ceaseless battle against cowardice is not complete!" Heeren smashed his claw into the podium, sending a thundering boom throughout the city. \n\n"We have ignited the torch of strength that has cauterized the weakness from our race, and in this way we have claimed our freedom from parasitism, but even this is not enough. We have the forces, we have the numbers, and we have the duty to liberate the continent! Sentinels, will you be the enemy's eternal opponent!?" \n\nThe ocean of soldiers, which had struggled to keep themselves silent so far, could restrain themselves no longer.

While a long, and rather servile document, it makes a few compelling points along with a rather odd request to build an arena. \n\nAs explained by several officials from the Legionary Interior Ministry, this project would generate further revenue for the state while simultaneously providing another way to get rid of fodder and finding the most capable fighters for the military! More than this, the letter goes on to posit, such bloody and public combat would only serve to further glorify the strength of the race and the Legion! \n\nHowever, the cost of this project is nearly prohibitive, and while it certainly will yield results and revenue, the amount of time for the arena to break even in the first place is distant in the future. After several moments of deliberation while pacing about his spacious, and grimly decorated office, the Volksmaarschalk has made his decision:"

 feathisia_heeren.34.d:0 "As the sun rose over the newly completed arena, dubbed the Iron Crucible, an artillery cannon boomed signalling the start of the first-ever Legionary Games, which saw hundreds of griffons and prisoners alike come from across the Legion to kill for the public's entertainment. The first battle had begun with a clean ground made of sand and bits of gravel and glass, but by sunset had been soaked almost entirely crimson. \n\nWatching high up from his personal seat was the Volksmaarschalk himself, and the sights of ponies being dismembered, or griffons slaughtering each other with nothing but their claws was simply intoxicating. Though he'd love to join in on the fun, his personal guards insisted that he stay put, which he begrudgingly accepted.\n\nHowever, after a few hours of spectacle, a particular griffon had caught his eye. A rather small soldier with completely pink feathers was brawling his way through scores of combatants, eventually making his way to a manticore, which he slayed using its own tail against it. The crowd exploded into applause, and even the Volksmaarschalk himself stood to cheer.\n\nSomething about the griff exhilarated him in a way he'd never felt before, and he caught most of his thoughts drifting towards him for the rest of the day. Perhaps, despite the decades of thinking it was impossible, this griff had secured the most difficult objective: Heeren's heart.\n\nThen this pink soldier had pinned another griffon nearly twice his size beneath him, and he stared up into the Volksmaarschalk's eyes for approval. Stunned for a moment, he snapped to his senses, and struck his thumb down, desperately trying to hide his blushing amid the audience's fanatic fanfare. Without hesitation, the pink griffon twisted his opponent's neck and beamed up with perfect legionary pride.\n\nThe Volksmaarschalk couldn't take the heat welling up in his cheeks, and he simply turned to his entourage and cleared his throat."

Heavy weights clung around their legs, spelling out their doom if they so much as moved a muscle, "was I not loyal to you?"\n\n"Your loyalty is not what's in question, Mister Aldus." The cruel Marshall Heeren looked at the griff from the other side of his estate pool with that characteristic glare that nearly pierced through the griffon rather than merely looked at him. Sliding a claw under his cap to casually scratch his head, Heeren turned his gaze around the room. "Or any of yours. The fact is, you've remained as loyal to me as I could've hoped for, and as such you've all become wealthy griffons. But that's precisely the problem."\n\nThe Volksmaarschalk flew up to the center of the pool, making it all the easier for his captives to fall to their deaths. "Just as the foul scourge of socialism has no place in the Legion, neither does capitalism. The state should benefit from everything inside its borders, not you parasites who suck away its lifeblood to fill your personal vaults." Heeren paused as a griff finally fell in the water, followed by a couple more, but continued on undeterred as they slowly sunk to the bottom. "The only people I can trust are my Sentinels, therefore, Sentinels will replace your positions, and the state can finally solidify its grasp over the economy."\n\n"Wait, Volksmaarschalk! Can't we talk about this!?" Marcel Vouwe, the coal tycoon, begged, with tears streaking down his face. "I'll be more loyal than one of your soldiers."\n\n"There is nothing more to discuss. Goodbye."

A few weeks ago in the forests of Angriver, a rare type of fungus was found when a soldier got lost on their way back to camp after hunting. \n\nHis report goes onto detail about red mushrooms that grew on the southern base of the tree, and that they glowed intensely like little jewels in the night all along the route back. An odd quirk, to be sure, but stranger still was the commanding officer's inability to find them the next day.\n\nSure enough, when the sun set, and another soldier was sent out to hunt, the red mushrooms guided his way back. Leading to the realization that they only sprouted at night. The next discovery came upon picking some of them the next day to bring back to camp, whereupon they ceased to glow in the daylight, and began glowing once exposed to darkness.\n\nWhat's even more curious is that after sending some samples to the nearest lab, scientists reported that the supernatural structures within the mushroom were actually absorbing sunlight and releasing some of it once the sun set. A few more weeks of testing, including isolating the part of the fungus that gave it its trademarked functionality, and implanting it into military hardware, yielded the very first night vision helmet for the Legion.\n\nNaturally, after a few test subjects from the prisons tried them on and proved their safety, the prototype was sent to the Volksmaarschalk directly, and he couldn't have been more pleased. The signature intensity of his stare was elevated to previously unknown heights when the lenses of this helmet shone a deep, piercing red. \n\nTypically, such accidents of the lost soldier who found the oddity would be harshly punished, but in this particular case, he was promoted to a high position! Moreover, cultivation of this mushroom has exponentially increased, and production of the helmets has begun in earnest!"

Within an instant, nearly a dozen griffons and a pony guard were there to greet him, all of them soldiers.\n\n"Whoa there, stranger, are you alright?"

His father, having no money for school, encouraged him to go out and sweep chimneys, sell papers on the corners, or on rare occasions, come along for a shift in the mines.\n\nAs a result, this left the young griff completely illiterate, and every time he passed by the library on his way home, he felt as though it were a monument to his stupidity. When the civil war broke out, he stayed in the mines and toiled the same as he always did, but things changed when the conflict ended. A new policy of mutual aid had come to the village, and while he initially refused the requests of his wife to give the literacy programs a try, he eventually gave in.\n\nThe first few weeks were a struggle, and it was hard for Sylvester to feel as though his brain worked at all from how all the words on every page of every book in the library mocked him.

With most of his students, he wondered if they were even listening sometimes, but with Tabitha, there was never any doubt. Turning away from the star student, "But what else? And I want to hear from someone else about this."\n\nReggie, a griff who looked as though he were half asleep surprisingly raised his claw to answer. With a nod from Gustavo, he started speaking, "Well before, like, police officers could just beat down on people and if you tried to stop them, they just beat on you too. But now police are like, community-oriented."\n\nThe professor cocked his head but ultimately nodded once again and spoke, adding more to the answer as he resumed his pacing, "Great answer, police, and the act of policing itself, is vested in the people more than a violent, armed, and unaccountable apparatus of the state. In short,"\n\nHe paused in the middle of the classroom, and stared out into the bright minds of tomorrow,"

 feathisia_kogchel.8.d:0 "Ferris Longclaw had been a librarian for nearly 50 years of his life, but a socialist for much longer. There were few titles underneath the banner of communism that he hadn't read several times over, and as he strolled through the rows upon rows of towering oak shelves in the newly completed Red Spire Library, he knew that he would only need a fraction of the space to hold every theory book. \n\nIt was the empty space that intrigued Ferris the most. Where others saw gaps in the shelves, he saw the potential for new knowledge to fill its place, and as he made his way back to the grand foyer, he felt his heart swell with the thought of new socialist minds filling up each of the shelves in the future. Just before he could become fully submerged in his thoughts, a visitor walked in through the revolving front doors. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave, whoever you are." Ferris called out on reflex, "This facility is still under construction."\n\n"Even an old friend like me?"\n\nFerris turned his head to see Gerben Kogchel himself wearing that all-too-familiar grin. "As I live and breathe!" Despite his age, he flew across the foyer to sweep his friend up in a hug. "I thought you'd be too busy running the country to stop by!"\n\n"Well," Kogchel said, breaking from the hug, "I'm not going to pretend I'm not, but I carved out just enough time for an official visit. The party was against me putting all of our eggs in one basket, but I knew with a watchful eye like yours, not a single one would crack!"\n\n"You flatter me, Gerben," Ferris waved his claw, as through he were dismissing the praise itself, "but you also underestimate the task you've given me. I'm not watching over a basket here, I'm supervising every red star in the sky!"\n\n"The same still applies," Gerben nudged his old companion in the arm, "but how about a tour, for tens of millions of Idols spent on this place, I think I can at least get that, right?"\n\n"Anything for you, Gerben," He started for the left side shelves of the library, "This is the syndicalist section, and past that is the anarchist section, and if we come over here, I was hoping to turn this into the Marksist section. Oh and over here...""

 feathisia_kogchel.10.d:0 "Gerben Kogchel had heard hundreds of people speak about hundreds of different topics, sometimes for a few moments and sometimes for hours, but the short, bubbly unicorn guiding him around her farm could make the most professional filibuster look amateurish.\n\n"So see how this corn's kernels all have different colors!?" Scarlet Star, the pioneer of the Betoverde Bodem initiative, pulled open an ear of corn on the stalk to reveal a stunning display of crystalline kernels, each a separate, bright hue from the other. "That's because I've enchanted it to turn a specific colour corresponding to its nutrient content!"\n\nKogchel blinked, taking a second to process the fast-talking mare's rambling, before a question popped into his head, "Shouldn't the nutrients of corn all be the same?"\n\n"Not anymore!" Scarlet sprang into the air with glee, as though she'd been waiting for that specific question. "So, with magic, you can alter the structure of an object, so I've done this with the composition of several crops to make them more varied and dense in their nutritional content. No other head of corn on the continent has as many vitamins as this one!"\n\n"That's... Amazing!" The chairgriff was taken aback with genuine surprise, "But how can you ensure reliable harvests?"\n\n"Magic has solved that too, sir!" Without prompting, Scarlet Star grabbed a clump of dirt from the ground and fetched a seed from under her thick ushanka hat. Her horn lit up, and a seedling emerged from the ball of soil. "So, with a little bit of sorcery, you can germinate a seed and have it grow within seconds! This can be done to scale, so crop failures are officially a thing of the past!"\n\n"Honestly, if I read about this in the papers, I wouldn't believe it, but seeing it with my own eyes I can still barely believe it's real." Kogchel looked at the sprout in Scarlet's hoof like it were a crystal ball. "This is all too incredible."\n\n"But wait, chairgriff! There's more!" She said before enveloping herself and Kogchel in magic and teleporting to a rice paddy."

The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it any and all faith in financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremism both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PvdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' most radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."

### Leader Descriptions ###
FEA_gerlach_desc:0 "Gerlach Weijermars IV occupies a very strange place in politics.\n\nEntirely separate from the negative attitudes surrounding Imperial politics, the Duke has instead amassed immense respect from almost every class and political affiliation in the Empire and around the world. After ascending to rule in 990, Gerlach's bold democratic reforms caused wide scandal amongst Imperial politics but tremendous support from the populace and combined with invaluable support from a coalition of Nobles headed by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, afforded Gerlach the political freedom necessary to form a constitution. Written in collaboration with the new political parties of Feathisia and affirmed my popular referendum, created tremendous buy-in and unity in trying times. Democracy, once shunned for its association with Republican revolution, turned into Feathisia's greatest strength, a living compromise born out of the struggle between Imperial and Republican loyalties.\n\n'The Silent Duke', a term of endearment popularized by his subjects in reference to his calm, sometimes melancholic demeanor, is a strong comfort for the citizens of Feathisia and even some across the Empire. For even through trying times of an infant democracy surrounded by war, Gerlach IV always finds a way for his people."
FEA_gerlach_married_desc:0 "A significant amount of prying newspapers, suspicious Nobles, and hopeless romantics, were vindicated with the marriage of Gerlach IV and Gabriela Eagleclaw.\n\nAs the heirs of their respective houses, Gerlach and Gabriela's youth was often spent counting down the days until the next royal ball, conference, or gathering afforded them the opportunity to hang out with their best friend, Eachother. For the better part of the last two decades, they served as each other's political muscle, with Gabriela using her many connections and hooks on Nobles to allow Gerlach's reforms to pass unscathed, and Gerlach utilizing his popular support to call more resources and loyalty to Gabriela's growing network of power. Though it was only realized consciously recently, it would not be unfair to assume they've been falling in love for decades.\n\nHowever, one cannot ignore the significant political utility the marriage has created. The popular support and loyalty the common citizens had for the Duke and Duchess as individuals has developed into an almost parasocial phenomenon, as many firmly attribute the recent and significant improvements to the Duke and Duchess' actions. With proven track records of serving the people, either directly or indirectly, they are often the subject of praise, of idealization, and for single Griffons and ponies, pure envy."
FEA_gerlach_evil_desc:0 "Born in the year 960 in the Ducal Estate just outside de Vleugels as the eldest son and heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Feathisia, Gerlach has made a name for himself ever since he ascended the throne. A patient and diligent griffon, the Grand Duke immediately started reforming the Grand Duchy, which was, like the rest of the Griffonian Empire, still reeling from the aftermath of the Republican revolution in Griffenheim. Co-leading a committee with Rudolph Thorbeak, the leading liberal politician in Feathisia at the time, they strengthened the constitution and brought stable democracy to Feathisia. Although the Feathisians had to get used to their new rights, it only took a few years for liberty to blossom and all sorts of parties to pop up.\n\nOne of his most controversial moments saw him blocking the liberal democratic party from government until they expelled any republican sentiments. The Grand Duke explained that the Gods crowned the nobility and that the natural order of things had to be preserved, an attitude Gerlach inherited from his father, who helped fight the Republican uprising.\n\nEven though the country was doing fine, Gerlach never stopped working hard, championing the abolishment of public executions, leading industrial change and whenever possible, supporting Emperor Grover. With the emperor dead and the system, he so carefully built on the verge of collapse, an attempt on his life saw the Grand Duke's last faith in the politicians he allowed to rule fade away. The Grand Duke took full control of the country, now that his old friends betrayed him. He would do anything to protect Feathisia and eliminate all griffons who would stop him."
FEA_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down with the advent of the civil war, as more violent and pessimistic forces took over the country. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Personally, the social democrat leader managed to curb the worst excesses of violence against civilians. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it was time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel gave Feathisia a second chance, hoping to rekindle democracy in a socialist light, to heal the wounds caused by the civil war and mend the country's broken society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon would leave the already battered state vulnerable in this uncertain age."
FEA_rozenkamp_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp was born in Mirabelle, the bustling industrial city in the northeast of Feathisia. Along with his brother Reinoud, the two barely scraped by as children of the working poor. Determined to escape the fate of their parents, both of them enlisted into the army as cannoneers under a young lieutenant van Voorst tot Voorst. The officer taught them not only how to shoot a cannon, but how to shoot a cannon and be a patriot while doing it. The death of their father in a workplace accident made the Rozenkamps leave the military, however. Herman had to take care of his mother and took his father's job. There he saw the difference between the noblegriffon's speeches about love for the country and the reality of factory work. Herman would change it all.\n\nThe Rozenkamp brothers joined the local PvdA, where they were initially suspected as former soldiers. Soon enough, their energy and oratory power got noticed by the party leadership and the brothers rose through the ranks. However, instead of boring party congresses and the administrative work which his brother spent more and more time on, Herman went back to the factories and sometimes even to soldiers. There he found fertile ground for his own brand of communism, called Rozenkampism.\n\nWith the economic crisis raging through Feathisia, Rozenkamp riled against everything. The nobility, the Triarchy and the weak politicians (sometimes his own party wasn't even spared). He blamed Griffenheim and Skyfall, Equestria and the Archons. But as the political instability reached the breaking point of civil war, Rozenkamp was ready for battle. When the red banner flew over De Vleugels, it were Rozenkampists who planted it there. And it will be Rozenkamp who will lead Feathisia to glory. For the Fatherland and for the Revolution!"
FEA_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren was born in Rottendedam to a middle-class family of shopkeepers. He was the world to his parents and the bright young griffon had everything his heart desired, but at school it was already he clear Heeren was problematic. He'd sometimes get overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage and woe to the kid that stood in his way if he did. Growing older, the griffon's way with words and his rage grew into an uncanny sort of magnetism and he easily attracted friends whose slavish attitude helped inflate his ego. Of course, like so many a youth before him, young Heeren thought he had politics all figured out. It was very easy. There were two griffons in Feathisia fit to rule the country, the first, Count Gerlach, foolishly gave his power away in pursuit of cheap popularity. The other griffon would be Godfried Heeren himself, naturally.\n\nHeeren joined the Orangecloaks, a paramilitary group training in the middle of the Great Plains. There his political thought evolved further and he found that his charisma served him well as he rose to a leadership position in the radical group. He quickly adopted the group's anti-pony attitudes and sheer hatred for socialism. When the group failed to win any seats in parliament, Heeren merged the group with the FNV party, negotiating his way into the spotlight of Feathisia's political elite. Afterwards, Heeren and the FNV at large profited from the crisis crippling the country, as the jobless proved loyal new voters.\n\nWhen the Regent Debate busted the coalition government, Moldernik, ever the pragmatist, tried to negotiate a coalition with the PvdA, but Heeren already prepared for a war. He aroused so much suspicion amongst his supporters that the deal busted and Feathisia went to war. Now Heeren was in charge of Feathisia. Those who know him best, doubt this would finally soothe his anger and satisfy Heeren's hunger for power."
FEA_edgar_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel led an unassuming but productive life. Born in a small town near to the capital to a family of bureaucrats, it seemed that Edgar would follow his parents' pawsteps. An interest in numbers and a sense of duty led him to the growing ranks of the ministry of finance. Some may find the work soul grinding, but for Edgar the numbers meant something. Every time the economy grew a little more, it meant more happy families and that money saved on military expenses could be used to fund healthcare that could safe somegriffon's life. His intrinsic motivation and his frankly brilliant work on the technical aspects of economics saw him rise as quickly through the ranks as the rigid structure of Feathisian bureaucracy allowed.\n\nWhen the crisis hit and the 1007 budget was to be presented, a true battle took place between the ministries of economic affairs and the ministry of finance. Pechvogel tried to champion a free-market based budget, while the idiots of EA tried to intervene in the market. Either way, the financial crisis exploded into a political crisis and a civil war.\n\nThe war kept going, while what was left of the civilian government tried to guard De Vleugels. And the wheels of bureaucracy kept turning, with most public servants having a sense of loyalty to their department over any of the warring factions. But alarming news came from Griffenheim as the Imperials marched into Feathisia!\n\nA few days later, a group of soldiers, some wearing caps with a red star on them while others wore Feathisian military outfits, barged into what remained of parliament. Edgar Pechvogel was there, delivering some paperwork personally. The soldiers, in surprising harmony, interrogated everygriffon present, leading them straight to Edgar Pechvogel. After hearing of his ability and crosschecking the list of griffons both parties hated, the soldiers decided that Edgar would do. Not much later, the public servant got inaugurated as the head of the National Salvation Committee. As the numbers turned from money to casualties, Edgar's vivid imagination seems more of a burden than a blessing. Still, Pechvogel would set himself to the present task, doing his best, as he had all his life."
FEA_moldernik_desc:0 "Born as the son of a manager in the Aiwle oil business, Anton Moldernik got the best education money could buy, namely a social science degree at Bruma university in Yale. Both his parents were part of the FNV party and Anton would become a member at an early age. Intelligent and ruthless, Moldernik managed to get ahead in the party and to get himself on the candidacy list, securing his election victory in Aiwle. In parliament, he became the party spokesperson on agricultural affairs, a topic the FNV's main competitor, the FHP, was strong in. Nevertheless, Moldernik managed to impress the populace in debates, presenting his monarchist counterparts as spineless conservatives.\n\nAfter about a decade in politics, Moldernik got elevated to the level of party leader, which he would remain until the Regency crisis broke out. With tensions flaring up, Moldernik sought to strike a deal with Kogchel. Much to his dismay, the deal faltered and his comfortable life shattered into a civil war. It took the nationalist some time to adjust to the new situation, but the fascist grew into his role as leader of the now openly authoritarian FNV. Now that the guns are silent and with his power reaffirmed, Anton Moldernik faces the task of redefining Feathisia and giving meaning to the lives of its people."
FEA_stappenbeld_desc:0 "Bernhardt Stappenbeld grew up in Rottendedam, the port city of Feathisia. Born with an inherent curiosity and a quick mind, the griffon started writing from a young age. Although his fiction was of a mediocre quality, his prose was good enough for the work of a journalist. Adventurous, the Feathisian accepted a job offer to report on stories from Stalliongrad. Over the years, his readers may have found the tone of his stories changing. Critical at first, the griffon living amongst ponies mocked the ponies of the Severyana for revolting against such a benevolent ruler like Celestia.\n\nSlowly but surely, the accounts of failing agricultural plans and empty store shelves made way for intricate essays on Stalliongradian communism and then what his critics called straight up love letters to socialism. When the journalist went home and joined the PvdA on the day of his return, they found a changed griffon. A sceptical journalist crossed the sea, returning as a socialist ideologue. His teachings, brought over from Stalliongrad, attracted a split following; intelligentsia and self-proclaimed revolutionaries on the one claw, and actual workers on the other.\n\nWith revolution raging in Feathisia, Stappenbeld's ranks grew enormously as his prophecy of class struggle indeed became true. The journalist showed himself a capable leader, eclipsing the social democrats in the PvdA and managing to get into party leadership. Now Bernhardt Stappenbeld looked over the ocean once more, ready to put theory into practice."
FEA_vorst_desc:0 "Born into the prestigious Van Vorst tot Vorst family, Herman was the heir to their land. Herman carried his heritage with him wherever he went, learning the traits that defined a good noblegriffon from school and at home. Staunch, conservative, brave and strategic, he graduated top of his class in the officer academy showing that a noble birth did not mean a lack of merit. Serving in many posts, including a fateful while as an artillery officer, the baron became popular among his troops for his no-nonsense attitude and straight up patriotism.\n\nFrom the army, Herman learned the value of hierarchy, of tradition and of the institution of the military. As he climbed through the ranks, he started to flirt with the FNV party, a highly unorthodox choice for a noblegriffon. But the Ducal party had grown spineless, giving to many concessions to weak doves who wanted total equality. When the system broke down, the Baron and soldiers loyal to him stepped in to fight on the side of the nationalists.\n\nHowever, during the fighting, Van Vorst tot Vorst discovered that his newfound allies were little better, discarding tradition in favour of something radically new. They had to be stopped as well and the Baron did stop them. Now the military rules Feathisia, guarding the people against any threat, both from the inside and from abroad. The House of Van Vorst tot Vorst stands victorious and vigilant against threats both foreign and domestic."

FEA_stefan_desc:0 "The cousin of the more famous Gerlach IV, Stefan Weijermars lived in relative obscurity as a curator to De Vleugels art museum. His true passion never lay in politics, although he shared the same enthusiasm for art as his cousin did for running a nation. Described as an introvert, only coming to life when the conversation comes to his passion, it was easy to forget the griffon's lineage when meeting him. Everything changed with the death of his cousin. The Weijermars family scattered when the civil war began, some leaving the country successfully, others shot by marauding Rozenkampists. Stefan was hidden by the museum staff amongst some of the most precious artworks. Only when the civil war died down, with the military securing victory, did Stefan come out.\n\nThe Baron's soldiers located Weijermars and after a conversation behind closed doors, he decided to take the title of Grand Duke of Feathisia. Whether he agreed in an effort to soften the military rule over the country, or because Stefan I was indeed a supporter of military stratocracy is up to speculation, but he must have no illusions of ever obtaining the power or influence his deceased cousin once wielded."
FEA_talonsley_desc:0 "A social and moderate liberal and beloved prime minister of Feathisia, Arjen Talonsley has led the country through an age of gradual destabilization. A griffon of compromises and normalcy, he is not above negotiations and solutions where 'everygriffon wins'.\n\nTalonsley took over the LDP after an incident known as the 'Night of Molenaer', after his predecessor as ruler of the LDP. Molenaer had won a stunning election victory against the monarchist FHP party, but the conservatives threatened to blow up negotiations for a government unless the LDP would openly denounce republicanism. Later on, it was proven that this demand came directly from the Grand Duke, but that night, the LDP was forced to choose between principle or pragmatism. Molenaer chose principles, but in an internal party vote, he was rejected by a narrow margin and Talonsley became head of the party, forging the LDP-FHP coalition. Molenaer left the party and Talonsley lost much of the republican vote to the PvdA, but he had his government. In time Arjen Talonsley and the LDP would shown that monarchy and liberty were not opposed values, but actually complement each other nicely. His free market approach to may see his support decline amongst the average griffon, however, especially during a crisis."

FEA_literally_dice_desc:0 "Out of all the weapons, shells, and bombs in Feathisia's arsenal, arguably the most dangerous is a Griffon who wears floral patterned shirts to battle. Depending on the story, Dobbelsteen Moerman was born either in 984 or at the dawn of time, and has made his name as a celebrity to the people, a nuisance to the police, a disgrace to the general staff, and as a hero to his soldiers. His exploits and successes in combat and training earned the explicit trust of the Duke of Feathisia, and afforded him untold leeway in the creation of Feathisia's special forces element, known as the Commandotroepen. Amongst the paper trail of insults against every political party, 86 arrests, 0 convictions, an ongoing attempt to convince the Duke to fund public gymnasiums, and a standing warrant for his arrest in Skyfall, Dobbelsteen Moerman has already earned himself the distinction as the most well-known troublemaker in the Herzland."

FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_in_freefall:0 "Total Freefall"
FEA_in_freefall_desc:0 "The situation is rapidly deteriorating, as constant warfare has scorched the continent of Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it faith in any and all financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremists both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PVdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."
FEA_bank_runs1:0 "Bank Runs"
FEA_bank_runs1_desc:0 "Decreased confidence in the economy leads to distrust of every economic institution, and this distrust manifests in total panic. Banks are lending at unprecedented and predatory rates, investments are falling through across the board, and if this wasn't frightening enough, the lack of confidence in these institutions has led to people withdrawing their savings en masse. Given that banks use their clients' money for investments and loans, which are then falling through, the money simply is not there to take out, which drastically worsens the problem. This is a horrific cycle that must end very soon or the entire country may come down around us!"

Everything that could of gone wrong, has gone wrong, and Feathisia's political and economic string of misfortunes would be funny if it wasn't tearing the fabric of our society apart. Parliament has locked itself out of compromise, and the crisis worsens by the day. The Duke must intervene, and fast!"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions:0 "Prevent Bank Repossessions"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions_desc:0 "In addition to falling wages, Griffons have been threatened with the loss of their homes, their farms, and their livelihoods. The banks, in an effort to make good on their debts, resolved to take what little our citizens have left. If this happens, there will be no hope of salvaging the situation!"
FEA_trade_union_visit:0 "Visit The Trade Unions"
FEA_trade_union_visit_desc:0 "In times of crisis, leaders usually meet those with influence for solutions to the current issues. Duke Gerlach has instead opted to meet with the workers whose lives have been affected the most by those with influence. Moreover, he refuses to act unless the voice of the worker is heard."
FEA_price_controls:0 "Institute Price Controls"
FEA_price_controls_desc:0 "In these difficult times, the price of staple goods has soared well beyond the reach of the common griff. These prices cannot stand. Duke Gerlach has passed a law dictating strict price controls for these goods so that no griffon goes hungry or cold."
FEA_investment_gamble:0 "The Investment Gamble"
FEA_investment_gamble_desc:0 "Feathisia won't survive without an injection of wealth, and it doesn't need to rely on private groups to get it. Duke Gerlach has taken advantage of his reputation to offer mutually beneficial investment opportunities to an assortment of nations."
FEA_tax_corporations:0 "Hike Corporate Taxes"
FEA_tax_corporations_desc:0 "One of the standing truths of our economy, precluding the current disaster, is the concentration of wealth into the claws of the few. Duke Gerlach has already demanded higher taxation of their wealth in this time of crisis."
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers:0 "Crack Down On Smugglers"
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers_desc:0 "With the breakdown in Feathisia's merchant class, bandits have taken to seizing goods and selling them back at exorbitant rates. Regiments of the Feathisian Army have been deployed to shut down this immoral enterprise."
FEA_cut_federal_salaries:0 "Cut Federal Salaries"
FEA_cut_federal_salaries_desc:0 "The representatives and administrative workers of the government are living well above the average Griffon. In order to balance the budget, this gap must be closed, and their salaries cut. Whether this reduction in salary is more to balance the budget, or a act of principle by the Duke, is up to interpretation."
FEA_save_the_banks:0 "Save The Banks"
FEA_save_the_banks_desc:0 "As though Feathisia did not have enough problems, there are frequent runs on the banks which worsen our situation even further. This, in addition to out of control lending and the loss of investments by the banks, means that our money supply is quickly evaporating. If this situation is to be mended, then all deposits must be ensured and all losses covered."
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes:0 "Moratorium On Estate Taxes"
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes_desc:0 "If this crisis is to be resolved, it will take the effort of Griffons from all walks of life. Favors and kind words to the Nobility will soothe their worries, and gain their backing in our other political actions. A temporary stay on estate taxes will accomplish just this. Besides, the estates aren't producing much value in these trying times anyways."
FEA_eight_hour_workday:0 "The Eight Hour Workday"
FEA_eight_hour_workday_desc:0 "The Duke believes we are not dealing with an economic, or a political crisis, but a societal one. The only way to prevent the breakdown of Feathisia is to offer confidence in the hearts of the people, and allow them to live their lives.

FEA_nationalize_telephone_lines:0 "Nationalize Telephone Lines"
FEA_nationalize_telephone_lines_desc:0 "A significant and rapidly growing industry in the Empire is telecommunications, and it connects people despite vast distances while generating a considerable amount of revenue.

FEA_turn_up_the_heat_desc:0 "Beyond outfitting our frontline troops with cannons, more powerful cannons well beyond the frontline can dispense firepower beyond imagination all along the front from a position of safety. Requested at will, these batteries can dispense fire wherever the enemy wants it least."
FEA_shock_and_awe:0 "Shock And Awe"
FEA_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "On the ground, soldiers fighting soldiers is a fight. On the sea, warships firing their cannons is an engagement. In the skies, aircraft coloring the sky with tracers is a dogfight. But with Artillery cracking the very earth on which the enemy stands on, war is made."
FEA_fix_and_flank:0 "Fix And Flank"

There are 100 different ways to kill the enemy, and by the gods we will find more."
FEA_momentum_and_initiative:0 "Momentum And Initiative"
FEA_momentum_and_initiative_desc:0 "No plan survives first contact with the enemy. Stemming from our renewed care to our Non-commissioned officers, a culture of decisions taken of commander’s own initiative, rather than a top-down approach, allows our Army to discard the dogmatic top-down approach, and keep constant momentum amongst our units."

We must set to building a great Luchtmacht, and we must see to it quickly!"
FEA_small_in_number:0 "Small In Number..."
FEA_small_in_number_desc:0 "It's true that our air force is very small compared to the rest of our neighbors, but that isn't necessarily an disadvantage. A small force means a heightened need to preserve that force by way of training the pilots to fly and engage cautiously, the plane's builders to put an emphasis on safety and longevity, and our officers to utilize our pilots accordingly!"

FEA_airfields_across_the_duchy_desc:0 "It wouldn't do us any bit of good to have constructed a great fleet of aircraft if we have nowhere to oragnize, repair, refuel, or deploy those aircraft from. To remedy this, airfields must be constructed across the country as soon as possible!"

FEA_the_infantrys_saviour:0 "The Infantry's Saviour"
FEA_the_infantrys_saviour_desc:0 "Any particular battle can turn south in a hurry depending on any incalcuable amount of factors, but just as quickly as a fight can turn for the worse, the presence of air superiority and close support can shift it back into nearly certain victory.

FEA_undetected_unexpected:0 "Undetected, Unexpected"
FEA_undetected_unexpected_desc:0 "Up until now, executing air operations at night was seen as nearly suicidal because of the extremely low visibility and high chance of misfiring or accidents.

FEA_spirit_in_the_sky_desc:0 "The shill whistle of a bomb falling from the bays of an aircraft down to the earth is perhaps one of the most frightening things one can hear, but hearing it at night or with your guard down is perhaps the only thing more terrifying.

  FEA_charity_loophole_desc:0 "While most of our population enjoys a comfortable livelihood, some even becoming wealthy, there are still some who are needy, so why not solve this lack of success with the success of others? By allowing a break on anyone's taxes once they've contributed a certain amount of money, we can bolster our economy while also providing welfare without state intervention!"

  FEA_build_the_rottendedam_university_desc:0 "The universities in Romau, Yale, and Griffenheim are some of the best on the continent, but they're also not enough to sate the rapidly rising appetite for higher knowledge in the Herzland! So, to educate even more students and bolster our jobs market even more, a new campus must be built in the heart of Rottendedam!"
  FEA_free_school_lunches:0 "Free School Lunches"
  FEA_free_school_lunches_desc:0 "The families of our country shouldn't have to pay the schools every day to feed their children, or let those poorer students starve because their parents can't afford the fee! These are both failings of the state! From now on, every student shall be provided a meal free of charge! Who said there was no such thing as a free lunch?"
  FEA_free_emergency_care:0 "Free Emergency Care"
  FEA_free_emergency_care_desc:0 "An often repeated tragedy in the country goes something like this: A worker finds success and amasses a comfortable savings, only to get ill or injured, and lose it all to medical debt. No one should lose their success from something out of their control, least of all a medical emergency! So, from hereon, all legitimate medical emergencies will be treated for free!"
  FEA_progressive_income_tax:0 "Progressive Income Tax"
  FEA_progressive_income_tax_desc:0 "Until now, the tax rates of the population have been the same across the board, but it's becoming increasingly clear that this is an outdated model. The poor have less to pay, and tend to spend more money, while the wealthy have much more to pay and tend to save their money. It follows then that the more money one has, the more taxes they should pay!"
  FEA_consistant_public_works:0 "Consistent Public Works"
  FEA_consistant_public_works_desc:0 "Two problems have been plaguing the nation that have been somewhat difficult to mend: A lack of public buildings and infrastructure, and considerable unemployment. But, if we hire on these unemployed workers to build these projects, we can provide them with a valuable job, skills, and income while also meeting our construction needs!"
  FEA_fair_market:0 "Fair Market"
  FEA_fair_market_desc:0 "One of the most fatal errors of the free market is the callous disregard for its failures, which it blames on individuals rather than assume responsibility. This is not the case in the Herzland, as we've created a market that is as free as the people, while managing to safeguard any of its shortcomings and ensure its fairness!"

  FEA_class_synchronization:0 "Class Synchronization"
  FEA_class_synchronization_desc:0 "The inequality between the classes is not something to be ignored until the schism boils over into hostility, as nobles desire, nor is it something to be fused together the nation is one impoverished class as socialists desire. No, the inequality of the hierarchies must be balanced and made to serve the interest and stability of the state."

  FEA_pay_off_family_mortgages_desc:0 "Among the bills that most families have to pay to keep their heads above water, the mortgage bill is the most dreaded and expensive of them all. The nobles have their titles, and the wealthy have their estates, but the working classes only have their homes to pass down, and we shall grant them this ability by allowing the state to assume and pay off that debt!"

  FEA_proportional_military_sector_desc:0 "For all the growth to civilian industry that has been accomplished, we've not put the same kind of attention to our military industrial sector.

  FEA_nationaal_welzijn_desc:0 "Despite our best intentions and widespread success, there are still those among our populace that are needy, and we must not turn up our noses and balk or tell them their poverty is their own fault.

  FEA_agricultural_mobilization:0 "Agricultural Mobilization"
  FEA_agricultural_mobilization_desc:0 "The farmlands of our nation are rich and fertile, but they're still being cultivated with the tools of our grandfathers rather than the tools of modernity. Further, the connection between the people and their homeland are becoming increasingly distant with the trend of urbanization, and we must set to remedy both quickly and decisively!"
  FEA_open_the_green_steel_mills:0 "Open The Green Steel Mills"
  FEA_open_the_green_steel_mills_desc:0 "Steel is the lifeblood of the Empire, but its production causes wanton waste and pollution. Strict standards must be enacted both to refine the quality of steel and its process while also protecting our sacred and historic homeland!"
  FEA_knownledge_is_power:0 "Knowlegde Is Power"
  FEA_knownledge_is_power_desc:0 "The true strength of the nation doesn't come from the barrel of a gun, but from the passion in their minds and hearts. Certainly, serving the country in uniform is a heroic act, but it is not the only way to contribute. Scientists make the country just as great as the soldier, and we'd do right to foster this attitude among the public!"
  FEA_reward_model_citizenship:0 "Reward Model Citizenship"
  FEA_reward_model_citizenship_desc:0 "Large families, military service, exemplarary performance at work, and a surplus of pride in one's country.

  FEA_service_over_self:0 "Service Over Self"
  FEA_service_over_self_desc:0 "It's a noble mindset to put the wellbeing and security of others over oneself, but it is a great triumph of the country if nearly every citizen embodies it as our nation does! As the sun rises over the Empire, the factory worker and the noble baron, the restaurant chef and the entrepreneur, all wake up with service of the nation over service of self."
  FEA_eco_fascism:0 "Eco-Fascism"

  FEA_utilize_marshland:0 "Utilize Marshland"
  FEA_utilize_marshland_desc:0 "The marshlands of Feathisia are paradoxically the most full of potential and the most underutilized land in the region. We'd do well to cultivate them to grow rice, carrots, and even cranberries so that they may no longer sit dormant!"
  FEA_introduce_pollution_controls:0 "Introduce Pollution Controls"
  FEA_introduce_pollution_controls_desc:0 "There exist few insults to the majesty of our homeland than willfully destroying it in search of profits or higher production. But, pollution is not something that can be completely avoided, so we must limit pollution as much as possible, and find ways to clean up contaminants wherever they appear."
  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights:0 "Restrict Drilling Rights"
  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights_desc:0 "Puncturing holes in the earth to drain it of its oil should be just as insulting as puncturing the flesh and draining its blood! There are other ways to produce oil that don't involve the mass piercing of the beautiful nation, and we must incentivize them and limit all others!"
  FEA_ban_unsustainable_farming:0 "Ban Unsustainable Farming"
  FEA_ban_unsustainable_farming_desc:0 "The way crops are grown can sometimes tarnish otherwise fertile farmland due to unsustainable practices, and the same is true for overgrazing with livestock. Thus, a crackdown must be initiated to prevent the wanton destruction of the beautiful homelands!"
  FEA_limit_meat_consumption:0 "Limit Meat Consumption"
  FEA_limit_meat_consumption_desc:0 "Meats like fish or pork are just as much a staple food as grains or vegetables are, but we cannot let the production and consumption of meat run away from us. Ranching and fishing, however valuable and necessary, are the legal mass-murder of animals, and this must be reined in if we are to live fully in admiration of our home."
  FEA_nationalize_plantations:0 "Nationalize Plantations"
  FEA_nationalize_plantations_desc:0 "It's often said that an army marches on its stomach, but this is not the whole truth. In reality, the entire nation marches forward on its stomach, and failure to feed the people will be the undoing of even the mightiest state! It stands to reason that the state should be in control of all food production so that the people may never go hungry again!"
  FEA_one_with_nature:0 "One With Nature"
  FEA_one_with_nature_desc:0 "The wind blows through the trees like breath comes through the lungs, and just as the waters flow in the rivers and the oceans so too does the blood of our people flow in their veins. It was not easy work to unify the welfare of people and their homeland, but we have fully preserved and enhanced both!"
  FEA_national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
  FEA_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "The economy is too vital to the security of the nation, and too essential to the wellbeing of the people to ever entrust it to the private sector. Furthermore, the gain of the nation ought to strengthen the nation, not fill the treasuries of the already wealthy. Thus, the state can control sections of the economy whilst retaining private business."
  FEA_dictate_prices:0 "Dictate Prices"
  FEA_dictate_prices_desc:0 "We do not agree with the PvdA on many things, but price controls are an exception to this general rule. If commodities are essential for the people to live, then they shall never be priced out of their means. However, this may also lead to market forces deciding to never produce these goods, which we must prevent through subsidy or through state purchase!"
  FEA_economic_vitalism:0 "Economic Vitalism"
  FEA_economic_vitalism_desc:0 "The people are full of a yearning for action and productivity, and this goes with the goals of the nation like a claw into a glove.

  FEA_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
  FEA_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Steel mills, oil fields, plantations, dockyards, fisheries and firearm factories are essential to the wellbeing and funding of the state. We are not barbarians who simply seize the property we want under a false claim of serving the people, but fervent believers in private enterprise, thus, we shall purchase and run these industries for a fair price!"
  FEA_absorb_smaller_businesses:0 "Absorb Smaller Businesses"
  FEA_absorb_smaller_businesses_desc:0 "If we are to control the vital points of our nation's economy, then it stands to reason that we shouldn't have to compete with clearly less-equipped, less refined, and less capable businesses, as doing so would be needless. These smaller businesses must be merged into the larger state-ran apparatus for the good of all, with compensation of course!"
  FEA_form_the_state_syndicates:0 "Form The State Syndicates"
  FEA_form_the_state_syndicates_desc:0 "While the state runs most of the vital industries, this doesn't mean that their management is unified or streamlined. To accomplish this we'd need to split the different sectors of the economy into their own syndicate with their own state-management in order to best consolidate production!"
  FEA_werkgevers_vereniging:0 "Werkgevers Vereniging"
  FEA_werkgevers_vereniging_desc:0 "Why is it that only the lowest of workers get to form unions to dictate their demands, rob the employers of their due profits, and bring the entire economy screaming to a halt, while the employers are simply left defenseless? This is backwards! The employers must have a voice just as the workers do, and the state ought to be their mediator!"
  FEA_create_the_staatsvaksbond:0 "Create The Staatsvakbond"
  FEA_create_the_staatsvaksbond_desc:0 "It stands to reason that if the employers have their own association, and if the state is to mediate between them and the workers, that the workers themselves should be apart of a united union to make their demands heard. The state will stand between the two as an objective and fair arbiter for labor!"
  FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons:0 "Form Arbeidsbataljons"
  FEA_form_arbeidsbataljons_desc:0 "For as many workers toiling away in the factories and workshops across the country, few will leave the cities and towns where they live lest they leave their families behind. But the work is still desperately needed. So, just as a soldier is conscripted when he's needed most, so too will workers be drafted to work these areas!"
  FEA_splendid_tripartism:0 "Splendid Tripartism"
  FEA_splendid_tripartism_desc:0 "The state, the economy, and the people are all one collaborative and energetic union, and the interests of one are the interests of all!

  FEA_class_collaboration:0 "Class Collaboration"

  FEA_universal_union_membership:0 "Universal Union Membership"
  FEA_universal_union_membership_desc:0 "Forged in the bonds of labor, unions are the most powerful tools in the worker’s arsenal.

  FEA_eradicate_parallel_development:0 "Eradicate Parallel Development"
  FEA_eradicate_parallel_development_desc:0 "Many companies have the wasteful habit of developing the same innovation, but spending their own funds with their own crews to accomplish it.

FEA_muzzle_the_press_desc:0 "The press had been our biggest enemy in Feathisia, but with some convincing and coercion, it became an invaluable propaganda machine. Curiously, the reverse is true in the newly unified territory, the press hails us as liberators and heroes. Their praise now can just as easily turn into scorn later, and as such, the press cannot be trusted and must be reigned in."
FEA_listening_posts:0 "Listening Posts"
FEA_listening_posts_desc:0 "Having secret police running about the streets and grabbing people away at night is in bad taste, and only serves to earn the public's distrust and fear.

FEA_a_tractor_for_every_farmer_desc:0 "The state of agriculture across the Herzland has been neglected by the decades of tumultuous conflicts, with some farmers still relying on manual tools for tilling and harvesting. This is far from what we're capable of, so it's time we give the farmers everything they could want free of charge!"
FEA_leerplicht:0 "Leerplicht"
FEA_leerplicht_desc:0 "Typically, parents decide if their children should go to school or not, and for how long should they go if they can even afford to, but this way of things is completely wrong! To deny our youth schooling is nothing short of neglect. Every child from age 6 to 18 will now be mandated to stay in school, free of charge to parents and with free lunches to boot!"
FEA_put_prisoners_to_work:0 "Put Prisoners To Work"
FEA_put_prisoners_to_work_desc:0 "There's no greater waste of potential than prisoners who loaf about in their cells, literally eating and sleeping away tax money when they could be laboring for the people's benefit. Prison labor has a harsh ring to it, but we will not be so crass as to treat prisoners poorly, when we can pay them for their work and reduce their sentences according to services rendered."
FEA_national_railway_project:0 "National Railway Project"
FEA_national_railway_project_desc:0 "Much of the Herzland is rural and disconnected from the cities by way of roads or rails, and this does nothing but hinder our own potential!

FEA_refurbish_the_libraries:0 "Refurbish The Libraries"
FEA_refurbish_the_libraries_desc:0 "Throughout much of the Herzland, public libraries remain poorly kept, poorly supplied, or in some tragic cases, both.

FEA_rolling_thunder:0 "Rolling Thunder"
FEA_rolling_thunder_desc:0 "The most crucial battles of the civil war were won through the use of artillery, and it's certain that our next victory will depend on it too. However, if we are to gain a decisive edge in using these cannons, we must look into enchanting the barrels and their shells so that they may fall upon the enemy like a thunderbolt!"
FEA_full_magic_jackets:0 "Full Magic Jackets"
FEA_full_magic_jackets_desc:0 "A breakthrough has come from a firing range in Klauwermack almost by accident. A cadet from the countryside had idle time around her base and decided to fill her time by enchanting the bullets in her rifle, causing them to completely obliterate her targets. It might be hard to replicate her work to scale, but doing so would dramatically bolster our arsenal."

FEA_pichtsbesef:0 "Plichtsbesef"
FEA_pichtsbesef_desc:0 "Signing up to fight in the military isn't just a simple contract, a series of training exercises, or even benefits during and after service ends.

FEA_mage_integration:0 "Mage Integration"

FEA_reclaim_the_birthplace_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "Countless years ago, the Gods had created griffonkind in Griffonstone, and hundreds of years from our current day, the great Grover I was born there as well. Such a legendary location cannot be governed by any other claws but the Empire's!"
FEA_drive_to_the_sea:0 "Drive To The Sea"
FEA_drive_to_the_sea_desc:0 "Just because the Skynavians are a different shade of Republican does not take away from their share of the blame for the failed revolt decades ago. They are just as guilty as the Republic they split from, and they will be treated the same way!"
FEA_march_through_the_frontier:0 "March Through The Frontier"
FEA_march_through_the_frontier_desc:0 "Dating all the way back to the time of Grover II, the frontier of Griffonia swore fealty to the Emperor, and the domino effect of secessions across the Empire eventually made its way there where independence was declared. We now have the power, and the right, to march back in and take back what is ours!"
FEA_welcome_the_northern_brethren:0 "Welcome The Northern Brethren"
FEA_welcome_the_northern_brethren_desc:0 "All the animosity that has been fermenting over the years had boiled into a large conflict, and now that the battle is over and victory achieved, we see the former Republican territories for what they really are: Brethren that have come home, we should welcome them back with the utmost kindness!"
FEA_integrate_the_south:0 "Integrate The South"
FEA_integrate_the_south_desc:0 "The thought is tempting to enact revenge on our former territories, Aquileia as Grover II once did, and Wingbardy as it deserves for bringing about the Empire's decay, this would be a step backward and accomplish nothing but repeat the most heinous errors of history. We must be better, and we offer our best to the citizens there so they may never have reason to secede again!"
FEA_resettle_the_frontier:0 "Resettle The Frontier"
FEA_resettle_the_frontier_desc:0 "Few territories are as vast and rural as the frontier of the Empire, and as such, no region has more potential for growth and prosperity. Alongside treating them with compassion and respect, we must also help them to develop to their highest point!"
FEA_new_arbeidswetten:0 "New Arbeidswetten"
FEA_new_arbeidswetten_desc:0 "Formally, the laws surrounding worker rights and conditions have been nullified when the constitution was suspended years ago, but in reality, the workers have had their rights respected and intact as though they were never suspended. Today we do right by the laborers and grant them official and expanded laws for their protection!"
FEA_shortened_working_day:0 "Shortened Working Day"
FEA_shortened_working_day_desc:0 "The brutal 10 hour work day of the previous years had its place and its reasons, but none of them apply to the present. The workers are exhausted and their lives suffer massively from the long hours, but no longer! A declaration has been declared that the working day is now 8 hours, with a guaranteed 1 hour break!"
FEA_limited_workplace_representation:0 "Limited Workplace Representation"
FEA_limited_workplace_representation_desc:0 "No one knows the interest of the workers better than the workers themselves, and while we've made great strides with their livelihood so far, we still haven't gone far enough. From here on, the concerns of the worker can be brought up at the workplace in a democratic, and limited, fashion!"
FEA_workers_compensation:0 "Worker's Compensation"
FEA_workers_compensation_desc:0 "Bills don't don't care if a worker is sick, injured, or recently disabled from their line of work, and they certainly don't wait for the recovery. This is a callous betrayal to our loyal and dedicated workers that ends today!"
FEA_evenredigheid:0 "Evenredigheid"
FEA_evenredigheid_desc:0 "Prosperity isn't merely making just enough to meet the cost of living without much wiggle room, it's having enough money to thrive! To free up the worker's expenditure, we must institute subsidies to bring the costs down and wages up to where everything a worker needs costs only 15% of his wages!"
FEA_artiestenvergoeding:0 "Artiestenvergoeding"
FEA_artiestenvergoeding_desc:0 "Of the worst things the Empire was deprived of during the harsher martial law days was art and entertainment, as workers of these industries were commanded to work in a more practical field for years. For this, we have robbed the people of their joy, and today we give it back and then some."
FEA_nationalize_housing:0 "Nationalize Housing"
FEA_nationalize_housing_desc:0 "No one should ever be homeless, especially when they have a family and especially when they have a job, and we cannot stand idly by and let the parasitic landlords profit off of a vital need of the people. Food, water, and electricity belong to the state, and as of today, so does the housing."
FEA_bread_circuses_and_pride:0 "Bread, Circuses, And Pride"
FEA_bread_circuses_and_pride_desc:0 "For all of the achievements of the Duke's governance, none are so great as freeing the people from hunger, planting the seeds for a flourishing entertainment industry to fill their hearts, and instill a deep, swelling pride in the Empire they thought had totally vanished just years prior! May this miracle be fostered forevermore!"
FEA_benevolent_tyranny:0 "Benevolent Tyranny"
FEA_benevolent_tyranny_desc:0 "Defying the odds of everyone on the continent, Duke Gerlach did not go mad with power, nor did he let grief paralyze him. He is a rare case in the world of absolute power used in the most beneficial and compassionate way, and in this, he has created a truly unique position of Tyranny with Benevolence."

feathasia.13.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feathasia.13.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbours, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessgriffs and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whom he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More worryingly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendedam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

feathasia.14.t:0 "For My Sentinels"
feathasia.14.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfried Heeren. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organisation, and considers them to be the safeguards of Feathisian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Do' novel."
feathasia.14.a:0 "Keep a close watch on Mister Heeren would you kindly?"

feathasia.17.a:0 "## TODO !! Fantastic"

feathasia.18.t:0 "If It Bleeds..."
feathasia.18.d:0 "Gerlach loved public appearances. Stage fright was an imaginary concept to a Griffon whose version of heaven seemed to be in front of the cameras. Initially there to gain the perspective of yet another group of his people, he soon found himself atop an impromptu stage hastily arranged in anticipation of his arrival by the dockyard workers. A routine stop soon turned into an hour-long rally in one of the hardest hit cities of the Economic crisis, its residents eager to hear the words of their Duke.\n\nAscending the steps of the stage in front of hundreds, Gerlach IV came to a stop right before the podium. He spoke under his breath. "...Thanks for coming here with me."\n\nAt his side, his fellow Noble, and best friend, Gabriela Eagleclaw. "I did have to rearrange some things, clear out a schedule or three.." She shrugged. "But support is built everywhere in the Empire. Not just in those places we find convenient. Even if it’s a bit..." She kept up her smile. "...Rustic."\n\nAn understatement, to be sure. As some Griffons and ponies of the urban center crammed to hear their Duke, Gabriela watched as Gerlach began to speak. Despite towering on the stage, his inflections and words spoke to the hard-hit creatures on their level. As if crafting a story, he weaved together the crowd’s hardships, their fears, and their common identity, bringing into their eyes a sense of hope. Gabriela couldn’t help but be impressed.\n\nShots.\n\nTwo, three, Gabriela Eagleclaw stopped counting as Gerlach collapsed onto the stage and panic rushed through the crowd. Adrenaline rushed in the Duchess’ veins as she wrapped her wings around him, and Feathisian Soldiers surrounded them both. The crowd shifted with panic heads turning to find the shooter until soldiers of the Feathisian army returned fire and ended the threat.\n\nOut of the huddle, Gerlach IV rose to his claws and brought up a wing in triumph, to the cheers of the unbroken crowd.\n\nGabriela’s worried eyes met Gerlach’s. "...Are you alright?"\n\nBlood dripped from the side of his head. "Hospital. Please.""

His heir is too young to rule alone and Griffenheim turned into a political showdown between two parties - those that supported Duchess Eagleclaw as regent and those that supported Archon Eros. Many griffons in Feathisia, along with the Duke himself, backed Duchess Eagleclaw and her more moderate policies. Now that the Duchess has rightfully taken control of the Imperial government, some lords have severed their vassalage and tensions are brewing. The Archons' defiance has enflamed political debate on where the country should head now."

feathasia.39.t:0 "Regicide in Griffenheim"
feathasia.39.d:0 "It hadn't been long since Emperor Grover V died. The citizens of Feathisia had barely begun to move on in a world where some regent may well control the Empire in the name of young Grover VI. All that changed when the news of the brute murder of the Child Emperor by parts of the Imperial military rippled through the Grand Duchy. There was no Grover left and Gabriela Eagleclaw was now technically the next in line to the throne. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, a dictator, had usurped the Empire.\n\nIn the evening candlelight wakes were held in every city and town in honour of Grover VI. Many cried, many others vowed that this could not go unpunished. Some still prayed for peace.\n\nThe next day, political scheming continued in earnest, there was no time for mourning with a power-hungry general at the gates. The so called Regency Debate had started since the death of the Sick Emperor, but had now exploded, with no griffon showing any true leadership. While the Grand Duke has locked himself in his Estate, privately grieving the death of his friend's son, the coalition of liberals and monarchists has broken in parliament. Dark times were ahead, and as long Feathisia remained disunited, the country could not stand against Dawnclaw." # RUBY Check if it suits you or you want it changed. Copied from Pre-Rework
feathasia.39.a:0 "No..."

feathasia_iron.1.t:0 "Darktide"
feathasia_iron.1.d:0 "As violent and frantic as the parliament building was, Gerlach hardly moved a muscle. Attempts to reason, of dialogue between the members of parliament were only interrupted by the newest arrival of reports of Ferdinand Dawnclaw’s latest actions. But Gerlach didn’t move. He hadn’t since the first report.\n\nIn the corners of his muffled hearing, along the edges of his unfocused vision, Gerlach saw an entire shift in the room like a rogue wave upon the seas. Rising to speak from the far corner of the parliamentary benches, Rozenkamp laid both his claw and his hateful words bare for all around him.\n\n"In playing with delusions of so-called equine morality, this great country has been reduced to a sham." His eyes were fiercely locked upon Gerlach, his accusatory words causing some even seated next to him to create distance. "We sold out our honor to the equine, and plunged the country into freefall because of it, and you have done everything to aid this."\n\nGerlach’s eyes emerged from their trance, now locking upon Rozenkamp. No emotion was worn upon his face, at least any that could be ascertained by the representatives of the room. The Duke leaned up out of his chair at the head of the Parliament and reached across his body under his wing.\n\nRozenkamp showed no attention to the Duke’s movements. "Even now amongst our own parliament," He paused to gesture around himself, pointing towards some ponies in the room, who uttered words of defiance under their breaths. "The powers of republicanism and international cliques have produced the final blow to this husk of an Empire, and he sits in living flesh in Griffenheim ready to devour us all. Is it any surprise this happened when you've done everything to court it? Moreover, his tools hide amongst-"\n\nA bullet cut off his speech, then two, then three. Gerlach closed the distance between himself and Rozenkamp swiftly, emptying his pistol into his corpse on the floor of the Parliament. Silence gripped the room, terror upon all of their faces. The Duke turned to Prime Minister Talonsley, who stood horrified mere feet away from the Griffon he no longer knew."
feathasia_iron.1.a:0 ""Talonsley, inform the representatives that their services are no longer required.""

feathasia_iron.2.t:0 "Either/Or"
feathasia_iron.2.d:0 "When martial law was declared, many didn't know what to do. The unions, however, sprang into action and planned for a general strike within the week. Above every mill, workshop, factory, and dockyard hung a tension in the air like thick smog, choking out the words of their workers and steeling them for the task ahead, until a voice came through the radios of the nation and shook them from their battle trance.\n\n"Beloved workers of Feathisia," The tinny voice of Duke Gerlach IV clawed its way through the static on every frequency, "For the past year, I have worked tirelessly to remedy the ills of freefall, and it was because of your help that we managed to avoid hitting the bottom. But I fear that if nothing is done about the planned general strike, we will sink to a level even worse than the bedrock of freefall and into servitude. I ask for you to lend me your ears."\n\nProduction halted as millions of anxious laborers turned their eyes up to listen. "I'm not blind to the animosity or fear reserved for me or to the dreadful conditions martial law has placed you in, but I would hazard against an outcry. Were there no maniac in Griffenheim, my actions would have no justification, and you would have every right to overthrow me. But it is precisely because there is a madgriff not far from our borders intent on destroying us that harshness is required."\n\nThe Duke cleared his throat and continued, "How does a devastating general strike help the situation? When we need to be at our strongest to face down our greatest foe, the unions would have us weakened. When we most need labor for our defense, the unions would leave us defenseless. When you are in dire need of better conditions and pay, the union declares that only by causing mayhem will they retrieve them for you. Let me tell you now, they are wrong. The only thing they can give you is bondage, while I can grant your every demand immediately without the anarchy. However, I cannot leave you vulnerable and I refuse to offer up the country in chains."\n\nHis voice choked, failing to hold back the tide of his emotions. "Unity is demanded of everyone in Feathisia's darkest hour, and for this reason, all unions are hereby forbidden to strike, and any attempt to do so will be met with harsh reprisal. It is through your labor, beloved workers of Feathisia, that we can defeat the madgriff! Thank you.""
feathasia_iron.2.a:0 "The dreams of a general strike were shattered by cheers!"

feathasia_iron.3.t:0 "The Aiwle Riots"
feathasia_iron.3.d:0 "The streets of Aiwle were a great singular mass of protestors, thousands moving like one entity and crying out with one voice as a deafening wall of noise, hoping to reach De Vleugels with its volume. Its only counter were the meager number of police who still pledged their loyalty to their Duke, standing guard at the entryways to certain streets to direct the flow of dissidents and keep them peaceful.\n\nAmong the chants, which came from across the political spectrum, were cries for a return to democracy, for an end to tyranny, and for bread and work. However, the more radical voices in the crowd eventually took command with calls for Duke Gerlach to abdicate the throne entirely and face justice for his crimes. However, this too was hijacked in the frenzy quickly overtaking the demonstrations.\n\nProtestors began slamming into the walls of police, who held their own against the tide, enduring the threats against their life and standing as a bulwark of order. Soon, the innocent and peaceful calls for democracy mutated into violent cries for Duke Gerlach's head.\n\nBefore long, a boom followed by a shrill, piercing, bloodcurdling scream shattered the sound of the demonstrators. As everyone fell silent, a griffon, barely over the age of twenty, lay trembling on the cold bricks of the street, clutching her wounds and sobbing quietly.\n\nThen everything came undone. In just an instant, the protest became a riot, and the wall of noise descended upon the officers like a tidal wave onto a small ship. In the resulting melee, over three dozen protestors lay dead in the streets, though most of both parties fled once the gunshots started ringing out.\n\nDuke Gerlach had since banned public protest to prevent such a riot from ever taking place again, while also making sure to compensate the families of those involved to set things right."
feathasia_iron.3.a:0 "It's for their own good..."

feathasia_iron.4.t:0 "Enemy Of My Enemy..."
feathasia_iron.4.d:0 "In a small back room, tucked away in the parts of the De Vleugels train station that the overhead lights don't touch, history was being made. Duke Gerlach IV sat with his back to the wall across from the beast in black known as Heeren, both griffs flanked on either side by antsy soldiers. Talking to the paramilitary leader was like trying to disarm a bomb with words. Convincing him wasn't the hard part, as he'd take any chance to bolster his ranks. Rather, it was containing his collateral damage.\n\nThe dim light above flickered as the two adversaries stared into each other eyes with glares that twisted like knives. "Let's get one thing straight," Gerlach was the first to speak, reaching into his coat pocket and producing a pipe, which he held in his beak without lighting it, "Were the circumstances any different, I would have your head, but as it happens, we need one another. Feathisia is in an uproar, and what little ability I have to contain it is dwindling. I need you to cut a path to law and order."\n\nHeeren drew a breath in and nodded slowly, refusing even to blink from the moment he sat down, "The feeling is mutual." His voice was low and coarse like gravel, and his eyes were fiercer than a thousand hawks, but Gerlach faced down the monster without flinching.\n\n"Make no mistake, I'm not giving you free reign. You are to enforce my laws, you are to disappear my enemies, and you are to follow my command. The state's purse is open to you for as many griffs and as much equipment as you need, but the instant you deviate from my word, or begin purging your personal enemies, the Bronze Sentinels and their leader, will cease to exist."\n\nWere the ferocity of Heeren's gaze any more intense, he would've turned Gerlach into stone. "We're on the same page, Gerlach, but you're naive if you think I'll leave my back open to be stabbed. I'll take your money and do your dirty work, but you have to promise me something in return."\n\n"And that is?" The Duke raised an eyebrow."
feathasia_iron.4.a:0 ""Stay out of my way.""

feathasia_iron.5.t:0 "Don’t Fear The Reaper"
feathasia_iron.5.d:0 "Parchments of paper were dropped into the claws of Bronze Sentinels across the Duchy, with Gerlach IV assured that he would have the corpse of every name on them.\n\nDoors were kicked in and entire cities were turned upside down, with the police given clear instructions not to stop them. Opposed to the usual crowd-violence typical of the political extremists, Heeren’s thugs moved through the Duchy as a surgeon’s scalpel moved through flesh, carving small pieces of communities out, whether they be sole buildings or people.\n\nOne group of Bronze Sentinels had pursued their mission far beyond their instructions, and had looted a group of businesses and homes operated by ponies. Before the sun rose, Gerlach IV made sure their names were crossed off the lists as well.\n\nThere was no use in keeping it quiet, and Gerlach made no effort to do so. Using the muscle of the most militant wing of the FNV, the Duke had allied himself with the strongest head of the hydra and was using it to rip the throats of the others. Dragged into a transport truck by his own soldiers, General Vorst tot Vorst and other officers suspected of posing a threat to the Duke found themselves in nooses on the streets of De Vleugels.\n\nIn the capital city of Feathisia, gallows were constructed in plain view of the various city centers. In no particular order, criminals, less-known politicians hostile to the Duke’s rule, uncooperative industry heads, and a minority of the Officer Corps had their names crossed off the Duke’s lists.\n\nGerlach watched each and every one of them hang. Not a mass killing, or murder on a grand scale, he didn’t watch more than a couple hundred necks snap by sunrise. Precise, methodical, every execution removing a roadblock on his path."

feathasia_iron.6.d:0 ""No—NO!" She yelled, picking up her pace down the halls. "Not another word!"\n\nRegina had to practically jump in front of her cousin, try as Gabriela Eagleclaw might to block out her words. "Cousin, just- please just listen to me!"\n\n"I don’t believe it!" The Duchess’ claws gripped into the carpets below her. The loss of Grover VI had previously made her an emotional husk, as she tried to bury it all inside. The horrible news from Feathisia had brought it all out again. "It’s a lie! He would never do that!"\n\nRegina Eagleclaw battled both her frustration and her empathy, powerless to help Gabriela. "He has. The news is coming from everywhere, and we can’t ignore it anymore! He’s turning his entire Duchy upside down, and with the amount of Griffons he’s having killed and institutions he’s burning, we are all in serious danger!"\n\n"Gerlach’s entire life, he has been—"\n\nRegina had to practically shove the papers into Gabriela’s claws, because as strong and intelligent as the Duchess was, there was no other way to get her to read them. "The parliament. The parties. He shot an MP personally, and who knows how many more he’s already had killed outside of his vision! He’s made no attempt to hide it, and all of Feathisia is praising him for it!"\n\nGabriela’s eyes couldn’t resist glancing down to the newspapers, telegrams, and pictures in her claws. "I-It... It can't... He’d never do this." She fought tears as she looked back up to her. "Cousin, we— He and I—"\n\nRegina’s own eyes began to water, unable to find any real way to console her friend. "He’s not the same Griffon, cousin. Nothing's going to stand between him and his war now. His enemies won’t be limited to Dawnclaw for long."\n\nWordlessly, Gabriela kept the papers and slowly went down the hall, as Regina’s eyes followed her. The Duchess did her best to block it all out."

The citizens that once rushed forth to meet their Duke whenever he was in public hid behind their curtains and locked doors as though he were a storybook villain.\n\nThis did not phase him when in fact he'd done everything to earn this reputation. He would suffer the people's fear so long as they were safe. Then, just as the half dozen armored vehicles made their stop around the fountain before Gerlach's estate, the situation flipped on its head. Hundreds of griffons descended upon the trucks and surrounded it entirely. Some were armed with rifles, others with pitchforks, and some with only the fury burning in their hearts. The soldiers of the convoy met them back with their own machine guns and magic rifles, and the city was silent once more.\n\nA cry came from somewhere in the crowd, which worked its way to the front in the form of a frenzied chant. "Bring us the Duke! Bring us the Duke!" There was no question in his mind what they wanted to do, nor any doubt that he could suppress this band of would-be insurrectionists right where they stood. However, there was also a chance that his beloved people could see reason as they always had, and so with a deep breath in, Gerlach flipped the hatch on the roof of the military truck he was in and came face to face with the mob.\n\n"My beloved subjects, I implore you to listen to what I have to say with an open mind to the very end." The crowd was hushed, staring out with rage and apprehension, as though they were expending the very last amount of loyalty they had for the Duke by letting him speak. "If by then you are not convinced and you do not find me in the right, I grant you every permission to fire upon me at will. I'll even step out among you and make it easy."\n\nHundreds among them turned and looked to one another, the thick tension in the air diffusing by the instant, then they all turned back to him in silence once more. Gerlach muttered to himself."

But when the news arrived that he had slain our Emperor Grover VI to do so, we were enraged." Duke Gerlach felt an anger within him bubble deep from his heart up to his throat and out his mouth as he spoke. "When I looked to our failing parliament, our economy that was on the brink of ruin, and an Empire that has done nothing but crumble and wither apart since I was young, I knew it was not up to the task of doing what needed to be done."\n\nPlacing his claws on the rim of the hatch, Gerlach leaned forward, letting the hate brewing within him for months finally take form as words. "Perhaps our ineffectual democracy could've been reformed, perhaps our shattered economy could mend itself quickly enough to put up a fight, but even if there was a chance that it could, it would do so far too late. For every moment we wasted in reform or reconstruction, we could've been arming ourselves for the struggle ahead. For every instant of claw-wringing and pearl-clutching we have done for so-called 'democracy', an instant that could've been used to prepare against our real enemy has been wasted!"\n\nNow the Duke climbed out from the hatch and stood tall atop the armored vehicle, gesturing wildly at the crowd, who looked back at him with fury and vengeance in their eyes that was quickly turning away from him and towards another enemy. "If there was another way that I could've prepared our country for the fight, I would have done it that way, but because my beloved subjects, there was no other way I did what needed to be done! I had to become the harsh tyrant and the brutal murderer, not because I wanted to, but because I had to! And for this I am sorry."\n\nThe eyes of the crowd were so angry that they were practically on fire as they stared at Gerlach walking down the top of the truck onto its hood before raising his claws to the sky. "If there is any griffon who believes their Duke is wrong, that he has not looked out for them or done everything in his power to keep them safe, let them fire upon me!"\n\nOnce again, the city did not stir. The mob one by one lifted their weapons to the sky, and just as before, a cry from the back rippled through the entire crowd, and later through the entire country like a stone in water."

Perhaps too late to save the Empire, but still with enough time to avenge it. The Duke’s armies swelled with resources and volunteers from across the land, with every avenue of life personally invested in the coming war against Dawnclaw. Citizens in every province trained in groups of spontaneous militias, each of them positively sure that they would not squander the opportunity if they were lucky enough to have their own claws around Ferdinand’s neck.\n\nThe fires of rage in their minds swelled with the gasoline of despair in their hearts, with the melancholic look and slight tinge of despair in the words of their Duke in his radio addresses in public appearances, serving as the closest reminder to the once-living child-Emperor. This was no longer an assault upon their Empire, but an attack upon the people themselves. It wasn’t hard to imagine the young chick as one of their own."

Clad in his royal armor and gripping his sword in claw, citizens inside the palace dragged an already bleeding, bruised, and wide-eyed Ferdinand Dawnclaw before the opening of the palace, and the staircase that led up to it.\n\nSmoke from distant fires plagued half the sky, and the gentle smoldering of coals throughout the damaged palace sizzled as the Griffons and ponies around Gerlach fell silent, anxious to hear the judgment of their Duke.\n\nFlares of rage, of mad fury, of horrific imagination unfolded in the eyes of Gerlach IV. But even in the cold echoes of what once used to be his hopeful heart, the reminders of what he used to be made their appearance in all new twisted form, turning his eyes away from Dawnclaw on the floor and down the steps.\n\nThe city was wounded, gunfire still echoing. Public displays of violence and sheer brutality inflicted on this city by Dawnclaw had gathered what must have been thousands of its starving, despairing citizens onto the streets below, looking up at their liberator.\n\n"You have all suffered, as I have suffered." Gerlach IV said, to the thousands who wished to hear him. "I will not deprive you of your justice."\n\nIn his final moments, the Lord Protector had to be dragged kicking and screaming down the steps and out onto the street, as Gerlach ordered his soldiers to deliver him to the justice of the city which he terrorized.

Cities and towns had begun stockpiling food and water, ensuring that if any conflict were to pass, her subjects would endure. Though no concrete military threat had been laid against the Strawberry Duchy, she hurried from Readewetter to every corner of the countryside, from villages large and small, to schools, to farms, and to castles. She had visited military installations, outposts and checkpoints, as her and her staff constructed plans and protocols to resist imminent invasion. Though it was never written down or spoken aloud, all preparations dealt with an invasion from Feathisia.\n\nVitalius Moonbill was always an odd griffon out from the rest of the crowd, and it made no difference to him now.

"Many of the fires have been put out before touching many residential areas, and armed resistance in the city has been eliminated."\n\nThe Duke weaved around citizens, some wounded and bandaged, who perked up either in admiration or alarm at his presence, or the sword he still carried in his claw. He stopped, resting his gaze on the flowing Griffking river that cut the city in three. "A significant portion?" He asked.\n\n"Much of the fighting occurred in the Industrial district. Dawnclaw’s forces were based out of there, and the surrounding residences were all practically destroyed. Some ten thousand citizens are without shelter."\n\nGerlach raised his claw to point across the river. "I’m looking at intact shopping centers across the bridge."\n\nGeneral Best nodded. "We’ve set up food and water distribution from there sir, but the shops themselves are all locked and boarded from the battle."\n\n"Break in." Gerlach IV leaned on the handle of his sword as if it were a cane, as he looked back to the streets. "I’ve spoken to many of your forces personally. They have all done our Duchy proud in our crusade, but this is far from over. If the creatures of the Empire are to look upon tomorrow with any remaining shard of hope after this, they are to be cared for as chicks ought to be after tragedy."\n\nWith those words, both Gerlach and General Pieter Best looked to the streets, crews of civilians and soldiers both pushing aside torched automobiles and trucks from the roads, sweeping broken glass off the sidewalks, and even removing a corpse from a lamppost."

"Some of my waiters and cooks showed up later when the soldiers started shooting at the houses." He looked up, wiping his eyes. "Are... Are you sure I’m not holding anyone up?"\n\nIt looked like entire new neighborhoods had been constructed overnight out of tents on the streets of Griffenheim, but these makeshift towns operated as one organism that spanned across all three sectors of the city. With the inner streets cleared and reconstruction efforts now aimed towards repair of infrastructure, the city’s core had become a hub for those residents with nowhere to flee.\n\n"Not at all, Riverbill." Another Griffon, Silverquill said. "The hospitals have all the injured under control. Your care is just as important as any other." He leaned in. "You said you hid in the restaurant with others?"\n\nRiverbill nodded. "Yes, as uh... as long as we could. We couldn’t continue making boiled pasta-" He said, with a dry laugh, "So eventually we had to search for something to eat. Some of us came back... Some of us didn’t."

Like most young chicks in the Herzland, many dream to be a knight, or a policegriff, or whatever their parents were, Cap had wanted to be a knight more than anything. She dragged her parents to parades where they would march, made a habit of finding sticks that most resembled a sword, and fashioning armor out of cardboard or pots from the cupboard.\n\nHowever, Cap never grew out of this desire, unlike most chicks, instead she placed a full focus on it, and once she reached the age, joined up in the Duke's army. Her parents had begged her not to, and it was hard to leave them behind, but the siren call of that little filly in her proved louder and more convincing.\n\nDuke Gerlach had given her more than a chance to be a knight, he'd given Hard Cap the dream she'd been working for her whole life, a purpose and a flag to lay down her life for, and the sword to carry out the justice the nation demanded. Before Cap had thought of knights as being a more elite soldier, but in the rush of combat the full truth of the title revealed itself."

It went onto say that because he'd worked less than 45 hours a week for the past two months, he was no longer covered by the National Health Redoubt. But that was flat out impossible, he was one of the last griffs out during the siege of the Imperial Palace, there was no way they'd deny him care!\n\n"Next!"

For as grueling as prison labor was some days, most were like any other day on the job, which was still difficult, but far better and fairer than he expected. As Lindert chewed his food slower now that he'd all but inhaled half of the meal, he looked out to the giant wooden posts he was fixing wires to and couldn't help but think of home.\n\nFive children and a wife, all had to depend on his paycheck, which was smaller under the command economy.

Though the guards of the estate looked on with contempt, his own company carried no weapons apart from the sword which never left his claw. His approach was slow, methodical. Against the advice of all around him, he had ventured alone through the gardens and to the front doors, moving at a snail’s pace.\n\nThe Duke brought up iron walls around his heart and gently pushed open the doors. Curtains fluttered from the cold breeze flowing through the doors, the sound of the outside rain leaking into the dark halls.

Her offices and rooms lay empty, save for the sound of Gerlach walking through them.\n\nRounding the top of a staircase, Gerlach saw her. The Duchess of Strawberry, Gabriela Eagleclaw, turned her eyes from the window where she’d watched him approach.

Lindert stood motionless for a moment, unsure if this was just a dream, but the calm smell of lavender in her hair was enough to prove that it was real, and he returned the embrace. "I'm so happy you're back! They didn't treat you too bad, did they? Oh! Kids! Your father's home!"\n\n"They—" Lindert could barely get his answer out before five chicks rushed out from the doorway and spilled out onto the porch before promptly tackling their father to the ground in a coordinated hug. All of them were a lot bigger than he remembered, and they each asked him enough of their own questions to make his head spin. "I missed you guys too, I'm sorry I had to be away for so long."\n\n"You stood up for the right thing, Dad!" His youngest, a sporty young griff with dirt perpetually on his face no matter how many times you scrubbed it off, held his head high as he spoke, "That's what Mom said!"\n\nA chant of 'yeah!' and 'that's right!' came shortly after, which brought a chuckle from both Lindert and Rose, the latter of whom was pulling her beloved from the swarm of children. "I think you owe us some stories," She said with a wink. \n\n"You're not mad at me?" Lindert stopped the walk back inside and cocked his head.\n\n"Well, at first I was furious." Rose started with a nod, "But the more time that passed the more I understood, and the more I forgave you. It was not easy taming this pack of chicks, but we made it work, and the checks that came in kept us afloat.""

Letter from the Imperial Government?"\n\nThe slim amount of attention he gave the envelopes suddenly became total. The Imperial Government didn't send letters to just anyone, and if they did, the matter would have to be of high importance. Holding the letters in his beak for a brief enough moment to open the front door to his quaint one-story house, Conrad went straight for the couch to the immidiate right of the door and plopped down, setting the groceries and every letter but one down on the coffee table before him. "Hey honey, you might wanna come here for a minute." He called to somewhere in the home.\n\n"What is it, dear?" The voice of his wife called from the kitchen, along with the sounds of vegetables being chopped.\n\n"The Imperial Government saw it fit to send us a letter, must be big." Conrad called, getting a little quieter once he saw his wife enter the room, along with their daughter and son from the room they shared down the hall from the kitchen. Silently, Conrad looked at each one of them and heaved in a heavy breath as he tore open the letter and unfolded the paper within.\n\nHis expression told the whole story, first apprehensive, then relief, and then utter joy all within the span of a moment. "I... don't believe this." He looked up, tears welling up in his eyes before flowing down. "They say they're going to be paying off the home, our mortgage is going to be paid for by the government from now on."\n\n"What!?" Conrad's wife bolted forward, quickly grabbing up the letter before quickly succumbing to the same wave of emotions her husband had. She took him in the thightest embrace they'd had since their wedding day, before kneeling down and including the children in the hug too. "That's unbelievable!""

feathasia_iron.24.d:0 "The writing was on the wall, written in Gerlach and Gabriela's claw-writing: The Bronze Sentinels had outlived their usefulness. Tonight, these words would become historical fact.\n\nThe insidious group led by the even more insidious Godfreid Heeren had outposts all across the Herzland, but most were located in central Griffenheim and deployed as needed. Usually, this would make the task of crippling or arresting their leadership difficult as it'd require a nationwide coordinated effort to strike all at once, but their headquarters in the capital decided to hold an uncharacteristic banquet. In other words, all the eggs were in one basket for the taking.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had discussed issuing a declaration to simply dissolve the group and rescind their authority, but almost instantly, they both realized Heeren wouldn't take it sitting down and would likely respond with hostility. So instead of going through a costly and destructive skirmish with the Bronze Sentinels, they decided to use the banquet to behead the snake.\n\nNearly a hundred soldiers followed their Duke into the Sentinel's headquarters, arrested the guards at the door, and any on their way to the hall as they entered. Shockingly, most accepted their fate, likely thinking that their dear leader would avenge the injustice. Then the strike force cam to the large set of double red doors that the feast was being held in, laughter could be heard coming from within as the troops got into position.\n\nThen all at once, Gerlach kicked the doors in and the hundred soldiers with him rushed in and fixed guns on everyone in attendance around a long black table. The response was immediate as every Sentinel, including Heeren himself, drew their firearms right back. "I wouldn't if I were you. There's one hundred guns trains on you and many more waiting outside." Gerlach's voice was laced deeply with venom as he strolled into the chamber, like he'd been waiting to say these words for years. He stared into those hawkish eyes of Godfreid and smiled, feeling his old self return for just a moment. "The Imperial Government no longer recognizes the Bronze Sentinels as their secret police, but instead as a terrorist organization. You are all under arrest."\n\nOne by one, the Sentinel leadership surrendered, and the look on Heeren's face when the cuffs went around his claws was worth every Idol in the Empire. Every one of them would be placed in a different prison, and every one would never see daylight again."

feathasia_iron.25.d:0 "Much was changing across the Empire, the hard and commanding nature was giving way to a more free and fair society, but something that never changed was the respect the soldiers gave to their beloved Duke. Starting from one end of a sea of soldiers gathered in the stone-brick ground of the De Vleugels Military Academy, every few steps saw the pair of soldiers stood before him turn and stand at attention to make a path for him.\n\nFinally, after passing by hundreds of soldiers, Gerlach climbs the small set of stairs to a circular wooden stage prepared for just this occasion, and once he stood center in it, every soldier clicked their heels and saluted in one united motion. The aging griff looked around, nothing stirred under that bright sunny sky but him observing it. Finally, gulping down his anxiety, the Duke could feel the wheels of history turn just as he had when he spoke to the people from atop a military vehicle years ago.\n\n"Until very recently, many of you would've called me the Iron Duke, and some of you still think that way of me, but today I come to you seeking to reform the armed forces the same way that I was reformed not long ago." A certain tenseness washed over the crowd, and the heaviness of it threatened to choke the words right from Gerlach's beak, but he pushed through. "For the time of martial law, you were the sword that cut a path to freedom and the shield which protected the people, but those were different times, and we now must adapt to the present."\n\nHis stomach began to tie itself in knots as he could see confusion growing among the troops, but he persisted. "The former army which commanded you has since been abolished, and in its place, I hereby announce a standing army of honour, of mercy, and of order. No longer will your arms be pointed at your fellow countrygriffs, but out towards any enemy who dares encroach upon our nation!" Gerlach gulped, and suddenly the knot unraveled, the tightness in his throat vanished, and instead a fire rose in their places. "From now on, the laws that govern you will be fair instead of cruel, the common soldier will be given a say on what happens to them and how their military is organized right on down to the unit level, you will be given back the respect that all free griffons deserve! Soldiers of our new free army, do you accept my proposal?"\n\nFirst there was silence, then in an instant, like a firework going off, the mass of troops exploded in one voice as they once had moved with one action."

feathasia_iron.26.d:0 "Duke Gerlach drummed his claws against the handle of his cane, which leaned against the large, long table in the studio booth. Next to him was his beloved Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, and next to her was a volunteer voice actor, and so was everyone else around the set of microphones. The idea was genius: Read out the newly passed Economic Bill of Rights to the people of the Herzland in multiple different voices.\n\nThe thought was, at least according to Gabriela herself, was that by reading it out this way, it would show that it gives everyone a more powerful voice than they had before. To the slightly grumpy Gerlach, it meant having to share a bit of the spotlight he'd grown so used to.\n\nThen the short tune playing petered out, and that was the Duke's cue to start, which he did after quickly clearing his throat. "My beloved subjects, for the past few years your way of life has been kept in the grip of an iron claw, which has only recently released you and thrown away the gauntlet. Parliament is back and martial law has been lifted."\n\nHe glanced over to the griffon across from him, who picked up the verbal baton without missing a beat. "However, the realities of the command economy of those tough times has illuminated certain truths which have become accepted as self-evident. The hours you had to work were not sustainable, the conditions you had to live under were not acceptable, and the uncertainty thrust upon your families was not permissible."\n\nThe mare next to Gabriela spoke in a thick Buckmour accent, "To remedy the ills that the command economy has caused, it is not enough to simply lift it, the same way that healing a stab wound is not to pull out the knife. The wound must be tended to, the blood must stop flowing, and it must be sewn shut completely."\n\nNow it was Gabriela's turn, who began before pausing after hearing her own voice, only to then resume. Gerlach couldn't help but admire her as she spoke, "In other words, instead of passing token, piecemeal reforms that don't go far enough and are always under threat to be reversed, a bill has been passed which is built right into the new constitution. This will guarantee everyone with inalienable economic rights that will entitle everyone to..." Everyone in the booth took a breath in and spoke at the same time with a rehearsed cadence."

"Hey, you're gonna lose the race at this rate!" The voice of his beloved Gabriela brought his head out from the trees that lined the old railroad the pair were skipping along, and back to the task at claw.\n\n"What are we, chicks?" Gerlach rolled his eyes, but couldn't hide the smile coming across his face as he took bounding steps between the gaps of the rail, only ever touching the wooden planks. In their youth, before either of them had any real power or responsibilities, this was where both of them snuck off to. Then he could hop between the boards with ease, but in his age he could only settle for large steps. "Besides, you're cheating, you know?"\n\n"Ooh, check it out, a snail!" Gabriela gasped, ignoring the attitude coming from her other half and pointing to it.\n\n"Cool, I'm sure there's none other like it." He smirked, before letting his expression and his gaze fall to the ground, as though a sense of guilt was tugging him down. "I feel like we've said this before. After everything, we're still the same old griffs, huh?"\n\n"Wrong!" She said scooping up the creature in her claw, "We're stronger, like everyone else."\n\n"Gabby, do you think I did the right thing?" Once more, Gerlach's frankness was his own worst enemy, having doused a bucket of cold water on a warm moment for possibly the hundredth time in his life. "Do you ever think about how things would've been if Dawnclaw never..."\n\n"We'll never know, dear. They might've been better, or things might've been way worse." Gabriela glanced away from the snail and to her love, "But what I know is that we did the best with what we had. Neither the tyranny of Dawnclaw or the Iron Duke could crush that seed of hope which blossomed forth from the bloodiest of grounds. So yes, Gerlach, I think you did the right thing in the end. But I'd be remiss if I didn't say...""

feathasia_iron.28.t:0 "All Is Lost"
feathasia_iron.28.d:0 "A large bed in the Imperial Palace was Gerlach's prison, and his sentence had started a week ago. The life of the Duke was one of loss, seeing the Empire around him decay, his beloved country and people fall to ruin, and then hearing the news of the young Emperor's passing. It was all almost too much to bear.\n\nBut seeing the love of his life's eyes lock onto his in desperate fury, fighting for the very same things he was, only to fall by his own claws was too much to bear. Now there was nothing left and nothing that could be done, and the once small part of Gerlach that blamed himself had grown into an all-encompassing, all-controlling behemoth. The punishment for these crimes was to be carried out by laying in bed until death by hunger or a broken heart, whichever decided to take him first.\n\nThe words of his departed love, Gabriela, pounded through his head like a vengeful spirit, pouring salt and alcohol into the wounds he caused. Tyrant. Murderer. Liar. Each one hit their mark with perfect accuracy. He'd won over Dawnclaw and restored peace to the Herzland, but it cost everything he ever wanted to protect.\n\nTears flowed down from his eyes onto the sheets like blood from the open wound of his heart as he stared into the same ceiling he had for the last six days, waiting for death to take him. Then came a knock on the door, a worker in the palace that dropped meals off by the door only to pick them up cold and untouched hours later. Each wrap of knuckles against the wood shook thoughts loose from his head like apples from a tree, until one knocked square against his temple.\n\nWhat emerged was the realization that not all was gone. Nearly everything was, but beneath all the mountains of loss and grief and pain were the people. The people he had sworn to protect, the ones he had fought so valiantly for against all odds. In those knocks against the door, the Duke's purpose came flowing back to him.\n\nThere was indeed nothing left at all, but there was much to be done. His heart lay shattered, but all its pieces were intact. Everyone in his life that he loved was gone, except for the people."

feathasia_iron.29.d:0 "Of all the materials and resources in short supply during the last few years, the one that hurt the most to do without was criticism. Doing so would earn one punishment of all varieties, from a simple fine to extensive jail time depending on the nature of the offense. While this was essential to securing peace in the region, critique could no longer be done without.\n\nTo this end, the even-clawed Duke Gerlach ordered the construction of public forums in every town and city, no matter how small or hostile to his rule, to replenish the supply of criticism and utilize it for the better of the Empire. In a speech over the radio, the Duke declared, 'A tyrant rules with a deaf ear to his people, but a ruler reigns only hearing the words of his citizens.'\n\nThe words still tasted sweet on Gustaaf's tongue, once a mayor of the city of Katerinburg, now the head of its public forum, as he seated himself in the large chair that presided over the great hall. Next to him, in an equally large chair, sat a bright blue griffon before a typewriter. Outward, rows of curved benches, all facing towards the tall podium where Gustaaf sat, each filled with griffons, ponies, and all other manners of citizens from the Empire looking back at him.\n\n"Now," The aging griffon announced, clanging a gavel against the podium's dark surface, "One at a time, please come up and state your issue, and my lovely assistant next to me will catalog them, and send them straight to Griffenheim. Who's first?"\n\nWithout missing a beat, as though he were waiting for his moment, a gray griff with long black hair flew to the stand in between the podiums and benches, "What I demand is an end to the rationing program! We have Greifenmarschen to grow us all we could eat, so why must we starve ourselves?" A chorus of agreement came from behind him.\n\nTaking his seat, a red pegasus slowly walked to the stand, "I, uhm, I'd like it if we could get rid of curfews. Thank you!" She practically squeaked before returning to her seat with applause. More of the same repeated throughout the day, with Gustaaf and his assistant meeting it all with a smile. It was strange to hear nothing but negative things all day and feel happy about it. But it was the voice of the people."

His voice echoed in the huge, dim warehouse, "I'd like to th-thank you for coming to this m-meeting. Are th-there any concerns you want to tell me?"\n\n"Yeah, I got one!" A griffon nearly three times the size of Aart stood up, "Are you actually gonna help us out? 'Cause we've had a couple griffs come out here and promise to help us, and they didn't do a thing!"\n\n"Yes!" Aart pushed his glasses up, "D-Duke Gerlach has decreed th-that a link between state and worker must be made. Th-the command economy left no room for growth or change, so we're taking any su-suggestions to improve."\n\n"How about some more time off, for starters." The hulking griffon announced, to cheers and hollers from his fellow workers. "I mean, I got two kids at home, and I can't even see them grow up because I work too much!"\n\n"Oh, and how about a few smoke breaks!" Another griffon from the back piped up, eliciting another round of loud agreement. "Can you do that for us?"\n\n"Th-that and more!" Aart smiled, something he thought he wouldn't get to do in their presence. The expectation going in was that they'd rip him apart for the poor state of things, and considering his size, he couldn't put up a fight. "I'll get word to the Duke right away! You sh-should have these benefits by next week."\n\n"Get down here bud!" The large brawny griff who first spoke out motioned for Aart to come down, only for the shrimpy representative to be picked up and tossed into the air, and caught by a forming crowd of strong griffs below."

Garrit, an earth pony whose family moved from Rottendedam, was a natural when it came holding his breath, but Flip, a stout griffon from a nearby town, had practically grown up in the water.\n\nThe pair sucked in a huge gulp of air and dived below, and several moments passed of nothing but a few bubbles escaping to the surface, Flip was the first to emerge, followed almost immediately after by Garrit. "I win!" He declared, only to be met with a splash of water by his friend. Retaliation was instant, and the two were now engaged in the next improvised competition of who could outsplash the other.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest which were decided in short order, this one would be cut short with the all-important cry from the docks nearby, "Supper's ready! Come on back now!" The two kids looked at one another, and narrowed their eyes, as though reading the other's thoughts and accepting the challenge. The score for the day was tied. It was now or never as the two broke for the shore, heaving themselves into the water like a fish that escaped a hook.\n\nWhoever reached the shore would be crowned top swimmer, and neither was about to give up the title. Just as the sun met the horizon, Flip touched his claw to the sand and cried out in victory, only to swallow a mouthful of water and cough. Still, his opponent conceded, and slapped a towel around him and then himself, laughing as they started their trek back to base camp."

It was early in the morning, with the sun barely beginning to crest over the horizon, but the Duke had been there for hours even before that.\n\nRottendedam was hosting a grand festival, and the leader of the Empire could hardly earn his title if he weren't present, but the night before the big day, the Duke couldn't sleep. And instead of letting his mind wander beneath the covers, he took a walk to try and clear it instead. The years hadn't been kind to him, developing a cough from his pipe and a limp from the times he foolishly tried to lead from the front.\n\nSparking up the bowl of his pipe and taking a long drag, his thoughts drifted to Rozenkamp, the first casualty of martial law. That one moment of mania which sparked everything. The chaos that ensued, and the order that followed. The wars which came to pass, and the unbridled peace that they brought. The ire and admiration of his people, both of which he more than earned through his deeds.\n\nIt wasn't long before these thoughts sank into guilt. For as much as he'd done for the people, he couldn't ever shake the truth that every deed was done to earn the admiration of someone whom he killed. That everything was simply an attempt to exorcise the ghost of his beloved.\n\nGerlach gripped his pipe tighter, a single tear flowing down from his blind eye, as he finally arrived at the crux of his insomnia. Were she alive today, would Gabriela be proud of him and his actions? That every hard decision he had to make on the road leading to this moment was worth it?\n\nSorrow mixed with certainty in his heart to form a bittersweet cocktail of emotions as the Duke hurled his pipe down into the waters below, hung his head in his claws, and sobbed. As the sun rose over Rottendedam, the answer couldn't be any more clear."

 feathisia_heeren.2.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, soldiers from across the country were dismissed and sent back home to their families, or whatever remained of either of them. But, the ardent fighters in the Bronze Sentinels stayed behind their leader, Godfreid Heeren, and followed him to the capital in De Vleugals. On a cloudy day, with rain just beginning to sprinkle over an audience of thousands of the elite, black-clad griffons, Marshall Heeren stood atop the roof of a local business that hadn't been leveled by bombs and spoke to his troops.\n\n"Sentinels, I am humbled and honored that you would follow me from the fire and chaos of the civil war to where we currently stand now. But I have one thing to ask of you if you are to stay under my command. Are you afraid of the dark?"\n\The crowd cried in one voice, "No, Marshall, we fear nothing!"\n\n"Excellent!" Heeren sneered and pointed a claw to a spot in the distance. "Out there, my sentinels, lurking everywhere from the shadows of the night to plain sight before us, are bandits and socialists. They abandoned the country in its most desperate hour of need before, during, and now after the war. Instead of helping Feathisia back to its former glory, they insist on tearing it down and utilizing the destruction to further their ends. Is there anything more cowardly?"\n\n"No, Marshall!" The audience boomed once again, refusing to budge as the rain began to pick up and the sky darkened.\n\Heeren paced from one end of the roof to the other, his voice carrying louder over the rain, "On my orders, the provisional government has seen it fit to issue bounties for the heads of these traitors, and sentinels I tell you now that it is your job to plunge into the dark and brighten it with gunfire. Do you get me?"\n\n"Yes Sir!"\n\nLightning tore a blinding white scar across the sky, and the thunder exploded with such noise that it shook the very city as Heeren concluded his speech."

 feathisia_heeren.3.t:0 " 'X' Marks the Spot"
 feathisia_heeren.3.d:0 ""Are we ready, boys?" Captain Gustavo Shortclaw asked his entourage of a half dozen Bronze Sentinels in a low and quiet voice. Nightfall had shrouded their approach to the mansion of a wealthy and influential baron, which was surrounded by brick walls and long lines of hedges. The sight of such decadence would've driven the soldiers to nausea were their mission less important.\n\nAll of them nodded, and promptly flew over the walls in formation before scattering to the different sides of the estate that were lit up from the outside. Light meant someone was there, and that's precisely what they were after. Marshall Heeren had given them a covert and personal order to seize the stolen wealth of all nobility, by any means necessary, both to fund the reconstruction efforts and to set an example for the affluent industrialists in the country. They were not about to let him down.\n\n"Now!" Captain Shortclaw bellowed, and all at once, the sentinels crashed through the mansion's windows and began destroying everything in their path not of value, screams of the home's staff and family shattered the tranquil quiet of the night. For the Captain though, he simply kicked in the tall front doors and marched straight in through the havoc. There, rushing up the stairs before freezing in place, was the griff of the hour.\n\n"Baron Cloudfall," Gustavo grinned in stark contrast to the screams as he slowly made his way towards him, "just the griff I wanted to see. Now, you have something we want, and if you, or anyone alive in this gorgeous estate, wants to see the sun rise, you're going to give it to me." \n\nA dark spot spread across the baron's gaudy purple pants, and it took all of Gustavo's strength not to burst into laughter from the pitiful sight. After a few futile pleas, more than a few tears, and a crack across the head from a rifle stock, the baron slowly slinked into one of the lavish rooms, and pointed to the bed. Without hesitation, Gustavo flipped the bed over to reveal a hidden trap door, and upon opening it, a stash of gems, gold, and jewelry looked back at him. "Thank you, Cloudfall for your generous donation! How kind of you!" He said with a wide smile as he shot him between the eyes. Strolling down the stairs with his packs laden with loot, he gave one final order for the night."

 feathisia_heeren.4.t:0 "The Cost of Doing Business"
 feathisia_heeren.4.d:0 ""Let me be up front." Marshall Heeren latched the door to the conference room behind him shut. Gathered here, ostensibly invited to discuss terms of contracts for reconstruction, was all of what remained of Feathisian industry: Mine owners, mill tycoons, and the union leaders for a range of different key industries from textile plants to food production. Each had a paper in front of them signing control of their enterprises over to Heeren specifically. As the Marshall in question began walking to the end of the room, he let the thumps of his footfalls punctuate the silence, before he stood over his chair. "This is not a negotiation."\n\n"Then why are we here?" Walter Aldus, head of the union for grain mills, asked with a twinge of annoyance, tapping his claw against the paper before him. \n\n"You are here, Mister Aldus, and everyone in this room is here, to bend the knee. You've come here to pledge fealty to me." Heeren glared at Aldus with such intensity that a hole might bore through the poor griff. \n\n"Yeah right," Marcel Vouwe, owner of nearly all coal mines in Feathisia, rolled his eyes, "You really expect us to sign these? What do we get in return?"\n\n"You and your family's lives." Heeren turned his piercing gaze over to Vouwe, the room becoming deathly silent and increasingly tense, "what I am offering you is a chance to live on the right side of history. Join me, not the FNV, not anyone else, and you will be amply rewarded. Go against me, tell anyone what happened here, or violate my will in any way, and I will hang you and your family's bodies up from the production floor until you rot away to bones. You know who I am and you know what I've done. Make the right choice." \n\nWere Marshall Heeren any less imposing, any less menacing, or any less brutal than he was, this coercion would fail. But precisely because he was a maniac of his word, because the provisional government was toothless, and because they had no choice, each and every griffon in attendance signed the paper without hesitation and passed it to the end of the table. "Continue to work as though this conversation never happened.""

 feathisia_heeren.5.d:0 "As Marshall Heeren continued to gain power, and his ranks of Sentinels steadily grew, the methods used to build Feathisia back gradually became harsher. Nobles, harmonists, and socialists were all under some kind of punishment, which they were told, would be lifted if they put in enough work. Today, in the sleepy town of Klauwermack, a story told many times across the Grand Duchy repeated itself once again. \n\nA Bronze Sentinel officer flew in place, overlooking what was once a peaceful street from his hometown that had been annihilated in the civil war. Progress on its reconstruction was coming along surprisingly well owing to the order and discipline imposed upon the workers, despite how much they protested the treatment. A little under half of the buildings that once stood proud were restored to their former image, and hardly any rubble remained in sight, but from the corner of his eye, he saw a girl throw down her tools and storm off.\n\nWith a sigh, the officer flew down and landed in front of her in one swift motion. Eyeing her up and down, he saw that she wore an ornate necklace and asked, "Are you a noble?"\n\n"I was," She huffed, trying to rush past the officer, who merely shifted back in front of her and prevented her passing. "Look, I'm so done with this! I need a break!" \n\n"Careful now," He warned her, taking a menacing step towards her, "That sounded an awful lot like insubordination. Break time isn't for another three hours, so resume your duty. I won't repeat myself." \n\n"As if!" The noble spread her wings and tried to take off in flight, only to be cracked across the face with a rifle by the officer. She crumpled to the ground and started sobbing almost immediately, which enraged the officer.\n\n"I warned you, now get back to your post immediately." He barked, giving the girl another kick for good measure before flying to the air to address the workers on the street who only looked on in horror."

 feathisia_heeren.6.t:0 "Maneuver Warfare "
 feathisia_heeren.6.d:0 "One of the guiding philosophies that served Heeren well both during and after the civil war was, 'all is fair in love and war.' Although now in the ashes of the conflict, he saw it fit to add 'and politics' onto the end.\n\nWhen the last shots were fired, a provisional government was established on an uneasy and tense foundation. For the first few weeks, decisions were made by a de-facto council of three, Anton Moldernik, Baron Herman of Voorst tot Voorst, and Marshall Heeren himself. In this immediate stage, their goals to stabilize and rebuild were identical, but as reconstruction progressed, the Marshall had begun to drift from their vision for a new Feathisia. More than this, the writing on the wall, written in their claw-writing, was that Heeren was living on borrowed time.\n\nThen Voorst tot Voorst made the biggest tactical error of his entire career, and Moldernik agreed to it: Holding elections for provincial leadership. On his own, Marshall Heeren was wildly unpopular, and only remained in office before the war thanks to his sentinels continually voting him in and intimidating those in his district to do so as well. Without a proper electoral or government apparatus, the Bronze Sentinels could stuff the ballot box, threaten voters, bribe officials to look the other way, and destroy votes against them as they saw fit. After all, it's not the votes that matter, but who counts them.\n\nSurprisingly, this wasn't necessary for some towns or provinces that Heeren and his soldiers had fought valiently to defend or liberate from the socialists, and with a few speeches made by the Marshall to win them over, he had enough organic support to make the forced elections look genuine.\n\nPolitics was no different than warfare, and often the same maneuvers that worked in combat worked in governing. By the end of the first elections, Heeren had amassed 55% of the popular vote through a combination of his methods, not enough to take over completely, but enough to build a foundation to do so once reconstruction was complete. For now, his sentinels sat on over half the provisional government seats, allowing him to act with impunity over the whole country, and rebuild it in the exact image he wanted."

 feathisia_heeren.7.d:0 ""According to this report, Marshall Heeren," Baron Herman of Vorst tot Vorst, the only other officer from the civil war who stood equal rank to Heeren, glanced up from a stack of paper held in his claws with disdain. The tension in the cramped De Vleugals conference room, which was alarmingly full of Bronze Sentinel officials, could be cut with a knife. "Your Sentinels were harassing reconstruction workers and issuing them with quotas for the day, which they faced harsh punishment for not meeting."\n\nOn the opposite end of the long, dark table was Heeren who clasped his claws together and listened, "Sounds right so far."\n\n"Glad we're on the same page," Herman spat, "the report then goes on to say that one such worker, upon receiving his quota, complained that he would be unable to meet it, prompting the Bronze Sentinel overseeing the town to pull out his rifle and strike the worker multiple times. The workers were then in an uproar, which was quelled by, again, your Sentinels drawing weapons on them and ordering them back to work."\n\n"This is standard procedure, and it's impossible to argue that it hasn't gotten results." Heeren leaned back in his chair with an expression far too casual for the situation. "My Sentinels do what needs to be done to restore Feathisia's strength. Would you rather I not do that? Perhaps you'd like me to hold their claws and read them bedtime stories."\n\n"Yes, I rather you would." Herman slapped the papers down and jabbed an accusing claw towards the Marshall. "Do you realize that how you're treating your fellow countrygriffs violates the law? What would you tell that worker, who died from his injuries, if he were right in front of us?"\n\nMarshall Heeren looked up at the ceiling and feigned as though he were in thought before leaning forward and staring straight through Baron Herman's eyes."

 feathisia_heeren.8.d:0 "After all the time that had passed from the end of the civil war to the present moment, the government should've been united, driven, and admired. The current Feathisian Provisional Government had none of those qualities. For every one good deed done by the FNV, the increasingly growing Bronze Sentinel wing of the party would commit three atrocities. The part of the FNV that hadn't succumbed to Marshall Heeren's spell or been put beneath his boot, simply had enough.\n\nA motley army composed of everyone wronged by Heeren, from harmonists, to socialists, to the children of the nobility, and fascists who couldn't stand to see their country plunged down the path Heeren laid for it, rallied in De Vleugals. They intended to split up after receiving their orders from Baron Herman of Voorst tot Voorst and Anton Moldernik, and take the country back city by city in a second civil war. It would undo all the work they've done, but in so doing, would save the country from a certain nightmare.\n\nHowever, their movement was not secret and had been reported by spies on the inside weeks in advance. So when the united front against Marshall Heeren formed, it was as though every rotten egg had been gathered in a single basket. Just as Moldernik had finished his rousing and liberating speech calling the united front to arms, the stage from under him erupted into explosions, and machine gun fire tore the crowd of soldiers to pieces.\n\nThe forces that weren't slaughtered fled in all directions and took up encampments in buildings throughout the capital. Any prominent name in the country who could stand up to Heeren was dead and all power now rested in his claws. The brutal room-to-room combat that enveloped the city, ending in Bronze Sentinel victory, would later be referred to by historians as:"

 feathisia_heeren.9.d:0 "Frederick was once a city planner in Arwie before he became a soldier for the Legion, and one of the more charming quirks about Feathisian architecture actually helped him to complete his tasks. Most storefronts in the country had two floors, with some having three, where the first floor served as the actual place of commerce while the others served as a home. That is, many store owners worked where they lived, and while a boon to productivity, it also presented a unique vulnerability.\n\nAfter picking the lock to a particular pony-owned grocer, Frederick snuck in and fastened the door located in the back storage room shut, so no one could exit from it no matter how badly they wanted to. As casually as a walk in the park, the city planner skipped out of the store back to the quiet street he entered from, making sure to grab an orange on his way out. The sun had yet to rise over Arwie, and most of its populace that weren't soldiers were still fast asleep. There were no witnesses.\n\nThe spry, young soldier picked up one of two bottles resting on the sidewalk, each of them filled with gasoline and topped with a soaked cloth, and lit it before hurling it into the upstairs window. His favorite part of the job was watching as the fire spread from a dim light in the window to an inferno, and the screams of the equines that woke to find themselves engulfed in flames was just a bonus.\n\nLike always, instead of jumping out of the window to safety, the ponies simply ran to the door that had been rigged only to open from the outside, and that's precisely when Frederick threw the second bottle inside. The particular mixture inside these bottles was set to burn out on their own after about 20 minutes of burning, so as to not damage the perfectly innocent griffon-ran businesses that may neighbor the pony-ran ones.\n\nWith a whistle, now punctuated only by silence instead of shrill shrieks, Frederick brought out a notepad with dozens of names and crossed four of them off."

Sour remarked colorlessly, placing his hooves on the table out of reflexive servility. Julius uncorked the vial and pressed it to Mint's lips, which he readily opened, letting the brew flow straight down his throat. Nothing appeared to have changed as the griffon fastened the equine's hooves to the machine with small belts.\n\n"Ok, first question, just to calibrate the lie detector: What is your name?"

His father worked the overnight shift at the textile mill that sewed the uniforms for soldiers, while his mother worked the day shift, each of them working 12 hours and ensuring someone was always home for little Sebastian.\n\nBut today was different. When his father came through the door, he looked as though he'd been wrung out, and instead of hugging his son or spinning him round as he loved, he simply collapsed onto the short couch in the cramped living room of their apartment. Sebastian's mother, who nearly dozed off in the chair next to the sofa, barely had the energy to greet him. "I've had it up to here with work!" His father yelled but was muffled by cushions.\n\n"Tell me about it, dear." Sebastian's mother lit a cigarette and took a long drag, expending just about half of the stick. "I can barely feel my claws anymore. I wish we had more time together, but..."\n\n"But country comes first!"

This would not only save the trouble of waiting on the slaves to finish constructing one from scratch, but also accelerate the speed at which faith disappears by denying a place of worship.\n\nThe second proposes to transform the temples into monuments of griffonian strength and griffonkind overall, and in so doing, transform the worship of Gods into the worship of strength and heroism, which will undoubtedly embolden our troops. Though, this sentiment is only shared amongst a minority of officers, as the worship of griffonkind could just as easily mutate into a new religion, or allow the secret praying to Gods.\n\nHowever, the final proposal is shared by a small minority of officers, but the vast majority of common soldiers throughout the Herzland: Simply level the temples.\n\nAfter a few days of thought, the Volksmaarschalk has decided the fate of the temples:\n"

FEA_gerlach_desc:0 "Gerlach Weijermars IV occupies a very strange place in politics.\n\nEntirely separate from the negative attitudes surrounding Imperial politics, the Duke has instead amassed immense respect from almost every class and political affiliation in the Empire and around the world. After ascending to rule in 990, Gerlach’s bold democratic reforms caused wide scandal amongst Imperial politics but tremendous support from the populace and combined with invaluable support from a coalition of Nobles headed by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, afforded Gerlach the political freedom necessary to form a constitution. Written in collaboration with the new political parties of Feathisia and affirmed my popular referendum, created tremendous buy-in and unity in trying times. Democracy, once shunned for its association with Republican revolution, turned into Feathisia’s greatest strength, a living compromise born out of the struggle between Imperial and Republican loyalties.\n\n‘The Silent Duke’, a term of endearment popularized by his subjects in reference to his calm, sometimes melancholic demeanor, is a strong comfort for the citizens of Feathisia and even some across the Empire. For even through trying times of an infant democracy surrounded by war, Gerlach IV always finds a way for his people."
FEA_gerlach_married_desc:0 "A significant amount of prying newspapers, suspicious Nobles, and hopeless romantics, were vindicated with the marriage of Gerlach IV and Gabriela Eagleclaw.\n\nAs the heirs of their respective houses, Gerlach and Gabriela’s youth was often spent counting down the days until the next royal ball, conference, or gathering afforded them the opportunity to hang out with their best friend, Eachother. For the better part of the last two decades, they served as each other's political muscle, with Gabriela using her many connections and hooks on Nobles to allow Gerlach’s reforms to pass unscathed, and Gerlach utilizing his popular support to call more resources and loyalty to Gabriela’s growing network of power. Though it was only realized consciously recently, it would not be unfair to assume they’ve been falling in love for decades.\n\nHowever, one cannot ignore the significant political utility the marriage has created. The popular support and loyalty the common citizens had for the Duke and Duchess as individuals has developed into an almost parasocial phenomenon, as many firmly attribute the recent and significant improvements to the Duke and Duchess’ actions. With proven track records of serving the people, either directly or indirectly, they are often the subject of praise, of idealization, and for single Griffons and ponies, pure envy."
FEA_gerlach_evil_desc:0 "Born in the year 960 in the Ducal Estate just outside de Vleugels as the eldest son and heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Feathisia, Gerlach has made a name for himself ever since he ascended the throne. A patient and diligent griffon, the Grand Duke immediately started reforming the Grand Duchy, which was, like the rest of the Griffonian Empire, still reeling from the aftermath of the Republican revolution in Griffenheim. Co-leading a committee with Rudolph Thorbeak, the leading liberal politician in Feathisia at the time, they strengthened the constitution and brought stable democracy to Feathisia. Although the Feathisians had to get used to their new rights, it only took a few years for liberty to blossom and all sorts of parties to pop up.\n\nOne of his most controversial moments saw him blocking the liberal democratic party from government until they expelled any republican sentiments. The Grand Duke explained that the Gods crowned the nobility and that the natural order of things had to be preserved, an attitude Gerlach inherited from his father, who helped fight the Republican uprising.\n\nEven though the country was doing fine, Gerlach never stopped working hard, championing the abolishment of public executions, leading industrial change and whenever possible, supporting Emperor Grover. With the emperor dead and the system, he so carefully built on the verge of collapse, an attempt on his life saw the Grand Duke's last faith in the politicians he allowed to rule fade away. The Grand Duke took full control of the country, now that his old friends betrayed him. He would do anything to protect Feathisia and eliminate all griffons who would stop him."
FEA_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down with the advent of the civil war, as more violent and pessimistic forces took over the country. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Personally, the social democrat leader managed to curb the worst excesses of violence against civilians. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it was time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel gave Feathisia a second chance, hoping to rekindle democracy in a socialist light, to heal the wounds caused by the civil war and mend the country's broken society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon would leave the already battered state vulnerable in this uncertain age."
FEA_rozenkamp_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp was born in Mirabelle, the bustling industrial city in the northeast of Feathisia. Along with his brother Reinoud, the two barely scraped by as children of the working poor. Determined to escape the fate of their parents, both of them enlisted into the army as cannoneers under a young lieutenant van Voorst tot Voorst. The officer taught them not only how to shoot a cannon, but how to shoot a cannon and be a patriot while doing it. The death of their father in a workplace accident made the Rozenkamps leave the military, however. Herman had to take care of his mother and took his father's job. There he saw the difference between the noblegriffon's speeches about love for the country and the reality of factory work. Herman would change it all.\n\nThe Rozenkamp brothers joined the local PvdA, where they were initially suspected as former soldiers. Soon enough, their energy and oratory power got noticed by the party leadership and the brothers rose through the ranks. However, instead of boring party congresses and the administrative work which his brother spent more and more time on, Herman went back to the factories and sometimes even to soldiers. There he found fertile ground for his own brand of communism, called Rozenkampism.\n\nWith the economic crisis raging through Feathisia, Rozenkamp riled against everything. The nobility, the Triarchy and the weak politicians (sometimes his own party wasn't even spared). He blamed Griffenheim and Skyfall, Equestria and the Archons. But as the political instability reached the breaking point of civil war, Rozenkamp was ready for battle. When the red banner flew over De Vleugels, it were Rozenkampists who planted it there. And it will be Rozenkamp who will lead Feathisia to glory. For the Fatherland and for the Revolution!"
FEA_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren was born in Rottendedam to a middle-class family of shopkeepers. He was the world to his parents and the bright young griffon had everything his heart desired, but at school it was already he clear Heeren was problematic. He'd sometimes get overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage and woe to the kid that stood in his way if he did. Growing older, the griffon's way with words and his rage grew into an uncanny sort of magnetism and he easily attracted friends whose slavish attitude helped inflate his ego. Of course, like so many a youth before him, young Heeren thought he had politics all figured out. It was very easy. There were two griffons in Feathisia fit to rule the country, the first, Count Gerlach, foolishly gave his power away in pursuit of cheap popularity. The other griffon would be Godfried Heeren himself, naturally.\n\nHeeren joined the Orangecloaks, a paramilitary group training in the middle of the Great Plains. There his political thought evolved further and he found that his charisma served him well as he rose to a leadership position in the radical group. He quickly adopted the group's anti-pony attitudes and sheer hatred for socialism. When the group failed to win any seats in parliament, Heeren merged the group with the FNV party, negotiating his way into the spotlight of Feathisia's political elite. Afterwards, Heeren and the FNV at large profited from the crisis crippling the country, as the jobless proved loyal new voters.\n\nWhen the Regent Debate busted the coalition government, Moldernik, ever the pragmatist, tried to negotiate a coalition with the PvdA, but Heeren already prepared for a war. He aroused so much suspicion amongst his supporters that the deal busted and Feathisia went to war. Now Heeren was in charge of Feathisia. Those who know him best, doubt this would finally soothe his anger and satisfy Heeren's hunger for power."
FEA_edgar_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel led an unassuming but productive life. Born in a small town near to the capital to a family of bureaucrats, it seemed that Edgar would follow his parents' pawsteps. An interest in numbers and a sense of duty led him to the growing ranks of the ministry of finance. Some may find the work soul grinding, but for Edgar the numbers meant something. Every time the economy grew a little more, it meant more happy families and that money saved on military expenses could be used to fund healthcare that could safe somegriffon's life. His intrinsic motivation and his frankly brilliant work on the technical aspects of economics saw him rise as quickly through the ranks as the rigid structure of Feathisian bureaucracy allowed.\n\nWhen the crisis hit and the 1007 budget was to be presented, a true battle took place between the ministries of economic affairs and the ministry of finance. Pechvogel tried to champion a free-market based budget, while the idiots of EA tried to intervene in the market. Either way, the financial crisis exploded into a political crisis and a civil war.\n\nThe war kept going, while what was left of the civilian government tried to guard De Vleugels. And the wheels of bureaucracy kept turning, with most public servants having a sense of loyalty to their department over any of the warring factions. But alarming news came from Griffenheim as the Imperials marched into Feathisia!\n\nA few days later, a group of soldiers, some wearing caps with a red star on them while others wore Feathisian military outfits, barged into what remained of parliament. Edgar Pechvogel was there, delivering some paperwork personally. The soldiers, in surprising harmony, interrogated everygriffon present, leading them straight to Edgar Pechvogel. After hearing of his ability and crosschecking the list of griffons both parties hated, the soldiers decided that Edgar would do. Not much later, the public servant got inaugurated as the head of the National Salvation Committee. As the numbers turned from money to casualties, Edgar's vivid imagination seems more of a burden than a blessing. Still, Pechvogel would set himself to the present task, doing his best, as he had all his life."
FEA_moldernik_desc:0 "Born as the son of a manager in the Aiwle oil business, Anton Moldernik got the best education money could buy, namely a social science degree at Bruma university in Yale. Both his parents were part of the FNV party and Anton would become a member at an early age. Intelligent and ruthless, Moldernik managed to get ahead in the party and to get himself on the candidacy list, securing his election victory in Aiwle. In parliament, he became the party spokesperson on agricultural affairs, a topic the FNV's main competitor, the FHP, was strong in. Nevertheless, Moldernik managed to impress the populace in debates, presenting his monarchist counterparts as spineless conservatives.\n\nAfter about a decade in politics, Moldernik got elevated to the level of party leader, which he would remain until the Regency crisis broke out. With tensions flaring up, Moldernik sought to strike a deal with Kogchel. Much to his dismay, the deal faltered and his comfortable life shattered into a civil war. It took the nationalist some time to adjust to the new situation, but the fascist grew into his role as leader of the now openly authoritarian FNV. Now that the guns are silent and with his power reaffirmed, Anton Moldernik faces the task of redefining Feathisia and giving meaning to the lives of its people."
FEA_stappenbeld_desc:0 "Bernhardt Stappenbeld grew up in Rottendedam, the port city of Feathisia. Born with an inherent curiosity and a quick mind, the griffon started writing from a young age. Although his fiction was of a mediocre quality, his prose was good enough for the work of a journalist. Adventurous, the Feathisian accepted a job offer to report on stories from Stalliongrad. Over the years, his readers may have found the tone of his stories changing. Critical at first, the griffon living amongst ponies mocked the ponies of the Severyana for revolting against such a benevolent ruler like Celestia.\n\nSlowly but surely, the accounts of failing agricultural plans and empty store shelves made way for intricate essays on Stalliongradian communism and then what his critics called straight up love letters to socialism. When the journalist went home and joined the PvdA on the day of his return, they found a changed griffon. A sceptical journalist crossed the sea, returning as a socialist ideologue. His teachings, brought over from Stalliongrad, attracted a split following; intelligentsia and self-proclaimed revolutionaries on the one claw, and actual workers on the other.\n\nWith revolution raging in Feathisia, Stappenbeld's ranks grew enormously as his prophecy of class struggle indeed became true. The journalist showed himself a capable leader, eclipsing the social democrats in the PvdA and managing to get into party leadership. Now Bernhardt Stappenbeld looked over the ocean once more, ready to put theory into practice."
FEA_vorst_desc:0 "Born into the prestigious Van Vorst tot Vorst family, Herman was the heir to their land. Herman carried his heritage with him wherever he went, learning the traits that defined a good noblegriffon from school and at home. Staunch, conservative, brave and strategic, he graduated top of his class in the officer academy showing that a noble birth did not mean a lack of merit. Serving in many posts, including a fateful while as an artillery officer, the baron became popular among his troops for his no-nonsense attitude and straight up patriotism.\n\nFrom the army, Herman learned the value of hierarchy, of tradition and of the institution of the military. As he climbed through the ranks, he started to flirt with the FNV party, a highly unorthodox choice for a noblegriffon. But the Ducal party had grown spineless, giving to many concessions to weak doves who wanted total equality. When the system broke down, the Baron and soldiers loyal to him stepped in to fight on the side of the nationalists.\n\nHowever, during the fighting, Van Vorst tot Vorst discovered that his newfound allies were little better, discarding tradition in favour of something radically new. They had to be stopped as well and the Baron did stop them. Now the military rules Feathisia, guarding the people against any threat, both from the inside and from abroad. The House of Van Vorst tot Vorst stands victorious and vigilant against threats both foreign and domestic."

FEA_stefan_desc:0 "The cousin of the more famous Gerlach IV, Stefan Weijermars lived in relative obscurity as a curator to De Vleugels art museum. His true passion never lay in politics, although he shared the same enthusiasm for art as his cousin did for running a nation. Described as an introvert, only coming to life when the conversation comes to his passion, it was easy to forget the griffon's lineage when meeting him. Everything changed with the death of his cousin. The Weijermars family scattered when the civil war began, some leaving the country successfully, others shot by marauding Rozenkampists. Stefan was hidden by the museum staff amongst some of the most precious artworks. Only when the civil war died down, with the military securing victory, did Stefan come out.\n\nThe Baron's soldiers located Weijermars and after a conversation behind closed doors, he decided to take the title of Grand Duke of Feathisia. Whether he agreed in an effort to soften the military rule over the country, or because Stefan I was indeed a supporter of military stratocracy is up to speculation, but he must have no illusions of ever obtaining the power or influence his deceased cousin once wielded."
FEA_talonsley_desc:0 "A social and moderate liberal and beloved prime minister of Feathisia, Arjen Talonsley has led the country through an age of gradual destabilization. A griffon of compromises and normalcy, he is not above negotiations and solutions where 'everygriffon wins'.\n\nTalonsley took over the LDP after an incident known as the 'Night of Molenaer', after his predecessor as ruler of the LDP. Molenaer had won a stunning election victory against the monarchist FHP party, but the conservatives threatened to blow up negotiations for a government unless the LDP would openly denounce republicanism. Later on, it was proven that this demand came directly from the Grand Duke, but that night, the LDP was forced to choose between principle or pragmatism. Molenaer chose principles, but in an internal party vote, he was rejected by a narrow margin and Talonsley became head of the party, forging the LDP-FHP coalition. Molenaer left the party and Talonsley lost much of the republican vote to the PvdA, but he had his government. In time Arjen Talonsley and the LDP would shown that monarchy and liberty were not opposed values, but actually complement each other nicely. His free market approach to may see his support decline amongst the average griffon, however, especially during a crisis."

FEA_literally_dice_desc:0 "Out of all the weapons, shells, and bombs in Feathisia's arsenal, arguably the most dangerous is a Griffon who wears floral patterned shirts to battle. Depending on the story, Dobbelsteen Moerman was born either in 984 or at the dawn of time, and has made his name as a celebrity to the people, a nuisance to the police, a disgrace to the general staff, and as a hero to his soldiers. His exploits and successes in combat and training earned the explicit trust of the Duke of Feathisia, and afforded him untold leeway in the creation of Feathisia's special forces element, known as the Commandotroepen. Amongst the paper trail of insults against every political party, 86 arrests, 0 convictions, an ongoing attempt to convince the Duke to fund public gymnasiums, and a standing warrant for his arrest in Skyfall, Dobbelsteen Moerman has already earned himself the distinction as the most well-known troublemaker in the Herzland."

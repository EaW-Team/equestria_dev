FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_in_freefall:0 "Total Freefall"
FEA_in_freefall_desc:0 "The situation is rapidly deteriorating, as constant warfare has scorched the continent of Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it faith in any and all financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremists both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PVdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."
FEA_bank_runs1:0 "Bank Runs"
FEA_bank_runs1_desc:0 "Decreased confidence in the economy leads to distrust of every economic institution, and this distrust manifests in total panic. Banks are lending at unprecedented and predatory rates, investments are falling through across the board, and if this wasn't frightening enough, the lack of confidence in these institutions has led to people withdrawing their savings en masse. Given that banks use their clients' money for investments and loans, which are then falling through, the money simply is not there to take out, which drastically worsens the problem. This is a horrific cycle that must end very soon or the entire country may come down around us!"

### National Focuses ###
FEA_its_over:0 "It's Over"
FEA_its_over_desc:0 "It has never been more over for Feathisia than it is right now. Everything that could of gone wrong, has gone wrong, and Feathisia's political and economic string of misfortunes would be funny if it wasn't tearing the fabric of our society apart. Parliament has locked itself out of compromise, and the crisis worsens by the day. The Duke must intervene, and fast!"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions:0 "Prevent Bank Repossessions"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions_desc:0 "In addition to falling wages, Griffons have been threatened with the loss of their homes, their farms, and their livelihoods. The banks, in an effort to make good on their debts, resolved to take what little our citizens have left. If this happens, there will be no hope of salvaging the situation!"
FEA_trade_union_visit:0 "Visit The Trade Unions"
FEA_trade_union_visit_desc:0 "In times of crisis, leaders usually meet those with influence for solutions to the current issues. Duke Gerlach has instead opted to meet with the workers whose lives have been affected the most by those with influence. Moreover, he refuses to act unless the voice of the worker is heard."
FEA_price_controls:0 "Institute Price Controls"
FEA_price_controls_desc:0 "In these difficult times, the price of staple goods has soared well beyond the reach of the common griff. These prices cannot stand. Duke Gerlach has passed a law dictating strict price controls for these goods so that no griffon goes hungry or cold."
FEA_investment_gamble:0 "The Investment Gamble"
FEA_investment_gamble_desc:0 "Feathisia won't survive without an injection of wealth, and it doesn't need to rely on private groups to get it. Duke Gerlach has taken advantage of his reputation to offer mutually beneficial investment opportunities to an assortment of nations."
FEA_tax_corporations:0 "Hike Corporate Taxes"
FEA_tax_corporations_desc:0 "One of the standing truths of our economy, precluding the current disaster, is the concentration of wealth into the claws of the few. Duke Gerlach has already demanded higher taxation of their wealth in this time of crisis."
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers:0 "Crack Down On Smugglers"
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers_desc:0 "With the breakdown in Feathisia's merchant class, bandits have taken to seizing goods and selling them back at exorbitant rates. Regiments of the Feathisian Army have been deployed to shut down this immoral enterprise."
FEA_cut_federal_salaries:0 "Cut Federal Salaries"
FEA_cut_federal_salaries_desc:0 "The representatives and administrative workers of the government are living well above the average Griffon. In order to balance the budget, this gap must be closed, and their salaries cut. Whether this reduction in salary is more to balance the budget, or a act of principle by the Duke, is up to interpretation."
FEA_save_the_banks:0 "Save The Banks"
FEA_save_the_banks_desc:0 "As though Feathisia did not have enough problems, there are frequent runs on the banks which worsen our situation even further. This, in addition to out of control lending and the loss of investments by the banks, means that our money supply is quickly evaporating. If this situation is to be mended, then all deposits must be ensured and all losses covered."
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes:0 "Moratorium On Estate Taxes"
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes_desc:0 "If this crisis is to be resolved, it will take the effort of Griffons from all walks of life. Favors and kind words to the Nobility will soothe their worries, and gain their backing in our other political actions. A temporary stay on estate taxes will accomplish just this. Besides, the estates aren't producing much value in these trying times anyways."
FEA_eight_hour_workday:0 "The Eight Hour Workday"
FEA_eight_hour_workday_desc:0 "The Duke believes we are not dealing with an economic, or a political crisis, but a societal one. The only way to prevent the breakdown of Feathisia is to offer confidence in the hearts of the people, and allow them to live their lives. The Eight hour workday limit is a good start to affording more time to the personal lives of the people, and healing the divides of our Duchy."
FEA_not_so_different:0 "Not So Different"
FEA_not_so_different_desc:0 "Moldernik, the leader of the FNV, has proven to be quite more open to cooperation than most in the LDP first believed. Prime Minister Talonsley and Moldernik, at the Duke's request, have discussed common goals of both parties, like increased veteran benefits. Such legislation, no matter how minor, can ease tensions between the parties."
FEA_bank_nationalisation:0 "Nationalize The Banks"
FEA_bank_nationalisation_desc:0 "The simple answer to our banking woes is a direct nationalisation of the financial institutions of Feathisia. Bringing credit under federal control has effectively already been accomplished, and would bring much needed faith in the banks."
FEA_bank_regulation:0 "The Kogchel-Moldernik Act"
FEA_bank_regulation_desc:0 "A proposal from the unlikeliest of duos, the leaders of both the PvDA and the FNV have offered a joint-bill to Gerlach to seperate investment banking, dealing with corporations and stocks, from commerical banking, which offers services to individuals. Such a proposal is seen as a middle ground to preserve investment, and offer much needed regulation."
FEA_a_square_deal:0 "A Square Deal"
FEA_a_square_deal_desc:0 "Gerlach has met with workers and employers alike to serve as a mediator of their issues, and has successfully secured concessions for both parties involved! The working griff enjoys higher wages and increased benefits, and the employers can utilize a returning supply of labor to their workplaces!"
FEA_tempering_extremists:0 "Tempering Extremists"
FEA_tempering_extremists_desc:0 "Anton Moldernik and Gerben Kogchel may be the leaders of opposite ideologies, but a strange show of mutual respect has risen between the two throughout the crisis. Collaborating to present a manner of ideas, Gerlach has agreed to work with them... in exchange for their help in the suppression of their more unsavory political allies."
FEA_we_are_back:0 "We're So Back"
FEA_we_are_back_desc:0 "The Duke's active role in solving this crisis, as well as parliament's full collaboration, has elevated him from a beloved monarch into a national hero. With a stable economy and increasing optimism from the people, it's like we never left."
FEA_rallying_moderates:0 "Rallying Moderates"
FEA_rallying_moderates_desc:0 "Members of the LDP and FHP have had their faith tested throughout the crisis, but with the confidence and eagerness to work with the moderate parties, their numbers have seen a resurgence!"
FEA_fireside_chat:0 "A Fireside Chat"
FEA_fireside_chat_desc:0 "With a year passing since Gerlach's first action to solve the crisis, Feathisia has been brought back from the brink of collapse. Believing that the crisis was caused by lingering doubts that go deeper than strictly economics, the Duke has scheduled a nation-wide radio address directly to the citizens of the Duchy, to address their fears, their questions, and their hopes."

### Pre-Federalization Focus Tree ###
FEA_grand_estate_party:0 "Grand Estate Party"
FEA_grand_estate_party_desc:0 "Today the twin duchies of the Feathisia and Strawberry have taken a gallant step forward together in unity just as its two leaders have in matrimony! While there is still work to be done finalizing the terms of unification and integration, this is tomorrow's task. Tonight, the whole region celebrates the union of lands and leaders!"
FEA_twelve_days_in_bronzekreuz:0 "Twelve Days In Bronzekreuz"
FEA_twelve_days_in_bronzekreuz_desc:0 "Bronzehill has remained a fiercely loyal subject of the Empire since the days of Grover II, but the tides are changing both inside the Bronze Mountains and in the Herzland as a whole. If we are to minimize the bloodshed in unifying the region under one banner, we must convince the Diamond Dogs of our legitimacy and commitment to peace and stability!"
FEA_approach_the_peasant_democracy:0 "Approach The Peasant Democracy"
FEA_approach_the_peasant_democracy_desc:0 "One of the most resilient and shining examples of democracy in the Herzland comes from the Peasant Democracy in Greifenmarschen, and we see no reason why a vote cannot be held in both of our lands to unify without a drop of blood being spilled!"
FEA_shake_claws_with_romau:0 "Shake Claws With Romau"
FEA_shake_claws_with_romau_desc:0 "Romau has always enjoyed a great deal of autonomy in the Empire, but its history is one of instability, codependence, and stagnation. While the thought of independence is great on paper, the reality is that integration without war would be best for both our sake and the sake of the Herzland overall."
FEA_appeal_to_angriver:0 "Appeal To Angriver"
FEA_appeal_to_angriver_desc:0 "The Barony of Angriver is a rare case of a nation where history has stood completely still, and while it somehow marches on, it does so on borrowed time. We must appeal to its people and its leadership for unification before it's too late."
FEA_the_greenback_convention:0 "The Greenback Convention"
FEA_the_greenback_convention_desc:0 "As though it were a mirror image of the Empire, Yale is a nation in decline and its leadership struggles to provide meaningful answers to or progress on any of their most glaring questions. However, all of these issues can be solved through direct integration with our lands, and it wouldn't cost them a single bullet. Thus, a convention must be held to quickly unify our territories!"
FEA_restore_the_order_in_katerin:0 "Restore The Order In Katerin"
FEA_restore_the_order_in_katerin_desc:0 "One of the most desolate, unstable, and hopeless regions of the Herzland is the sorry state of Katerin, and its people deserve far better. A letter has been dispatched with demands for immediate annexation for the good of the region, for the good of its people, and the good of the Herzland as a whole."

FEA_demand_griffenheim_desc_text:0 "We have the numbers and we have the legitimacy, and the only obstacle to a peaceful and democratic Herzland is a false pretender in Griffenheim. The hour of its defeat has arrived, and we come to kick in the door and demand the final jewel in the crown for good and all!" ##This is a text that appears in FEA_demand_griffenheim desc if you don't own it and married Gabriela as a ruler in STW
FEA_federalization_of_the_reichspakt:0 "Federalization Of The Reichspakt"
FEA_federalization_of_the_reichspakt_desc:0 "The Herzland is finally back in one piece after so many years of turmoil, but even still, it is far from being united. As of now, we have many overlapping governments, economies, and legal codes functioning at the same time, and this is on top of cultural dissonance across the region. They must be brought under a single banner, the Empire must be federalised!"

### Harmonist/Centrist Gerlach Focus Tree ###

FEA_guarantee_union_rights:0 "Guarantee Union Rights"
FEA_guarantee_union_rights_desc:0 "The urgent needs of our laborers are not issues that can simply be kicked down the road as often as they arise, they must be taken seriously. To this end, every worker in every industry will be allowed to join a union and make his voice heard without threat of retaliation!"
FEA_office_of_public_integrity:0 "Office of Public Integrity"
FEA_office_of_public_integrity_desc:0 "It stands as no surprise that the years of decline and conflict in the Empire have created a hotbed for corruption among its officials, which only further adds to the problem. We've found limited success in our efforts to uproot this issue so far, so we must double down and create a public institution charged exclusively with rooting out corruption!"
FEA_fruits_of_our_labor:0 "Fruits of our Labor"
FEA_fruits_of_our_labor_desc:0 "What good is unity in the Herzland if we simply ignore the very states that make us whole? From the classrooms of Yale to the fields of Greifenmarschen, from the forests of Angriver to the marshes of Feathisia, we must cultivate the rich potential of the region!"
FEA_bail_out_noble_industries:0 "Bail Out Noble Industries"
FEA_bail_out_noble_industries_desc:0 "The pitiful state of the economy over the past few decades has led to noble-owned companies taking on massive losses and debt through no fault of their own, and it would be unfair to saddle the largest industries to that deficit. Thus, the state will take on the debt owed by these industries to free the burden on our economy!"
FEA_abolish_inheritance_tax:0 "Abolish Inheritance Tax"
FEA_abolish_inheritance_tax_desc:0 "Among the loudest demands from the nobility across the country is to do away with the taxation on inheritances, as that money was earned rightfully by noble estates and handed down to relatives and trustees, which ought to be no business of the government. We agree, and henceforth, all inheritance across the country will be free from taxation!"
FEA_ministry_of_wellbeing:0 "Ministry of Wellbeing"
FEA_ministry_of_wellbeing_desc:0 "The health of the people is the health of the entire nation, and both are far too important to cut any corners! For this, an institution must be created to provide affordable healthcare to the masses, and social services to the most needy among our populace so all can benefit from the blessings of good health!"
FEA_regulatory_hardball:0 "Regulatory Hardball"
FEA_regulatory_hardball_desc:0 "Private interests are the primary driver of our economy, but this doesn't mean that our administration will simply cater to their demands at the expense of the Herzland or its people, so we must curb the influence of the industrialists through the power of regulation. If it ever comes down to money or people, we'll make sure the people win every time."
FEA_codify_rights_of_citizen:0 "Codify the Rights of Citizens"
FEA_codify_rights_of_citizen_desc:0 "The rights that citizens across the Herzland have varies on what part of the region they live in, but this only creates headaches and handicaps on the liberty of the people. To remedy this, a new list of standardized and expanded rights for the citizens has been drawn up and approved to apply to everyone in the Empire!"
FEA_equality_before_law:0 "Equality Before the Law"
FEA_equality_before_law_desc:0 "Up until now, the law that applied to the wealthy and the law that applied to the poor were different. In the new Empire, no one will be above the law, so the nobility and the wealthy industrialists will no longer be passed over for their crimes, and can no longer bribe their way out of jail."
FEA_secularisatie_harmonic:0 "Secularisatie"
FEA_secularisatie_harmonic_desc:0 "Religious laws are simply codified discrimination, and the state should serve the people above everything else, not subordinate them to the whims of the temples. While the people have a right to their faith, they also have a right to a government separated from it!"
FEA_imperial_charter:0 "Ratify the Imperial Charter"
FEA_imperial_charter_desc:0 "Just as the people themselves have rights that cannot be taken away, so too do the states of the Herzland!The Imperial Charter sees fit to allow each state of the Herzland to enact its own laws as well elect its own representatives at the local and state levels, provided they don't conflict with the overarching law of the Empire!"
FEA_cabinet_of_the_reichspakt:0 "Cabinet of the Reichspakt"
FEA_cabinet_of_the_reichspakt_desc:0 "For as competent as the leaders of the Herzland are, they cannot know everything, so a team of advisors and experts in various fields from across the region must be assembled in order to brief the leaders of our country on any given matter so that any decision made is the best decision that can be made!"
FEA_imperial_parlament_harmonic:0 "Convene the Imperial Parliament"
FEA_imperial_parlament_harmonic_desc:0 "The rights of the people and the states have been ratified, and a new code of freedom and autonomy reigns across the Empire!

### Far Right Gerlach Focus Tree ###

FEA_buyout_failing_industries:0 "Buyout Failing Industries"
FEA_buyout_failing_industries_desc:0 "The economy is too precious and vital to the state to be left in private claws, but it would be undemocratic and against the fascist creed to protect private enterprise to simply nationalise industries, so instead we will do what is within our power to accomplish both and simply purchase failing industries and put them under state management! "
FEA_nationalize_telephone_lines:0 "Nationalize Telephone Lines"
FEA_nationalize_telephone_lines_desc:0 "A significant and rapidly growing industry in the Empire is telecommunications, and it connects people despite vast distances while generating a considerable amount of revenue. While seizing the businesses would be against our values, purchasing the companies outright would not, and doing so would net the state a significant source of funds."
FEA_seize_our_potential:0 "Seize Our Full Potential"
FEA_seize_our_potential_desc:0 "The Herzland is a region rich in culture, history, and untapped potential. We must reverse the trend of decay and waste in the Empire by cultivating its lands to bolster every part of its strength and its people!"
FEA_recognize_noble_titles:0 "Recognize Noble Titles"
FEA_recognize_noble_titles_desc:0 "Among the louder voices who supposedly speak for the FNV is Heeren, who is as deranged as he is anti-monarchist. However, the stated FNV position is not against the nobility, not against private property, and not against democracy, and to cement this fact we will officially recognize and protect noble titles and noble property!"
FEA_bar_extremists_from_office:0 "Bar Extremists from Office"
FEA_bar_extremists_from_office_desc:0 "Extremists like Rozenkamp and Heeren do nothing but take up valuable space to represent the most incoherent and rabid of opinions in the Herzland, which themselves are extremely unpopular. The wasted seats filled by them could be suited to better candidates who represent productive ideas rather than delusion, and as of today, extremists are no longer welcome."
FEA_after_work_leauge:0 "After-Work League"
FEA_after_work_leauge_desc:0 "Workers deserve leisure time that is rewarding and connects them to their community. Thus, a resolution has passed to organize a community-oriented organization to provide concerts, clubs, cultural fairs, sports facilities, and outdoor hikes at little to no cost to the worker!"
FEA_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
FEA_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "While much of the old Empire's decay was caused by a bloated administration and consistent economic decline, both of these were dramatically worsened by corruption. For as much as we've tried to purge this from the new Empire, we must double down on our efforts to fully eliminate it for good and all!"
FEA_encourage_productivism:0 "Encourage Productivism"
FEA_encourage_productivism_desc:0 "The purpose of life is action for the good of the community and to grow as an individual in the process, not some misplaced idea that life itself is driven by economic forces as the socialists say. It then follows that if this is the purpose of one's life, then the worker ought to take pride in his work and the state ought to encourage them in various ways!"
FEA_one_herzland_one_law:0 "One Herzland, One Law"
FEA_one_herzland_one_law_desc:0 "The current state of the Herzland is a motley mess of overlapping economies, governments, and legal codes that only serves to bring the Empire back into ruin. If there is to be a whole Herzland, then there must be one way of governing, one way of economics, and one law that its population follows."
FEA_secularisatie_fascism:0 "Enshrine Religious Freedom"
FEA_secularisatie_fascism_desc:0 "All the chatter in the halls of Parliament lately about a secular government betray the sentiments of most citizens in the Empire. Worship of the gods is part of our national identity, and to strip that from our government in any way is to strip away one of its most vital parts. Thus, a resolution must be passed to enshrine religious freedoms and laws!"
FEA_peoples_charter:0 "Ratify the National People's Constitution"
FEA_peoples_charter_desc:0 "Just as we have secured freedom and unity among every state of the Herzland, we shall now extend this to the people. No democracy is complete without a constitution, and no people are truly free unless their rights are secured. We declare that every citizen will have the right to life, liberty, and victory!"
FEA_herzland_council_of_fascism:0 "The Herzland Council of Fascism"
FEA_herzland_council_of_fascism_desc:0 "The future of the Herzland and its people is fascism, but as of now the FNV has no official party line, no plan of succession, no ability to approve and appoint government clerks or deputies, and no check on power to the other parties or the royal family. Hence, a body to serve these purposes, and to advise the direction of the country, must be formed!"
FEA_imperial_parlament_fascism:0 "Convene the Imperial Parliament"
FEA_imperial_parlament_fascism_desc:0 "The terms are clear, the rights of the people are established, and fascism remains the word on the horizon that we've set our course for. The only thing left to do is merge the parliaments from across the country into one unified body so that the whole Herzland may be heard!"

FEA_momentum_and_initiative:0 "Momentum And Inintiative"
FEA_momentum_and_initiative_desc:0 "No plan survives first contact with the enemy.

  FEA_scale_back_taxation_desc:0 "What good are improvements to the economy if the population is taxed so much that they can't even enjoy it? Taxation must be brought down across the board to free up the funds of the people so that they may spend more and improve the economy!"
  FEA_prison_labor:0 "Give Prisoners Work"
  FEA_prison_labor_desc:0 "The notion from the socialists to make prison a rehabilitative vacation makes about as much sense as the current policy of allowing prisoners to do nothing but waste taxpayer money! The prisoners can be doing something productive with their time and with our resources, like building rails, schools, laying telegraph lines, or building sewers, not simply loafing about!"

  FEA_slash_tarrifs_desc:0 "Unlike some of the more illogical members of parliament who want to limit foreign trade to encourage domestic production, the LDP recognizes this for the backward policy it is!

  FEA_rent_control_desc:0 "Few things are as scary for the working family than a notice that their rent has gone up, and it's especially frustrating when their home has no discernable improvements to justify the increase.

  FEA_limits_on_strikes_desc:0 "Nothing is more valuable to the worker than the ability to unionize and strike, but by the same token, nothing is more dangerous to the economy than a strike that happens at the wrong time.

  FEA_lower_trade_duties:0 "Lower Trade Duties"
  FEA_lower_trade_duties_desc:0 "Some foreign goods that we import have high enough trade duties on their shipments that it actually heightens the price the consumer has to pay, and if we can cut those duties down to size, the price would come down and sales would increase!

  FEA_free_school_lunches:0 "Free School Lunches"
  FEA_free_school_lunches_desc:0 "The families of our country shouldn't have to pay the schools every day to feed their children, or let those poorer students starve because their parents can't afford the fee!

  FEA_free_emergency_care:0 "Free Emergency Care"
  FEA_free_emergency_care_desc:0 "An often repeated tragedy in the country goes something like this: A worker finds success and amasses a comfortable savings, only to get ill or injured, and lose it all to medical debt. No one should lose their success from something out of their control, least of all a medical emergency! So, from hereon, all legitimate medical emergencies will be treated for free!"
  FEA_progressive_income_tax:0 "Progressive Income Tax"
  FEA_progressive_income_tax_desc:0 "Until now, the tax rates of the population have been the same across the board, but it's becoming increasingly clear that this is an outdated model. The poor have less to pay, and tend to spend more money, while the wealthy have much more to pay and tend to save their money. It follows then that the more money one has, the more taxes they should pay!"
  FEA_consistant_public_works:0 "Consistent Public Works"
  FEA_consistant_public_works_desc:0 "Two problems have been plaguing the nation that have been somewhat difficult to mend: A lack of public buildings and infrastructure, and considerable unemployment. But, if we hire on these unemployed workers to build these projects, we can provide them with a valuable job, skills, and income while also meeting our construction needs!"
  FEA_fair_market:0 "Fair Market"
  FEA_fair_market_desc:0 "One of the most fatal errors of the free market is the callous disregard for its failures, which it blames on individuals rather than assume responsibility. This is not the case in the Herzland, as we've created a market that is as free as the people, while managing to safeguard any of its shortcomings and ensure its fairness!"

  FEA_class_synchronization_desc:0 "The inequality between the classes is not something to be ignored until the schism boils over into hostility, as nobles desire, nor is it something to be fused together the nation is one impoverished class as socialists desire.

  FEA_pay_off_family_mortgages_desc:0 "Among the bills that most families have to pay to keep their heads above water, the mortgage bill is the most dreaded and expensive of them all.

  FEA_nationaal_welzijn_desc:0 "Despite our best intentions and widespread success, there are still those among our populace that are needy, and we must not turn up our noses and balk or tell them their poverty is their own fault.

  FEA_agricultural_mobilization:0 "Agricultural Mobilization"
  FEA_agricultural_mobilization_desc:0 "The farmlands of our nation are rich and fertile, but they're still being cultivated with the tools of our grandfathers rather than the tools of modernity.

  FEA_service_over_self:0 "Service Over Self"
  FEA_service_over_self_desc:0 "It's a noble mindset to put the wellbeing and security of others over oneself, but it is a great triumph of the country if nearly every citizen embodies it as our nation does!

  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights:0 "Restrict Drilling Rights"
  FEA_restrict_drilling_rights_desc:0 "Puncturing holes in the earth to drain it of its oil should be just as insulting as puncturing the flesh and draining its blood!

  FEA_create_the_staatsvaksbond_desc:0 "It stands to reason that if the employers have their own association, and if the state is to mediate between them and the workers, that the workers themselves should be apart of a united union to make their demands heard.

FEA_jail_disloyal_officers:0 "Jail Disloyal Officers"
FEA_jail_disloyal_officers_desc:0 "The recent necessary actions taken by Duke Gerlach have sparked outrage and condemnation across the country, especially in the officer corps of the military.

FEA_in_defense_of_autocracy_desc:0 "It appears that our most recent and necessary actions have drawn animosity from nearly every pampered member of society, from the furthest left to the furthest right. What the Duke is doing is harsh, it is bleak, but they are not the actions of a madgriff, but the calculated policies of someone doing what is needed."
FEA_open_the_armories:0 "Forced Conversions"
FEA_open_the_armories_desc:0 "War is on the horizon to take back the Empire and exact justice, but resolve alone cannot win battles. We need rifles, cannons, radios, bandages, binoculars, trucks, and telegraphs in order to wage an effective war and claim victory, and we can hardly produce any of these vital tools if the economy is wasted producing luxuries and trinkets, so they must be retooled immediately."

FEA_unite_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "From across the breadth of the country, young men and women answer the Duke's call to action, take up arms, and march to their nearest recruitment office. The will to fight has been instilled in enough young citizens, that a considerable number of volunteer divisions can be assembled to fight for justice!"
FEA_assume_direct_control:0 "Assume Direct Control"
FEA_assume_direct_control_desc:0 "The same generals that we're trusting to lead this crusade against Dawnclaw are the same ones who could just as easily turn the army around and march on De Vleugels. This possibility must be denied, and the command of the army will be left to Duke Gerlach himself for the duration of the conflict. "
FEA_command_the_economy:0 "Command The Economy"
FEA_command_the_economy_desc:0 "Private enterprise necessarily exists to create and hoard profit first, and any benefit the country or any worker gleans from that is secondary and incidental. We do not have the resources, the time, or the will to allow for such profiteering during our darkest hour, thus, the economy will now fall under the command of the state itself."

FEA_guide_their_hate_desc:0 "Common purpose can be a great unifier of the people, but a common enemy is drastically more effective, and there is no greater enemy than the maniac in Griffenheim. Hatred stirs everyone's heart to beat as one and compels them to act in whatever way they can, and guiding that hate toward crushing Dawnclaw will make his defeat inevitable."
FEA_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
FEA_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "The army is disciplined and ready, the workers give their all to produce for the war effort with full conviction, the country is completely stable and all threats are but a fleeting memory. Now that everything is in order, the only thing left to do is gather our strength and plan our attack."
FEA_revengeance:0 "Revengeance"
FEA_revengeance_desc:0 "The Empire was a rotten carcass of its former self just years ago, and Ferdinand Dawnclaw desecrated that corpse and defiled the lineage when he seized power and murdered Emperor Grover VI. The past few years have been spent in fury, in preparation, and in vengeance. The time to strike is now, he will not leave alive!"
FEA_the_peoples_prisoner:0 "The People's Prisoner"
FEA_the_peoples_prisoner_desc:0 "Griffenheim is ours and the Empire is reclaimed, but justice has not been served for the monster responsible. Ferdinand Dawnclaw sits in a jail cell without the faintest hope of a trial, counting down the minutes until his death. While a public execution would give everyone the catharsis and justice they deserve, the Duke has something better in mind..."
FEA_consistent_public_works:0 "Consistent Public Works"
FEA_consistent_public_works_desc:0 "Now that one of our greatest ambitions has been fulfilled, we must turn our sights inward to perfect the Empire we've inherited. The workers don't need to produce weapons of war anymore, but they do need employment that is just as meaningful, and consistent public works throughout the country solve both issues and improve their lives simultaneously!"
FEA_rubber_stamp_legislature:0 "Rubber Stamp Legislature"
FEA_rubber_stamp_legislature_desc:0 "Operating under Martial Law has proved to be extremely effective, but now that things are beginning to settle down, problems are arising that can't easily be solved through force. However, democratization is a mistake, so instead of an open and free legislature, one shall be approved to run as a loyal extension of the Duke's power!"
FEA_shackled_parliament:0 "Shackled Parliament"
FEA_shackled_parliament_desc:0 "The overwhelming cries for representation across the Herzland territories are getting to be impossible to ignore, and while we could crack down on these pleas and reassert our authority, it would be a better course of action to install a puppet parliament. While ostensibly representing the people, this body will act only per the Duke's wishes."
FEA_redeem_the_throne:0 "Redeem The Throne"
FEA_redeem_the_throne_desc:0 "The current state of Griffenheim is a bloodied and battered remnant of what it was, and no place in the city is more tarnished than the throne itself.

We can show those who survived the horror that it has passed, and we are here to give them a brighter future."
FEA_charity_houses:0 "Charity Houses"
FEA_charity_houses_desc:0 "Though the common worker's conditions have improved steadily since we've assumed control, many spend most of their earnings to just barely meet their bottom line. While we can't simply give the people money directly, we can open a series of shops that sell essential goods at a heavily reduced cost thanks to new taxation levied against the church!"
FEA_enemies_everywhere:0 "Enemies Everywhere"
FEA_enemies_everywhere_desc:0 "For as uniquely evil as Dawnclaw was, he is not the only malevolent threat in the Herzland. As far as we're concerned, the entire Herzland is our enemy and must be reclaimed just as Griffenheim was."
FEA_muzzle_the_press:0 "Muzzle The Press"
FEA_muzzle_the_press_desc:0 "The press had been our biggest enemy in Feathisia, but with some convincing and coercion, it became an invaluable propaganda machine. Curiously, the reverse is true in the newly unified territory, the press hails us as liberators and heroes. Their praise now can just as easily turn into scorn later, and as such, the press cannot be trusted and must be reigned in."
FEA_listening_posts:0 "Listening Posts"
FEA_listening_posts_desc:0 "Having secret police running about the streets and grabbing people away at night is in bad taste, and only serves to earn the public's distrust and fear. Besides, we have no need for them when we can simply listen in on everyone's phone calls through Switchboard Monitors and arrest dissenters in a more refined and private fashion."
FEA_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
FEA_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "For as great an effort as we've made to control dissent and maximize security, we should be putting just as much into dislodging the disloyal sentiments from the populace in the first place!

FEA_a_tractor_for_every_farmer:0 "A Tractor For Every Farmer"
FEA_a_tractor_for_every_farmer_desc:0 "The state of agriculture across the Herzland has been neglected by the decades of tumultuous conflicts, with some farmers still relying on manual tools for tilling and harvesting. This is far from what we're capable of, so it's time we give the farmers everything they could want free of charge!"
FEA_leerplicht:0 "Leerplicht"
FEA_leerplicht_desc:0 "Typically, parents decide if their children should go to school or not, and for how long should they go if they can even afford to, but this way of things is completely wrong! To deny our youth schooling is nothing short of neglect. Every child from age 6 to 18 will now be mandated to stay in school, free of charge to parents and with free lunches to boot!"
FEA_put_prisoners_to_work:0 "Put Prisoners To Work"
FEA_put_prisoners_to_work_desc:0 "There's no greater waste of potential than prisoners who loaf about in their cells, literally eating and sleeping away tax money when they could be laboring for the people's benefit. Prison labor has a harsh ring to it, but we will not be so crass as to treat prisoners poorly, when we can pay them for their work and reduce their sentences according to services rendered."
FEA_national_railway_project:0 "National Railway Project"
FEA_national_railway_project_desc:0 "Much of the Herzland is rural and disconnected from the cities by way of roads or rails, and this does nothing but hinder our own potential! The small-time farmer in Feathisia should be able to transport their goods all the way to Griffenheim,  and there ought to be rails stretching across the country that can accommodate them!"
FEA_refurbish_the_libraries:0 "Refurbish The Libraries"
FEA_refurbish_the_libraries_desc:0 "Throughout much of the Herzland, public libraries remain poorly kept, poorly supplied, or in some tragic cases, both. We have the funds to properly maintain and staff them, but the only thing we need is the books themselves to fill each and every shelf, and that won't be hard to accomplish!"
FEA_modernize_the_hospitals:0 "Modernize The Hospitals"
FEA_modernize_the_hospitals_desc:0 "The health of the people is like the health of the nation, and if we cannot take care of our own then what does this say about the integrity of our country? From here on, medical care will be free of charge, high quality, and modernized to the highest standards available!"
FEA_welfare_chauvinism:0 "Welfare Chauvinism"
FEA_welfare_chauvinism_desc:0 "The welfare we're providing our citizens grows in quality and in scope by the day, but it's also been falling into the wrong claws. The only people who should benefit from welfare are those that benefit or serve the state, not outsiders or parasites."
FEA_the_new_knighthood:0 "The New Knighthood"
FEA_the_new_knighthood_desc:0 "Knights should not be constrained to an elite griffon clad in armor with a rifle, but be free to pursue even more specialized fields. The new definition of knighthood must be expanded to include tank crews, soldiers in a motorized unit, and even ponies should they possess the muster and pass the requisite training!"
FEA_broadened_conscription:0 "Broadened Conscription"
FEA_broadened_conscription_desc:0 "We don't have the numbers necessary to face down all threats and win, and the longer we don't address this glaring issue the sooner that calamity will strike! To this end, we must get every able-bodied citizen into uniform to meet any foe without fear!"
FEA_rolling_thunder:0 "Rolling Thunder"
FEA_rolling_thunder_desc:0 "The most crucial battles of the civil war were won through the use of artillery, and it's certain that our next victory will depend on it too. However, if we are to gain a decisive edge in using these cannons, we must look into enchanting the barrels and their shells so that they may fall upon the enemy like a thunderbolt!"
FEA_full_magic_jackets:0 "Full Magic Jackets"
FEA_full_magic_jackets_desc:0 "A breakthrough has come from a firing range in Klauwermack almost by accident. A cadet from the countryside had idle time around her base and decided to fill her time by enchanting the bullets in her rifle, causing them to completely obliterate her targets. It might be hard to replicate her work to scale, but doing so would dramatically bolster our arsenal."
FEA_forge_the_spearhead:0 "Forge The Spearhead"
FEA_forge_the_spearheads_desc:0 "The security of the Empire cannot only rely upon soldiers with rifles and cannons, however trained they may be. Indeed, the future of combat and the safety of the people depend upon something greater: The armored tank."
FEA_pichtsbesef:0 "Plichtsbesef"
FEA_pichtsbesef_desc:0 "Signing up to fight in the military isn't just a simple contract, a series of training exercises, or even benefits during and after service ends. It is an unwavering oath to fight for the defense of the Empire, for the safety of its inhabitants, and to rise beyond the call of duty!"
FEA_mage_integration:0 "Mage Integration"
FEA_mage_integration_desc:0 "While we didn't expect many ponies to join up and fight in a largely griffon army, we've been very pleasantly surprised. Even more so, some of the unicorns among the ranks have proposed the idea of a support company utilizing their magic for combat and medical purposes!"
FEA_monopoly_on_violence:0 "Monopoly On Violence"
FEA_monopoly_on_violence_desc:0 "Violence can be horrifying and brutal tool to crush the people, but violence is also an invaluable tool to keep order and protect the innocent.

However, unlike military demobilization which can be done relatively quickly, economic demobilization will take far more time and require far more care, but it must be done to fully erase tyranny from the Empire."
FEA_remove_strings_on_welfare:0 "Remove Strings On Welfare"
FEA_remove_strings_on_welfare_desc:0 "Welfare should be for everyone who needs it, not a narrow classification of people.

FEA_stamp_out_wingbardy:0 "Stamp Out Wingbardy"
FEA_stamp_out_wingbardy_desc:0 "Decades ago, Wingbardy had seceeded from the Empire and took several vassals along that rightfully belonged under the Empire. This secession was so destructive to the Empire's economy, that it accelerated the Empire's decline and arguably led to the death of the Grover lienage. Today, we take back the jewel in the crown!"

FEA_artiestenvergoeding:0 "Artiestenvergoeding"
FEA_artiestenvergoeding_desc:0 "Of the worst things the Empire was deprived of during the harsher martial law days was art and entertainment, as workers of these industries were commanded to work in a more practical field for years.

FEA_nationalize_housing_desc:0 "No one should ever be homeless, especially when they have a family and especially when they have a job, and we cannot stand idly by and let the parasitic landlords profit off of a vital need of the people.

feathasia.13.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feathasia.13.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbours, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessgriffs and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whom he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More worryingly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendedam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

feathasia.14.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfried Hereen. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organisation, and considers them to be the safeguards of Feathisian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Do' novel. "

feathasia.18.t:0 "If It Bleeds..."
feathasia.18.d:0 "Gerlach loved public appearances. Stage fright was an imaginary concept to a Griffon whose version of heaven seemed to be in front of the cameras. Initially there to gain the perspective of yet another group of his people, he soon found himself atop an impromptu stage hastily arranged in anticipation of his arrival by the dockyard workers. A routine stop soon turned into an hour-long rally in one of the hardest hit cities of the Economic crisis, its residents eager to hear the words of their Duke.\n\nAscending the steps of the stage in front of hundreds, Gerlach IV came to a stop right before the podium. He spoke under his breath. “...Thanks for coming here with me."\n\nAt his side, his fellow Noble, and best friend, Gabriela Eagleclaw. “I did have to rearrange some things, clear out a schedule or three.." She shrugged. “But support is built everywhere in the Empire. Not just in those places we find convenient. Even if it’s a bit..." She kept up her smile. “...Rustic."\n\nAn understatement, to be sure. As some Griffons and ponies of the urban center crammed to hear their Duke, Gabriela watched as Gerlach began to speak. Despite towering on the stage, his inflections and words spoke to the hard-hit creatures on their level. As if crafting a story, he weaved together the crowd’s hardships, their fears, and their common identity, bringing into their eyes a sense of hope. Gabriela couldn’t help but be impressed. \n\nShots.\n\nTwo, three, Gabriela Eagleclaw stopped counting as Gerlach collapsed onto the stage and panic rushed through the crowd. Adrenaline rushed in the Duchess’ veins as she wrapped her wings around him, and Feathisian Soldiers surrounded them both. The crowd shifted with panic heads turning to find the shooter until soldiers of the Feathisian army returned fire and ended the threat.\n\nOut of the huddle, Gerlach IV rose to his claws and brought up a wing in triumph, to the cheers of the unbroken crowd.\n\nGabriela’s worried eyes met Gerlach’s. “...Are you alright?"\n\nBlood dripped from the side of his head. “Hospital. Please."

The citizens of Feathisia had barely begun to move on in a world where some regent may well control the Empire in the name of young Grover VI. All that changed when the news of the brute murder of the Child Emperor by parts of the Imperial military rippled through the Grand Duchy. There was no Grover left and Gabriela Eagleclaw was now technically the next in line to the throne. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, a dictator, had usurped the Empire.\n\nIn the evening candlelight wakes were held in every city and town in honour of Grover VI. Many cried, many others vowed that this could not go unpunished. Some still prayed for peace.\n\nThe next day, political scheming continued in earnest, there was no time for mourning with a power-hungry general at the gates. The so called Regency Debate had started since the death of the Sick Emperor, but had now exploded, with no griffon showing any true leadership. While the Grand Duke has locked himself in his Estate, privately grieving the death of his friend's son, the coalition of liberals and monarchists has broken in parliament. Dark times were ahead, and as long Feathisia remained disunited, the country could not stand against Dawnclaw." # RUBY Check if it suits you or you want it changed. Copied from Pre-Rework

Attempts to reason, of dialogue between the members of parliament were only interrupted by the newest arrival of reports of Ferdinand Dawnclaw’s latest actions. But Gerlach didn’t move. He hadn’t since the first report.\n\nIn the corners of his muffled hearing, along the edges of his unfocused vision, Gerlach saw an entire shift in the room like a rogue wave upon the seas. Rising to speak from the far corner of the parliamentary benches, Rozenkamp laid both his claw and his hateful words bare for all around him.\n\n"In playing with delusions of so-called equine morality, this great country has been reduced to a sham." His eyes were fiercely locked upon Gerlach, his accusatory words causing some even seated next to him to create distance. "We sold out our honor to the equine, and plunged the country into freefall because of it, and you have done everything to aid this."\n\nGerlach’s eyes emerged from their trance, now locking upon Rozenkamp. No emotion was worn upon his face, at least any that could be ascertained by the representatives of the room.  The Duke leaned up out of his chair at the head of the Parliament and reached across his body under his wing.\n\nRozenkamp showed no attention to the Duke’s movements. "Even now amongst our own parliament,"" He paused to gesture around himself, pointing towards some ponies in the room, who uttered words of defiance under their breaths. "The powers of republicanism and international cliques have produced the final blow to this husk of an Empire, and he sits in living flesh in Griffenheim ready to devour us all. Is it any surprise this happened when you've done everything to court it? Moreover, his tools hide amongst-"\n\nA bullet cut off his speech, then two, then three. Gerlach closed the distance between himself and Rozenkamp swiftly, emptying his pistol into his corpse on the floor of the Parliament. Silence gripped the room, terror upon all of their faces.

Above every mill, workshop, factory, and dockyard hung a tension in the air like thick smog, choking out the words of their workers and steeling them for the task ahead, until a voice came through the radios of the nation and shook them from their battle trance.\n\n"Beloved workers of Feathisia," The tinny voice of Duke Gerlach IV clawed its way through the static on every frequency, "For the past year, I have worked tirelessly to remedy the ills of freefall, and it was because of your help that we managed to avoid hitting the bottom. But I fear that if nothing is done about the planned general strike, we will sink to a level even worse than the bedrock of freefall and into servitude. I ask for you to lend me your ears."\n\nProduction halted as millions of anxious laborers turned their eyes up to listen. "I'm not blind to the animosity or fear reserved for me or to the dreadful conditions martial law has placed you in, but I would hazard against an outcry. Were there no maniac in Griffenheim, my actions would have no justification, and you would have every right to overthrow me. But it is precisely because there is a madgriff not far from our borders intent on destroying us that harshness is required."\n\nThe Duke cleared his throat and continued, "How does a devastating general strike help the situation? When we need to be at our strongest to face down our greatest foe, the unions would have us weakened. When we most need labor for our defense, the unions would leave us defenseless. When you are in dire need of better conditions and pay, the union declares that only by causing mayhem will they retrieve them for you. Let me tell you now, they are wrong. The only thing they can give you is bondage, while I can grant your every demand immediately without the anarchy. However, I cannot leave you vulnerable and I refuse to offer up the country in chains."\n\nHis voice choked, failing to hold back the tide of his emotions. "Unity is demanded of everyone in Feathisia's darkest hour, and for this reason, all unions are hereby forbidden to strike, and any attempt to do so will be met with harsh reprisal. It is through your labor, beloved workers of Feathisia, that we can defeat the madgriff! Thank you.""

Its only counter were the meager number of police who still pledged their loyalty to their Duke, standing guard at the entryways to certain streets to direct the flow of dissidents and keep them peaceful.\n\nAmong the chants, which came from across the political spectrum, were cries for a return to democracy, for an end to tyranny, and for bread and work. However, the more radical voices in the crowd eventually took command with calls for Duke Gerlach to abdicate the throne entirely and face justice for his crimes. However, this too was hijacked in the frenzy quickly overtaking the demonstrations.\n\nProtestors began slamming into the walls of police, who held their own against the tide, enduring the threats against their life and standing as a bulwark of order. Soon, the innocent and peaceful calls for democracy mutated into violent cries for Duke Gerlach's head.\n\nBefore long, a boom followed by a shrill, piercing, bloodcurdling scream shattered the sound of the demonstrators. As everyone fell silent, a griffon, barely over the age of twenty, lay trembling on the cold bricks of the street, clutching her wounds and sobbing quietly.\n\nThen everything came undone. In just an instant, the protest became a riot, and the wall of noise descended upon the officers like a tidal wave onto a small ship. In the resulting melee, over three dozen protestors lay dead in the streets, though most of both parties fled once the gunshots started ringing out.\n\nDuke Gerlach had since banned public protest to prevent such a riot from ever taking place again, while also making sure to compensate the families of those involved to set things right."

feathasia_iron.4.d:0 "In a small back room, tucked away in the parts of the De Vleugals train station that the overhead lights don't touch, history was being made. Duke Gerlach IV sat with his back to the wall across from the beast in black known as Heeren, both griffs flanked on either side by antsy soldiers. Talking to the paramilitary leader was like trying to disarm a bomb with words. Convincing him wasn't the hard part, as he'd take any chance to bolster his ranks. Rather, it was containing his collateral damage.\n\nThe dim light above flickered as the two adversaries stared into each other eyes with glares that twisted like knives. "Let's get one thing straight," Gerlach was the first to speak, reaching into his coat pocket and producing a pipe, which he held in his mouth without lighting it, "Were the circumstances any different, I would have your head, but as it happens, we need one another. Feathisia is in an uproar, and what little ability I have to contain it is dwindling. I need you to cut a path to law and order."\n\nHeeren drew a breath in and nodded slowly, refusing even to blink from the moment he sat down, "The feeling is mutual." His voice was low and coarse like gravel, and his eyes were fiercer than a thousand hawks, but Gerlach faced down the monster without flinching.\n\n"Make no mistake, I'm not giving you free reign. You are to enforce my laws, you are to disappear my enemies, and you are to follow my command. The state's purse is open to you for as many griffs and as much equipment as you need, but the instant you deviate from my word, or begin purging your personal enemies, the Bronze Sentinels and their leader, will cease to exist."\n\nWere the ferocity of Heeren's gaze any more intense, he would've turned Gerlach into stone. "We're on the same page, Gerlach, but you're naive if you think I'll leave my back open to be stabbed. I'll take your money and do your dirty work, but you have to promise me something in return."\n\n"And that is?" The Duke raised an eyebrow."

Opposed to the usual crowd-violence typical of the political extremists, Heeren’s thugs moved through the Duchy as a surgeon’s scalpel moved through flesh, carving small pieces of communities out, whether they be sole buildings or people.\n\nOne group of Bronze Sentinels had pursued their mission far beyond their instructions, and had looted a group of businesses and homes operated by ponies. Before the sun rose, Gerlach IV made sure their names were crossed off the lists as well.\n\nThere was no use in keeping it quiet, and Gerlach made no effort to do so. Using the muscle of the most militant wing of the FNV, the Duke had allied himself with the strongest head of the hydra and was using it to rip the throats of the others. Dragged into a transport truck by his own soldiers, General Vorst Tot Vorst and other officers suspected of posing a threat to the Duke found themselves in nooses on the streets of De Vleugels.\n\nIn the capital city of Feathisia, gallows were constructed in plain view of the various city centers. In no particular order, criminals, less-known politicians hostile to the Duke’s rule, uncooperative industry heads, and a minority of the Officer Corps had their names crossed off the Duke’s lists.\n\nGerlach watched each and every one of them hang. Not a mass killing, or murder on a grand scale, he didn’t watch more than a couple hundred necks snap by sunrise. Precise, methodical, every execution removing a roadblock on his path."

The loss of Grover VI had previously made her an emotional husk, as she tried to bury it all inside. The horrible news from Feathisia had brought it all out again. "It’s a lie! He would never do that!"\n\nRegina Eagleclaw battled both her frustration and her empathy, powerless to help Gabriela. "He has. The news is coming from everywhere, and we can’t ignore it anymore! He’s turning his entire Duchy upside down, and with the amount of Griffons he’s having killed and institutions he’s burning, we are all in serious danger!"\n\n"Gerlach’s entire life, he has been—"\n\nRegina had to practically shove the papers into Gabriela’s claws, because as strong and intelligent as the Duchess was, there was no other way to get her to read them. "The parliament. The parties. He shot an MP personally, and who knows how many more he’s already had killed outside of his vision! He’s made no attempt to hide it, and all of Feathisia is praising him for it!"\n\nGabriela’s eyes couldn’t resist glancing down to the newspapers, telegrams, and pictures in her claws. "I-It... It can't... He’d never do this." She fought tears as she looked back up to her. "Cousin, we— He and I—"\n\nRegina’s own eyes began to water, unable to find any real way to console her friend. "He’s not the same Griffon, cousin. Nothing's going to stand between him and his war now.

The streetlights all flickered on in response to the oncoming dark clouds that rolled in, but otherwise, the city did not stir. The citizens that once rushed forth to meet their Duke whenever he was in public hid behind their curtains and locked doors as though he were a storybook villain.\n\nThis did not phase him when in fact he'd done everything to earn this reputation. He would suffer the people's fear so long as they were safe. Then, just as the half dozen armored vehicles made their stop around the fountain before Gerlach's estate, the situation flipped on its head. Hundreds of griffons descended upon the trucks and surrounded it entirely. Some were armed with rifles, others with pitchforks, and some with only the fury burning in their hearts. The soldiers of the convoy met them back with their own machine guns and magic rifles, and the city was silent once more.\n\nA cry came from somewhere in the crowd, which worked its way to the front in the form of a frenzied chant. "Bring us the Duke! Bring us the Duke!" There was no question in his mind what they wanted to do, nor any doubt that he could suppress this band of would-be insurrectionists right where they stood. However, there was also a chance that his beloved people could see reason as they always had, and so with a deep breath in, Gerlach flipped the hatch on the roof of the military truck he was in and came face to face with the mob.\n\n"My beloved subjects, I implore you to listen to what I have to say with an open mind to the very end." The crowd was hushed, staring out with rage and apprehension, as though they were expending the very last amount of loyalty they had for the Duke by letting him speak. "If by then you are not convinced and you do not find me in the right, I grant you every permission to fire upon me at will. I'll even step out among you and make it easy."\n\nHundreds among them turned and looked to one another, the thick tension in the air diffusing by the instant, then they all turned back to him in silence once more.

Duke Gerlach felt an anger within him bubble deep from his heart up to his throat and out his mouth as he spoke. "When I looked to our failing parliament, our economy that was on the brink of ruin, and an Empire that has done nothing but crumble and wither apart since I was young, I knew it was not up to the task of doing what needed to be done."\n\nPlacing his claws on the rim of the hatch, Gerlach leaned forward, letting the hate brewing within him for months finally take form as words. "Perhaps our ineffectual democracy could've been reformed, perhaps our shattered economy could mend itself quickly enough to put up a fight, but even if there was a chance that it could, it would do so far too late. For every moment we wasted in reform or reconstruction, we could've been arming ourselves for the struggle ahead. For every instant of claw-wringing and pearl-clutching we have done for so-called 'democracy', an instant that could've been used to prepare against our real enemy has been wasted!"\n\nNow the Duke climbed out from the hatch and stood tall atop the armored vehicle, gesturing wildly at the crowd, who looked back at him with fury and vengeance in their eyes that was quickly turning away from him and towards another enemy. "If there was another way that I could've prepared our country for the fight, I would have done it that way, but because my beloved subjects, there was no other way I did what needed to be done! I had to become the harsh tyrant and the brutal murderer, not because I wanted to, but because I had to! And for this I am sorry."\n\nThe eyes of the crowd were so angry that they were practically on fire as they stared at Gerlach walking down the top of the truck onto its hood before raising his claws to the sky. "If there is any griffon who believes their Duke is wrong, that he has not looked out for them or done everything in his power to keep them safe, let them fire upon me!"\n\nOnce again, the city did not stir. The mob one by one lifted their weapons to the sky, and just as before, a cry from the back rippled through the entire crowd, and later through the entire country like a stone in water."

Serving as a magnet for all of the world’s ills, the people of Feathisia and scattered throughout the Herzland had begun to place their faith and labor in the only Griffon who could stop him.\n\nGerlach IV was revered as the manifestation of the people’s rage, the titan of what little hope was left for the Empire. Perhaps too late to save the Empire, but still with enough time to avenge it. The Duke’s armies swelled with resources and volunteers from across the land, with every avenue of life personally invested in the coming war against Dawnclaw. Citizens in every province trained in groups of spontaneous militias, each of them positively sure that they would not squander the opportunity if they were lucky enough to have their own claws around Ferdinand’s neck.\n\nThe fires of rage in their minds swelled with the gasoline of despair in their hearts, with the melancholic look and slight tinge of despair in the words of their Duke in his radio addresses in public appearances, serving as the closest reminder to the once-living child-Emperor.

But even in the cold echoes of what once used to be his hopeful heart, the reminders of what he used to be made their appearance in all new twisted form, turning his eyes away from Dawnclaw on the floor and down the steps.\n\nThe city was wounded, gunfire still echoing.

Though no concrete military threat had been laid against the Strawberry Duchy, she hurried from Readewetter to every corner of the countryside, from villages large and small, to schools, to farms, and to castles. She had visited military installations, outposts and checkpoints, as her and her staff constructed plans and protocols to resist imminent invasion. Though it was never written down or spoken aloud, all preparations dealt with an invasion from Feathisia.\n\nVitalius Moonbill was always an odd griffon out from the rest of the crowd, and it made no difference to him now.

He stopped, resting his gaze on the flowing Griffking river that cut the city in three. "A significant portion?" He asked.\n\n"Much of the fighting occurred in the Industrial district. Dawnclaw’s forces were based out of there, and the surrounding residences were all practically destroyed. Some ten thousand citizens are without shelter."\n\nGerlach raised his claw to point across the river. "I’m looking at intact shopping centers across the bridge."\n\nGeneral Best nodded.

Another Griffon, Silverquill said. "The hospitals have all the injured under control. Your care is just as important as any other." He leaned in.

Like most young chicks in the Herzland, many dream to be a knight, or a policegriff, or whatever their parents were, Cap had wanted to be a knight more than anything. She dragged her parents to parades where they would march, made a habit of finding sticks that most resembled a sword, and fashioning armor out of cardboard or pots from the cupboard.\n\nHowever, Cap never grew out of this desire, unlike most chicks, instead she placed a full focus on it, and once she reached the age, joined up in the Duke's army. Her parents had begged her not to, and it was hard to leave them behind, but the siren call of that little filly in her proved louder and more convincing.\n\nDuke Gerlach had given her more than a chance to be a knight, he'd given Hard Cap the dream she'd been working for her whole life, a purpose and a flag to lay down her life for, and the sword to carry out the justice the nation demanded.

But that was flat out impossible, he was one of the last griffs out during the siege of the Imperial Palace, there was no way they'd deny him care!\n\n"Next!" The voice of a rather bored looking mare called from ahead, causing the walls of the clinic began to close around him, and the counter ahead of him seemed to get further and further away. "Uh, sir? Hello? You're next."\n\nThe words snapped him from his trance, but did nothing to calm his racing heart as he stepped forward, struggling to find his voice. "Th-there must be some mistake, ma'am. This letter here says I owe money to the state, but there must be a misunderstanding or a misfiling or something." Ludwig shakily pressed the letter down on the counter and tapped his claw against it several times.\n\nThe mare slid the paper down to her level and pushed up her glasses, her eyes darting to the most relevant places of the document, a practiced motion she'd done thousands of times. "Nope, no misunderstanding. It says here that you're workshy, and the workshy are entitled to nothing but more work."\n\n"But I'm a veteran! I was there in Griffenheim! I had to get that surgery because my injuries I got from that battle! Surely there must be something you can do." Ludwig didn't care about the stares he was getting from others in the lobby, or from nurses down the halls from the counter.\n\nThe mare let out a sigh and pressed a red button on her desk. "Work more hours and we can see about a retroactive covering of these costs.""

A little over a year now he'd been in prison for striking, and since then the state had put him to work laying telegraph wires and power lines.\n\nLindert opened his lunchbox and almost immediately began shoveling the food into his beak, admiring how the taste of pork and cheese always tasted better after a day's work, and better still knowing that his family was provided for. For as grueling as prison labor was some days, most were like any other day on the job, which was still difficult, but far better and fairer than he expected. As Lindert chewed his food slower now that he'd all but inhaled half of the meal, he looked out to the giant wooden posts he was fixing wires to and couldn't help but think of home.\n\nFive children and a wife, all had to depend on his paycheck, which was smaller under the command economy. Sure, he knew striking would lead to jail, but with less food coming to the table, something had to be done. Initially, he'd figured that his family was doomed to destitution once he was locked up, but much to his surprise, he earned a fair wage for his work, which went back home to that big family of his just like messages on the wires."

Light rain proceeding from the dark storm clouds above proved gentle on the ears, in comparison to the sporadic gunshots of confused resistance weeks prior.\n\nContrary to his usual civilian motorcade, Gerlach’s convoy consisted of military personnel and staff officers. Though the guards of the estate looked on with contempt, his own company carried no weapons apart from the sword which never left his claw. His approach was slow, methodical. Against the advice of all around him, he had ventured alone through the gardens and to the front doors, moving at a snail’s pace.\n\nThe Duke brought up iron walls around his heart and gently pushed open the doors. Curtains fluttered from the cold breeze flowing through the doors, the sound of the outside rain leaking into the dark halls. The guards had all been allowed to stay, but most were relieved of their duties by her. Her offices and rooms lay empty, save for the sound of Gerlach walking through them.\n\nRounding the top of a staircase, Gerlach saw her. The Duchess of Strawberry, Gabriela Eagleclaw, turned her eyes from the window where she’d watched him approach. Before now, there was some inkling of hope within her heart that he would at least look the same, but absent from the Duke’s eyes was the optimism she so loved to indulge in. Missing from Gabriela’s, was the certainty and comfort Gerlach had known her for.\n\nThe two star-crossed rulers that couldn’t recognize the other.\n\n"...How many?" Gabriela’s voice, weak as a newborn chick, asked.\n\n"As little as I could." Gerlach spoke, his voice hollow. "Most surrendered. We avoided battles where we could. No fires. No shelling. No bombings. Those were my rules."\n\nGabriela took a step forward, away from the window. Confined to her estate ever since the surrender, fighting between their citizens had been minimal. It afforded her the peace of mind required to do what she did best. Plan for this."

Gerlach’s bitter voice said, his claw weakly grasping the handle of his sword as a cane which he leaned upon. "Dawnclaw’s armies grew by the day, and I had to get there before he could hurt anyone else! No one was more dangerous than he was, and I stopped him!"\n\n"And where has that gotten us?" Gabriela’s eyes narrowed. She was never one to hold back words from Gerlach. Her frankness had always carried a legitimacy in conversation that he had admired. Before, it had served him as a reality check, but now, it was his greatest opponent. "One ruler with absolute power rests in Griffenheim now, and it makes no difference what his name is! You have become everything you hated!" She tightened her beak in rage. "You killed more than just him."\n\n"And I’d do it again," Gerlach said, leering back at the Duchess. "Every death was a victory. Rozenkamp. Voorst. Dawnclaw. I was a fool to think that anything—" His eyes became unfocused. Perhaps in rage. Perhaps in a loss of sanity. Perhaps in grief. "Anything in this world can be achieved without blood. My citizens are fed. My people are safe." He looked up at her, and Gabriela swore she saw just a glint of the Gerlach she knew in his eyes.\n\n"....It wasn’t your fault, Gerlach."\n\nConfusion washed over the Duke, as though the words were cold water dumped on him, "W-What?" He spoke with all the bravery of a wounded animal caught in a trap.\n\nThe Duchess’ eyes became pearly with tears as she took a deep breath to say it again. "It wasn’t your fault. You can’t save Grover because he’s already gone and it wasn't your fault that he was..." Her words faltered as she took a step toward him.

The grip around his sword loosened. "I’m not sure who I am anymore, or if I can ever be who I was again."\n\nShe brought her claw to grasp his, pulling his attention up to her as she closed the little distance between them. "You still protected them..." She nodded, glancing from one of his eyes to the other. "You protected the Empire."\n\nRealization and horror of his own actions threatened Gerlach with collapse. "I...I can’t justify what I’ve done."\n\nThe Duke braced himself for the fall down to the wooden floors as he felt his body go limp, but Gabriela caught him and brought him down gently into her lap. He was hyperventilating, as visions of burned cities, hanging corpses, and crossed-off lists appeared in his mind. He couldn’t tell which was Dawnclaw, and which was himself. Did he truly ever restrict himself? Sure, there were only dozens on his lists. But lives were not numbers, no matter who they were. The fear that he'd eventually write more slithered from the back of his thoughts to the forefront of his mind.\n\n"It’s okay." Gabriela cooed, "It’s over now." The Duke became undone in her grasp only for Gabriela’s claws to grip him tighter. "You're still you... Despite all you've done, you’re still you. We’re safe," She gently ran her claw through his feathers. "And I love you."\n\nHis people were safe, Gerlach knew that. He only targeted those who harmed others, he made sure of it. The Sentinels were controlled, he was sure. But his people, his democracy, his Empire...when they looked at Dawnclaw, and they looked at him, could they tell the difference? Could he? Could she?

"I won’t let you do this." She took one step forward. "I loved you Gerlach... but you are not the Griffon you were. All I have are my subjects and I refuse to let you take them from me!"\n\nThe griffon he was whispered to him from the back of his mind, the one that believed in his people and saw hope for the future, and the one that loved her back. That he could still come back from everything. Duke Gerlach swallowed his hesitation, he had nothing to say to cowards. He brought up his sword and swung it down.\n\nSharp hisses of cutting steel tore through Gabriela’s estate, as the Duchess launched herself at the Duke like a ferocious animal, seeking to overwhelm him before either could linger in grief. But the tide of the fight was turning, Gerlach’s sword nearly cutting her throat as it swung and crashed into the lamps on the wall, fire now racing up the silk curtains and spreading to the roof above their heads.\n\nFlames torched the rooms, casting their orange glow on the tearful eyes of Gerlach and Gabriela. "You lied to me, Gerlach..." Gabriela choked out. "...I loved you!"\n\nShe was standing in his way, couldn’t she see that!? Everything he did, it was all for them! It was all for her!\n\nHis sword cut too close. Hers fell. She grasped at the gash in her chest as Gerlach broke out of his frenzy and rushed to her side, the estate burning down around them.

Like cauterizing a wound, catharsis was only going to be purchased with burning pain.\n\nThe deplorable actions of the Duke’s government, now highlighted in every newspaper and broadcast this side of the continent and rapidly spreading beyond Griffonia, were the least of his problems. Of his own accord, Gerlach IV had read in the newspapers about the single largest gathering of accusatory journalists, dismissed parliamentarians, union leaders and general opponents of the Duke to discuss the sudden rush of information about the scale of the Iron Duke’s terror. As Gabriela looked around herself in the vast converted warehouse, it was an assembly of all the Griffons and Ponies who would want him dead. Naturally, her husband walked right through the front door.\n\nIn the center of the warehouse, in the lights of cameras and broadcasting film, Gerlach IV entered the fiercest debate of his life. Not only was he before his opponents, but the entire world who watched through film and journalists’ writings. This was no time for caution.\n\n"How can any creature live in these conditions you have provided?" One Griffon, who Gabriela was sure to be a Republican revolutionary, dominated the crowd with his voice. "Living in fear of their ruler who, at any whim and moment, rule entirely against the will of his people?"\n\nGerlach IV stood in the center of the room, calm. "No resistance was ever faced by me in my actions. Little was hidden, though to be true little was told. But one cannot claim ignorance to what was going on, or the necessity of it you all agreed to."\n\n"You shot an elected member of parliament!"\n\n"I will apologize for a great many things. Murdering Herman Rozenkamp is not one of them. I will make no excuses for something I would do again today."\n\nAnother voice. "Your aim was against the most vicious of reactionaries..." That was Bernhardt Stappenbeld, and he seemed to have a lot of the crowd on his side. "But your alliance with the Bronze Sentinels forced workers into fear and hiding!"\n\n"It forced unions into hiding," Gerlach said, with a sigh. "It was still wrong. However, the Bronze Sentinels were brought under state control to combat the forces of lawlessness. They were in check by our armed forces, and eventually liquidated as they should be. The actions I committed were trades for time and power to eliminate Dawnclaw. I bring myself before you as a prodigy, to explain myself and seek your forgiveness. What I did was... horrible."

Would they accept him? Would they want nothing to do with him? What if they—\n\n"Lindert!?" The voice of his wife, Rose, brought him back to the present, and looking into those emerald eyes again made every ounce of struggle in prison worth it. Just as quickly as she laid eyes on him, her eyes were welling with tears before finally snatching him up in a tight hug. Lindert stood motionless for a moment, unsure if this was just a dream, but the calm smell of lavender in her hair was enough to prove that it was real, and he returned the embrace. "I'm so happy you're back! They didn't treat you too bad, did they? Oh! Kids! Your father's home!"\n\n"They—" Lindert could barely get his answer out before five chicks rushed out from the doorway and spilled out onto the porch before promptly tackling their father to the ground in a coordinated hug. All of them were a lot bigger than he remembered, and they each asked him enough of their own questions to make his head spin. "I missed you guys too, I'm sorry I had to be away for so long."\n\n"You stood up for the right thing, Dad!" His youngest, a sporty young griff with dirt perpetually on his face no matter how many times you scrubbed it off, held his head high as he spoke, "That's what Mom said!"\n\nA chant of 'yeah!' and 'that's right!' came shortly after, which brought a chuckle from both Lindert and Rose, the latter of whom was pulling her beloved from the swarm of children. "I think you owe us some stories," She said with a wink. \n\n"You're not mad at me?" Lindert stopped the walk back inside and cocked his head.\n\n"Well, at first I was furious."

The Imperial Government didn't send letters to just anyone, and if they did, the matter would have to be of high importance. Holding the letters in his beak for a brief enough moment to open the front door to his quaint one-story house, Conrad went straight for the couch to the immidiate right of the door and plopped down, setting the groceries and every letter but one down on the coffee table before him. "Hey honey, you might wanna come here for a minute." He called to somewhere in the home.\n\n"What is it, dear?"

Tonight, these words would become historical fact.\n\nThe insidious group led by the even more insidious Godfreid Heeren had outposts all across the Herzland, but most were located in central Griffenheim and deployed as needed. Usually, this would make the task of crippling or arresting their leadership difficult as it'd require a nationwide coordinated effort to strike all at once, but their headquarters in the capital decided to hold an uncharacteristic banquet. In other words, all the eggs were in one basket for the taking.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had discussed issuing a declaration to simply dissolve the group and rescind their authority, but almost instantly, they both realized Heeren wouldn't take it sitting down and would likely respond with hostility. So instead of going through a costly and destructive skirmish with the Bronze Sentinels, they decided to use the banquet to behead the snake.\n\nNearly a hundred soldiers followed their Duke into the Sentinel's headquarters, arrested the guards at the door, and any on their way to the hall as they entered. Shockingly, most accepted their fate, likely thinking that their dear leader would avenge the injustice. Then the strike force cam to the large set of double red doors that the feast was being held in, laughter could be heard coming from within as the troops got into position.\n\nThen all at once, Gerlach kicked the doors in and the hundred soldiers with him rushed in and fixed guns on everyone in attendance around a long black table. The response was immediate as every Sentinel, including Heeren himself, drew their firearms right back. "I wouldn't if I were you. There's one hundred guns trains on you and many more waiting outside." Gerlach's voice was laced deeply with venom as he strolled into the chamber, like he'd been waiting to say these words for years. He stared into those hawkish eyes of Godfreid and smiled, feeling his old self return for just a moment. "The Imperial Government no longer recognizes the Bronze Sentinels as their secret police, but instead as a terrorist organization. You are all under arrest."\n\nOne by one, the Sentinel leadership surrendered, and the look on Heeren's face when the cuffs went around his claws was worth every Idol in the Empire.

The aging griff looked around, nothing stirred under that bright sunny sky but him observing it. Finally, gulping down his anxiety, the Duke could feel the wheels of history turn just as he had when he spoke to the people from atop a military vehicle years ago.\n\n"Until very recently, many of you would've called me the Iron Duke, and some of you still think that way of me, but today I come to you seeking to reform the armed forces the same way that I was reformed not long ago."

To the slightly grumpy Gerlach, it meant having to share a bit of the spotlight he'd grown so used to.\n\nThen the short tune playing petered out, and that was the Duke's cue to start, which he did after quickly clearing his throat. "My beloved subjects, for the past few years your way of life has been kept in the grip of an iron claw, which has only recently released you and thrown away the gauntlet. Parliament is back and martial law has been lifted."\n\nHe glanced over to the griffon across from him, who picked up the verbal baton without missing a beat.

The hours you had to work were not sustainable, the conditions you had to live under were not acceptable, and the uncertainty thrust upon your families was not permissible."\n\nThe mare next to Gabriela spoke in a thick Buckmour accent, "To remedy the ills that the command economy has caused, it is not enough to simply lift it, the same way that healing a stab wound is not to pull out the knife. The wound must be tended to, the blood must stop flowing, and it must be sewn shut completely."\n\nNow it was Gabriela's turn, who began before pausing after hearing her own voice, only to then resume. Gerlach couldn't help but admire her as she spoke, "In other words, instead of passing token, piecemeal reforms that don't go far enough and are always under threat to be reversed, a bill has been passed which is built right into the new constitution. This will guarantee everyone with inalienable economic rights that will entitle everyone to..." Everyone in the booth took a breath in and spoke at the same time with a rehearsed cadence."

It was all almost too much to bear.\n\nBut seeing the love of his life's eyes lock onto his in desperate fury, fighting for the very same things he was, only to fall by his own claws was too much to bear. Now there was nothing left and nothing that could be done, and the once small part of Gerlach that blamed himself had grown into an all-encompassing, all-controlling behemoth. The punishment for these crimes was to be carried out by laying in bed until death by hunger or a broken heart, whichever decided to take him first.\n\nThe words of his departed love, Gabriela, pounded through his head like a vengeful spirit, pouring salt and alcohol into the wounds he caused. Tyrant. Murderer. Liar. Each one hit their mark with perfect accuracy. He'd won over Dawnclaw and restored peace to the Herzland, but it cost everything he ever wanted to protect.\n\nTears flowed down from his eyes onto the sheets like blood from the open wound of his heart as he stared into the same ceiling he had for the last six days, waiting for death to take him. Then came a knock on the door, a worker in the palace that dropped meals off by the door only to pick them up cold and untouched hours later. Each wrap of knuckles against the wood shook thoughts loose from his head like apples from a tree, until one knocked square against his temple.\n\nWhat emerged was the realization that not all was gone. Nearly everything was, but beneath all the mountains of loss and grief and pain were the people. The people he had sworn to protect, the ones he had fought so valiantly for against all odds. In those knocks against the door, the Duke's purpose came flowing back to him.\n\nThere was indeed nothing left at all, but there was much to be done.

While this was essential to securing peace in the region, critique could no longer be done without.\n\nTo this end, the even-clawed Duke Gerlach ordered the construction of public forums in every town and city, no matter how small or hostile to his rule, to replenish the supply of criticism and utilize it for the better of the Empire. In a speech over the radio, the Duke declared, 'A tyrant rules with a deaf ear to his people, but a ruler reigns only hearing the words of his citizens.'\n\nThe words still tasted sweet on Gustaaf's tongue, once a mayor of the city of Katerinburg, now the head of its public forum, as he seated himself in the large chair that presided over the great hall. Next to him, in an equally large chair, sat a bright blue griffon before a typewriter. Outward, rows of curved benches, all facing towards the tall podium where Gustaaf sat, each filled with griffons, ponies, and all other manners of citizens from the Empire looking back at him.\n\n"Now," The aging griffon announced, clanging a gavel against the podium's dark surface, "One at a time, please come up and state your issue, and my lovely assistant next to me will catalog them, and send them straight to Griffenheim. Who's first?"\n\nWithout missing a beat, as though he were waiting for his moment, a gray griff with long black hair flew to the stand in between the podiums and benches, "What I demand is an end to the rationing program! We have Greifenmarschen to grow us all we could eat, so why must we starve ourselves?" A chorus of agreement came from behind him.\n\nTaking his seat, a red pegasus slowly walked to the stand, "I, uhm, I'd like it if we could get rid of curfews. Thank you!" She practically squeaked before returning to her seat with applause. More of the same repeated throughout the day, with Gustaaf and his assistant meeting it all with a smile. It was strange to hear nothing but negative things all day and feel happy about it. But it was the voice of the people."

feathasia_iron.30.t:0 "A Rowdy Welcome Party"
feathasia_iron.30.d:0 ""H-hello everyone," Aart ter Elst, a pale and scrawny griff with glasses nearly as thick as his accent, stammered before a mass of nearly five dozen sturdy and grizzled griffons who made up just one of the many dockyards in western Feathisia, as though he were looking into a mirror that showed the exact opposite image of him. His voice echoed in the huge, dim warehouse, "I'd like to th-thank you for coming to this m-meeting. Are th-there any concerns you want to tell me?"\n\n"Yeah, I got one!" A griffon nearly three times the size of Aart stood up, "Are you actually gonna help us out? 'Cause we've had a couple griffs come out here and promise to help us, and they didn't do a thing!"\n\n"Yes!" Aart pushed his glasses up, "D-Duke Gerlach has decreed th-that a link between state and worker must be made. Th-the command economy left no room for growth or change, so we're taking any su-suggestions to improve."\n\n"How about some more time off, for starters." The hulking griffon announced, to cheers and hollers from his fellow workers. "I mean, I got two kids at home, and I can't even see them grow up because I work too much!"\n\n"Oh, and how about a few smoke breaks!" Another griffon from the back piped up, eliciting another round of loud agreement. "Can you do that for us?"\n\n"Th-that and more!" Aart smiled, something he thought he wouldn't get to do in their presence. The expectation going in was that they'd rip him apart for the poor state of things, and considering his size, he couldn't put up a fight. "I'll get word to the Duke right away! You sh-should have these benefits by next week."\n\n"Get down here bud!" The large brawny griff who first spoke out motioned for Aart to come down, only for the shrimpy representative to be picked up and tossed into the air, and caught by a forming crowd of strong griffs below."

feathasia_iron.31.t:0 "All Summer In A Day"
feathasia_iron.31.d:0 "The sun was just starting to set over one of the artificial lakes in Allwerder when Gerrit and Flip, two best friends who met just weeks ago in the Juegddivisie summer camp, poked their heads out from under the water and gasped for air.\n\nAfter hours of contests like who could touch the bottom of the lake fastest, which Garrit won, or who could swim from one edge of the lake to the other first, which Flip won, the next contest moved to who could hold their breath underwater the longest. Garrit, an earth pony whose family moved from Rottendedam, was a natural when it came holding his breath, but Flip, a stout griffon from a nearby town, had practically grown up in the water.\n\nThe pair sucked in a huge gulp of air and dived below, and several moments passed of nothing but a few bubbles escaping to the surface, Flip was the first to emerge, followed almost immediately after by Garrit. "I win!" He declared, only to be met with a splash of water by his friend. Retaliation was instant, and the two were now engaged in the next improvised competition of who could outsplash the other.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest which were decided in short order, this one would be cut short with the all-important cry from the docks nearby, "Supper's ready! Come on back now!" The two kids looked at one another, and narrowed their eyes, as though reading the other's thoughts and accepting the challenge. The score for the day was tied. It was now or never as the two broke for the shore, heaving themselves into the water like a fish that escaped a hook.\n\nWhoever reached the shore would be crowned top swimmer, and neither was about to give up the title. Just as the sun met the horizon, Flip touched his claw to the sand and cried out in victory, only to swallow a mouthful of water and cough. Still, his opponent conceded, and slapped a towel around him and then himself, laughing as they started their trek back to base camp."
feathasia_iron.31.a:0 "It was shaping up to be the best summer break ever!"

feathasia_iron.32.t:0 "All In All"
feathasia_iron.32.d:0 "There was a particularly calming effect in watching waves lap against the jagged, algae-covered rocks, and though there were many spots in the Empire that could provide this, Duke Gerlach IV was always partial to the piers of Rottendedam. It was early in the morning, with the sun barely beginning to crest over the horizon, but the Duke had been there for hours even before that.\n\nRottendedam was hosting a grand festival, and the leader of the Empire could hardly earn his title if he weren't present, but the night before the big day, the Duke couldn't sleep. And instead of letting his mind wander beneath the covers, he took a walk to try and clear it instead. The years hadn't been kind to him, developing a cough from his pipe and a limp from the times he foolishly tried to lead from the front.\n\nSparking up the bowl of his pipe and taking a long drag, his thoughts drifted to Rozenkamp, the first casualty of martial law. That one moment of mania which sparked everything. The chaos that ensued, and the order that followed. The wars which came to pass, and the unbridled peace that they brought. The ire and admiration of his people, both of which he more than earned through his deeds.\n\nIt wasn't long before these thoughts sank into guilt. For as much as he'd done for the people, he couldn't ever shake the truth that every deed was done to earn the admiration of someone whom he killed. That everything was simply an attempt to exorcise the ghost of his beloved.\n\nGerlach gripped his pipe tighter, a single tear flowing down from his blind eye, as he finally arrived at the crux of his insomnia. Were she alive today, would Gabriela be proud of him and his actions? That every hard decision he had to make on the road leading to this moment was worth it?\n\nSorrow mixed with certainty in his heart to form a bittersweet cocktail of emotions as the Duke hurled his pipe down into the waters below, hung his head in his claws, and sobbed. As the sun rose over Rottendedam, the answer couldn't be any more clear."

Inflation and political extremism both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PvdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' most radical elements.

### Leader Descriptions ###
FEA_gerlach_desc:0 "Gerlach Weijermars IV occupies a very strange place in politics.\n\Entirely separate from the negative attitudes surrounding Imperial politics, the Duke has instead amassed immense respect from almost every class and political affiliation in the Empire and around the world. After ascending to rule in 990, Gerlach’s bold democratic reforms caused wide scandal amongst Imperial politics but tremendous support from the populace and combined with invaluable support from a coalition of Nobles headed by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, afforded Gerlach the political freedom necessary to form a constitution. Written in collaboration with the new political parties of Feathisia and affirmed my popular referendum, created tremendous buy-in and unity in trying times. Democracy, once shunned for its association with Republican revolution, turned into Feathisia’s greatest strength, a living compromise born out of the struggle between Imperial and Republican loyalties.\n\‘The Silent Duke’, a term of endearment popularized by his subjects in reference to his calm, sometimes melancholic demeanor, is a strong comfort for the citizens of Feathisia and even some across the Empire. For even through trying times of an infant democracy surrounded by war, Gerlach IV always finds a way for his people."
FEA_gerlach_married_desc:0 "A significant amount of prying newspapers, suspicious Nobles, and hopeless romantics, were vindicated with the marriage of Gerlach IV and Gabriela Eagleclaw.\n\As the heirs of their respective houses, Gerlach and Gabriela’s youth was often spent counting down the days until the next royal ball, conference, or gathering afforded them the opportunity to hang out with their best friend, Eachother. For the better part of the last two decades, they served as each other's political muscle, with Gabriela using her many connections and hooks on Nobles to allow Gerlach’s reforms to pass unscathed, and Gerlach utilizing his popular support to call more resources and loyalty to Gabriela’s growing network of power. Though it was only realized consciously recently, it would not be unfair to assume they’ve been falling in love for decades.\n\However, one cannot ignore the significant political utility the marriage has created. The popular support and loyalty the common citizens had for the Duke and Duchess as individuals has developed into an almost parasocial phenomenon, as many firmly attribute the recent and significant improvements to the Duke and Duchess’ actions. With proven track records of serving the people, either directly or indirectly, they are often the subject of praise, of idealization, and for single Griffons and ponies, pure envy."
FEA_gerlach_evil_desc:0 "Born in the year 960 in the Ducal Estate just outside de Vleugels as the eldest son and heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Feathisia, Gerlach has made a name for himself ever since he ascended the throne. A patient and diligent griffon, the Grand Duke immediately started reforming the Grand Duchy, which was, like the rest of the Griffonian Empire, still reeling from the aftermath of the Republican revolution in Griffenheim. Co-leading a committee with Rudolph Thorbeak, the leading liberal politician in Feathisia at the time, they strengthened the constitution and brought stable democracy to Feathisia. Although the Feathisians had to get used to their new rights, it only took a few years for liberty to blossom and all sorts of parties to pop up.\n\nOne of his most controversial moments saw him blocking the liberal democratic party from government until they expelled any republican sentiments. The Grand Duke explained that the Gods crowned the nobility and that the natural order of things had to be preserved, an attitude Gerlach inherited from his father, who helped fight the Republican uprising.\n\nEven though the country was doing fine, Gerlach never stopped working hard, championing the abolishment of public executions, leading industrial change and whenever possible, supporting Emperor Grover. With the emperor dead and the system, he so carefully built on the verge of collapse, an attempt on his life saw the Grand Duke's last faith in the politicians he allowed to rule fade away. The Grand Duke took full control of the country, now that his old friends betrayed him. He would do anything to protect Feathisia and eliminate all griffons who would stop him."
FEA_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down with the advent of the civil war, as more violent and pessimistic forces took over the country. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Personally, the social democrat leader managed to curb the worst excesses of violence against civilians. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it was time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel gave Feathisia a second chance, hoping to rekindle democracy in a socialist light, to heal the wounds caused by the civil war and mend the country's broken society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon would leave the already battered state vulnerable in this uncertain age."
FEA_rozenkamp_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp was born in Mirabelle, the bustling industrial city in the northeast of Feathisia. Along with his brother Reinoud, the two barely scraped by as children of the working poor. Determined to escape the fate of their parents, both of them enlisted into the army as cannoneers under a young lieutenant van Voorst tot Voorst. The officer taught them not only how to shoot a cannon, but how to shoot a cannon and be a patriot while doing it. The death of their father in a workplace accident made the Rozenkamps leave the military, however. Herman had to take care of his mother and took his father's job. There he saw the difference between the noblegriffon's speeches about love for the country and the reality of factory work. Herman would change it all.\n\nThe Rozenkamp brothers joined the local PvdA, where they were initially suspected as former soldiers. Soon enough, their energy and oratory power got noticed by the party leadership and the brothers rose through the ranks. However, instead of boring party congresses and the administrative work which his brother spent more and more time on, Herman went back to the factories and sometimes even to soldiers. There he found fertile ground for his own brand of communism, called Rozenkampism.\n\nWith the economic crisis raging through Feathisia, Rozenkamp riled against everything. The nobility, the Triarchy and the weak politicians (sometimes his own party wasn't even spared). He blamed Griffenheim and Skyfall, Equestria and the Archons. But as the political instability reached the breaking point of civil war, Rozenkamp was ready for battle. When the red banner flew over De Vleugels, it were Rozenkampists who planted it there. And it will be Rozenkamp who will lead Feathisia to glory. For the Fatherland and for the Revolution!"
FEA_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren was born in Rottendedam to a middle-class family of shopkeepers. He was the world to his parents and the bright young griffon had everything his heart desired, but at school it was already he clear Heeren was problematic. He'd sometimes get overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage and woe to the kid that stood in his way if he did. Growing older, the griffon's way with words and his rage grew into an uncanny sort of magnetism and he easily attracted friends whose slavish attitude helped inflate his ego. Of course, like so many a youth before him, young Heeren thought he had politics all figured out. It was very easy. There were two griffons in Feathisia fit to rule the country, the first, Count Gerlach, foolishly gave his power away in pursuit of cheap popularity. The other griffon would be Godfried Heeren himself, naturally.\n\nHeeren joined the Orangecloaks, a paramilitary group training in the middle of the Great Plains. There his political thought evolved further and he found that his charisma served him well as he rose to a leadership position in the radical group. He quickly adopted the group's anti-pony attitudes and sheer hatred for socialism. When the group failed to win any seats in parliament, Heeren merged the group with the FNV party, negotiating his way into the spotlight of Feathisia's political elite. Afterwards, Heeren and the FNV at large profited from the crisis crippling the country, as the jobless proved loyal new voters.\n\nWhen the Regent Debate busted the coalition government, Moldernik, ever the pragmatist, tried to negotiate a coalition with the PvdA, but Heeren already prepared for a war. He aroused so much suspicion amongst his supporters that the deal busted and Feathisia went to war. Now Heeren was in charge of Feathisia. Those who know him best, doubt this would finally soothe his anger and satisfy Heeren's hunger for power."
FEA_edgar_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel led an unassuming but productive life. Born in a small town near to the capital to a family of bureaucrats, it seemed that Edgar would follow his parents' pawsteps. An interest in numbers and a sense of duty led him to the growing ranks of the ministry of finance. Some may find the work soul grinding, but for Edgar the numbers meant something. Every time the economy grew a little more, it meant more happy families and that money saved on military expenses could be used to fund healthcare that could safe somegriffon's life. His intrinsic motivation and his frankly brilliant work on the technical aspects of economics saw him rise as quickly through the ranks as the rigid structure of Feathisian bureaucracy allowed.\n\nWhen the crisis hit and the 1007 budget was to be presented, a true battle took place between the ministries of economic affairs and the ministry of finance. Pechvogel tried to champion a free-market based budget, while the idiots of EA tried to intervene in the market. Either way, the financial crisis exploded into a political crisis and a civil war.\n\nThe war kept going, while what was left of the civilian government tried to guard De Vleugels. And the wheels of bureaucracy kept turning, with most public servants having a sense of loyalty to their department over any of the warring factions. But alarming news came from Griffenheim as the Imperials marched into Feathisia!\n\nA few days later, a group of soldiers, some wearing caps with a red star on them while others wore Feathisian military outfits, barged into what remained of parliament. Edgar Pechvogel was there, delivering some paperwork personally. The soldiers, in surprising harmony, interrogated everygriffon present, leading them straight to Edgar Pechvogel. After hearing of his ability and crosschecking the list of griffons both parties hated, the soldiers decided that Edgar would do. Not much later, the public servant got inaugurated as the head of the National Salvation Committee. As the numbers turned from money to casualties, Edgar's vivid imagination seems more of a burden than a blessing. Still, Pechvogel would set himself to the present task, doing his best, as he had all his life."
FEA_moldernik_desc:0 "Born as the son of a manager in the Aiwle oil business, Anton Moldernik got the best education money could buy, namely a social science degree at Bruma university in Yale. Both his parents were part of the FNV party and Anton would become a member at an early age. Intelligent and ruthless, Moldernik managed to get ahead in the party and to get himself on the candidacy list, securing his election victory in Aiwle. In parliament, he became the party spokesperson on agricultural affairs, a topic the FNV's main competitor, the FHP, was strong in. Nevertheless, Moldernik managed to impress the populace in debates, presenting his monarchist counterparts as spineless conservatives.\n\nAfter about a decade in politics, Moldernik got elevated to the level of party leader, which he would remain until the Regency crisis broke out. With tensions flaring up, Moldernik sought to strike a deal with Kogchel. Much to his dismay, the deal faltered and his comfortable life shattered into a civil war. It took the nationalist some time to adjust to the new situation, but the fascist grew into his role as leader of the now openly authoritarian FNV. Now that the guns are silent and with his power reaffirmed, Anton Moldernik faces the task of redefining Feathisia and giving meaning to the lives of its people."
FEA_stappenbeld_desc:0 "Bernhardt Stappenbeld grew up in Rottendedam, the port city of Feathisia. Born with an inherent curiosity and a quick mind, the griffon started writing from a young age. Although his fiction was of a mediocre quality, his prose was good enough for the work of a journalist. Adventurous, the Feathisian accepted a job offer to report on stories from Stalliongrad. Over the years, his readers may have found the tone of his stories changing. Critical at first, the griffon living amongst ponies mocked the ponies of the Severyana for revolting against such a benevolent ruler like Celestia.\n\nSlowly but surely, the accounts of failing agricultural plans and empty store shelves made way for intricate essays on Stalliongradian communism and then what his critics called straight up love letters to socialism. When the journalist went home and joined the PvdA on the day of his return, they found a changed griffon. A sceptical journalist crossed the sea, returning as a socialist ideologue. His teachings, brought over from Stalliongrad, attracted a split following; intelligentsia and self-proclaimed revolutionaries on the one claw, and actual workers on the other.\n\nWith revolution raging in Feathisia, Stappenbeld's ranks grew enormously as his prophecy of class struggle indeed became true. The journalist showed himself a capable leader, eclipsing the social democrats in the PvdA and managing to get into party leadership. Now Bernhardt Stappenbeld looked over the ocean once more, ready to put theory into practice."
FEA_vorst_desc:0 "Born into the prestigious Van Vorst tot Vorst family, Herman was the heir to their land. Herman carried his heritage with him wherever he went, learning the traits that defined a good noblegriffon from school and at home. Staunch, conservative, brave and strategic, he graduated top of his class in the officer academy showing that a noble birth did not mean a lack of merit. Serving in many posts, including a fateful while as an artillery officer, the baron became popular among his troops for his no-nonsense attitude and straight up patriotism.\n\nFrom the army, Herman learned the value of hierarchy, of tradition and of the institution of the military. As he climbed through the ranks, he started to flirt with the FNV party, a highly unorthodox choice for a noblegriffon. But the Ducal party had grown spineless, giving to many concessions to weak doves who wanted total equality. When the system broke down, the Baron and soldiers loyal to him stepped in to fight on the side of the nationalists.\n\nHowever, during the fighting, Van Vorst tot Vorst discovered that his newfound allies were little better, discarding tradition in favour of something radically new. They had to be stopped as well and the Baron did stop them. Now the military rules Feathisia, guarding the people against any threat, both from the inside and from abroad. The House of Van Vorst tot Vorst stands victorious and vigilant against threats both foreign and domestic."

FEA_stefan_desc:0 "The cousin of the more famous Gerlach IV, Stefan Weijermars lived in relative obscurity as a curator to De Vleugels art museum. His true passion never lay in politics, although he shared the same enthusiasm for art as his cousin did for running a nation. Described as an introvert, only coming to life when the conversation comes to his passion, it was easy to forget the griffon's lineage when meeting him. Everything changed with the death of his cousin. The Weijermars family scattered when the civil war began, some leaving the country successfully, others shot by marauding Rozenkampists. Stefan was hidden by the museum staff amongst some of the most precious artworks. Only when the civil war died down, with the military securing victory, did Stefan come out.\n\nThe Baron's soldiers located Weijermars and after a conversation behind closed doors, he decided to take the title of Grand Duke of Feathisia. Whether he agreed in an effort to soften the military rule over the country, or because Stefan I was indeed a supporter of military stratocracy is up to speculation, but he must have no illusions of ever obtaining the power or influence his deceased cousin once wielded."
FEA_talonsley_desc:0 "A social and moderate liberal and beloved prime minister of Feathisia, Arjen Talonsley has led the country through an age of gradual destabilization. A griffon of compromises and normalcy, he is not above negotiations and solutions where 'everygriffon wins'.\n\nTalonsley took over the LDP after an incident known as the 'Night of Molenaer', after his predecessor as ruler of the LDP. Molenaer had won a stunning election victory against the monarchist FHP party, but the conservatives threatened to blow up negotiations for a government unless the LDP would openly denounce republicanism. Later on, it was proven that this demand came directly from the Grand Duke, but that night, the LDP was forced to choose between principle or pragmatism. Molenaer chose principles, but in an internal party vote, he was rejected by a narrow margin and Talonsley became head of the party, forging the LDP-FHP coalition. Molenaer left the party and Talonsley lost much of the republican vote to the PvdA, but he had his government. In time Arjen Talonsley and the LDP would shown that monarchy and liberty were not opposed values, but actually complement each other nicely. His free market approach to may see his support decline amongst the average griffon, however, especially during a crisis."

FEA_literally_dice_desc:0 "Out of all the weapons, shells, and bombs in Feathisia's arsenal, arguably the most dangerous is a Griffon who wears floral patterned shirts to battle. Depending on the story, Dobbelsteen Moerman was born either in 984 or at the dawn of time, and has made his name as a celebrity to the people, a nuisance to the police, a disgrace to the general staff, and as a hero to his soldiers. His exploits and successes in combat and training earned the explicit trust of the Duke of Feathisia, and afforded him untold leeway in the creation of Feathisia's special forces element, known as the Commandotroepen. Amongst the paper trail of insults against every political party, 86 arrests, 0 convictions, an ongoing attempt to convince the Duke to fund public gymnasiums, and a standing warrant for his arrest in Skyfall, Dobbelsteen Moerman has already earned himself the distinction as the most well-known troublemaker in the Herzland."

FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_in_freefall:0 "Total Freefall"
FEA_in_freefall_desc:0 "The situation is rapidly deteriorating, as constant warfare has scorched the continent of Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it faith in any and all financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremists both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PVdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."

### National Focuses ###
FEA_its_over:0 "It's Over"
FEA_its_over_desc:0 "It has never been more over for Feathisia than it is right now. Everything that could of gone wrong, has gone wrong, and Feathisia's political and economic string of misfortunes would be funny if it wasn't tearing the fabric of our society apart. Parliament has locked itself out of compromise, and the crisis worsens by the day. The Duke must intervene, and fast!"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions:0 "Prevent Bank repossesions"
FEA_prevent_bank_repossessions_desc:0 "In addition to falling wages, Griffons have been threatened with the loss of their homes, their farms, and their livelihoods. The banks, in an effort to make good on their debts, resolved to take what little our citizens have left. If this happens, there will be no hope of salvaging the situation!"
FEA_trade_union_visit:0 "Visit The Trade Unions"
FEA_trade_union_visit_desc:0 "In times of crisis, leaders usually meet those with influence for solutions to the current issues. Duke Gerlach has instead opted to meet with the workers whose lives have been affected the most by those with influence. Moreover, he refuses to act unless the voice of the worker is heard."
FEA_price_controls:0 "Institute Price Controls"
FEA_price_controls_desc:0 "In these difficult times, the price of staple goods has soared well beyond the reach of the common griff. These prices cannot stand. Duke Gerlach has passed a law dictating strict price controls for these goods so that no griffon goes hungry or cold."
FEA_investment_gamble:0 "The Investment Gamble"
FEA_investment_gamble_desc:0 "Feathisia won't survive without an injection of wealth, and it doesn't need to rely on private groups to get it. Duke Gerlach has taken advantage of his reputation to offer mutually beneficial investment oppurtunities to an assortment of nations."
FEA_tax_corporations:0 "Hike Corporate Taxes"
FEA_tax_corporations_desc:0 "One of the standing truths of our economy, precluding the current disaster, is the concentration of wealth into the claws of the few. Duke Gerlach has already demanded higher taxation of their wealth in this time of crisis."
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers:0 "Crack Down On Smugglers"
FEA_crack_down_on_smugglers_desc:0 "With the breakdown in Feathisia's merchant class, bandits have taken to seizing goods and selling them back at exorbitant rates. Regiments of the Feathisian Army have been deployed to shut down this immoral enterprise."
FEA_cut_federal_salaries:0 "Cut Federal Salaries"
FEA_cut_federal_salaries_desc:0 "The representatives and administrative workers of the government are living well above the average Griffon. In order to balance the budget, this gap must be closed, and their salaries cut. Whether this reduction in salary is more to balance the budget, or a act of principle by the Duke, is up to interpretation."
FEA_save_the_banks:0 "Save The Banks"
FEA_save_the_banks_desc:0 "As though Feathisia did not have enough problems, there are frequent runs on the banks which worsen our situation even further. This, in addition to out of control lending and the loss of investments by the banks, our money supply is quickly evaporating. If this situation is to be mended, then all deposits must be ensured and all losses covered."
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes:0 "Moratorium On Estate Taxes"
FEA_moratorium_estate_taxes_desc:0 "If this crisis is to be resolved, it will take the effort of Griffons from all walks of life. Favors and kind words to the Nobility will soothe their worries, and gain their backing in our other political actions. A temporary stay on estate taxes will accomplish just this. Besides, the estates aren't producing much value in these trying times anyways."
FEA_eight_hour_workday:0 "The Eight Hour Workday"
FEA_eight_hour_workday_desc:0 "The Duke believes we are not dealing with an economic, or a political crisis, but a societal one. The only way to prevent the breakdown of Feathisia is to offer confidence in the hearts of the people, and allow them to live their lives. The Eight Hour workday limit is a good start to affording more time to the personal lives of the people, and healing the divides of our Duchy."
FEA_not_so_different:0 "Not So Different"
FEA_not_so_different_desc:0 "Moldernik, the leader of the FNV, has proven to be quite more open to cooperation than most in the LDP first believed. Prime Minister Talonsley and Moldernik, at the Duke's request, have discussed common goals of both parties, like increased veteran benefits. Such legislation, no matter how minor, can ease tensions between the parties."
FEA_bank_nationalisation:0 "Nationalize The Banks"
FEA_bank_nationalisation_desc:0 "The simple answer to our banking woes is a direct nationalisation of the financial institutions of Feathisia. Bringing credit under federal control has effectivley already been accomplished, and would bring much needed faith in the banks."
FEA_bank_regulation:0 "The Kogchel-Moldernik Act"
FEA_bank_regulation_desc:0 "A proposal from the unlikeliest of duos, the leaders of both the PvDA and the FNV have offered a joint-bill to Gerlach to seperate investment banking, dealing with corporations and stocks, from commerical banking, which offers services to individuals. Such a proposal is seen as a middle ground to preserve investment, and offer much needed regulation."
FEA_a_square_deal:0 "A Square Deal"
FEA_a_square_deal_desc:0 "Gerlach has met with workers and employers alike to serve as a mediator of their issues, and has successfully secured concessions for both parties involved! The working griff enjoys higher wages and increased benefits, and the employers can utilize a returning supply of labor to their workplaces!"
FEA_tempering_extremists:0 "Tempering Extremists"
FEA_tempering_extremists_desc:0 "Anton Moldernik and Gerben Kogchel may be the leaders of opposite ideologies, but a strange show of mutual respect has risen between the two throughout the crisis. Collaborating to present a manner of ideas, Gerlach has agreed to work with them...in exchange for their help in the suppression of their more unsavory political allies."
FEA_we_are_back:0 "We're So Back"
FEA_we_are_back_desc:0 "The Duke's active role in solving this crisis, as well as parliament's full collaboration, has elevated him from a beloved monarch into a national hero. With a stable economy and increasing optimism from the people, it's like we never left."
FEA_rallying_moderates:0 "Rallying Moderates"
FEA_rallying_moderates_desc:0 "Members of the LDP and FHP have had their faith tested throughout the crisis, but with the confidence and eagerness to work with the moderate parties, their numbers have seen a resurgence!"
FEA_fireside_chat:0 "A Fireside Chat"
FEA_fireside_chat_desc:0 "With a year passing since Gerlach's first action to solve the crisis, Feathisia has been brought back from the brink of collapse. Believing that the crisis was caused by lingering doubts that go deeper than strictly economics, the Duke has scheduled a nation-wide radio address directly to the citizens of the Duchy, to address their fears, their questions, and their hopes."

FEA_in_freefall_modifier_desc:0 "The situation is rapidly deteriorating, as constant warfare has scorched the continent of Griffonia. The Griffonian Empire has decayed, and with it faith in any and all financial and political institutions. Ruthless competition with the merchants of Skyfall has eliminated trade profits and wages alike, as prices from the grocery store to the manufacturing plants skyrocket. Inflation and political extremists both run rampant, as even Gerben Kogchel, leader of the socialist PVdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have lost control of their parties' radical elements. The government, and Feathisian society itself, is on the brink of general collapse."

### Leader Descriptions ###
FEA_gerlach_desc:0 "Born in the year 960 in the Ducal Estate just outside de Vleugels as the eldest son and heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Feathisia, Gerlach has made a name for himself ever since he ascended the throne. A patient and diligent griffon, the Grand Duke immediately started reforming the Grand Duchy, which was, like the rest of the Griffonian Empire, still reeling from the aftermath of the Republican revolution in Griffenheim. Co-leading a committee with Rudolph Thorbeak, the leading liberal politician in Feathisia at the time, they strengthened the constitution and brought stable democracy to Feathisia. Although the Feathisians had to get used to their new rights, it only took a few years for liberty to blossom and all sorts of parties to pop up.\n\nOne of his most controversial moments saw him blocking the liberal democratic party from government until they expelled any republican sentiments. The Grand Duke explained that the Gods crowned the nobility and that the natural order of things had to be preserved, an attitude Gerlach inherited from his father, who helped fight the Republican uprising.\n\nEven though the country was doing fine, Gerlach never stopped working hard, championing the abolishment of public executions, leading industrial change and whenever possible, supporting Emperor Grover. All his hard work has left the Grand Duke without a wife, however, some griffons saying he gets awkward and shy alone with any possible candidate. The Silent Duke, as his subjects lovingly call him, will continue to give his all for his country, quietly praying his people continue to prosper under his rule and make him proud."

Now that the Grand Duke is married to Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, he has doubled his efforts, now in the forefront of Griffonian politics. The Silent Duke, as his subjects lovingly call him, will continue to give his all for his country and now the rest of Griffonia, if the gods give him the chance."

With the emperor dead and the system, he so carefully built on the verge of collapse, an attempt on his life saw the Grand Duke's last faith in the politicians he allowed to rule fade away. The Grand Duke took full control of the country, now that his old friends betrayed him. He would do anything to protect Feathisia and eliminate all griffons who would stop him."
FEA_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down with the advent of the civil war, as more violent and pessimistic forces took over the country. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Personally, the social democrat leader managed to curb the worst excesses of violence against civilians. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it was time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel gave Feathisia a second chance, hoping to rekindle democracy in a socialist light, to heal the wounds caused by the civil war and mend the country's broken society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon would leave the already battered state vulnerable in this uncertain age."
FEA_rozenkamp_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp was born in Mirabelle, the bustling industrial city in the northeast of Feathisia. Along with his brother Reinoud, the two barely scraped by as children of the working poor. Determined to escape the fate of their parents, both of them enlisted into the army as cannoneers under a young lieutenant van Voorst tot Voorst. The officer taught them not only how to shoot a cannon, but how to shoot a cannon and be a patriot while doing it. The death of their father in a workplace accident made the Rozenkamps leave the military, however. Herman had to take care of his mother and took his father's job. There he saw the difference between the noblegriffon's speeches about love for the country and the reality of factory work. Herman would change it all.\n\nThe Rozenkamp brothers joined the local PvdA, where they were initially suspected as former soldiers. Soon enough, their energy and oratory power got noticed by the party leadership and the brothers rose through the ranks. However, instead of boring party congresses and the administrative work which his brother spent more and more time on, Herman went back to the factories and sometimes even to soldiers. There he found fertile ground for his own brand of communism, called Rozenkampism.\n\nWith the economic crisis raging through Feathisia, Rozenkamp riled against everything. The nobility, the Triarchy and the weak politicians (sometimes his own party wasn't even spared). He blamed Griffenheim and Skyfall, Equestria and the Archons. But as the political instability reached the breaking point of civil war, Rozenkamp was ready for battle. When the red banner flew over De Vleugels, it were Rozenkampists who planted it there. And it will be Rozenkamp who will lead Feathisia to glory. For the Fatherland and for the Revolution!"
FEA_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren was born in Rottendedam to a middle-class family of shopkeepers. He was the world to his parents and the bright young griffon had everything his heart desired, but at school it was already he clear Heeren was problematic. He'd sometimes get overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage and woe to the kid that stood in his way if he did. Growing older, the griffon's way with words and his rage grew into an uncanny sort of magnetism and he easily attracted friends whose slavish attitude helped inflate his ego. Of course, like so many a youth before him, young Heeren thought he had politics all figured out. It was very easy. There were two griffons in Feathisia fit to rule the country, the first, Count Gerlach, foolishly gave his power away in pursuit of cheap popularity. The other griffon would be Godfried Heeren himself, naturally.\n\nHeeren joined the Orangecloaks, a paramilitary group training in the middle of the Great Plains. There his political thought evolved further and he found that his charisma served him well as he rose to a leadership position in the radical group. He quickly adopted the group's anti-pony attitudes and sheer hatred for socialism. When the group failed to win any seats in parliament, Heeren merged the group with the FNV party, negotiating his way into the spotlight of Feathisia's political elite. Afterwards, Heeren and the FNV at large profited from the crisis crippling the country, as the jobless proved loyal new voters.\n\nWhen the Regent Debate busted the coalition government, Moldernik, ever the pragmatist, tried to negotiate a coalition with the PvdA, but Heeren already prepared for a war. He aroused so much suspicion amongst his supporters that the deal busted and Feathisia went to war. Now Heeren was in charge of Feathisia. Those who know him best, doubt this would finally soothe his anger and satisfy Heeren's hunger for power."
FEA_edgar_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel led an unassuming but productive life. Born in a small town near to the capital to a family of bureaucrats, it seemed that Edgar would follow his parents' pawsteps. An interest in numbers and a sense of duty led him to the growing ranks of the ministry of finance. Some may find the work soul grinding, but for Edgar the numbers meant something. Every time the economy grew a little more, it meant more happy families and that money saved on military expenses could be used to fund healthcare that could safe somegriffon's life. His intrinsic motivation and his frankly brilliant work on the technical aspects of economics saw him rise as quickly through the ranks as the rigid structure of Feathisian bureaucracy allowed.\n\nWhen the crisis hit and the 1007 budget was to be presented, a true battle took place between the ministries of economic affairs and the ministry of finance. Pechvogel tried to champion a free-market based budget, while the idiots of EA tried to intervene in the market. Either way, the financial crisis exploded into a political crisis and a civil war.\n\nThe war kept going, while what was left of the civilian government tried to guard De Vleugels. And the wheels of bureaucracy kept turning, with most public servants having a sense of loyalty to their department over any of the warring factions. But alarming news came from Griffenheim as the Imperials marched into Feathisia!\n\nA few days later, a group of soldiers, some wearing caps with a red star on them while others wore Feathisian military outfits, barged into what remained of parliament. Edgar Pechvogel was there, delivering some paperwork personally. The soldiers, in surprising harmony, interrogated everygriffon present, leading them straight to Edgar Pechvogel. After hearing of his ability and crosschecking the list of griffons both parties hated, the soldiers decided that Edgar would do. Not much later, the public servant got inaugurated as the head of the National Salvation Committee. As the numbers turned from money to casualties, Edgar's vivid imagination seems more of a burden than a blessing. Still, Pechvogel would set himself to the present task, doing his best, as he had all his life."
FEA_moldernik_desc:0 "Born as the son of a manager in the Aiwle oil business, Anton Moldernik got the best education money could buy, namely a social science degree at Bruma university in Yale. Both his parents were part of the FNV party and Anton would become a member at an early age. Intelligent and ruthless, Moldernik managed to get ahead in the party and to get himself on the candidacy list, securing his election victory in Aiwle. In parliament, he became the party spokesperson on agricultural affairs, a topic the FNV's main competitor, the FHP, was strong in. Nevertheless, Moldernik managed to impress the populace in debates, presenting his monarchist counterparts as spineless conservatives.\n\nAfter about a decade in politics, Moldernik got elevated to the level of party leader, which he would remain until the Regency crisis broke out. With tensions flaring up, Moldernik sought to strike a deal with Kogchel. Much to his dismay, the deal faltered and his comfortable life shattered into a civil war. It took the nationalist some time to adjust to the new situation, but the fascist grew into his role as leader of the now openly authoritarian FNV. Now that the guns are silent and with his power reaffirmed, Anton Moldernik faces the task of redefining Feathisia and giving meaning to the lives of its people."
FEA_stappenbeld_desc:0 "Bernhardt Stappenbeld grew up in Rottendedam, the port city of Feathisia. Born with an inherent curiosity and a quick mind, the griffon started writing from a young age. Although his fiction was of a mediocre quality, his prose was good enough for the work of a journalist. Adventurous, the Feathisian accepted a job offer to report on stories from Stalliongrad. Over the years, his readers may have found the tone of his stories changing. Critical at first, the griffon living amongst ponies mocked the ponies of the Severyana for revolting against such a benevolent ruler like Celestia.\n\nSlowly but surely, the accounts of failing agricultural plans and empty store shelves made way for intricate essays on Stalliongradian communism and then what his critics called straight up love letters to socialism. When the journalist went home and joined the PvdA on the day of his return, they found a changed griffon. A sceptical journalist crossed the sea, returning as a socialist ideologue. His teachings, brought over from Stalliongrad, attracted a split following; intelligentsia and self-proclaimed revolutionaries on the one claw, and actual workers on the other.\n\nWith revolution raging in Feathisia, Stappenbeld's ranks grew enormously as his prophecy of class struggle indeed became true. The journalist showed himself a capable leader, eclipsing the social democrats in the PvdA and managing to get into party leadership. Now Bernhardt Stappenbeld looked over the ocean once more, ready to put theory into practice."
FEA_vorst_desc:0 "Born into the prestigious Van Vorst tot Vorst family, Herman was the heir to their land. Herman carried his heritage with him wherever he went, learning the traits that defined a good noblegriffon from school and at home. Staunch, conservative, brave and strategic, he graduated top of his class in the officer academy showing that a noble birth did not mean a lack of merit. Serving in many posts, including a fateful while as an artillery officer, the baron became popular among his troops for his no-nonsense attitude and straight up patriotism.\n\nFrom the army, Herman learned the value of hierarchy, of tradition and of the institution of the military. As he climbed through the ranks, he started to flirt with the FNV party, a highly unorthodox choice for a noblegriffon. But the Ducal party had grown spineless, giving to many concessions to weak doves who wanted total equality. When the system broke down, the Baron and soldiers loyal to him stepped in to fight on the side of the nationalists.\n\nHowever, during the fighting, Van Vorst tot Vorst discovered that his newfound allies were little better, discarding tradition in favour of something radically new. They had to be stopped as well and the Baron did stop them. Now the military rules Feathisia, guarding the people against any threat, both from the inside and from abroad. The House of Van Vorst tot Vorst stands victorious and vigilant against threats both foreign and domestic."

FEA_stefan_desc:0 "The cousin of the more famous Gerlach IV, Stefan Weijermars lived in relative obscurity as a curator to De Vleugels art museum. His true passion never lay in politics, although he shared the same enthusiasm for art as his cousin did for running a nation. Described as an introvert, only coming to life when the conversation comes to his passion, it was easy to forget the griffon's lineage when meeting him. Everything changed with the death of his cousin. The Weijermars family scattered when the civil war began, some leaving the country successfully, others shot by marauding Rozenkampists. Stefan was hidden by the museum staff amongst some of the most precious artworks. Only when the civil war died down, with the military securing victory, did Stefan come out.\n\nThe Baron's soldiers located Weijermars and after a conversation behind closed doors, he decided to take the title of Grand Duke of Feathisia. Whether he agreed in an effort to soften the military rule over the country, or because Stefan I was indeed a supporter of military stratocracy is up to speculation, but he must have no illusions of ever obtaining the power or influence his deceased cousin once wielded."
FEA_talonsley_desc:0 "A social and moderate liberal and beloved prime minister of Feathisia, Arjen Talonsley has led the country through an age of gradual destabilization. A griffon of compromises and normalcy, he is not above negotiations and solutions where 'everygriffon wins'.\n\nTalonsley took over the LDP after an incident known as the 'Night of Molenaer', after his predecessor as ruler of the LDP. Molenaer had won a stunning election victory against the monarchist FHP party, but the conservatives threatened to blow up negotiations for a government unless the LDP would openly denounce republicanism. Later on, it was proven that this demand came directly from the Grand Duke, but that night, the LDP was forced to choose between principle or pragmatism. Molenaer chose principles, but in an internal party vote, he was rejected by a narrow margin and Talonsley became head of the party, forging the LDP-FHP coalition. Molenaer left the party and Talonsley lost much of the republican vote to the PvdA, but he had his government. In time Arjen Talonsley and the LDP would shown that monarchy and liberty were not opposed values, but actually complement each other nicely. His free market approach to may see his support decline amongst the average griffon, however, especially during a crisis."

FEA_literally_dice_desc:0 "Out of all the weapons, shells, and bombs in Feathisia's arsenal, arguably the most dangerous is a Griffon who wears floral patterned shirts to battle. Depending on the story, Dobbelsteen Moerman was born either in 984 or at the dawn of time, and has made his name as a celebrity to the people, a nuisance to the police, a disgrace to the general staff, and as a hero to his soldiers. His exploits and successes in combat and training earned the explicit trust of the Duke of Feathisia, and afforded him untold leeway in the creation of Feathisia's special forces element, known as the Commandotroepen. Amongst the paper trail of insults against every political party, 86 arrests, 0 convictions, an ongoing attempt to convince the Duke to fund public gymnasiums, and a standing warrant for his arrest in Skyfall, Dobbelsteen Moerman has already earned himself the distinction as the most well-known troublemaker in the Herzland."

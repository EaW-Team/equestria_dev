 #### Starting Ideas ####
 FRE_Isolated_Clanns:0 "Isolated Clanns"
 FRE_Isolated_Clanns_desc:0 "The incredibly decentralised government structure of Pònaidhean combined with the lacking development in social and economic infrastructure is an issue that no Taoiseach has yet to overcome. If mass mobilisation and economic development is to arrive in our beloved highlands, something must be done to improve the situation."
 
 FRE_The_Limited_Taoiseach:0 "The Limited Taoiseach"
 FRE_The_Limited_Taoiseach_desc:0 "Despite the assent of the numerous Clanns required for her election, the Taoiseach has relatively limited power at her disposal. This is partly because the nation’s underdeveloped infrastructure places a practical restriction on the reach and effectiveness of Crimson's governance, but is also the result of centuries of conventionally decentralised rule. Whilst this does have benefits regarding the sociopolitical stability of the country, it makes governing particularly slow and difficult process in turn."
 
 FRE_The_Riverland_Backwater:0 "The Riverland Backwater"
 FRE_The_Riverland_Backwater_desc:0 "Though some mining companies have made small-scale dealings with some of the more personable Clanns, the fact of the matter is that Pònaidhean is underdeveloped and everypony else knows it. We have no industrial base to speak of and it makes whatever we do try and sell very difficult to shift, especially as the aforementioned foreign corporations begin to encroach on our beloved mountains in order to mine, refine and sell higher quality resources. Unfortunately, competition has not yet spurred innovation in our traditionally-minded craftsponies."
 
 FRE_Highland_Adherence:0 "Highland Adherence"
 FRE_Highland_Adherence_desc:0 "Whilst the vast majority of Pònaidhean’s population lies in the country’s forests and plains, our military doctrine has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The Highlands have always been a central element of defensive strategy with our knowledge of the many passes and peaks making them almost impenetrable to foreign invaders. Unfortunately, the historical effectiveness of and subsequent adherence to such simplistic tactics has rendered the already outdated cohorts of the Clann chiefs dangerously unprepared to fight the modern and professional militaries of other nations.\n\n§YChanges§! in military doctrine may §Rnegatively affect§! the existing §Ymountain§! and §Yhill§! province modifiers, should we decide to modernise the armed forces and abandon the old ways of war."

 ### Starting Focuses ###
 
 FRE_Necessity_of_Change:0 "The Necessity of Change"
 FRE_Necessity_of_Change_desc:0 "Though the Prìomh Chomhairle was more than happy to elect a young and idealistic pony to assist the various Clanns in settling a litany of disputes, Crimson nic Heart’s passion has resulted in little real change for Pònaidhean thus far. If she wishes to reform and develop the country, the Taoiseach must make extensive use of the ancient right of monastic counsel."

 FRE_Matters_of_Land:0 "Matters of Land"
 FRE_Matters_of_Land_desc:0 "Land reform is a touchy subject for many clannponies and indeed for the monasteries themselves. Some worry over the ancient clann borders that have been carefully worked out over centuries whilst others concern themselves with the ramifications of granting the Taoiseach powers regarding the distribution and land. Whatever shape the reforms may take, doing nothing at all is out of the question."

 FRE_What_of_Industry:0 "What of Industry?"
 FRE_What_of_Industry_desc:0 "Though the reasons for lacking native industrial development in Pònaidhean are many and the supporters of industrialisation are few, Crimson nic Heart recognises the importance of economic development as a potentially necessary evil to improve the lives of the average pony. Rapidly industrialising may be challenging even with monastic assistance, but it must be done in some capacity."

 FRE_Our_Duty_to_the_Coalition:0 "Our Duty to Others"
 FRE_Our_Duty_to_the_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Clanns and monasteries alike have ancient and entrenched duties to dispel evil, very few creatures in foreign lands know of our efforts or even of the travelling monks that protect them. Whilst our timeless plight against demons must persist, it is clear we must do more. The question is, who would be best suited to organise such additional foreign duties?"

 FRE_A_Society_of_Clanns:0 "A Society of Clanns"
 FRE_A_Society_of_Clanns_desc:0 "Its many centuries of persistence in spite of changing surroundings demonstrate the strength and resilience of Pònaidh society, but also displays its deepest flaws. The complete resistance to change has left the nation politically underdeveloped and dependent on the whims of any individual Taoiseach. This arrangement is beneficial for Crimson nic Heart and her idealism, but is unsustainable."

 FRE_Our_Military_Inadequacies:0 "Our Military Inadequacies"
 FRE_Our_Military_Inadequacies_desc:0 "Though the various Traiths and Toisiches retain small personal cohorts of specialised soldiers and maintain small defensive holdings in the highlands, there is nothing that could accurately be described as a national military. If Pònaidhean is to be capable of defending itself against modern militaries then some level of centralisation and reorganisation must occur."

 FRE_The_Work_Begins:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle Begins its Work"
 FRE_The_Work_Begins_desc:0 "The full cooperation of the Prìomh Chomhairle is necessary for the success of Crimson nic Heart’s reforms. Fortunately she is a popular leader and many already support her, but alliances with the sympathetic Traiths and Toisiches must be reaffirmed and extended to the monasteries that are soon to affect change."

 ### OLD EVENTS AND TOOLTIPS BELOW ###

#Event for Nimbusia to sell some fighters. From FRE focus.
 freeponies.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy Some Fighters"
 freeponies.2.d:0 "Our friends in Pònaidhean have decided to start an air force. Although these ponies have only just now built their first airport, they are seeking to kick-start their air fleet with some foreign planes. There logical first move is to get themselves some fighter planes. The Pònaidheans have offered a sizable sum of money, mostly in the form of valuable clothing, as compensation for us providing them with some of our old aircraft. Shall we sign the deal?"
 freeponies.2.a:0 "Helping an ally is helping ourselves." #Leads to freeponies.3
 freeponies.2.b:0 "We should keep these planes for ourselves." #Leads to freeponies.4

 freeponies.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Sold Us Some Fighters"
 freeponies.3.d:0 "Our friends in [From.GetName] have accepted our terms! The planes are coming our way and soon we will be able to start training our airponies! This is a big win for diplomacy within the River Coalition and shows that we can indeed rely on our friends."
 freeponies.3.a:0 "Great!"

 freeponies.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Doesn't Want to Sell us any Fighters"
 freeponies.4.d:0 "Sadly, our friends from [From.GetName] don't want to sell us any fighters. They said that they'd rather keep the planes to themselves, for safety reasons. It seems that we will have to make our own planes if we want to actually use our new airfield..."
 freeponies.4.a:0 "Aww..."

 #Event for Lake City to sell some bombers. From FRE focus.
 freeponies.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy Some Bombers"
 freeponies.5.d:0 "Our friends all the way over in Pònaidhean have decided to start an air force. Although these ponies have only just now built their first airport, they are seeking to kick-start their air fleet with some foreign planes. Instead of starting with small fighters, they have set their sights on some heavier bomber craft. The Pònaidheans have offered a sizable sum of money, mostly in the form of valuable clothing, as compensation for us providing them with some of our old aircraft. Shall we sign the deal?"
 freeponies.5.a:0 "They are part of the Coalition, so sure." #Leads to freeponies.6
 freeponies.5.b:0 "What good will those planes do in their hooves?" #Leads to freeponies.7

 freeponies.6.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Sold Us Some Bombers"

 #Triggerd by focus: FRE_welth_of_the_mountains
 freeponies.8.t:0 "Breezies Protest"
 freeponies.8.d:0 "It seems the cautionary tales we tell our foals actually came true. Our industrialisation efforts meant that we had to disturb some ancient homes of the little creatures. Despite monks warning us and workers sometimes laying down their tools and refusing to cut down Breezie trees, we pushed through.\n\nNow the Breezies have emerged from their homes and have been causing havoc at our new mines. They have been teasing and interrupting the miners, sabotaging our machinery and being a big nuisance overall. One of the creatures delivered a message straight to the Taoiseach. The Breezies want us to stop destroying the land in the search for crystals and other minerals. They warn that they cannot abide by us continuing to disturb their living space and that they can do much worse if we don't comply. Ignoring their demands may be disastrous, but giving concessions might show the weakness of the government."
 freeponies.8.a:0 "We can make some concessions."
 freeponies.8.b:0 "Who cares what those bugs say?!" #Leads to freeponies.9

 freeponies.9.t:0 "The Breezie Famine"
 freeponies.9.d:0 "Grim tidings, Taoiseach! It's the same story all over the country. The Breezies have enacted terrible vengeance upon us. Although their spells usually helps us, the magical creatures from the Otherworld have destroyed all crops in the entirety of Pònaidhean. There is nothing we can do, as their magic worked as if salting the earth. All our fields are barren and the ponies are beyond reproach. Without hope and without reason, we must rely on foreign imports. Millions might starve because of our arrogance. Because of your arrogance! But at least we still have our natural resources, although we probably have to trade most of them away just to stay alive."
 freeponies.9.a:0 "We should have listened..."

 #Trigger: -50% Stability and is taking the rapid industrialisation rout. This can repeat.
 freeponies.10.t:0 "Anger in the Prìomh Chomhairle"
 freeponies.10.d:0 "The Priomh Chomhairle is angry with the direction the country is going. They are demanding that the Taoiseach scales back her development plans. The protesting Triaths and Toisiches have donned traditional clothing, donning their tartans and suaicheantas. The supporters of the reforms have, as a counterpoint, started wearing modern fashion, some even wearing ties. To protect the consensus in the Prìomh Chomhairle, it would be best to hammer out a consensus between the clanns. Undoubtedly, that would mean slowing down our modernisation efforts."
 freeponies.10.a:0 "Negotiate with the traditionalist clanns."
 freeponies.10.b:0 "We can't compromise now, we are almost there."

 #Trigger: Has invited Wittenland Teachers. Stability less then 50%
 freeponies.11.t:0 "Monks Protest"
 freeponies.11.d:0 "A large amount of Anam-Teine Monks have travelled to the capital and are holding a silent protest in front of the Prìomh Chomhairle. Their grim faces and refusal to move, despite the extreme weather of the last few days has caused a surge in support for their cause. The Monks presented a letter to parliament in which they claim that the Wittenland schoolteachers who we invited earlier are destroying the moral and feeling with cultural heritage in the nation's youth.\n\nThe younger ponies have been caught teasing the monks, preventing them from doing their jobs. Apparently the teachers from Wittenland teach them that these monks are just a backward tradition and to be made fun of. Several Triaths have prepared a proposal to meet the monks halfway, but this is sure to reduce our modernisation efforts."
 freeponies.11.a:0 "We must keep these teachers in check."
 freeponies.11.b:0 "The time of the Monks is over." #Triggers event freeponies.11

 freeponies.12.t:0 "A Demon Attacks!"
 freeponies.12.d:0 "A Demon has destroyed one of our factories in a terrible blaze of dark magic. When the foul creature showed up, the workers were evacuated and the Monks, our ancient guardians against evil were called. When the responding Monks saw that everypony was brought to safety, they refused to engage with the Demon. Instead, the Monks started to lecture the local workers, while their factory burned down. They say that they could have easily prevented it, but they did not because the locals had turned against the monks and vandalised their monastery. If the monks were to respect these new developments in society, the ponies should respect tradition and keep sacred monasteries intact. Perhaps if we compromised, this disaster wouldn't have happened."
 freeponies.12.a:0 "We should have listened..."

 #Trigger less than 10% stability and is industrialising.
 freeponies.13.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 freeponies.13.d:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle demanded a debate with the Taoiseach on the consequences of the industrialisation policy. Many of the Triaths mercilessly attacked her policies, citing many examples of the modernisation bringing disaster upon Pònaidhean. At the end of the day, the Freeponies overwhelmingly voted for a motion of no confidence, demanding that the Taiosich resigns for acting against the will of the nation and for destroying the land's ancient wonders. The laws aren't clear on whether the Taoiseach has to follow such an order, but staying on would certainly be very difficult."
 freeponies.13.a:0 "Perhaps they've been right all along..."
 freeponies.13.b:0 "No, it is the people who are wrong!" #Leads to freeponies.14
 
 #Trigger less than 1% Stability
 freeponies.14.t:0 "Civil War!"
 freeponies.14.d:0 "The nation  has been completely divided by the Taoiseach's policy of rapid modernisation and resistance has been brewing in the hinterlands for a while now. An alliance of Clanns and Monks have seen their chance and have risen up in rebellion against the Taoiseach's central government who they claim are destroying the nation. The backwater, peaceful nation of Pònaidhean now finds itself at war, not with outsiders, or some ancient evil, but with themselves. The Taoiseach must now show the superiority of her ways by force, or risk reactionaries taking over who would undo everything she strived for."
 freeponies.14.a:0 "A longhouse divided cannot stand."

 #Clansponies-Division have arrived
 freeponies.15.t:0 "The Highlanders Arrive!"
 freeponies.15.d:0 "The call to war has echoed through the forests and over mountain tops and the call has been answered! Horns now sound through forgotten glens as the lost Clanns rally for war! Every day, more soldiers arrive in [FRE.Capital.GetName]. Ponies wearing armour passed down from generation to generation, with large broadswords and round shields. Others come with rifles and guns, yet other clannsponies bring only their muscles. The colourful formations trotting through the empty countryside were quite sight. Some older ponies were grim-faced, while younger ponies raised their voices in song during their march to [FRE.Capital.GetName]\n\nThe Triaths and Toisiches who lead these new forces have come before the Taoiseach and swore their oaths to defend Pònaidhean. The stallions and mares who lead the highlanders appeared like relics from another time, wearing the tartans of their clann, speaking in old dialect barely understood by the ponies who were more connected with the world. [Root.GetLeader] gracefully accepted the allegiance of these fresh troops, who had come to defend their homeland in its hour of need. After one last merry feast, the highlanders marched towards the front, the colours of their clanns raised high and cheerful tunes playing from their bagpipes."
 freeponies.15.a:0 "Buaidh no Bàs!- Freedom or Death!"
 
# FRE_secrets_of_anam_teine
 freeponiesflavor.1.t:0 "The Secrets of Anam-Teine"
 freeponiesflavor.1.d:0 "As the sun rose in the east above the capital, the riverside of Dail Mhòr flared with the tell-tale lights of magic. A group of ponies had gathered to watch the display, as a small group of monks put on a spectacle on the waterfront. Summoning their Amamarms- soul weapons- from thin air, much to the astonishment of those watching the display. As impressive as their summoning was, however, it was nowhere near what was to come next- brilliant plumes of blue flame arched into the cold morning air, many ponies jumping back in fright at the brilliant display of fire magic. Showing mastery of their craft fitting for their rank. Expertly weaving their flames through the air for the remaining duration of their display, until finally stopping, packing up what little they had and leaving behind an amazed crowd."
 freeponiesflavor.1.a:0 "What a thing to wake up to!" 
 
 # FRE_trible_militias
 freeponiesflavor.2.t:0 "An Army All Our Own!"
 freeponiesflavor.2.d:0 "The sound of traditional Pònaidhean war chants rang through the capital this evening, as our newly established national army marched through the city. Proudly wearing the garb of our people, and brandishing our weapons, our brave soldiers marched through Dail Mhòr in a display of our newfound strength. City-goers flocked to the streets to wish the soldiers well and cheer them on, and the finest graduates of our officer school proudly inspected the ponies soon to be under their command."
 freeponiesflavor.2.a:0 "Glory to Pònaidhean!" 
 
 # FRE_pegasi_assault_groups
 freeponiesflavor.3.t:0 "The Flight of the Pegasi Corps"
 freeponiesflavor.3.d:0 "An alien sight met the citizens of the capital today, as a procession of pegasi in military kit soared above the city in tight formation, putting on a fantastic display of flight skills. On the streets below, the brass of a military band began to sound as our newly trained army took to the streets, marching in perfect formation. As the military band began to play marches on suitably foreign instruments, many curious citizens gathered on the streets to watch out newly reformed army, some cheering, whole others simply looked on."
 freeponiesflavor.3.a:0 "Stay in formation, soldier!" 
 
 # FRE_unicorn_corps
 freeponiesflavor.4.t:0 "March of the Unicorns"
 freeponiesflavor.4.d:0 "Our programs to integrate unicorns into our military have been a fantastic success, and parade in our capital today has shown this to the whole nation. The procession began their march in a regular fashion, however soon the unicorns began their specially trained display. Put near the front of the cortege, the horns of the many unicorns began to glow in unison, before using their magic to light up the streets, putting on a dazzling show of their abilities. While overshadowed by the magic display, the rest of our army performed as admirably as could be expected, though most of the civilian praise was directed towards the newly trained unicorn corps."
 freeponiesflavor.4.a:0 "Send our thanks to Wittenland!"
  
 # breezie festival event
 freeponiesflavor.6.t:0 "Offerings to the Otherworld"
 freeponiesflavor.6.d:0 "Across Pònaidhean, ponies have put aside their typical routines for a more important task. Bearing gifts of various kinds, ponies have set out to please the spirits and faeries of the Otherworld, leaving out various offerings; the most typical ones being food, small valuables or alcohol for the enjoyment of their otherworldly friends. There is no truer exhibition of the caring of the ponies of Pònaidhean, and the ties of her citizens to the faeries they share the land with."
 freeponiesflavor.6.a:0 "A toast to our faerie friends!"
 
 # tribes ponies ran over by a train
 freeponiesflavor.7.t:0 "The Iron Stallion"
 freeponiesflavor.7.d:0 "In the highlands of our nation, many isolated clanns lay dormant, far from the outside world, content to keep to their own. One peaceful day in the mountains, a young stallion went out to gather berries, but found something far stranger. Metal bars on the ground, bound together by wood, and stretching out as far as the eye could see. Before he could return to his people with the news of the strange finding, he froze in place as a terrible roar came from beyond, the ground beginning to tremble. He looked around fearfully, looking for whatever beast caused such a noise- when he was suddenly torn from this world, hit by one of our newest locomotives. His clann, finding his corpse next to the line on which the 'metal demon' ran, have taken to sabotaging our train lines in the area, thinking that our train is some sort of terrible beast or demon."
 freeponiesflavor.7.a:0 "At least the trains run on time?" 
 
 # tribes pony craftsponies losing jobs
 freeponiesflavor.8.t:0 "Highlander Protests"
 freeponiesflavor.8.d:0 "The markets of our our cities have been affected greatly by our new policies of industrialisation. Once only containing foods and tools from local craftsponies and farmers, our markets now offer a grand variety of goods, from all around the Riverlands- a true testament to our modernisation. However, in the fog of the morning, angry cries could be heard from the prosperous markets of one city. A group of highlander craftsponies, angry at their loss of jobs to foreign and domestic industries alike, had begun a protest, demanding the government stepped in to protect their well-being. Their small attempt at resistance did not last long, however- quickly they were driven out of the market but a combination of angry civilians wishing to purchase from it, and local law enforcement. Although this may have been a minor incident, it is still indicative of a much larger problem."
 freeponiesflavor.8.a:0 "Surely they could just work in the factories?"

 POLITICS_RAVEN_NICCALL_DESC:0 "Raven 'Cridhe Teine' nic Call is the Grand Master of the Ard Fitheach Monastery. Orphaned at the age of 8 when a lesser demon attacked her village; she was taken in by the local monastery and raised as a monk of Anam-Teine where she quickly mastered the mystical arts of Anam-Teine, including summoning her Anamarm (Soul Weapon) faster than any of the other novices. During her first mission to the Dark Wilds, they were attacked by 2 Greater Demons. Her teacher and 5 other students were killed, but Raven and 3 others, including Crimson Heart, were able to hold their ground until rescued, earning herself the rank of Monk. Since then, she has quickly risen through the ranks to become Grand Master of the most prestigious monastery in Pònaidhean and is the spokesmare of all monks in the Prìomh Chomhairle."

 #### Starting Ideas ####
 FRE_Isolated_Clanns:0 "Isolated Clanns"
 FRE_Isolated_Clanns_desc:0 "The incredibly decentralised government structure of Pònaidhean combined with the lacking development in social and economic infrastructure is an issue that no Taoiseach has yet to overcome. If mass mobilisation and economic development is to arrive in our beloved highlands, something must be done to improve the situation."
 
 FRE_The_Limited_Taoiseach:0 "The Limited Taoiseach"
 FRE_The_Limited_Taoiseach_desc:0 "Despite the assent of the numerous Clanns required for her election, the Taoiseach has relatively limited power at her disposal. This is partly because the nation’s underdeveloped infrastructure places a practical restriction on the reach and effectiveness of Crimson's governance, but is also the result of centuries of conventionally decentralised rule. Whilst this does have benefits regarding the sociopolitical stability of the country, it makes governing particularly slow and difficult process in turn."
 
 FRE_The_Riverland_Backwater:0 "The Riverland Backwater"
 FRE_The_Riverland_Backwater_desc:0 "Though some mining companies have made small-scale dealings with some of the more personable Clanns, the fact of the matter is that Pònaidhean is underdeveloped and everypony else knows it. We have no industrial base to speak of and it makes whatever we do try and sell very difficult to shift, especially as the aforementioned foreign corporations begin to encroach on our beloved mountains in order to mine, refine and sell higher quality resources. Unfortunately, competition has not yet spurred innovation in our traditionally-minded craftsponies."
 
 FRE_Highland_Adherence:0 "Highland Adherence"
 FRE_Highland_Adherence_desc:0 "Whilst the vast majority of Pònaidhean’s population lies in the country’s forests and plains, our military doctrine has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The Highlands have always been a central element of defensive strategy with our knowledge of the many passes and peaks making them almost impenetrable to foreign invaders. Unfortunately, the historical effectiveness of and subsequent adherence to such simplistic tactics has rendered the already outdated cohorts of the Clann chiefs dangerously unprepared to fight the modern and professional militaries of other nations.\n\n§YChanges§! in military doctrine may §Rnegatively affect§! the existing §Ymountain§! and §Yhill§! province modifiers, should we decide to modernise the armed forces and abandon the old ways of war."

 ### Starting Focuses ###
 
 FRE_Necessity_of_Change:0 "The Necessity of Change"
 FRE_Necessity_of_Change_desc:0 "Though the Prìomh Chomhairle was more than happy to elect a young and idealistic pony to assist the various Clanns in settling a litany of disputes, Crimson Ua Heart’s passion has resulted in little real change for Pònaidhean thus far. If she wishes to reform and develop the country, the Taoiseach must make extensive use of the ancient right of monastic counsel."

 FRE_Matters_of_Land:0 "Matters of Land"
 FRE_Matters_of_Land_desc:0 "Land reform is a touchy subject for many clannponies and indeed for the monasteries themselves. Some worry over the ancient clann borders that have been carefully worked out over centuries whilst others concern themselves with the ramifications of granting the Taoiseach powers regarding the distribution and land. Whatever shape the reforms may take, doing nothing at all is out of the question."

 FRE_What_of_Industry:0 "What of Industry?"
 FRE_What_of_Industry_desc:0 "Though the reasons for lacking native industrial development in Pònaidhean are many and the supporters of industrialisation are few, Crimson Ua Heart recognises the importance of economic development as a potentially necessary evil to improve the lives of the average pony. Rapidly industrialising may be challenging even with monastic assistance, but it must be done in some capacity."

 FRE_Our_Duty_to_the_Coalition:0 "Our Duty to Others"
 FRE_Our_Duty_to_the_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Clanns and monasteries alike have ancient and entrenched duties to dispel evil, very few creatures in foreign lands know of our efforts or even of the travelling monks that protect them. Whilst our timeless plight against demons must persist, it is clear we must do more. The question is, who would be best suited to organise such additional foreign duties?"

 FRE_A_Society_of_Clanns:0 "A Society of Clanns"
 FRE_A_Society_of_Clanns_desc:0 "Its many centuries of persistence in spite of changing surroundings demonstrate the strength and resilience of Pònaidh society, but also displays its deepest flaws. The complete resistance to change has left the nation politically underdeveloped and dependent on the whims of any individual Taoiseach. This arrangement is beneficial for Crimson Ua Heart and her idealism, but is unsustainable."

 FRE_Our_Military_Inadequacies:0 "Our Military Inadequacies"
 FRE_Our_Military_Inadequacies_desc:0 "Though the various Traiths and Toisiches retain small personal cohorts of specialised soldiers and maintain small defensive holdings in the highlands, there is nothing that could accurately be described as a national military. If Pònaidhean is to be capable of defending itself against modern militaries then some level of centralisation and reorganisation must occur."

 FRE_The_Work_Begins:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle Begins its Work"
 FRE_The_Work_Begins_desc:0 "The full cooperation of the Prìomh Chomhairle is necessary for the success of Crimson Ua Heart’s reforms. Fortunately she is a popular leader and many already support her, but alliances with the sympathetic Traiths and Toisiches must be reaffirmed and extended to the monasteries that are soon to affect change."

 FRE_start.1.t:0 "The Taoiseach's Empty Halls"
 FRE_start.1.d:0 "Scarcely an hour had passed since she had set hoof in her family home and whatever excitement from the trip that had lingered during the journey home was now gone.\n\nCrimson Ua Heart sat quietly by the living room fireplace, enjoying the soft crackling of the low flames. It was a far cry from the almost unbearable noise produced by the cart that had brought some of her belongings to Coltstream on Pònaidhean’s cobbled roads. The Taoiseach sighed and adjusted herself on the settee, unable to think of much besides the summit that had just come and gone. It had been exactly how she had remembered it as a foal: full of ponies she respected, up to its ears in debates that lasted for hours and full of energy.\n\nWhat she hadn’t seen as a filly was just how little was actually accomplished during the summits she attended. Some of the members of the River Coalition had managed to negotiate deals amongst themselves, but for all her hard work it truly felt like she had personally accomplished nothing for the Clanns. It was true that some ideas for economic aid had been passed around, but ultimately even that wouldn’t help to make the changes she wanted to see in Pònaidhean. Infrastructure and a little money would not bring harmony to the Clanns, however much she wished it could.\n\nCrimson slowly removed the quilt that she was resting beneath and sat up on the sofa, gradually opening her eyes and sighing once more. She had hoped - seemingly in vain - that being part of the River Coalition would have afforded the Clanns more of an opportunity to reform themselves through exposure to harmony in a more natural fashion. It was clear now that relying on the coalition was not the solution for Pònaidhean, helpful as their riverpony friends might be.\n\nA knock at the door quickly roused the earth pony from her contemplations, “Apologies for the disturbance, Taoiseach; but Raven Ua Call has arrived.”\n\n“Ah, thank you. I’ll be right out.” She called back to the servant, a smile appearing on her face."

#Event for Nimbusia to sell some fighters. From FRE focus.
 freeponies.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy Some Fighters"
 freeponies.2.d:0 "Our friends in Pònaidhean have decided to start an air force. Although these ponies have only just now built their first airport, they are seeking to kick-start their air fleet with some foreign planes. There logical first move is to get themselves some fighter planes. The Pònaidheans have offered a sizable sum of money, mostly in the form of valuable clothing, as compensation for us providing them with some of our old aircraft. Shall we sign the deal?"
 freeponies.2.a:0 "Helping an ally is helping ourselves." #Leads to freeponies.3

 freeponies.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Doesn't Want to Sell us any Fighters"
 freeponies.4.d:0 "Sadly, our friends from [From.GetName] don't want to sell us any fighters. They said that they'd rather keep the planes to themselves, for safety reasons. It seems that we will have to make our own planes if we want to actually use our new airfield..."
 freeponies.4.a:0 "Aww..."

 #Event for Lake City to sell some bombers. From FRE focus.
 freeponies.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy Some Bombers"
 freeponies.5.d:0 "Our friends all the way over in Pònaidhean have decided to start an air force. Although these ponies have only just now built their first airport, they are seeking to kick-start their air fleet with some foreign planes. Instead of starting with small fighters, they have set their sights on some heavier bomber craft. The Pònaidheans have offered a sizable sum of money, mostly in the form of valuable clothing, as compensation for us providing them with some of our old aircraft. Shall we sign the deal?"
 freeponies.5.a:0 "They are part of the Coalition, so sure." #Leads to freeponies.6

 #Triggerd by focus: FRE_welth_of_the_mountains
 freeponies.8.t:0 "Breezies Protest"
 freeponies.8.d:0 "It seems the cautionary tales we tell our foals actually came true. Our industrialisation efforts meant that we had to disturb some ancient homes of the little creatures. Despite monks warning us and workers sometimes laying down their tools and refusing to cut down Breezie trees, we pushed through.\n\nNow the Breezies have emerged from their homes and have been causing havoc at our new mines. They have been teasing and interrupting the miners, sabotaging our machinery and being a big nuisance overall. One of the creatures delivered a message straight to the Taoiseach. The Breezies want us to stop destroying the land in the search for crystals and other minerals. They warn that they cannot abide by us continuing to disturb their living space and that they can do much worse if we don't comply. Ignoring their demands may be disastrous, but giving concessions might show the weakness of the government."
 freeponies.8.a:0 "We can make some concessions."
 freeponies.8.b:0 "Who cares what those bugs say?!" #Leads to freeponies.9

 freeponies.9.t:0 "The Breezie Famine"
 freeponies.9.d:0 "Grim tidings, Taoiseach! It's the same story all over the country. The Breezies have enacted terrible vengeance upon us. Although their spells usually helps us, the magical creatures from the Otherworld have destroyed all crops in the entirety of Pònaidhean. There is nothing we can do, as their magic worked as if salting the earth. All our fields are barren and the ponies are beyond reproach. Without hope and without reason, we must rely on foreign imports. Millions might starve because of our arrogance. Because of your arrogance! But at least we still have our natural resources, although we probably have to trade most of them away just to stay alive."
 freeponies.9.a:0 "We should have listened..."

 #Trigger: -50% Stability and is taking the rapid industrialisation rout. This can repeat.
 freeponies.10.t:0 "Anger in the Prìomh Chomhairle"
 freeponies.10.d:0 "The Priomh Chomhairle is angry with the direction the country is going. They are demanding that the Taoiseach scales back her development plans. The protesting Triaths and Toisiches have donned traditional clothing, donning their tartans and suaicheantas. The supporters of the reforms have, as a counterpoint, started wearing modern fashion, some even wearing ties. To protect the consensus in the Prìomh Chomhairle, it would be best to hammer out a consensus between the clanns. Undoubtedly, that would mean slowing down our modernisation efforts."
 freeponies.10.a:0 "Negotiate with the traditionalist clanns."
 freeponies.10.b:0 "We can't compromise now, we are almost there."

 #Trigger: Has invited Wittenland Teachers. Stability less then 50%
 freeponies.11.t:0 "Monks Protest"
 freeponies.11.d:0 "A large amount of Anam-Teine Monks have travelled to the capital and are holding a silent protest in front of the Prìomh Chomhairle. Their grim faces and refusal to move, despite the extreme weather of the last few days has caused a surge in support for their cause. The Monks presented a letter to parliament in which they claim that the Wittenland schoolteachers who we invited earlier are destroying the moral and feeling with cultural heritage in the nation's youth.\n\nThe younger ponies have been caught teasing the monks, preventing them from doing their jobs. Apparently the teachers from Wittenland teach them that these monks are just a backward tradition and to be made fun of. Several Triaths have prepared a proposal to meet the monks halfway, but this is sure to reduce our modernisation efforts."
 freeponies.11.a:0 "We must keep these teachers in check."
 freeponies.11.b:0 "The time of the Monks is over." #Triggers event freeponies.11

 freeponies.12.t:0 "A Demon Attacks!"
 freeponies.12.d:0 "A Demon has destroyed one of our factories in a terrible blaze of dark magic. When the foul creature showed up, the workers were evacuated and the Monks, our ancient guardians against evil were called. When the responding Monks saw that everypony was brought to safety, they refused to engage with the Demon. Instead, the Monks started to lecture the local workers, while their factory burned down. They say that they could have easily prevented it, but they did not because the locals had turned against the monks and vandalised their monastery. If the monks were to respect these new developments in society, the ponies should respect tradition and keep sacred monasteries intact. Perhaps if we compromised, this disaster wouldn't have happened."
 freeponies.12.a:0 "We should have listened..."

 #Trigger less than 10% stability and is industrialising.
 freeponies.13.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 freeponies.13.d:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle demanded a debate with the Taoiseach on the consequences of the industrialisation policy. Many of the Triaths mercilessly attacked her policies, citing many examples of the modernisation bringing disaster upon Pònaidhean. At the end of the day, the Freeponies overwhelmingly voted for a motion of no confidence, demanding that the Taiosich resigns for acting against the will of the nation and for destroying the land's ancient wonders. The laws aren't clear on whether the Taoiseach has to follow such an order, but staying on would certainly be very difficult."
 freeponies.13.a:0 "Perhaps they've been right all along..."
 freeponies.13.b:0 "No, it is the people who are wrong!" #Leads to freeponies.14
 
 #Trigger less than 1% Stability
 freeponies.14.t:0 "Civil War!"
 freeponies.14.d:0 "The nation  has been completely divided by the Taoiseach's policy of rapid modernisation and resistance has been brewing in the hinterlands for a while now. An alliance of Clanns and Monks have seen their chance and have risen up in rebellion against the Taoiseach's central government who they claim are destroying the nation. The backwater, peaceful nation of Pònaidhean now finds itself at war, not with outsiders, or some ancient evil, but with themselves. The Taoiseach must now show the superiority of her ways by force, or risk reactionaries taking over who would undo everything she strived for."
 freeponies.14.a:0 "A longhouse divided cannot stand."

 #Clansponies-Division have arrived
 freeponies.15.t:0 "The Highlanders Arrive!"
 freeponies.15.d:0 "The call to war has echoed through the forests and over mountain tops and the call has been answered! Horns now sound through forgotten glens as the lost Clanns rally for war! Every day, more soldiers arrive in [FRE.Capital.GetName]. Ponies wearing armour passed down from generation to generation, with large broadswords and round shields. Others come with rifles and guns, yet other clannsponies bring only their muscles. The colourful formations trotting through the empty countryside were quite sight. Some older ponies were grim-faced, while younger ponies raised their voices in song during their march to [FRE.Capital.GetName]\n\nThe Triaths and Toisiches who lead these new forces have come before the Taoiseach and swore their oaths to defend Pònaidhean. The stallions and mares who lead the highlanders appeared like relics from another time, wearing the tartans of their clann, speaking in old dialect barely understood by the ponies who were more connected with the world. [Root.GetLeader] gracefully accepted the allegiance of these fresh troops, who had come to defend their homeland in its hour of need. After one last merry feast, the highlanders marched towards the front, the colours of their clanns raised high and cheerful tunes playing from their bagpipes."
 freeponies.15.a:0 "Buaidh no Bàs!- Freedom or Death!"
 
# FRE_secrets_of_anam_teine
 freeponiesflavor.1.t:0 "The Secrets of Anam-Teine"
 freeponiesflavor.1.d:0 "As the sun rose in the east above the capital, the riverside of Dail Mhòr flared with the tell-tale lights of magic. A group of ponies had gathered to watch the display, as a small group of monks put on a spectacle on the waterfront. Summoning their Amamarms- soul weapons- from thin air, much to the astonishment of those watching the display. As impressive as their summoning was, however, it was nowhere near what was to come next- brilliant plumes of blue flame arched into the cold morning air, many ponies jumping back in fright at the brilliant display of fire magic. Showing mastery of their craft fitting for their rank. Expertly weaving their flames through the air for the remaining duration of their display, until finally stopping, packing up what little they had and leaving behind an amazed crowd."
 freeponiesflavor.1.a:0 "What a thing to wake up to!" 
 
 # FRE_trible_militias
 freeponiesflavor.2.t:0 "An Army All Our Own!"
 freeponiesflavor.2.d:0 "The sound of traditional Pònaidhean war chants rang through the capital this evening, as our newly established national army marched through the city. Proudly wearing the garb of our people, and brandishing our weapons, our brave soldiers marched through Dail Mhòr in a display of our newfound strength. City-goers flocked to the streets to wish the soldiers well and cheer them on, and the finest graduates of our officer school proudly inspected the ponies soon to be under their command."
 freeponiesflavor.2.a:0 "Glory to Pònaidhean!" 
 
 # FRE_pegasi_assault_groups
 freeponiesflavor.3.t:0 "The Flight of the Pegasi Corps"
 freeponiesflavor.3.d:0 "An alien sight met the citizens of the capital today, as a procession of pegasi in military kit soared above the city in tight formation, putting on a fantastic display of flight skills. On the streets below, the brass of a military band began to sound as our newly trained army took to the streets, marching in perfect formation. As the military band began to play marches on suitably foreign instruments, many curious citizens gathered on the streets to watch out newly reformed army, some cheering, whole others simply looked on."
 freeponiesflavor.3.a:0 "Stay in formation, soldier!" 
 
 # FRE_unicorn_corps
 freeponiesflavor.4.t:0 "March of the Unicorns"
 freeponiesflavor.4.d:0 "Our programs to integrate unicorns into our military have been a fantastic success, and parade in our capital today has shown this to the whole nation. The procession began their march in a regular fashion, however soon the unicorns began their specially trained display. Put near the front of the cortege, the horns of the many unicorns began to glow in unison, before using their magic to light up the streets, putting on a dazzling show of their abilities. While overshadowed by the magic display, the rest of our army performed as admirably as could be expected, though most of the civilian praise was directed towards the newly trained unicorn corps."
 freeponiesflavor.4.a:0 "Send our thanks to Wittenland!"
  
 # breezie festival event
 freeponiesflavor.6.t:0 "Offerings to the Otherworld"
 freeponiesflavor.6.d:0 "Across Pònaidhean, ponies have put aside their typical routines for a more important task. Bearing gifts of various kinds, ponies have set out to please the spirits and faeries of the Otherworld, leaving out various offerings; the most typical ones being food, small valuables or alcohol for the enjoyment of their otherworldly friends. There is no truer exhibition of the caring of the ponies of Pònaidhean, and the ties of her citizens to the faeries they share the land with."
 freeponiesflavor.6.a:0 "A toast to our faerie friends!"
 
 # tribes ponies ran over by a train
 freeponiesflavor.7.t:0 "The Iron Stallion"
 freeponiesflavor.7.d:0 "In the highlands of our nation, many isolated clanns lay dormant, far from the outside world, content to keep to their own. One peaceful day in the mountains, a young stallion went out to gather berries, but found something far stranger. Metal bars on the ground, bound together by wood, and stretching out as far as the eye could see. Before he could return to his people with the news of the strange finding, he froze in place as a terrible roar came from beyond, the ground beginning to tremble. He looked around fearfully, looking for whatever beast caused such a noise- when he was suddenly torn from this world, hit by one of our newest locomotives. His clann, finding his corpse next to the line on which the 'metal demon' ran, have taken to sabotaging our train lines in the area, thinking that our train is some sort of terrible beast or demon."
 freeponiesflavor.7.a:0 "At least the trains run on time?" 
 
 # tribes pony craftsponies losing jobs
 freeponiesflavor.8.t:0 "Highlander Protests"
 freeponiesflavor.8.d:0 "The markets of our our cities have been affected greatly by our new policies of industrialisation. Once only containing foods and tools from local craftsponies and farmers, our markets now offer a grand variety of goods, from all around the Riverlands- a true testament to our modernisation. However, in the fog of the morning, angry cries could be heard from the prosperous markets of one city. A group of highlander craftsponies, angry at their loss of jobs to foreign and domestic industries alike, had begun a protest, demanding the government stepped in to protect their well-being. Their small attempt at resistance did not last long, however- quickly they were driven out of the market but a combination of angry civilians wishing to purchase from it, and local law enforcement. Although this may have been a minor incident, it is still indicative of a much larger problem."

She quickly mastered the mystical arts of Anam-Teine in the service of the enigmatic Mountain God, including managing to summon her anam-cara - in her case, a particularly dangerous blade - faster than any of the other novices of her age.\n\nDuring her first expedition in a seemingly safe forest, she and several other monks-in-training were attacked unexpectedly by two greater demons. Her tutor at the time and five other students were killed in the battle that ensued, but Raven and a few others - including Crimson Ua Heart herself - were able to hold their ground until more experienced fighters arrived. Her instrumental role in saving the lives of the remaining students as well as herself earned the still-young pony an initiation into monkhood proper.  Since then, she has experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks to become Grand Master of the most prestigious monastery in Pònaidhean and is the spokesmare of all monks in the Prìomh Chomhairle.\n\nNeedless to say that she and Crimson Ua Heart remain very close after all these years, having found their way to the very top alongside one another. Though Raven remains the protector of monastic tradition in Pònaidhean, she remains open to the Taoiseach’s idealism in the hope that Crimson’s dream for the nation will only enshrine their faith in the Anam-Teine rather than abandon it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vistamage"
 POLITICS_CRIMSON_NICHEART_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of February 970 in Laimrig Geal\n\n§YBiography§!: Born as the heiress of the prestigious Heart clann, Crimson had always been destined for a future of leadership and political power amongst the Clanns. Her father - one Wall Ua Heart - made sure to bring his filly along to every important meeting during her formative years to instil a sense of duty in young Crimson, a habit which had the side effect of frequently exposing her to the friendly ambassadors from Wittenland, Bakara and the River Republic. It was almost inevitable that she would become somewhat of a harmonic idealist as she grew up, eventually idolising the success of White Star in particular for her diligent work in reforming the Wittenlandic monarchy.\n\nAt the age of ten she joined the Supreme Monastery to study the arts of Anam-Teine and quickly grew to become a skilled warrior whilst also becoming close friends with Raven Ua Call who was enjoying a rise in popularity amongst the elder monks of the monastery at the time. She would receive the position of monk through a steady stream of successful expeditions and a slew of diligent work, but fate would tear her away from Raven and the monastery not long afterwards.\n\nLearning that her father had contracted a terminal illness mere weeks after becoming a monk, she returned to her family home in Laimrig Geal to be beside him in his final months until he peacefully passed away one night in spring. Following his death, Crimson Ua Heart would be officially recognised as the Toisiche of the Heart Clann and was later elected to be the Taoiseach of Pònaidhean after a string of successes in mediating the disputes of other Clanns of her own accord.\n\nTime has not dulled her idealism, nor has it weakened her friendship with Raven. Crimson Ua Heart has never been more ready to see her vision for Pònaidhean come to pass.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
 
 FRE_lelei_la_lalena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of March 976 in the highlands of Pònaidhean-Èibhinn\n\n§YBiography§!: Storm Ua Calm can generally be described as an oxymoron in all respects. Many immediately recognise the current head of the Calm Clann for his opposing fore and surnames, but few know quite the extent of his departure from his family’s history.\n\nUnlike the many creatures that came before him, Storm was always quick to question authority and tradition and to do things in his own unique way. He was talented, but frequently reckless and disrespectful to the many traditions that his ancient Clann held near and dear. It was for this reason that he was eventually thrown out of the Training Monastery, making him the only member of the Prìomh Chomhairle to lack the title of monk.\n\nTo add more evidence to his peculiar nature, Storm is the first head of his Clann to pursue a position of military command. The ancient Traith Calm, first of the Clann in forename who would subsequently produce the historic family name, was true to her ascension as a creature of slow mediation and peaceful meditation. Needless to say that the latest to receive her ancient title could not be further from her methods, try as he might.\n\nDespite his monastic difficulties, his military career was nothing less than a meteoric rise; one only slowed by his own convictions to the many ponies he personally knew in the cohorts. His youthful brashness and abrasiveness within the traditional military hierarchies of the Clanns eventually evolved into a respectful, if still very assertive, personal command philosophy. Storm Ua Calm is one of the most talented commanders in Pònaidhean and shall remain so for years to come.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Motley"

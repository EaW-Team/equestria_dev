CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

Ambitious, she spent thirteen years working her way to the rank of captain and was slated to become a flag officer. However, Exavia caught the attention of VOPS due to her eccentric behaviour and attitude towards ponies. When it became clear that she was sympathetic to Thorax's cause, Queen Chrysalis ordered her arrest and execution.\n\nFortunately for Exavia, the Thoraxian revolt made it possible for her to flee to Thorax's camp before she could be caught by VOPS. Though she lacked the necessary experience to usually be granted the rank of admiral or even rear admiral, Exavia was still the most senior and experienced naval officer on Thorax's side.\n\nA fresh-faced admiral without a fleet, she is still determined to do what needed to be done to ensure victory.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri/floppochkin§!"

thoraxian.1.t:0 "The Thoraxian Betrayal"
thoraxian.1.d:0 "With supporters for harmony and friendship growing larger and larger within the hives scattered across changeling lands, it was only time before those upstarts thought themselves too good for the strength and unity of the Queen. Thorax and his supporters, as well as numerous detractors of Chrysalis, have all united under the banner of 'harmony'.\n\nNumerous hives in Volistad, Antax, and Soryth have pledged their allegiance to Thorax, embracing the values of harmony, friendship, and peace."
thoraxian.1.a:0 "We shall embrace harmony!"
thoraxian.1.b:0 "We will come for you soon enough, traitors."
thoraxian.2.t:0 "The Raid on Schloss Trimmel!"
thoraxian.2.d:0 "Put Cool Story Here"
thoraxian.2.a:0 "Trimmel survived and is calling for Thorax to be deposed!"

thoraxian.4.t:0 "Changelings Offer Pact"
thoraxian.4.d:0 "The Changelings offer a non-aggression pact, it's quite clear from diplomatic talks that they will seek ally us and bring down The Lunar Empire."
thoraxian.4.a:0 "We could accept."

thoraxian.5.t:0 "[OLE.GetName] Accepts"
thoraxian.5.d:0 "Olenia has accepted our offer!"
thoraxian.5.a:0 "Excellent."

thoraxian.7.d:0 "This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] and [OLE.GetLeader] both meet in the city hall of Vaverfront to sign a mutual defensive pact between their nations, forming what some have begun to call the Duskian Concordat."
thoraxian.7.a:0 "Together into the breach!"
thoraxian.8.t:0 "Changeling Alliance"
thoraxian.8.d:0 "We have received an offer from the King of the Changelings, he seeks to bring down the Tyrants in the south and promises us a fair share of Equestria if we throw in our support."
thoraxian.8.a:0 "While it pains us to cooperate with bourgeois scum, we accept."
thoraxian.8.b:0 "Why would we work with them they are no better then the tyrant in the south! Refuse their outrageous offer."
thoraxian.9.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepted"
thoraxian.9.d:0 "One more for team Thorax!"
thoraxian.9.a:0 "Excellent."
thoraxian.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declined"
thoraxian.10.d:0 "Stalliongrad has refused your generous offer and has cited it is a 'doomed endeavour'"

thoraxian.11.t:0 "Changeling Alliance"
thoraxian.11.d:0 "We have received an offer from the King of the Changelings, he seeks to bring down the Tyrants in the south citing it will be the greatest battle to ever happen, how could the Yaks of all species miss such a glorious event?"
thoraxian.11.a:0 "Yes."
thoraxian.11.b:0 "Ye- I mean no!"
thoraxian.12.t:0 "Yaks Accepted"
thoraxian.12.d:0 "Like they would have missed a good fight."
thoraxian.12.a:0 "Another one for team Thorax."
thoraxian.13.t:0 "Yaks Refuse"
thoraxian.13.d:0 "The Yaks of Yakyakistan apparently torn apart our treaty after looking it over, its safe to assume they they will not assist us in the upcoming war."
thoraxian.13.a:0 "Its like they all want to be enslaved by ponies or something..."
thoraxian.14.t:0 "Queen Velvet returns to Olenia with Changeling Backing"
thoraxian.14.d:0 "With the backing of Thorax and his changelings, Queen Velvet has returned from her exile in Equestria, and intends to claim the throne of Olenia as its rightful heir. Supporters of Velvet are already mobilising, and clashing in the streets with those loyal to Johan and his regime.\n\nIt's now up to those fighting to determine the future of Olenia."
thoraxian.14.a:0 "Bah! I'm the rightful ruler of Olenia!"
thoraxian.14.b:0 "The true Queen has returned! Hail Velvet!"
thoraxian.15.t:0 "Marriage Offer"
thoraxian.15.d:0 "After numerous nights together, Thorax and Velvet have grown close over the past few weeks after her successful installation as the rightful monarch of the Kingdom of Olenia, and it was tonight that Thorax proposed to Velvet. Offering to not only bring their nations closer in alliance, but also to bring themselves closer in the bonds of matrimony, as both King and Queen."
thoraxian.15.a:0 "I accept, I will get my best dress!"
thoraxian.15.b:0 "I refuse, but we can still remain allies."
thoraxian.16.t:0 "Velvet accepted!"
thoraxian.16.d:0 "Velvet was wooed by Thorax's boldness, and agreed to marriage. The ceremony was uneventful, but still celebrated across the two nations with joy from the citizens. Older deer and changeling reacted with suspicion, citing prior rivalry and hatred between the two nations, but those times are over now."
thoraxian.16.a:0 "Till death do us part..."
thoraxian.17.t:0 "Velvet refused but insisted we remain just allies"
thoraxian.17.d:0 "Ouch."
thoraxian.17.a:0 "Oh... okay."
thoraxian.18.t:0 "Capital of the Commonwealth"
thoraxian.18.d:0 "With the unification of Olenia and the Changeling Lands as the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth, a decision has to be made regarding the capital. While continuing to rule from Vesalipolis is the easiest to justify, considering it's where changelings have ruled from for nearly all time, arguments have to be made for moving the capital to the Olenian capital in Hjortland.\n\nAlternatively, arguments have been made for moving the capital to two of the Olenian and Changeling's biggest cities, Vaverfront and Vraks. While not as significant historically as the two current capitals, moving it to one of the other two may bring a sense of unity to the newly formed commonwealth."
thoraxian.18.a:0 "Vesalipolis."
thoraxian.18.b:0 "Hjortland." # DIRECT RULE FROM HJORTLAND!
thoraxian.18.c:0 "Vaverfront."
thoraxian.18.e:0 "Vraks."
thoraxian.19.t:0 "Propose Unification"
thoraxian.19.d:0 "With Thorax and Velvet's dynasties united in marriage, Thorax has made a proposal. Just as Thorax and Velvet are united, why not unite Olenia and the Changeling Lands under one flag, one banner, as a diarchal system? Not only will it bring two races who have had conflicts closer together, but it'll help unite the land and bring about more friendship and harmony."
thoraxian.19.a:0 "Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth."
thoraxian.19.b:0 "We should stay separate countries."
thoraxian.20.t:0 "Velvet refused the Union"
thoraxian.20.d:0 "Despite all that the changelings and the deer have been through in recent history, Queen Velvet has regrettably declined the offer to unify both the Changeling Lands and the Kingdom of Olenia."
thoraxian.20.a:0 "Oh... okay."
thoraxian.21.t:0 "Keisari Thorax" #IRC everyone is just gonna choose Velvet even myself
thoraxian.21.d:0 "In spite of the years of differences of the two nations, Queen Velvet has decided to unite the changelings and the deer as one nation under the diarchal rule of the married duo. As of this moment forward, King Thorax is now Keisari Thorax, and both Olenia and the Changeling Lands are the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth!"
thoraxian.21.a:0 "Keisarinna Velvet Jelzek!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody
thoraxian.21.b:0 "Keisari Thorax Jelzek!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody
thoraxian.22.t:0 "Changelings Seek Non Aggression Pact"
thoraxian.22.d:0 "We have recently received a diplomatic offer from the new government of the Changeling Lands lead by Thorax. After explaining that the new government wanted to distance itself from the previous acts of aggression perpetrated by the changelings, an offer of an official non-aggression pact between our two nations to solidify our new relationship was presented to us."
thoraxian.22.a:0 "Of course, we will accept. For peace and prosperity!"
thoraxian.22.b:0 "This has to be some sort of changeling trick!"
thoraxian.23.t:0 "Equestria Accepted!"
thoraxian.23.d:0 "After a short period of waiting, we have finally received a reply from Equestria! Along with the official signing of the non-aggression pact, we received a letter from Princess Celestia herself stating that this pact will hopefully put an end to the dreadful history of conflict between our nations."
thoraxian.23.a:0 "We will put the mistakes of the past behind us."
thoraxian.24.t:0 "Equestria Refused?"
thoraxian.24.d:0 "According to an envoy from Equestria, our offer of a non-aggression pact between our two nations has been rejected? We received no official reason for this rejection and are left quite puzzled by the Equestrian reaction."
thoraxian.24.a:0 "Wait, they said no?"
thoraxian.25.t:0 "Coronation of [CCN.GetLeader]"
thoraxian.25.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] was crowned ruler of the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth. At the opening of today's thousand-year-old rite the Allsherjargoði presented [CCN.GetLeader] to the citizens of both countries as their "undoubted Ruler", that is by holy right. Three hours later they went forth from the coronation event, amid the greatest rejoicing, a crowned and consecrated Monarch. No such delight has hailed a Sovereign's Coronation before."
thoraxian.25.a:0 "Interesting..."
thoraxian.26.t:0 "The Keisarinna's Plan"
thoraxian.26.d:0 "Keisarinna Velvet's Plan for the settlement of northern Olenia is in full swing, and it is a great success, providing living space for many deer and changelings. The vast, empty Olenian lands can now finally be used to their full potential!"
thoraxian.26.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.27.t:0 "The Asuttamien Plan Continues"
thoraxian.27.d:0 "The Kaiserin's plan continues at full speed. The various towns and villages dotted around northern Olenia have steadily expanded into larger and more prosperous communities. Roads and buildings are starting to cover the previously empty vastness of Olenia, and the economic potential of these regions continues to grow."
thoraxian.27.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.28.t:0 "The Asuttamien Plan Is Complete!"
thoraxian.28.d:0 "The final stages of the Asuttamien plan were completed in the last few weeks, and northern Olenia has truly started to transform. The many towns and villages covering the landscape are slowly merging into cities, and problems between the deer and changelings seem like distant memories to the inhabitants of the vast northern expanses of Olenia."
thoraxian.28.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.29.t:0 "Olenian Civil War Intervention"
thoraxian.29.d:0 "After pledging our own support to Queen Velvet's cause, it's our time to shine, and bring back harmony by helping Velvet to take down Johan. Our forces stand ready, and willing to help Velvet reclaim her rightful place as the harmonious Queen."
thoraxian.35.t:0 "Changeling Demands"
thoraxian.35.d:0 "During a meeting with one of the ambassadors of the changelings, it was made clear to us that they expect us to hold a referendum for those "harmony" supporters soon. The UFPR has grown in popularity ever since the changelings started to cozy up to Equestria, and now command a significant amount of support from our citizens. If we accept the referendum we might open the door to further changeling interference in our government, but refusing might have other consequences."
thoraxian.35.a:0 "We have no choice, hold the referendum."
thoraxian.35.b:0 "We can't cave into changeling demands that easily!"
thoraxian.36.t:0 "The Bears Accept!"
thoraxian.36.d:0 "The polar bears have accepted our generous offer, and Harmony now reigns in the Polar Bear Communities. The UFPR has requested our aid in transitioning their society to truly embrace harmony, and who are we to refuse such an offer."
thoraxian.36.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.37.t:0 "The Bears Refuse!"
thoraxian.37.d:0 "It seems that our offer did not go over well with [PLB.GetLeader], and was rejected by the Polar bears. In an official statement, Paw said that further changeling interference in the politics of the Polar bear communities would not be tolerated. It seems we might have to take other measures to establish harmony in the Polar bear communities."
thoraxian.37.a:0 "An unwise decision on their part."
thoraxian.38.t:0 "An Offer From The Changelings"
thoraxian.38.d:0 "The changelings have recently started to pressure us to hold a referendum for the supporters of Harmony within Yakyakistan.[From.GetLeader] is wary of accepting the offer, as the changelings have established very close ties with the Yakitan Liberal Nam, and there is no telling what they might do after the referendum."
thoraxian.38.a:0 "We must accept."
thoraxian.38.b:0 "We will not bow to their demands."
thoraxian.39.t:0 "The Yaks Accept"
thoraxian.39.d:0 "Yakyakistan recently held a referendum for their harmony supporters, and our good friends the in the Yakitan Liberal Nam have come out on top. Naturally, we must provide aid to the Yaks, both economically and politically. "
thoraxian.39.a:0 "Fantastic news!"
thoraxian.40.t:0 "The Yaks Refuse"
thoraxian.40.d:0 "It seems that our demands did not go over well with [From.GetLeader], and our offer was rejected by Yakyakistan. After this small setback, it might be necessary to pursue other options in bringing harmony to the Yaks."
thoraxian.40.a:0 "Unfortunate."
thoraxian.41.t:0 "A Change of Doctrine"
thoraxian.41.d:0 "With the integration of Olenia as our partner, we now have two choices of military doctrine; theirs, or ours. While our forces, overall, make up a greater portion of the army, and thus, it would be far easier to restructure their army then to do so with ours, there is also the possibility of exploring our partner's doctrinal warplan. After all, the world has already seen our might and experience in the civil war which cast the tyrant Chrysalis down. What shall we go with?"
thoraxian.41.a:0 "The tried and tested! The Changeling way!"
thoraxian.41.b:0 "The deer's way of thinking holds interesting possibilities."
thoraxian.41.b_tt:0 "Changes race to §YDeer§!.\nChanges racial technologies to §Ydeer technologies§!.\nTransfers all racial technologies researched by §YKingdom of Olenia§!.\n§RRemoves all changeling racial technologies.§!"

dragon.1.t:0 "Equestria Demands the Badlands"
dragon.1.d:0 "A letter arrived by dragonfire today. Bearing the seal of Equestria, its contents are unusual, but not too strange considering that these are non-dragon creatures that we are talking about. It embellishes the fact that the Badlands are landlocked and the damage done by the dragons when they travel between the Badlands and the Dragon Lands proper and the price paid by the dragons and Equestria every year. The letter concludes with a request for the Badlands to be turned over to what they call 'Equestrian suzerainty'  in effect giving the territory to them. While they are sparsely populated with dragons, even considering the small population, this has made for a relatively easy request to fulfill for us. However, it would still mean giving away a piece of the sparse territory we have. What should we do?"
dragon.1.a:0 "They can have that piece of wasteland"
dragon.1.b:0 "It is ours by right and will always be."

dragon.3.t:0 "The Genius"
dragon.3.d:0 "Dear diary,\n\nNow I was back in the Zebhara desert, but I was not going to Azir. Not yet. Instead, I was a passenger on a merchant canoe sailing up the Neighle river. My destination was in [CZR.GetNameDef] and its capital, [CZR.Capital.GetName]. It was a very dangerous journey as the area had faced much conflict recently, but the merchants had hired competent guards, so I was not too afraid.\n\nWhen the canoe arrived and the merchants engaged in trade with the locals, I went out to look for Rachel. Most of the populace were zebras who had never seen a pony before, but I assumed some of them must've seen a goat. Indeed, when I drew an image of a goat in the sand, one of the zebras pointed me where to go.\n\nThe home of Rachel was more of a makeshift workshop or laboratory. She was an inventor, apparently, with an ingenius mind. It was exceptional, because most goats I had met were honestly dull-witted. When she saw me, she immediately started asking questions about who I was and why I was there. I ended up explaining many details about my life before I even got to talk about the ruins and the crystal ball. At no point did she show any signs of boredom.\n\nShe said that obviously, someone wanted me to find the ball. It was a valuable artifact, and would've been stolen centuries ago if it had always been buried in the rubble, as ruins in the Zebhara were often scavenged by thieves. This was quite shocking to me as I had not even thought of it, but Rachel was probably right. When I asked why someone would've wanted me to find it, she said they wanted me to find a way to open the tomb because something valuable was in there. She did not say who "they" were or why they wanted the tomb to be opened, but said she was eager to find out what was inside it and would do everything she could to help with the task."

DRG_seize_spa_desc:0 "Equestria is embroiled at war and distracted, and our holdings in the Badlands were lost in the chaos. It is only fair we take some land to compensate for our loss. The Spa Islands, with their many geysers, will be a fine home for dragons."

DRG_rockslide_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown, in the Dragon Isles.\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Unlike many of his kin, Rockslide has little ambition beyond ensuring his own comfort and keeping his territory secure. More than once, rival dragons or rogue pirates have attempted to seize his domain, only to discover that his sluggish demeanor hides a terrifyingly efficient fighter when provoked.\n\nThough often described as lazy, Rockslide possesses an innate strategic mind—he simply prefers not to use it unless absolutely necessary. Those who can push him into action will find a general who values stability and defense above reckless expansion. But whether he can be convinced to exert effort for someone else's cause remains an open question.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Blakasmoko"
DRG_garble:0 "Garble"
Garble_adv_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown, in the Dragon Isles.\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Garble is a dragon who thrives on strength, dominance, and proving himself through sheer force. Once a typical bully among his kind, he has since hardened into a true warrior, learning through experience that brute strength alone is not always enough. While still hotheaded and prone to recklessness, he has become a formidable fighter, capable of rallying others through sheer bravado and an unshakable belief in draconic superiority.\n\nThough his leadership style often favors direct combat over careful planning, Garble is not entirely without tactical sense—he simply prefers action over hesitation. Under the right guidance, he could be molded into a devastating force on the battlefield, but without restraint, he is just as likely to charge headfirst into disaster as into victory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby and Blakasmoko"

Charcoal_adv_desc:0 "A dragon warrior with a sharp mind for opportunity and an even sharper desire for wealth, Charcoal carved out his reputation by forming a warband to fend off pirate incursions. However, his motivations were far from noble—he only did so to claim the spoils of defeated raiders for himself.\n\nDespite his greed, Charcoal is a pragmatic and reliable fighter. His warband has become the Isles’ unofficial defense force, though they are known to demand 'tribute' for their services. Those who can keep him well-fed with gold and treasure will find no better enforcer for their rule. But should the coffers run dry, his loyalty may prove just as fleeting as the wind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Blakasmoko"
DRG_graphite:0 "Graphite"
Graphite_adv_desc:0 "Graphite is an anomaly among dragons—obsessed not with hoarding gold, but with organizing, structuring, and most importantly, fixing things that others have messed up. She has converted her own cavern into an expansive bureaucratic office, filled with stacks of records, tax ledgers, and detailed reformation plans that she insists will 'finally bring some order to this lawless place.'\n\nAlthough undeniably brilliant and capable, she is also relentless. Whether one values her advice or not, she will ensure that it is heard—repeatedly—until it is either implemented or ignored at one’s own peril. Many rulers have found that arguing with her is more exDRGsting than ruling itself. Some even whisper that outlasting her nagging is a feat more challenging than battle itself. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

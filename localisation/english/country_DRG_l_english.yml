### Events ###

dragon.1.t:0 "Equestria Demands the Badlands"
dragon.1.d:0 "A letter arrived by dragonfire today. Bearing the seal of Equestria, its contents are unusual, but not too strange considering that these are non-dragon creatures that we are talking about. It embellishes the fact that the Badlands are landlocked and the damage done by the dragons when they travel between the Badlands and the Dragon Isles proper and the price paid by the dragons and Equestria every year. The letter concludes with a request for the Badlands to be turned over to what they call 'Equestrian suzerainty'  in effect handing the territory to them. While they are sparsely populated with dragons, even considering the small population, this has made for a relatively easy request to fulfill for us. However, it would still mean giving away a piece of the sparse territory we have. What should we do?"
dragon.1.a:0 "They can have that piece of wasteland"
dragon.1.b:0 "It is ours by right and will always be."

### Decisions ###

DRG_seize_spa:0 "Seize The Spa Islands"
DRG_seize_spa_desc:0 "Equestria is embroiled at war and distracted, and our holdings in the Badlands were lost in the chaos. It is only fair we take some land to compensate for our loss. The Spa Islands, with their many geysers, will be a fine home for dragons."

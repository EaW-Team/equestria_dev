 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot:0 "Chaos in Canterlot"
 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot_desc:0 "The Princesses are nowhere to be found, their whereabouts known by nopony. News is already spreading fast, Canterlot and even Equestria threatening to spiral out of control if something is not done. It is now up to Princess Twilight to take leadership, and solve this problem before it is too late."
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements:0 "Assemble the Elements"
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements_desc:0 "The Bearers of the Elements of Harmony are national heroes and Princess Twilight's closest friends. Their help will be invaluable in fixing Equestria's situation, and so Twilight has summoned them to Canterlot for their help and advice to rule."
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies:0 "Reassure the Ponies"
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are terrified, unsure of the future with the diarchs gone. Princess Twilight must inspire confidence in them like Celestia did to restore order. In the name of friendship and harmony, we will go out and convince them that nothing is wrong, and that Twilight's leadership will see continued peace for Equestria."
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles:0 "Meet with the Nobles"
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility in Canterlot may have been mostly ceremonial, but they are still important in the day-to-day running of Equestria nonetheless. They paid respect to Celestia before; Princess Twilight is sure that with a few words, she and they can see eye-to-eye as well."
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria:0 "The Leaders of Equestria"
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria_desc:0 "The mayors, the bureaucrats, the businessponies. There are many important ponies in Equestria beyond the capital, and their help is needed now more than ever. Twilight and her friends must meet with them to give them the support and the orders needed to keep Equestria alive."
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony:0 "Uphold Harmony"
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony_desc:0 "No matter what, we must make sure that Harmony is maintained in Equestria. Our principles are what make us who we are, our friendships defining what we as a country represent. Even if all else is lost, we must remain harmonious together, even if the world burns around us."
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved:0 "Equestria Saved"
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Princess Twilight, Equestria has been saved from the chaos of the past and is ready to continue its period of stability and peace, much like the reign of Princess Celestia. Twilight is confident that they will return soon, and until then, she will act as the new crown of the nation. Long live Princess Twilight! Long live Equestria!"
 
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins:0 "The Regency Begins"
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen into total war, and it is clear why. We are surrounded by traitors to harmony, to friendship, and most terrible of all, the Princesses themselves. Our holy Regent, Princess Twilight Sparkle, is now willing to do whatever it takes to destroy these false states and bring about Celestia and Luna's return... by any means necessary."
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship:0 "Redefining Friendship"
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship_desc:0 "The fact that Celestia left only means that we did not understand the true meaning of Friendship. Others do not see the truth like Twilight; they unfortunately have their own misguided visions of what Friendship looks like. The true Elements of Harmony will show us the way, and must be in their purest forms for Equestria to survive."
 EQS_TNO_honesty:0 "Honesty"
 EQS_TNO_honesty_desc:0 "Lies are the basis for the destruction of friendship. We are surrounded by lies, blinded by what we are told by others and what we tell ourself. The truth must be revealed, and be our only guide; the Regent will accept no other alternative. You will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
 EQS_TNO_loyalty:0 "Loyalty"
 EQS_TNO_loyalty_desc:0 "It was the absence of loyalty that caused the Princesses' absence, and the lack of it in Equestria is disgusting. Traitors and heretics have no place in the ideal new Equestria, and the Regent requires no deviation. You will swear your complete and utter loyalty to the Regent and her friends, and follow her commands without question."
 EQS_TNO_generosity:0 "Generosity"
 EQS_TNO_generosity_desc:0 "Equestria struggles to survive while some of its ponies still thrive on their own possessions. This is nothing but greed, and against everything Friendship should be. Generosity is giving everything you have in service of others and in particular the Regent. Your prosperity was given to you by her, and thus you must give back in return."
 EQS_TNO_laughter:0 "Laughter"
 EQS_TNO_laughter_desc:0 "Pinkie Pie is the Element Bearer of Laughter, and during her long friendship with the Regent she taught her what that means. It means to always be happy no matter the situation, to carry on and keep Friendship alive no matter how the situation seems. To always smile, to always laugh. So smile, everypony."
 EQS_TNO_kindness:0 "Kindness"
 EQS_TNO_kindness_desc:0 "Kindness is a luxury, but an important one all the same. Acts of kindness are what create and save Friendships, and it is the same thing that will save Equestria. Always be kind to your friends... and show none of it to your enemies, the treasonous subequines lurking in our midst. They do not deserve it, and they are not your friends."
 EQS_TNO_shut_the_doors:0 "Shut the Doors"
 EQS_TNO_shut_the_doors_desc:0 "It was the insidious influences from those outside of Equestria that led to its fall and the disappearance of the Princesses. No more shall we tolerate such. From now on, we will be alone, cut off from the world to be left to our own harmony, the way that things should be."
 EQS_TNO_enshrine_the_princesses:0 "Enshrine the Princesses"
 EQS_TNO_enshrine_the_princesses_desc:0 "Everything we do, we do for the Princesses. They are the guiding lights of Equestria, they were the country itself, and even without their presence we still serve and honor them. We must never let our loyalty falter; our faith must be unyielding, and our praise towards our holy leaders must never cease."
 EQS_TNO_friendship_brigades:0 "Friendship Brigades"
 EQS_TNO_friendship_brigades_desc:0 "The regular army is simply not up to the task of securing our rule. If we are to defeat our enemies and bring about the Princesses' return, we will need a larger, more disciplined force composed of soldiers who will carry out the Regent's orders without question. The Friendship Brigades shall be that force."
 EQS_TNO_everypony_in_place:0 "Everypony in Place"
 EQS_TNO_everypony_in_place_desc:0 "In a friendship, every pony has their place. There is a role for them all to play, much like the Elements of Harmony all had a role to play. And yet we let Equestria become complacent, prioritized the concept of individuality, a foolish notion. We are all one under the Regent, and where she tells you to go, you must go."
 EQS_TNO_celestial_artwork:0 "Celestial Artwork"
 EQS_TNO_celestial_artwork_desc:0 "It is not enough to just be loyal to the Princesses; we must show our devotion in not just our thoughts and deeds. Great works to the glory of the Princesses, paintings of their grace, statues of their beauty, reminders of their power must be commissioned, so we are all reminded of what we fight for, and what we must prove to regain."
 EQS_TNO_cult_of_the_crown:0 "Cult of the Crown"
 EQS_TNO_cult_of_the_crown_desc:0 "We are not worthy of her presence. We are not worthy of her grace. Not while we do not believe, while we still hold doubts or lack devotion. They may call us a cult; is that not what her majesties Celestia and Luna deserve? A portrait of them in every home, including one of the Regent will remind everypony of that fact."
 EQS_TNO_open_the_schools_of_friendship:0 "Open the Schools of Friendship"
 EQS_TNO_open_the_schools_of_friendship_desc:0 "Just as Celestia once taught the Regent in her School for Gifted Unicorns, the Regent must now teach the youth of Equestria in her new Schools of Friendship. We shall bring all schools under the direct control of the Regency and enforce a new curriculum written by the Regent herself. Our students must learn the true nature of harmony."
 EQS_TNO_rewrite_the_journal:0 "Rewrite the Journal"
 EQS_TNO_rewrite_the_journal_desc:0 "The Friendship Journal that the Regent made long ago was well-intentioned, but ultimately misguided. Twilight sees that now, sees all the mistakes she made in the past, and it is time to correct them. The journal must be rewritten, so that it can be copied and distributed as the new rules and examples to follow."
 EQS_TNO_repurpose_the_cmc:0 "Repurpose the CMC"
 EQS_TNO_repurpose_the_cmc_desc:0 "The Cutie Mark Crusaders have potential, that much is certain. At one point, they even learned under the personal mentorship of the Regent herself. But they lack purpose, and numbers. We can provide both, with mandatory membership and a duty to play in the plans of the Regency."
 EQS_TNO_magic:0 "Magic"
 EQS_TNO_magic_desc:0 "When the five Elements are together, united by the spark of friendship, only then does the sixth Element of Magic appear. That was the Regent's very first lesson long ago, during one of the holy Princesses' return. It leads the other five, and as the Princess and Element Bearer of Magic, there is no better proof of authority that our holy Regent has."
 EQS_TNO_absolute_standards:0 "Absolute Standards"
 EQS_TNO_absolute_standards_desc:0 "Everything must be nothing less than perfect for the Princesses. Everything must be in just the right place, and everypony must behave exactly as needed. There is no room for deviancy, no room for error. Perfection is not just expected, it is required. Tardiness is not an option."
 EQS_TNO_our_work_has_just_begun:0 "Our Work Has Just Begun"
 EQS_TNO_our_work_has_just_begun_desc:0 "The traitors lay broken at our hooves. Our Regency stands triumphant, society remolded as the Princesses intended. But yet they still do not return. This can only mean one thing; we have not done enough. We must take the lessons learned to heart, and go further than ever before; we can not let everything we have done been for nothing."
 EQS_TNO_the_horned_traitors:0 "The Horned Traitors"
 EQS_TNO_the_horned_traitors_desc:0 "In the Northeast a truly insidious group of traitors has risen, with ideals that run counter to even the ancient foundations of Equestria. The Unicornian Sisterhood has its aims displayed right in the name; it is dedicated to raising one pony race above the rest, when the nation was built by all three tribes. It is time to teach them a lesson in friendship."
 EQS_TNO_protracted_warfare:0 "Protracted Warfare"
 EQS_TNO_protracted_warfare_desc:0 "The war against the Sisterhood will not be an easy or a short one. The mountain ranges they hold will prove difficult to cross, and their territory is vast. We will have to settle in for a long war if we are to be victorious, or even survive against their determined onslaught."
 EQS_TNO_into_the_fold:0 "Into the Fold"
 EQS_TNO_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The ponies of Bales cried out for our liberation, for the welcoming and friendly hooves of the Regent to save them. And now that they are no longer forced to serve the Sisterhood, they are signing up in masses to serve and help us defeat them, to cast down the unicorns that once oppressed them. Grab a gun and a friend, because the war is not over yet!"
 EQS_TNO_shackle_the_unicorns:0 "Shackle the Unicorns"
 EQS_TNO_shackle_the_unicorns_desc:0 "Unicornia, a failed experiment caused by failed ponies, has fallen. The Earth Ponies and Pegasi freed of their oppression, they are not to blame for what has transpired. No, it is the unicorns who must be closely watched from now on. The leaders will be executed, and those remaining will never have the chance to betray Equestria again."
 EQS_TNO_the_false_princess:0 "The False Princess"
 EQS_TNO_the_false_princess_desc:0 "The Southwest has seen a new pony, a heretic who claims the title of Princess Platinum's descendant and direct heir. These are nothing but falsehoods, dishonesties to mislead ponies into fighting for them against our Regent. We need to deliver cold hard Honesty to them, by force."
 EQS_TNO_expose_the_lies:0 "Expose the Lies"
 EQS_TNO_expose_the_lies_desc:0 "It is not the fault of the ponies in the false Equestria that they have been lied to, fed nothing but what their 'Princess' wants them to hear, and deluded into thinking their cause is true. They deserve the truth, and we will provide it for them. When they learn their world is a lie, and that we are the ones who bring friendship, then they will change their tune towards their monarch."
 EQS_TNO_rush_them_down:0 "Rush Them Down"
 EQS_TNO_rush_them_down_desc:0 "The 'Princessdom', a fake state as it is, appears much stronger than it is. In reality they are weak, only one step away from being broken. And broken they shall be. We must be swift, and with only one quick buck the whole rotten structure will come crashing to the ground."
 EQS_TNO_burn_the_south:0 "Burn the South"
 EQS_TNO_burn_the_south_desc:0 "Upon a closer look, the issue was not just of a monarch claiming a dead throne, but of vile separatism from the Crown and the rule of the Princesses. This can not stand, will not stand under the watchful rule of the Regent. The dissidents will find no quarter or shelter, and the rugged south will once again find loyalty in service to Canterlot."
 EQS_TNO_accelerando:0 "Accelerando"
 EQS_TNO_accelerando_desc:0 "The Southeast was always a hotbed of separatism, but none of us could have expected the musical uprising that occured there, bring forth a crescendo of socialism. Still, only we can bring an end to this piece, and cause a finale to the aspirations of heathens."
 EQS_TNO_danger_of_the_jungles:0 "Danger of the Jungles"
 EQS_TNO_danger_of_the_jungles_desc:0 "The jungles are a dangerous place, filled with deadly traps and creatures for both friend and foe alike. Our Regent would know, having been on adventures there multiple times. The most important aspect in fighting there will be preparation, both for the enemy and the terrain itself. Plans, things that the Regent favors, will be crucial to our success."
 EQS_TNO_the_native_loyalists:0 "The Native Loyalists"
 EQS_TNO_the_native_loyalists_desc:0 "The natives of the Southeast are not content with just standing by as the Republic rips away every tradition they once held dear, but they have no way to fight back. They, the Neighua and the thestrals worship the sun and moon respectively, and by extension the Princesses that we do. That makes them loyal to us, and if we can only provide them the means they will rise up in support."
 EQS_TNO_in_with_the_old:0 "In With the Old"
 EQS_TNO_in_with_the_old_desc:0 "The Southeast requires a new, more local administration to ensure that the chaos that once enveloped it does not happen again. It is not the migrant or new Equestrians that we can rely upon, but the always-loyal and tested natives that can ensure devotion to the Princesses is absolute. Let them deal with such filth as the Baltimarian degenerates."
 EQS_TNO_the_eastern_revolution:0 "The Eastern Revolution"
 EQS_TNO_the_eastern_revolution_desc:0 "Manehattan, once a loyal part of Equestria, has fallen to revolution similar to that of Severyana long ago. This time, however, we can not stand by and let it fester anti-Princess thought. This uprising is one that will be nipped in the bud."
 EQS_TNO_break_the_illusions:0 "Break the Illusions"
 EQS_TNO_break_the_illusions_desc:0 "The UESR is filled with nothing but idealists, ponies who can't see the truth in front of their faces. They cling to impossible visions, wishing to see them become impossible realities. It's time to give them a cold dose of reality, and show them what friendship is really about."
 EQS_TNO_relentless_assault:0 "Relentless Assault"
 EQS_TNO_relentless_assault_desc:0 "We can not let ourselves be bogged down by a stale front in the East. There is no choice but to remain on the offensive, continuing our assault until there is nothing left of the traitorous communists. There will be no ceasing to our attacks, no quarter given. They will feel the full fury and might of our armies, with the Princesses watching over us!"
 EQS_TNO_extinguish_the_dream:0 "Extinguish the Dream"
 EQS_TNO_extinguish_the_dream_desc:0 "There will be no revolutions. There will be no more dreams of a new society, except that which the Regent brings. Such thoughts are extinguished under a new order, a new future. There will be no harsh punishment this time, but there will be a warning to all those who saw treason occur and did nothing; such acts will never be tolerated again."
 
 EQS_TNO_to_meet_the_deadline:0 "To Meet the Deadline"
 EQS_TNO_to_meet_the_deadline_desc:0 "The deadline for the Regent, and for all of Equestria looms ever closer, and yet we are still far from finished in our duties for the Princesses. To not be tardy, we must give more, become harsher and more loyal, show truer friendship than we ever have. And that will include giving that friendship to not just ourselves, but all of Equus."
 EQS_TNO_the_empire_of_snow_and_ice:0 "The Empire of Snow and Ice"
 EQS_TNO_the_empire_of_snow_and_ice_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire. The Regent and her loyal assistant personally saved it from destruction just years ago, yet now they refuse to acknowledge our rule over ponykind. Their arrogance will be their undoing; there is no pony too great to re-learn real friendship."
 EQS_TNO_the_crystal_heart:0 "The Crystal Heart"
 EQS_TNO_the_crystal_heart_desc:0 "The Crystal Heart was the very artifact that Princess Celestia, blessed be her name sent Princess Twilight to save, making it an artifact of holiness. The Crystal Ponies do not deserve to have such visible daily; it must be heavily guarded by only our most loyal friendship brigades, to prevent another King Sombra from rising forever."
 EQS_TNO_work_the_mountain_mines:0 "Work the Mountain Mines"
 EQS_TNO_work_the_mountain_mines_desc:0 "Many ponies have seen the light and embraced our rule. Many others have not. For those unfortunate souls who can not understand yet, they will find penance working in the far north of the Crystal Mines, giving the Regency what it needs one way or another."
 EQS_TNO_ponies_united:0 "Ponies United"
 EQS_TNO_ponies_united_desc:0 "Crystal Ponies and the Four Tribes were always meant to be together, no matter what others may say. We will respect their autonomy with their long struggle with the enemy of the Princesses, the terrible King Sombra, but over time they will become inseparatable with the lands of the Regency. Ponies united, together in friendship."
 EQS_TNO_children_of_the_moon:0 "Children of the Moon"
 EQS_TNO_children_of_the_moon_desc:0 "The thestrals, our loyal subjects. Their devotion to Princess Luna is unquestionable, and as we are the Regent in place of her, that means they are by extension loyal to us. They will be the shadows in the darkness, the ear that hears the voices of treachery. They will keep the Principality safe from enemies within and without."
 EQS_TNO_servants_of_the_sun:0 "Servants of the Sun"
 EQS_TNO_servants_of_the_sun_desc:0 "Before Celestia's disappearence, there remained a small group of ponies fanatically loyal to her and her sun, willing to lay down their lives in service of her. They serve the Regency now, and their devotion will not go unused. They can act not only as a militant arm of our proud forces, but also as the preachers and spreakers, filling our ponies with pride and diligence."
 EQS_TNO_redemption_through_labor:0 "Redemption Through Labor"
 EQS_TNO_redemption_through_labor_desc:0 "The crimes such as treason, heresy, and worst of all tardiness are great, but there is still a chance for redemption, for a return to friendship. The rock farms of Southern Equestria always need more labor, and there is now plenty to go around. If they can prove themselves once more, perhaps they can one day rejoin our ranks as our little ponies."
 EQS_TNO_the_original_traitors:0 "The Original Traitors"
 EQS_TNO_the_original_traitors_desc:0 "Before there was the civil war for the Regency, before there was even the return of Princess Luna, there was the creation of Stalliongrad. An insult by its mere existence to the Princesses, it willingly chose to reject their blessed leadership to run their own rotten, degenerated state. It started with them, and it ends with them."
 EQS_TNO_purge_the_revolutionaries:0 "Purge the Revolutionaries"
 EQS_TNO_purge_the_revolutionaries_desc:0 "There are few loyalists remaining in Severyana. Perhaps many just did not have the courage or loyalty to fight against the communist menace, but many were unfortunately tainted by their lies and fight us even now for twisted ideals. There is no saving them; they will only find solace in death."
 EQS_TNO_the_new_tsaritsa:0 "The New Tsaritsa"
 EQS_TNO_the_new_tsaritsa_desc:0 "The title of Tsaritsa is a defunct title, or so many had assumed. As the de facto leader of Severyana, Princess Celestia was by divine right the Tsaritsa of the region, and so the title now belongs to the Regent until her return. She does not need official legal power for her authority to be absolute, but she will use it nonetheless."
 EQS_TNO_severyana_reclaimed:0 "Severyana Reclaimed"
 EQS_TNO_severyana_reclaimed_desc:0 "There was no Stalliongrad. And there was no Our Town. Both were experiments that failed and are meant to be forgotten. There is only Equestria. There is only the Princesses. Never doubt their leadership, for they bring the ponies peace and friendship, and nopony else."
 EQS_TNO_save_the_princesses:0 "Save the Princesses"
 EQS_TNO_save_the_princesses_desc:0 "Long ago, in the Canterlot Attack of 1002, Queen Chrysalis, may her name be consigned to Tartarus for eternity, defeated the holy Princess Celestia in single combat. This was not only a terrible insult, but also proof that the Changeling race will always be a threat to ponykind and its beliefs. They must be destroyed at any cost, for the safety of the Princesses when they return."
 EQS_TNO_rescue_the_deer:0 "Rescue the Deer"
 EQS_TNO_rescue_the_deer_desc:0 "The Deer were meant to join us in Harmony, under Queen Velvet, a friend of Princess Celestia. But insidious forces destroyed that notion, placing a pretender on the throne. Olenia is too volatile to leave alone; it must be brought under our benevolent protection, and allowed to experience real harmony just as we have."
 EQS_TNO_hunt_the_queens:0 "Hunt the Queens"
 EQS_TNO_hunt_the_queens_desc:0 "The Queens of the Changeling Lands are dangeous. They can rival the power of alicorns, of Princesses, if given the chance. So they will not be given one. They must be hunted down, exterminated, thrown into graves en masse. It may not be easy, or pleasant, but ultimately it is necessary."
 EQS_TNO_bring_down_the_drones:0 "Bring Down the Drones"
 EQS_TNO_bring_down_the_drones_desc:0 "The Drones may not have ruled or have any power, but they were complicit all the same in the attack on Equestria. So, they too must be punished with wide-reaching reprisals, shown the consequences of their actions. Many may die, but it is a sacrifice the Regent is willing to make."
 EQS_TNO_aid_the_yaks:0 "Aid the Yaks"
 EQS_TNO_aid_the_yaks_desc:0 "During the learning period of Princess Twilight, the Yaks were convinced to leave their isolationism and embrace friendship. But the Jaks rejected that, wanting isolationism instead of our protection. So, we will bring it to them by force. Any real Yak will embrace us, and anyone else will be proven a traitor."
 EQS_TNO_towards_the_far_north:0 "Towards the Far North"
 EQS_TNO_towards_the_far_north_desc:0 "The Polar Bears and the Penguins. Races of cold, typically cut off from the rest of Equus. Our mandate requires their integration, so they must see service to the Regent as well. Who knows? Perhaps they will take better to friendship than we expect."
 EQS_TNO_cleanse_the_hives:0 "Cleanse the Hives"
 EQS_TNO_cleanse_the_hives_desc:0 "We have beaten them, we have broken them, yet still they resist. We are left with no other choice; the changeling race must be purged of any subequine thoughts until it is ready to integrate as friends with pony society. That day may be long off, but we are well-prepared to continue our efforts until it comes, or the last changeling falls dead at our hooves."
 EQS_TNO_those_from_beyond_equus:0 "Those From Beyond Equus"
 EQS_TNO_those_from_beyond_equus_desc:0 "The griffons do not belong on Equus. They were sent as a colonial venture, a way for the Empire beyond the seas to extend its power and meddle in our rightful affairs. That protection is long gone now, and we remain as we always have. If the griffons can learn friendship, then we will accept them. If not... we are more than willing to send them back where they came from."
 EQS_TNO_kneel_the_dragons:0 "Kneel the Dragons"
 EQS_TNO_kneel_the_dragons_desc:0 "We have had a troubled relationship with the dragons. Once enemies, turned friends. But many still antagonize us, continue to test patience we no longer possess. They will recognize the authority of the Regent above any Dragon Lord, and they will do it learning humility above all else."
 EQS_TNO_ascension:0 "Ascension"
 EQS_TNO_ascension_desc:0 "Everything is in place. Yet the Princesses are still missing. So, we will continue. Twilight has seen reality; she must do more. Accomplish more. And for that, she must ascend past who she is now. The Regent will cast off her current shackles to lead us into an even brighter age, ready to take any action for the glory of our Princesses! All Hail the Eternal Regent!"

 equestria_TNO_reference.1.d:0 "Twilight's room in her castle was her second sanctuary (after her library), and the one place she could be counted upon not having to bother with guards... until about three seconds ago.\n\n"Princess Twilight, Princess Twilight!" one of the guards from outside of her room burst out as they barged into her room, rudely rousting her from her slumber.\n\n"I am pillow," she half-asleep muttered out, just about seeing the golden armour shining out of the corner of her eyes.\n\n"Princess Luna and Princess Celestia...they're gone!" the guards exclaimed, the faces caked in panic.\n\nTwilight's brain finally got itself together and began working, "What do you mean gone?" she replied in bewilderment.\n\nThe guards looked at each other. "The Palace sent a letter," they said, holding out a sealed envelope.\n\n"A letter? For the sake of All Equestria, why didn't you lead with that?!" she complained.\n\n"You ne-" they started before Twilight cut them off, quickly ripping up the envelope and unfolding the letter inside. Skipping over the formal pages, she came to the following conclusion:\n\n'You are now the ruler of all Equestria until Celestia and Luna return'\n\nThere was only one word left for Twilight to utter that morning in the bedroom."

Ponies have gathered under new leaders, even delving into forbidden thoughts," the voice on the phone cut her off.\n\n"But Celestia's memory, the Blessed Princess..." she began, "Her words, and mine, all of the Regency done in her name," she continued, flopping into a chair nearby. She looked on the map. Canterlot and surrounding areas in a, to her, pleasing lavender. Then other places, cities, countryside and that inbetween coloured in other, worrying colours.\n\n"Hello? Hello, hello?"\n\n"Yes. I want as many of them gone, you hear me? I want the bad hugged out of them," she whispered into the receiver.\n\n"Very well, your highness." the voice replied.\n\n"Twilight, are you alright?" the voice of Fluttershy came from behind her,\n\n"I'm fine...

Cities, nobles, everypony has broken their oaths of loyalty!"\n\nTwilight answered almost immediately, shocked at the sudden interruption, "What?!" she exclaimed, leaping from her seat. "They won't do this. They can't do this. I will personally burn their experiments to the ground!"\n\nThe guard hesitated, fearing getting caught in a rogue magic bolt as Twilight's eye twitched, and sparks flew off her horn, "Princess, the guard is almost gone. If we are to act, the clock is ticking."\n\nAt that sentence, it was as if something clicked inside Twilight "Yes. Clock is ticking... Clock. Is.

It seemed like only a few days ago that she was racing back and forth in the city, before she was even a Princess as a test from Celestia herself to save the Crystal Empire. This test was of a far greater magnitude than before, but Twilight was not the young filly she once was. She was prepared this time, and not a single mistake would be made now.\n\nEspecially when it came to the Crystal Heart.\n\nThe loyal soldiers of the Friendship Brigade stationed at the palace silently let the Regent pass as she entered the new room designed to hold the magical artifact, which still spun in its place below the spire. Twilight was no fool; she knew the Crystal City needed it to survive, and letting the Crystal Ponies die to the cold was not the will of Celestia and Luna. If Celestia herself had wanted her to save it, though, then it was truly a holy piece beyond all else. Not just anypony deserved to lay their eyes upon it, and that is why she was here.\n\n"Oh, Princess Celestia," the Regent prayed quietly, "give me the wisdom to continue forward, the traits of friendship that will allow me to save Equestria, to bring you back. Give me Honesty, to remain true to our goals and to never lie in service of myself or of others. Give me Loyalty, to never betray the cause we have created for you..."\n\nThe soldiers remained at attention for hours, never ceasing their vigil, as the Regent continued to pray to the voices that would not answer."

 equestria_TNO_reference.21.d:0 "Long Vines had always been careful. It had been one of his defining traits, even as a foal. His neighbors always told him to relax, to stop being paranoid, but he knew better. He never let his guard down, and so it wasn't him taken away by the Regency's soldiers when they came to find any traitors. Oh, he disagreed with what she in Canterlot was doing, of course, but he hid those thoughts deep where nopony else would find them.\n\nBut perhaps even he was going too far. He had sworn he has seen eyes staring through his window, piercing slits that watched his every move, and yet when he checked outside there was nothing there. Only the cold wind of the night, and the rustling trees of his garden. His mind conceded to his fatigue, and he got into bed ready for sleep.\n\nHe ignored the eyes reappearing in the windows. He ignored the slight creak of a door opening, the gentle sound of hooves on his floorboards. It was all in his imagination, all part of his fears. They weren't real.\n\nAnd yet for the first time since the Regency began, he was proven wrong as the thestrals that surrounded him knocked him out cold and dragged his body off into the night, leaving behind only unkept bedsheets and open windows."

 equestria_TNO_reference.22.d:0 ""Hear ye, hear ye!" The center square of the small village was filled with the sound of a single voice as residents gathered to see the newcomers before them. "The Regent brings her holy word, blessing you with its wisdom! Hear us, and rejoice at the prosperity that soon awaits us all!"\n\nThe scene was almost medieval. The ponies wore hooden robes, looking more like inquisitors than anything else. Such harsh religion was a foreign concept for Equestrians, and many gawked at the cold-eyed ponies, faces obscured and stances harsh. Very similar, yet strangely different to the official soldiers of the Regency that they replaced.\n\nThe ponies passed out trinkets, symbols of the Sun, the Moon, the sisters and above all, the Regent. They preached of salvation, of safety, of the future. And then, they left. Not a trace of them remained as they continued their journey to the next town, to spread the word further of all the victories and all the praises the Regency and its leader deserved."

 equestria_TNO_reference.23.d:0 "Life on a rock farm was difficult. The hours were long, the work was backbreaking, and the conditions left a lot to be desired. This job had once been done by ponies who enjoyed working with rocks, but now the farms were worked almost exclusively by those who had defied the Regent.\n\nCozy Glow set her pickaxe down and rested. It would be a few minutes before the overseer came back, so she knew she was safe. She tugged at the chain around her leg, but she couldn't get it any looser.\n\nCozy silently seethed as she considered her situation. The overseers kept saying she could leave once she was redeemed of her crime, but they never explained what was required to bring about that redemption. Asking them what she should be doing to earn it only resulted in her getting punished.\n\nFor now it seemed she was stuck in this place worse than Tartarus, doing menial labor that was clearly beneath her.\n\nCozy lifted the nearby water jug above her head and splashed some on her face before taking a huge sip. The laborer beside her, an old earth pony stallion, noticed her and got angry.\n\n"What do you think you're doing!? That water's supposed to last us all day!"\nCozy scowled, then quickly composed herself and put on her best puppy dog eyes.\n\n"You wouldn't take water away from a cute little filly like me, would you? I thought we were friends!"\n\nThe stallion tried his best to stay angry, but eventually he just gave up. "Fine, take it all. Maybe without water I'll finally get to die."\n\nCozy tried not to think about this comment, but she couldn't shake the fear that she too would only leave this place in death."

 equestria_TNO_reference.24.d:0 "Rarity had been acting off lately. Every other pony would have dismissed such a claim, but Twilight saw it, past the lies. The smell of doubt and treason was all over her. There was fear, fear of her and the Regency, and that was dangerous. It was why she had pulled Rarity to speak with her, alone.\n\n"D-darling, whatever could be the issue?" she asked, looking around nervously. "Is something the matter?"\n\n"Do you believe that I am correct in everything I have done, Rarity? Be honest."\n\n"Ah, well, you've certainly done a lot for Equestria and the Princesses..." The Regent continued to watch her friend closely and coldly as she continued. "But well, perhaps there are a few mistakes you made here and there, I mean don't you think you've been going a little too far-"\n\nA single shot rang out as Twilight's pistol whipped out, shooting Rarity straight through the heart. The unicorn falling over dead was not what surprised her. What did, however, was the green fire that revealed her as a changeling. "What is this?" she hissed, furious.\n\nA lone Earth Pony rushed in, bowing to the alicorn immediately. "My Regent, apologies for the interruption, but there is urgent news. Rarity has been found dead during a raid on a Sisterhood cell. It appears that she was leading them the entire time under a false name..." He spotted the dead changeling and trailed off, falling silent.\n\nTwilight's eye twitched. "She was a traitor the whole time," she whispered. Rarity had never been a real friend. She had been working towards the downfall of Equestria from the beginning. She would have likely even collaborated with the Changelings had she been given the chance. "Get this changeling out of here and bring me the Element of Generosity," Twilight ordered the pony.\n\n"From now on, there was no pony named Rarity.""

 equestria_TNO_reference.25.d:0 ""Are you sure this is going to work?"\n\nThe earth pony helping push the heavy metal crate grunted. "The Regent herself said it would. We followed her instructions to the very letter. A big metal box with a red balloon inside, with two magical seals and constant surveillance. There's no way this won't work."\n\nThe first pony shrugged. "If you say so. Just saying though, there's probably a reason why nopony else took the assignment. We all know the legends around the Element of Laughter. Throwing her into a volcano seems solid, but you never know..."\n\nThey both looked at each other before shoving the metal crate over the edge they had reached, watching it fall hundreds of feet into the lava below. "Well, that takes care of that."\n\n"Takes care of what?" Both ponies jumped into the air as Pinkie Pie tilted her head at them. "Are you guys planning a party now that you got that heavy crate into the volcano? Can I join?"\n\nThe two soldiers of the Regency just stared dumbfounded before sighing, rubbing their eyes with a hoof. "Look, it's been a long day. Can't you just... jump into the volcano, or something?" one of them asked.\n\n"Oh, okay!" And so she did, much to their surprise.\n\nAnd that was the day they learned that party ponies don't survive in pools of burning lava."

 equestria_TNO_reference.26.t:0 "The Death of Loyalty"
 equestria_TNO_reference.26.d:0 "Another day, another group of traitors to dispose of.\n\nThe Southeast was a virulent hotbed of disorder and rebellion, with no end to the ponies that needed to be removed in service of the Regency. The communists of Baltimare, the remaining "true harmonists" of Stableside, and even the heathen thestrals who thought of the moon as a higher deity than Princess Luna herself. Such degenerates were easily dealt with by the loyal thestrals and natives, of course, but it was still irritating to Twilight.\n\nFortunately, something major had happened today. One of the heads of resistance, the once acclaimed writer A.K. Yearling, or Daring Do to the few that knew the truth had been captured, and sentenced for immediate execution. The Regent was personally overseeing it, watching the firing squad assemble before them. But just before giving the order to fire, something stopped her.\n\n"Stop it, Twilight!" Rainbow Dash said as she stood in front of the prisoners defiantly. The soldiers seemed unsure what to do; after all, the pegasi was an Element Bearer and a personal friend of the Regent. They all looked at Twilight for further instruction.\n\n"Get out of the way, Rainbow Dash," the Regent hissed, her limited patience quickly running thin. "They are traitors. You should know that as the Element of Loyalty."\n\n"Traitors to you, maybe! But these ponies are my friends, my real heroes! You've become somepony I don't even know anymore! And I'm not just going to sit by anymore and watch this happen!"\n\nTwilight rolled her eyes. She always did have a penchant for theatrics. She turned away, not even bothering to look back as she gave the order.\n\n"Fire.""

 equestria_TNO_reference.27.d:0 "Eliminating the Element Bearer of Kindness was proving more difficult than the Regent had thought it would be. Not becuase of any sort of intention on Fluttershy's part, of course; it was simply that nopony had the nerve to kill a pony like her. Every soldier she had asked for the task had refused, even under threat of death, and for this one specific moment the Regent could not blame them for their disloyalty. Not even she had what it took to dispose of a friend possessing such unconditional kindness.\n\n"Um, Twilight? You wanted to see me?" Fluttershy walked into the dark room, the door closing behind her. In her eyes was not the fear that most ponies had when seeing the Regent, but instead just her normal shy nature that was familiar to many. She had known the Regent for far too long to be afraid of her.\n\nTwilight nodded. "Fluttershy, you've been one of my closest friends for a long time. And I think that I just haven't given enough in return for all the kindness you gave me over the years."\n\n"Oh, I mean, I don't really need anything in return, it's just so nice to see everypony hap-"\n\n"I insist," Twilight pushed. "There was something I remember you wanted a long time ago, and I think it's finally time I give it to you. Just trust me, Fluttershy."\n\nThe mare seemed to think for a second before nodding. "Okay. I trust you, Twilight."\n\nMagic began to envelop the pegasus, swirling around her until the pony within it was completely obscured by the purple energies that surrounded it. Twilight's horn strained with the energy required, but she continued to push herself. After all, if she couldn't eliminate Fluttershy, there were... other ways to get rid of her. She would appreciate this, anyway.\n\nAnd when the room was finally cast into darkness once again, the latest tree to be placed into the Canterlot Gardens was standing before the Regent it once called a friend."

The labor quotas she had set, all reasonable numbers she had carefully calculated based on what the Regency needed, were not even close to being met. It was almost like they were intentionally falling behind them, with how little was being accomplished.\n\n"Would you care to explain why these numbers are so low?" Twilight asked the pony trembling before her, her voice icy.\n\n"W-well, it's been difficult keeping the ponies in line and motivated to work, Princess. There are rebellions every single day, and we are losing our own loyal soldiers keeping them pacified. It's impossible to meet your standards in these conditions..." The pony realized his mistake as soon as another hair sprung out of place in Twilight's mane, her eyes seeping back into the look of insanity.\n\nShe let out a small, terrifying laugh. "Impossible? Ponies told me things were impossible, and I still did them. Impossible is not an excuse." She leaned inwards, staring the stallion straight in the eyes. "The Regency needs those quotas filled. If you don't do that, then I will have to get somepony else to do it instead. Is that clear?"\n\nHe nodded. "Of course, my Regent." He quickly made to leave, but was stopped when Twilight asked one more question.\n\n"Oh, and what's this hat doing here?"\n\n"It was found on one of the dead. Her name was Applejack, and she apparently knew you. We thought it best to send it to you in case it was important."\n\nThe Regent tilted her head. "Who?""

It had been long, so long. And so much work had been done. But all of her calls for Celestia had still gone unanswered. She was still alone, in silence. Twilight didn't have the power to continue, to finish the task that seemed to stretch on longer and longer ahead of her.\n\nBut she soon would.\n\nThe Crystal Heart pulsed with power. Her Element of Magic glowed brightly on her head. Magic filled the air, saturating Twilight's very being as it swirled around her. She pulled harder, her horn pushed further and further to its limit as the magic taken from the artifacts twisted to suit her needs. It became dark, darker than the blackest sky, as it all flowed into her.\n\nPurple flames burned into clothes fit for an alicorn. Her wings unfurled, feathers wide. Her horn a neon blue, with a mask to fit. When the magic around her exploded and her hooves touched the ground once more, there was no Twilight Sparkle anymore.\n\nThere was only Midnight.\n\nShe tilted her head back and laughed as the Element of Magic fell to the ground, its usefulness come to an end. She had everything she wanted now. Limitless power, the potential to make this world bend to her whims. To make every world, no matter how far across time and space learn friendship. The very essence of magic itself was merely a pawn in her hooves now, and now, as the Eternal Regent, she could serve in the name of the Princesses like she never could before.\n\nNow, Midnight would have it all."

No one could dare question her authority now, and plans for the nations remaining in the world were already being drawn up. Midnight of course would personally lead the charge; she was invincible, immortal, all-powerful. It was by her will that creatures lived or died, from the largest of dragons to the smallest of breezies.\n\nBut her assistant, her loyal assistant all this time, was nowhere to be found! It grated on her in all the wrong ways. So much in fact, that she failed to notice the stack of papers left on the floor in front of her. And putting her hoof exactly in the wrong place, she tripped forward.\n\nMidnight gave a yelp, attempting to use her hooves or wings to catch herself, but it was too late. The staircase leading downwards in front of her gave no chance, and she tumbled down and down rolling faster and faster. And right before she hit the bottom, her head landed in front of her body just the wrong way, snapping her neck instantly.\n\nAnd with that Midnight Sparkle, the Eternal Regent of Equestria and most powerful creature in the world, was dead."

A country run down into despair, a nation broken beyond belief.\n\nCelestia frowned. "I don't believe Princess Twilight found our note."\n\n"I believe you are correct. Indeed, I can even sense that she and her friends have passed from this world." Luna looked at her sister with slight concern. "Who will be the Bearers of the Elements now?"\n\nThe elder Princess sighed. "I had thought this might happen one day. Do not worry, I have kept others beyond the mirror portal to act as replacements." She seemed to think to herself for a moment. "Though I suppose I will need to find something to replace that Twilight's glasses..."\n\n"And the ponies? What will they think of us, or her?"\n\nThe alicorn waved a hoof dismissively. "Ponies have short memories. I'm sure in a week or two, they'll forget all about this and move on." Celestia motioned with a wing to her sister. "Now come Luna, we still have much to do.

She had all these powers now at her disposal, new glasses fit for a Princess, attire that apparently her old counterpart used to wear. It still boggled her mind that there was another version of herself on the other side of a portal this whole time, without her even knowing it.\n\nFitting in as a Princess was difficult, though. There were always questions; 'why are you wearing glasses now?', 'why don't you know anything about magic?', 'why do all your friends use weird terms instead of everypony?'. There were so many questions that she and everyone else had, and yet Twilight could ask and answer none. The only solace she could have was her own personal research projects that Princess Celestia allowed her to undertake.\n\nSpeaking of which, her latest one was proving to be quite interesting. There were multiple magical anomalies all centering around one location, in Northern Zebrica. Celestia had forbidden her from traveling to do a study personally, but the devices she had built had picked up energy spikes, abnormal color radiation, unexplained images.\n\nAnd they all centered around the nation of Hippogriffia.\n\n"No doubt about it, Spike," she told her new dragon assistant.

Born in Princessyn amidst the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations of 985, Valery Stablein was only a child when his family pledged themselves to the service of Staliongrad's Winter Revolution and its legendary leader, the Marksist theorist Steel Stallion. Stablein grew up dreaming of Stallion and of the revolution, but when he arrived as a commissar under the command of Stalliongrad's army of the proletariat, the young threstral found only disappointment. Stablein dreamed of a true pan-Equestrian revolution, a foolish hope of unity, strength, and a socialist magic of friendship to all ponies no matter their tribe, but Stalliongrad, he knew, would never be the place for it.\n\nTraveling south from that degenerated workers' state, Stablein found a place for himself within the thestral rights movement. Bat ponies, from Manhehattan to Tenochtitlan to the sunny shores of Coltfoalnia, could only find their rights in the form of a mass popular movement, a revolutionary vanguard that neither Princess Luna or Nightmare Moon could ever provide. When the dam broke and the Princesses and their despotism departed Equestria at last, Stablein stormed a radio tower in Detrot and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. He expected none but the most faithful of his revolutionary thestral movement to listen, but they did. Stallions and mares flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, the colts and the fillies.

 EQS_UESR_anger_desc:0 "The thestrals are an important part of our revolution like any other tribe, fighting for the cause the same as anypony else. But, with their unique history, they have felt the effects of the diarchy's fall much differently. It is not just a new Equestria for them, it is the chance to strike back for years of injustice done upon them."
 
 EQS_UESR_justice:0 "A Plea for Justice"
 EQS_UESR_justice_desc:0 "This is no longer just about bringing a better future, it is about saving it from certain doom.

 EQS_UESR_kill_unicorn_desc:0 "The Unicornian Sisterhood is yet another great threat to us, wishing unicorn dominance over all of Equestria over the other tribes. Firmly entrenched in the far west, they will not fall easily, or without a fight. But their belief in one tribe above all will be their downfall, as the unity of four prevails over any one pony!"

 EQS_UESR_tea_time_with_the_industrial_barons_desc:0 "The Unicornian Sisterhood has fallen, and its members have scattered to the wind. We do not even need to deal with them in any real shape or form; what we do need to worry about now is the industrialists. The rich upper class, which so far remains opposed to our revolution and the people. Valery Stablein will meet with them personally to convince them otherwise."

 EQS_UESR_theory_reading_classes:0 "Bordiclaw's Theory Reading Classes"
 EQS_UESR_theory_reading_classes_desc:0 "Though Equestria's dated educational programs have been shut down, the desire to learn still exists within many ponies. Fortunately, we have just the right idea on how to tackle this issue: Armchairs and public discussion groups! (But mostly armchairs!)"

 uesr_TNO_reference.1.t:0 "A Wholesome Visitor"
 uesr_TNO_reference.1.d:0 "From a place some claim is a land far beyond Equestria, a new figure has come to aid the revolution. A large bunny rabbit, he demanded to see our leader Stablein immediately, where he explained that he was one of the 275 siblings of the famous Angel Bunny, the pet of the Element Bearer of Kindness Fluttershy. However, while Angel Bunny was a mere plebian bunny, this rabbit who simply calls himself "Chungus" maintains that he is a revolutionary at heart, and has pledged his services to the Stableinite revolution to save Equestria and its ponies. While some still find his appearence or general presence disturbing, we have given him a place on our general staff to help lead our forces to victory."
 uesr_TNO_reference.1.a:0 "Welcome to the revolution, kind stranger!"
 
 uesr_TNO_reference.2.t:0 "A Stallion In Over His Head"
 uesr_TNO_reference.2.d:0 "When Valery Stablein first broadcast his message from that one radio tower in Detrot, he never expected anything massive to occur. His intent was simply to create a regional movement to pressure the Equestrian government towards the plight of his kind, to help being it slowly closer towards true communism. And yet, here he is, the leader of a full revolution against the Princess, warlords and all who were against his dream. And while he is eternally grateful to the ponies for putting their trust in him, leadership does not come easy.\n\nThe enemies of the revolution will not go down without a fight. The soldiers need a strong leader, and Stablein must be that thestral for the task. It is up to him now to take the charge and usher in a new age for Equestria, whether he was ready or not. And no matter how hard the task may be, he, like so many behind him is ready to give it all for the dream."
 uesr_TNO_reference.2.a:0 "I never expected to get THIS far..."
 
 uesr_TNO_reference.3.t:0 "A People Without Their Princess"
 uesr_TNO_reference.3.d:0 "The thestral tribe is, through the very existence of its history intertwined with that of the Moon and by extension Princess Luna. Without her, many have fallen into a state of peronal chaos. Their faith has been shattered, and they need somepony else to look to for guidance. And while Stablein is willing to be that pony, to a certain extent, that willingness to follow does not come without its consequences.\n\nThe anger and resentment towards the other tribes has culminated in many requests made personally to Stablein to officially make the revolution a bat pony-led movement, made by and for the thestral race. Their regard for his leadership unfortunately stems less from loyalty to the revolution and more towards Valery being of their own race instead of a unicorn or pegasus. These thoughts are antithetical to the principles of the Revolution we are fighting for even as this goes on, but there is little we can do to convince them at the moment to fight the enemies we all share instead of our own comrades."
 uesr_TNO_reference.3.a:0 "By the moon, direct your rage towards the reactionaries instead!"
 
 uesr_TNO_reference.4.t:0 "All Manner of Equestrians"
 uesr_TNO_reference.4.d:0 "Equestria is no longer the place it once was. The mere existence of our cause proves that, but it is more than just us that has changed. The common ponies know what is happening, they have heard the rumors. Twilight's state of insanity, the unicorns consolidating power, the false pretender monarch. Tyrannical regimes are becoming the norm, and with them Equestrians from all over flock and flee to what we have created.\n\nOf course, not all of them are strictly revolutionaries. Many are simple Harmonists, ones who see us as misguided and foolish in fighting against the institution of the Princesses themselves. Others are pragmatists and nihilists, believing that we are too idealistic and our vision too wide and utopian for reality. We may not see eye to eye, but all of us can yet still come together in friendship believing that what we bring is the only way forward. We are all united, as one force of freedom against the evil that has taken root in the once great capital of Equestria. and beyond."

 uesr_TNO_reference.5.t:0 "Knocking Heads Together"
 uesr_TNO_reference.5.d:0 "The communists of Baltimare were a very dynamic and wide group, that much was certain from a first glance. Everything from full-blown anarchists to hardline statists were present, which at first seemed like a good example of left unity. However, closer inspection clearly showed that factionalism was rife within, and that included the topic of our great Stablein's revolution.\n\nGolden Delicious and the anarchist delegates were at first more than willing to join our revolution, but things went south when Valery mentioned his distaste towards their continued racism against the thestrals. Golden had to restrain the anarchists from discussing 'inherent reactionaries' and keeping things civil.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the statists such as Lavender Berry and Cricket Chafer are willing to work with us, but have absolutely no interest in joining our idealistic cause. They have both repeatedly stated that such a utopian ideal is simply impossible, and that we are doomed to fail on the path we are pursuing. A lot of work is going to be necessary if we're going to get these ponies in line, but we have no choice if we want socialism to survive in the Southeast, for without the help of the Baltimarians the dream may end before it even begins." # TO DO, sablin attempts to get all the leaders and factions of baltimare to join up with him, CAN / TER agrees but Stablein is angry they still follow racism against bats, meanwhile Chafer and Berry want nothing to do with such a utopian, baltimare factions debate with eachother as Stablein tries to bring them in line

Once, many considered them mutually exclusive with Harmony, that they existed in opposition and as part of class warfare. But these were lies, falsehoods created by the dictators and paranoid alike. The truth is that they are one and the same.\n\nSuch thought has always been at the forefront of Valery Stablein's mind, but it has been confirmed with the arrival of a single pony, one named Nikolai Buckharin. He claims to be from a place called Russia, one with a revolution that rose and fell to a menace he does not speak of. However, what he does speak of is the connection between friendship, socialism and magic, believe that harmony and Equestria can be restored using socialist theory. The Elements of Harmony as our guide, just because our path is different does not mean we do not wish the same things that the Princesses before us did.\n\nSo now, it is time to put words into practice. Already our ponies seem happier, more willing to cooperate with each other. Recognition is slowly rising internally and beyond as the true Equestrian government and successor, and perhaps when this war is finally over we can prove to the world that friendship truly is socialist magic!"

A small army, perhaps not enough to win this war alone, but still a force of devoted ponies-turned-revolutionaries who serve as the focal point of the nation.\n\nAlready they are filling in the gaps from the ponies who have sadly fallen in service of the union, and we have no doubt that with this fresh wave victory against Twilight and her fanatical followers will soon follow.

It seems like quite the one-sided deal for us."\n\nValery took a deep breath before beginning. "You see, this revolution is by the ponies and for the ponies of Equestria, and that includes you.

But when he had personally explained why he was doing what he was, and what was actually going to happen, Applejack had found herself agreeing more and more with him.\n\nIt wasn't the destruction of the farm, it was just new ownership. Applejack had been so busy worrying about the farm and her own family that she had never realized how that affected everypony else. The stranglehold they had gained as an apple oligarchy was harming innocent ponies, just like many other southern monopolies that had to be removed. So in the end, she had been more than willing to allow her farm to be opened up to workers of all ages, turning it into a commune for anypony to gather to.\n\n"And so...

Perhaps they'd made a few mistakes here and there, but those actions had brought him and his friends to where they were now.\n\nValery looked around himself. Beside him was Nikolai Buckharin, who wistfully looked up at the night sky. On his other side was Starlight Glimmer, who hadn't taken her eyes off of him since they sat down. Behind him were Comrades Chungus and Knuckles, who seemed to be playing some sort of children's game with the digits on the ends of their limbs. Dust Hoover seemed absorbed in a toy boat he was holding. Golden Delicious sat smiling with his eyes closed, his hat on the ground next to him. The stalwart Floppa was as stoic as ever, though Valery could have sworn that the feline smiled at him. Maud Pie held her beloved pet Boulder as her sister Limestone struggled to maintain her usual grumpy expression. Lavender Berry, though usually aloof and antisocial, actually agreed to join Valery in this outing, surprising everypony.\n\nSuddenly, a flash could be seen over Canterlot in the distance.

He looked over to see Starlight, who had also begun to shed tears. Of all the friends Valery had made, she was his favorite.

Being a resident of the Town of Friendship, she had occasional run-ins with the Element Bearers. Seeing Princess Twilight's descent into madness saddened her more than anything had in her life.\n\nWhen Princess Twilight went mad with power and seized control over Equestria. She fled Ponyville to the city of Baltimare, where she then discovered the Poets of Equestria and the Equinist Association, a secret society of ponies in the Southwest believing in a fringe socialist ideology, some call Utopian Socialism. Though Octavia wasn't one to dabble in politics, the Equnist Association truly picqued her interest, seeing them as the only way that she could bring Equestria back to Harmony. It was there where she inexplicably rose through the ranks of the Equinist Association and became its leader. And when the Southwest fell into anarchym it was she and her Equinist Association that asserted power, declaring the Equinist Republic of Equestria.\n\nNow known to her country as Shostavia, her composer alias, she promises that she and the Equinist Association will lead Equestria to a new age of Harmony once the North has been reconquered, and bring back friendship to the torn lands of Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

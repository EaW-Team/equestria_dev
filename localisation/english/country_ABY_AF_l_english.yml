### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 ABY_AF_kaiser_kattail:0 "Kaiser Kattail"
 ABY_AF_kaiser_kattail_desc:0 "Kaiser Kattail is the supreme, mostly-undisputed ruler of the infamous Katzenartig Imperium. Charismatic and mysterious, yet markedly goofy at times, Kattail is known for his utterly insane megalomaniac tendencies that drive him to seek the ultimately unattainable goal of conquering all that exists.\n\nRegardless of the fundamental impossibility of this lofty scheme, he is nonetheless unwilling to give up on attempting to achieve universal conquest, something which he has done countless times before thanks to his ability to travel to future Universal Cycles, essentially granting him near-unlimited attempts. Thus, most of his supposed genius and competence is simply the result of brute-force trial and error.\n\nDespite his imperialistic tendencies, Kattail vehemently believes that all species must be treated equally, and can thus be described as a sort of semi-benevolent despot who does genuinely wish to improve the lives of his subjects. However, while he attempts to enforce equality between all citizens of his empire, regardless of their origin, dissent is nevertheless cracked down upon, and local cultures tend to be erased or amalgamated into Katzen culture whenever possible.\n\nIt is thus difficult to define whether Kattail is villainous or benevolent, as while his empire tries to provide good living conditions to every single of its citizens, things can quickly take a turn for the worse should his empire find itself on the back foot militarily, with forced conscription and harsh crackdowns becoming the norm in a desperate attempt to keep the empire alive.\n\n§4For more information pertaining to Kaiser Kattail, check out his Wiki Page on the Gigastructural Engineering Lore Database website!§!"

## COSMETIC TAGS ###

ABY_AF_earlygame_cosmetic:0 "Katzennia"

### FOCUS ### 

 ABY_AF_this_isnt_flusion:0 "This Isn't Flusion..."
 ABY_AF_this_isnt_flusion_desc:0 "Wherever this is, it isn't Flusion. Everything is strange, different and odd. Perhaps this is a chance to start afresh, with ripe clay for moulding."
 ABY_AF_but_their_technology:0 "...But their Technology..."
 ABY_AF_but_their_technology_desc:0 "Whilst the felines here do not have the technological might of Flusion, it is at least sufficient for the Kaiser to guide them and to begin a fresh conquest on unspoiled land."
 ABY_AF_and_their_powers:0 "...And Their Powers..." #Comma
 ABY_AF_and_their_powers_desc:0 "Something odd here sets this world far apart from Flusion. By all known laws of physics, what passes for normal here should not be possible. Instead of raging at the inconsistency of it all, though, Kattail can see the use of all this new... stuff. Magic, they call it."
 ABY_AF_are_worth_taking_over:0 "...Are Worth Taking Over!" #Comma
 ABY_AF_are_worth_taking_over_desc:0 "Abyssinia may just be the springboard the Kaiser needs for the path ahead: a species that look just like him, political turmoil not too dissimilar from Flusion's, and a population who clearly has no experience with someone who can play them like a fiddle (for Kattail has done so millions of times)."
 ABY_AF_kiloforges:0 "Build Kiloforges"
 ABY_AF_kiloforges_desc:0 "With a sprinkling of Katzen know-how and a hefty dose of Katzen industrial might, things will start to get interesting. Establishing of Kiloforges will help pump out the machinery of war for the Kaiser's plans."
 ABY_AF_kiloforges_tt:0 "New §YManufacturers§! or §YMIOs§! will be available."
 ABY_AF_the_trains_run_on_time:0 ""The Trains Run on Time""
 ABY_AF_the_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "In a long-forgotten cycle, a bunch of pizza-eaters revered this Beakolini-sound-alike figure who allegedly made the trains run on time. (Unrelated to that: the Kaiser orbital-bombarded them into submission) Still, everything working smoothly will be a miraculous turn-around for these battered kats."
 ABY_AF_the_sieger_project:0 "Projekt 1: Towards the Riesieger"
 ABY_AF_the_sieger_project_desc:0 "The pitiable hunks of metal that pass for "armour" here will be a thing of the past. It may be too early to think of space-faring behemoths powered by entire solar systems, but the Kaiser's know-how can produce the next best thing with limited resources: a tank that screams "overlord.""
 ABY_AF_establish_production_lines:0 "Establish Foundries"
 ABY_AF_establish_production_lines_desc:0 "Whilst they may not be Kiloforges, a serious effort should be made to rip out surplus buildings and turn it into manufacturing forges. This will help alleviate some of the production demand."
 ABY_AF_project_two_the_tractor:0 "Projekt 2: The Katzen-Kampfpanzer"
 ABY_AF_project_two_the_tractor_desc:0 "Close your eyes and imagine the thunder of wheels across these dunes. Behold an entire country blessed with the power of wheels. Every kat, a trucker—and they better be, if they are to keep up the pace."
 ABY_AF_every_kat_must_do_their_duty:0 "Every Kat Must Do Their Duty" 
 ABY_AF_every_kat_must_do_their_duty_desc:0 "In Kattail's many cycles, he has found that many civilizations do not effectively use their populations in wartime. Why limit the fighting to just the adults? The more Kats in the military, the better. A bullet is deadly no matter who fires it and every able-bodied katzen who contributes to the war effort is essential."
 ABY_AF_the_mark_in_your_pocket:0 "The Mark in Your Pocket"
 ABY_AF_the_mark_in_your_pocket_desc:0 "Cities and villages alike will flood with money, both a promise of inconceivable prosperity and a sweetener to make the bitter reality of war go down once we walk into the rest of the world uninvited... and if they're worried about spending too much, the Kaiser's smile graces each coin, blessing every transaction."
 ABY_AF_katnological_marvels:0 "Katnological Marvels"
 ABY_AF_katnological_marvels_desc:0 "For Katzens nationwide, it is time to break the chains of ignorance. The Kaiser's great intellect has already shown, with primitive materials, what can be possible. Let's be optimists and discover what boundaries we can break when we innovate together."
 ABY_AF_thunderstorm_and_lightning:0 "Thunderstorm and Lightning"
 ABY_AF_thunderstorm_and_lightning_desc:0 "Whip everyone into a fervour! Frenzy, battle, fighting! A few speeches and some witty repartee will be more than enough to stoke the fires of conquest in the Kaiser's name."
 ABY_AF_very_very_frightening:0 "Very Very Frightening"
 ABY_AF_very_very_frightening_desc:0 "With catlike tread, our agents steal into the night, venting into foreign offices and snooping in on emergency meetings. Pretty soon, we'll have sleeper felines (and sleepy felines) embedded in every one of our neighbours, and they shall face the terror that is an agency's freakishly unpronounceable name."
 ABY_AF_i_have_a_dream:0 "I Have a Dream"
 ABY_AF_i_have_a_dream_desc:0 "The Abyssinia of old was limited by its lack of ambition. Every feline monarch in the past would've said "Impossible!" at the mere idea of a single continent under their rule. Kattail is the first to say never to never as his Katzens march to prove their ancestors wrong."
 ABY_AF_the_end_of_all:0 "The End of All Things"
 ABY_AF_the_end_of_all_desc:0 "The brilliant chessmaster that is Kaiser Kattail is at his best brooding over the next step to greatness. A cantankerous few might say it should be an easy stomp-fest, but Kattail has decades, centuries, possibly even millenniums of experience to back up his striving for that one fool-proof offensive."
 ABY_AF_new_world_old_acquaintances:0 "New World, Old Acquaintances"
 ABY_AF_new_world_old_acquaintances_desc:0 "In nearly every iteration of Flusion, several friendly faces have popped up like universal constants in the Kaiser's rise to power. Although this Cycle seems highly irregular, those good old allies of his shall arrive to seize the day!... even if they just need some reminding about who they are."
 ABY_AF_let_loose_the_cries_of_war:0 "Let Loose the Cries of War" 
 ABY_AF_let_loose_the_cries_of_war_desc:0 "We must not count days, we must not count miles, for we must count only the territories we gain and the numbers we stack against those who stand in our way. We must let loose the propaganda machine and push onward to victories waiting for us!"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sea:0 "Towards the Sea" 
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sea_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves strong on land. Yet, we cannot hope to win further victories and gain more land if we cannot sail across the seas and oceans. Our sights must now turn to the lands beyond the shores of Zebrica."
 ABY_AF_exploit_the_oil:0 "Exploit the Oil" 
 ABY_AF_exploit_the_oil_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of our new empire. If we wish to survive, then we must not waste the expertise of our citizens for nothing. Surveys and proper funding for oil extraction and processing must begin very soon."
 ABY_AF_modernized_work_programmes:0 "Modernized Work Programmes" 
 ABY_AF_modernized_work_programmes_desc:0 "While it is nice to put our backs into our labor, it certainly would be nicer if we could invest in the equipment of our workforce and ensure that the projects we have are not backwards in thinking. Innovation, investments, and improvements should be the order of the day."
 ABY_AF_trade_with_the_worlds:0 "Integration of the Worthy" 
 ABY_AF_trade_with_the_worlds_desc:0 "While we certainly can have some use for the cultures that we've absorbed through our conquests, it is vital that we carefully consider which of these are worthy of greater things. Integrating the more loyal and skilled creatures would mean a much easier process of establishing our control and legitimacy over any new territories we have gained so far."
 ABY_AF_crack_the_lines:0 "Crack the Lines"
 ABY_AF_crack_the_lines_desc:0 "The feline body is not suited for the lightning war required to conquer the world. Luckily, Kattail knows of a certain crystal substance that may help. But using these crystals for defense is not something we can commit to all the time. We can't afford to put our troops through lengthy sieges or fancy maneuver operations. Our katzen must punch through the enemy lines and bite hard."
 ABY_AF_march_on_mages:0 "March on the Magocracy"
 ABY_AF_march_on_mages_desc:0 "This Maretania has the tools and artefacts needed to better utilise (or profane) this world's magic. Their whole gimmick of confining these entities away just won't do for eager conquerors: Putting them on the field will give them results far more accurate than any peer-reviewed study can produce. To that end, we must push our way toward their well-guarded caverns, no matter the cost."
 ABY_AF_project_three_claw_steel:0 "Projekt 3: Supertensile Blast Plates"
 ABY_AF_project_three_claw_steel_desc:0 "The old tanks were stop-gap measures. Some more Katzen know-how will make true machines of war! Afterall, there is no such thing as a tank that's too big."
 ABY_AF_the_vaults_are_open:0 "The Vaults are Open"
 ABY_AF_the_vaults_are_open_desc:0 "We might've breached containment a bit too much, given that we still need to look for where these artefacts are. Still, we've gathered that what these mages have been studying were of Aeternite origin, so no time to waste!"
 ABY_AF_enlighten_them:0 "Enlighten Them"
 ABY_AF_enlighten_them_desc:0 "The Kaiser pierces through the abyss of ignorance like a lantern. The blessings of his reign penetrates many minds, and they've borne further fruit: reading, available to all at your nearest public library!"
 ABY_AF_clock_is_ticking_kattail:0 "Clock is Ticking, Kattail!"
 ABY_AF_clock_is_ticking_kattail_desc:0 "Running an empire is like riding a bike, wherein momentum keeps you, well, moving. That, or some public vehicle rigged to explode if you go lower than a certain speed. Either way, such hyper-militarization does not come for free: the empire's maw must grow, lest it collapse under its sheer obesity."
 ABY_AF_victory_parades:0 "Victory Parades"
 ABY_AF_victory_parades_desc:0 "In a matter of months, we've accomplished what few, if any, have done. These cats, who've had nothing to aspire to before we arrived, have experienced joy after joy, achievement after achievement. Making official these celebrations will keep their thoughts away from the gargantuan need for yet more..."
 ABY_AF_katzenfication_take_one:0 "Begin Katzenfication Protocols"
 ABY_AF_katzenfication_take_one_desc:0 "We are not club-wielding brutes, despite our rivals' slander. The Katzens' long history with and admiration for war has turned the affair into a rejuvenating, civilising force... a zeitgeist this planet's cats (and otherwise) are not used to yet but will happily adopt. When the Imperium strings along victory after victory, everyone will want to be a Katzen!"
 ABY_AF_the_zebtropa_plan:0 "The Zebtropa Plan"
 ABY_AF_the_zebtropa_plan_desc:0 "It's a few centuries too early for water cities, so let's settle for second-best: a dam to drain the Arabian Sea and reveal new lands for settlement and industry. A massive diplomatic power play, to be sure, though the details are rather top secret."
 ABY_AF_a_grand_gesture:0 "A Grand Gesture"
 ABY_AF_a_grand_gesture_desc:0 "From sea to shining sea? Not exactly, but the Kaiser has done a great deal in such short time. This world's power blocs will surely realise that the Katzens are here to stay. They will surely send their best to stop us. To that, we say:\n\nBring it."
 ABY_AF_continental_ambitions:0 "Continental Ambitions"
 ABY_AF_continental_ambitions_desc:0 "An empire's first obstacle is distance, the bane of every ruler's desires, from levying armies to nabbing taxes. Roads and rail may be kindergarten to the Kaiser, but he knows their necessity in cementing the Imperium's gains."
 ABY_AF_along_the_sea:0 "Along the Sea"
 ABY_AF_along_the_sea_desc:0 "From the Zarantian dunes where spices and other exotics flow to the suspiciously similar pyramids of the suspiciously named Maregypt, there is a lot of valuable coastland (that isn't desert). They're ripe to be the staging of more serious campaigns."
 ABY_AF_the_capable_hippogriffs:0 "The Capable Hippogriffs"
 ABY_AF_the_capable_hippogriffs_desc:0 "Across the strait lies the proud islands of Hippogriffia, whose natives pose a real threat of combined naval and aerial operations by virtue of shapeshifting from winged creatures into seahorses. However, any challenge is a good challenge, and soon, they'll collectively transform from independant into subservient."
 ABY_AF_the_road_ahead:0 "The Road Ahead"
 ABY_AF_the_road_ahead_desc:0 "What stands between the Imperium and the other two landmasses with their envious eyes are the seas. These deep waters will inevitably be our bridge to the rest of the planet, though before we can mount a magnanimous landing force, we require the fleet to match. Let's re-orient several city-wide factory districts this way..."
 ABY_AF_cleaning_up_stragglers:0 "Cleaning up Stragglers"
 ABY_AF_cleaning_up_stragglers_desc:0 "North-east Zebrica is nearly ours. There is but one civilisation left to challenge: Colthage, a (probably) not-so-stable republic with quite the corrupt and nepotist recent history. Whatever ails it now, the future cadaver of Zonicia's pride will make for a fine souvenir."
 ABY_AF_the_queen_over_the_water:0 "The Queen over the Water"
 ABY_AF_the_queen_over_the_water_desc:0 "Without fear or apology, the Katzen Navy shall stand supreme. The beaked fish people across the channels will receive our heavily armed courtesy calls. They can either submerge themselves into their graves or surrender to keep their aquatic homes intact."
 ABY_AF_downfall:0 "Downfall"
 ABY_AF_downfall_desc:0 "The fickle shapeshifters have continued to evade us, but while the local Katzen might not've had much experience fighting them, the Kaiser's wisdom knows no bounds. If it's a slog they want, it's a slog they'll get. Those sapient flying seafoods will purchase each day of survival with costly pounds of flesh."
 ABY_AF_cracking_open_the_mountain:0 "Cracking Open the Mountain"
 ABY_AF_cracking_open_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mount Aris has fallen, and millions must submit. For a country that has only recently recovered from battling the Storm King, they went mad with prosperity. A sizeable minority even wanted to leave the world alone, such isolating debauchery. They and their wealth will not be spared from the Katzen war machine."
 ABY_AF_a_curious_specimen:0 "A Curious Specimen"
 ABY_AF_a_curious_specimen_desc:0 "From the ashes of Hippogriffia, a peculiar seapony has made herself known to us. This "Posada" has quickly established herself as no mere socialist, with ideas verging on the whimsical. Then again, the Kaiser himself would be called whimsical if he were to speak of all he's seen in his life. Posada may have her uses, then."
 ABY_AF_a_curious_proposal:0 "A Curious Proposal"
 ABY_AF_a_curious_proposal_desc:0 "Blueprints and schematics galore spill from Posada's brain. Kattail has seen them in so many Cycles before, but not so many for the quadruped or the fishy form. Plus, this seapony does want to study our advanced machines to satiate her fascination with the future. Let's give her something extra for her time."
 ABY_AF_floating_fortresses:0 "Floating Fortresses"
 ABY_AF_floating_fortresses_desc:0 "Our diplomacy is of the gunboat variety, and it's about time we take that seriously. Across the three continents, dreadnoughts and destroyers of diverse countries will bow to the true titans of the sea, hulking with hideous strength. They may even spread rumours that they're a kilometre long!"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sky:0 "Towards the Sky"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sky_desc:0 "Way down south in the land of raiders, former slaves, and Storm King traitors, we ride away to a writhing mass of laker. Scarred by the yetis' warpath, they'll be a nice sideshow for our itchy paws."
 ABY_AF_the_inventive_yetis:0 "The Inventive Yetis"
 ABY_AF_the_inventive_yetis_desc:0 "Much of the world is composed of quadruped creatures, so a species with opposable thumbs poses problems. Or they would've if we were not bipedal thumb-users ourselves. The weapons and vehicles they've left behind for the poor zebras to use don't have to be refit to our forms, for one."
 ABY_AF_through_the_mountains:0 "Through the Mountains"
 ABY_AF_through_the_mountains_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes barely have had time to unshackle themselves from the yeti yoke to fend themselves against the terrors in the sky. Their antiquated scrap metal on wings will fall to our highly coordinated swarms. The zebras will have no time to breathe."
 ABY_AF_the_path_beyond:0 "The Path Beyond"
 ABY_AF_the_path_beyond_desc:0 "Entire regions can be iterated and re-iterated upon, made incredibly efficient. The Imperium does not yet have the technology to convert the entire planet into a giant manufacturing centre, but we've captured enough land to sow the seeds for that outcome."
 ABY_AF_march_straight_onwards:0 "March Straight Onwards" #Comma
 ABY_AF_march_straight_onwards_desc:0 "From great lakes to inclement weather, we've entered the yeti heartland. Treacherous mountains and inhospitable storms make for less than ideal conditions, but Kattail has mastered terrain far above the troposphere. Tacking on "storm" into their names will yield the yetis and their thralls nothing."
 ABY_AF_ten_minutes_of_revenge:0 "Ten Minutes of Revenge" #Comma
 ABY_AF_ten_minutes_of_revenge_desc:0 "Call revanchism for what it is, but what once was Abyssinia has clawed its way to the Storm King's homeland. Only humiliation is what the worst of these despoilers deserve, while the rest will have their geniuses harnessed. Our proud felines will get the justice they need, starting with a few... renovations."
 ABY_AF_the_flying_fortress:0 "The Flying Fortress"
 ABY_AF_the_flying_fortress_desc:0 "Whilst the stars may elude Katzen-kind here, that does not mean that we cannot metaphorically stretch our wings and wreak havoc from the skies once more. Massive payloads of crippling, destructive bombs will help pave the way."
 ABY_AF_applied_avionics:0 "Applied Avionics"
 ABY_AF_applied_avionics_desc:0 "The Kaiser has put great emphasis on technological advancement for all Katzen, and the notion of detection electronics will give a suitable edge - as well as protecting our airforce."
 ABY_AF_flying_carriers:0 "Armored Airships" #Nila
 ABY_AF_flying_carriers_desc:0 "Aerial supremacy alone is not enough. Although we may have outstanding planes, we must also make use of airships. Though the Storm King may have used them during his time, it shall be we who change this. Our engineers shall do their best to make finely armored airships worthy of giving us aerial domination!"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sturmer:0 "Towards the Sturmer"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sturmer_desc:0 "Great powerful guns and rolling thunder will, in unison, deliver a one-two punch of demoralising and destructive might to the foes of all katzen. If the Kaiser wills it, so must it be. Advanced blueprints have been drawn for a new weapon of war - The Sturmer."
 ABY_AF_nuclear_is_always_an_option:0 "Nuclear is ALWAYS an Option"
 ABY_AF_nuclear_is_always_an_option_desc:0 "The Kaiser's keen intellect and knowledge of advanced katzen technology means that there can be a significant jump in power generation - and weaponisation. His insights into technology previously thought beyond us will give us great assistance in the wars to come."
 ABY_AF_onwards_to_glory:0 "Onwards to Glory" #Comma
 ABY_AF_onwards_to_glory_desc:0 "We are not meant to uphold the Imperium alone. The funky-looking horses have it right when they say that friendship is magic: only together can we journey into something greater than ourselves. That's something our oldest friends need a good reminding of, no?"
 ABY_AF_gigastructural_engineering:0 "Gigastructural Engineering" #Comma
 ABY_AF_gigastructural_engineering_desc:0 "This world is rather small-minded, wowed by rolling tanks and airplanes when these metal contraptions will be mere ants crunched by the treads and thrusters of what Kattail will see and build. The sheer scale of what once was, will be."
 ABY_AF_project_zebtropa:0 "Project Zebtropa" #Comma
 ABY_AF_project_zebtropa_desc:0 "A dam to drain the Arabian Sea will indeed be a miracle of modern engineering with which to bless the rains down the dunes of the Zebhara and to reward the pioneers among us in settling new lands. This will still take considerable time to accomplish, but with an entire empire backing up the enterprise, what is there to worry about?"
 ABY_AF_project_grunwuste:0 "Project Grunwuste"
 ABY_AF_project_grunwuste_desc:0 "" #Comma
 ABY_AF_project_atominseln:0 "Project Atominseln"
 ABY_AF_project_atominseln_desc:0 "A triangle of islands serve as the crossroads between the three continents. Kattail isn't exactly content to leave them untapped: they're the perfect foundation for a new age of shipbuilding. Why tack a dockyard on a shore when you can make an entire isles efficient scores of naval assembly plants?" #Comma
 ABY_AF_project_grossatom:0 "Project Grossatom"
 ABY_AF_project_grossatom_desc:0 "The anomalous weather that engulf the yetis' home island in eternal thunder can't be all bad. Such abundant lightning can be redirected to heat up water in nuclear reactors, fast-tracking the whole power-generation process. In laycat's words: more nukes! " #Comma
 ABY_AF_we_need_more_i_need_more:0 "We Need More, I Need More" #Comma
 ABY_AF_we_need_more_i_need_more_desc:0 "Maybe it's the world itself that is too miniscule to contain Kattail's machinations. Current-year technology can only do so much. It is up to the Imperium to drag everyone into the future with all its potential unlocked... kicking and screaming."
 ABY_AF_what_are_we_going_to_do_now:0 "What Are We Going To Do Now?" #Comma
 ABY_AF_what_are_we_going_to_do_now_desc:0 "In the galactic age, protecting one's self against planes faded when a massive spaceship can smoke a whole planet. Still, this world isn't there yet... but this is the last hole in defence Kattail can patch up. After this, the Imperium will be air-tight."
 ABY_AF_what_i_do_every_cycle:0 "What I Do Every Cycle" #Comma
 ABY_AF_what_i_do_every_cycle_desc:0 "There's always room for more tanks, particularly of the very large variety. With these new designs, the Katzens wouldn't even need high-level tactics to steamroll through the continents... which raises a good question: Do they need them anymore? Does Kattail need them anymore?"
 ABY_AF_try_and_take_over_the_world:0 "Try and Take Over the World" #Comma
 ABY_AF_try_and_take_over_the_world_desc:0 "The kats of this planet have been chosen to disengage with every idea that will hinder their ascension, all under Kattail's wisdom.

 ABY_AF_the_kattown_pyramid:0 "The Katown Pyramid" #Comma
 ABY_AF_the_kattown_pyramid_desc:0 "Under this sky, the Imperium sets out on a course to enforce peace under one futuristic banner. This grand campaign must then require a grand beginning: inaugurating a kilometre-high pyramid to serve as the nexus of Katzen high command."
 ABY_AF_the_kattown_pyramid_tt:0 "We will be able to construct the §OKatown Pyramid§!, a grand command center to serve as the beating heart of our ever-growing empire."
 ABY_AF_war_plan_equus:0 "War Plan Equus" 
 ABY_AF_war_plan_equus_desc:0 "The continent of Equus is not only one of the greater landmasses of this world, but also one of its best. Great amounts of untapped potential awaits us there. Thus, we must prepare to unleash our armies against the creatures there so we can defeat them and utilize their populations as well as exploit the very resources we seek."
 ABY_AF_making_landfall:0 "Making Landfall" 
 ABY_AF_making_landfall_desc:0 "We have made it upon Equus! That alone is an achievement worthy of boasting about, but we must not be so carefree. Now that we have established ourselves here, we must immediately secure additional beachheads for our supply lines. Onward, katzens!"

 ABY_AF_a_hop_and_a_skip_desc:0 "To bridge the gap between our invading forces and new continents and landmasses, plans have been drawn up for a new elite corps of katzen soldier, one able to dismount from the sea and advance onto enemy held terrain under fire."
 ABY_AF_taming_the_dragons:0 "Taming the Dragons"
 ABY_AF_taming_the_dragons_desc:0 "Dragons hold themselves rulers over the Badlands on Equus and upon their home island off the southern coast. Seizing the island would mean much to our forces, easing our entry into Equus. To do that, of course, we must deal with the inhabitants as thoroughly as possible. We'll have to clear the skies."
 ABY_AF_into_the_desert:0 "Into the Desert"
 ABY_AF_into_the_desert_desc:0 "We have already tamed the dragons and secured more of our conquered territory. However, there is still work to be done. We are to advance into the desert, to finish off the rest of our enemies in southern Equus."

 ABY_AF_the_relentless_drive_desc:0 "Rapid conquest necessitates that we actually expand, well, rapidly! From the highest general to the average katzen soldier, all must push on with regard only for the acquisition of territory in the quickest manner possible."

 ABY_AF_better_than_chrysalis_desc:0 "We want to prove ourselves worthy of being the new masters of this land, and if we wish to gain the loyalty of the changelings, then we must show them that we are much better than their tyrannical queen, Chrysalis. We aren't interested in imitating her."

 ABY_AF_a_night_in_canterlot_desc:0 "We've come so far, finally vanquishing Equestria and making the ponies submit to our rule. Now, we must do something about their former capital. While Canterlot is certainly beautiful, that damned magical forest is to be dealt with."

 ABY_AF_projekt_sondersteinwerke_desc:0 "The territories of the Crystal Empire are chock full of their magical namesakes, but primitives here waste time and strength by mining and hauling this precious resource away.

 ABY_AF_projekt_uberreaktor:0 "Projekt Uberreaktor" #Comma
 ABY_AF_projekt_uberreaktor_desc:0 "Heat is energy. This principle is useful and flexible once you think out of the box. The Dragon Isles are an obvious spot for geothermal energy, so why not house one big facility harnessing a whole volcano for this? And not just a volcano! Don't dragons breathe fire as well? We have a bunch of flying and talking generators!"
 ABY_AF_war_plan_griffonia:0 "War Plan Griffonia" 
 ABY_AF_war_plan_griffonia_desc:0 "Griffonia, lying north of Zebrica, separated only by water, should be next for us to subjugate. This task will not be an easy one, for our enemies are many, and their centuries of fighting each other has given them enough experience in war that they will be no easy foe."
 ABY_AF_across_the_middle_sea:0 "Across the Middle Sea"
 ABY_AF_across_the_middle_sea_desc:0 "In order to protect our naval forces from retaliatory fire, camouflage and patterns that will disrupt the eye need to be hastily painted and marked across every hull, so that we may strike without mercy."

 ABY_AF_from_the_air_desc:0 "The griffons may fly with their own wings and their planes, but such advantages shouldn't deter us. Our paratroopers must be deployed en masse, hitting vital targets, seizing or destroying them. They're vital to harassing and hindering enemy operations and movements, too.

 ABY_AF_from_the_west:0 "From the West" #Nila
 ABY_AF_from_the_west_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire, the Aquileians, and the Wingbardians stand firmly upon the western face of the continent. Our planners have chosen these as our targets.

 ABY_AF_a_mountain_of_iron_desc:0 "The immense metal deposits in the deeper parts of Zebrica will be bent only to the Imperium's will, by any means necessary.

 ABY_AF_from_the_east_desc:0 "The Riverlands lay east, as do several other nation-states belonging to griffons, the mixed-race Kasans, and even changelings. There are even supposed rumors of the undead inhabiting a peninsula north of this part of Griffonia. Yet, shall these be too challenging for us that we would not turn our mighty forces to best them?

 ABY_AF_targeted_sabotage_desc:0 "To ensure the greatest success of our campaign against the states of Griffonia, we have to deploy well-trained units to conduct large-scale sabotage operations before we deploy our forces.

 ABY_AF_a_most_curious_device:0 "A Most Curious Device" #Comma
 ABY_AF_a_most_curious_device_desc:0 "Furtive rumours say that hidden away in Gryphus lies an artefact that can control the weather. It's relieving to know that the legwork is already done for us by this magical violation of meteorology. All we need to do now is to let it loose in the Zebhara, turning the inhospitable into the inhabitable."
 ABY_AF_a_most_curious_device_tt:0 "We shall utilize the technology of Gryphus' §HWeather Control Machine§! in order to terraform the §HZebhara Desert§! as part of the §GGrünwüste§! project, utilizing the evaporated water from §CProject Zebtropa§!."

 ABY_AF_projekt_kraftwasser_desc:0 "The Griffking is a storied stream, a demarcation line with which to bless the Riverlander non-griffons in this griffon continent.

 ABY_AF_projekt_sacraflasche:0 "Projekt Sacraflasche" #Comma
 ABY_AF_projekt_sacraflasche_desc:0 "Religions can sometimes make a big deal of holy water, but if Kattail were a god, why would he limit this to a chosen few? Holy water has fascinating properties from belief to belief, and if what they say about Watertowns, there's some real holy water to bottle up en masse. Live long and prosper with agua viva, everyone!"
 ABY_AF_projekt_grossgang:0 "Projekt Grossgang" #Comma
 ABY_AF_projekt_grossgang_desc:0 "The Kaiser is well known for his eccentricity, both by friend and foe. Sometimes, it propels society forward by shattering the boundaries of known science. Other times, though, it has him rambling about a small natural tunnel that starts in Rumare. Which may shatter science anyway."
 ABY_AF_war_plan_zebrica:0 "War Plan Zebrica" 
 ABY_AF_war_plan_zebrica_desc:0 "Zebrica is home to zebras, horses, kirin, hippogriffs, and more. This, too, is the home of our empire, forging it with the steel of our tanks, the blood of our soldiers, and the ambition of our Emperor. This shall be the foundation of our empire. Uniting all of Zebrica should be within our grasp, and none shall stay our march."
 ABY_AF_all_weather_tanks:0 "All-Weather Tanks" 
 ABY_AF_all_weather_tanks_desc:0 "Our tanks should not simply form a line of steel around our enemies nor smash through their lines. If we can modify our armored fighting vehicles to function in any weather with little to no issues, then we will be unstoppable."
 ABY_AF_all_weather_planes:0 "All-Weather Planes" 
 ABY_AF_all_weather_planes_desc:0 "The sky should belong to us and not even storms should dissuade us. But if we want to clear the skies of our enemies no matter what the weather, then great scientific investments have to be made."

 ABY_AF_a_flood_of_violence_desc:0 "Our troops need not suffer great losses. As we unleash a flood of violence against our enemies, we must enhance our special forces and improve our airpower.

 ABY_AF_through_the_clearings:0 "Through the Clearings" #Nila
 ABY_AF_through_the_clearings_desc:0 "Our Katzen cannot make quicker progress through the continent if we do not find paths through the immense jungle we have come to. We must heed the lessons learnt by the deer and zebra who live here. Only then can we begin fighting better in such harsh terrain."

 ABY_AF_march_on_vermillion_desc:0 "We have come very, very far now. Our eyes are set upon the East and just within reach is the great city of Vermillion. The kirin, unfortunately, stand in our way. We must push them aside, regardless of their devoted defense of their capital and their Matriarch."
 ABY_AF_the_eradication_principle:0 "The Eradication Principle" #Comma
 ABY_AF_the_eradication_principle_desc:0 "It's a tired saying by now: Don't die for your country but make the enemy die for theirs. The kirin's unwavering stand for the Matriarch has sent them blindly rushing into our airspace. Lets put it this way: our air force has refined the rituals that will send so many souls back to Concord, rituals that involve some serious ordinance." 
 ABY_AF_hack_and_slash:0 "Hack and Slash" #Nila
 ABY_AF_hack_and_slash_desc:0 "Our army should not stop for anything, not even the immense jungle that many say would be impossible for our vehicles to pass through. Nonsense! We shall deploy our best engineers and give them as much leeway to establish wide paths for our forces to use. Even if it means that we must cut down thousands of trees and destroy any creature impeding us, then so be it!"
 ABY_AF_projekt_wasserhalt:0 "Grandiose Autarky"

 ABY_AF_plan_totenpferd_desc:0 "Rumors of unliving equines and holy orders protecting against invading surges of terrors do not concern the Kaiser, as land is land and conquest is his by right. All of this, as dire and desolate as it is, shall be unified."

### EVENTS ###

katzen_AF.1.t:0 "A Wrong Turn"
katzen_AF.1.d:0 "Another defeat at the hand of rival galactic powers, another collapsing Imperium, another storming of Katown and the Pyramid... another failed attempt. It mattered little in the end, Kattail thought, as he barreled through eternity and unto the next iteration of the Infinite Cycle, where he knew that another Flusion and its billions of zealous Katzens would be waiting for him to arrive and retry everything once more.\n\nKattail found himself in a cave, presumably somewhere near Katown. As he got up to exit the cave and restart his conquests, he felt... heavier than usual. How strange, had he put on weight since the last Cycle? No matter, he thought, as he walked out of the cave, expecting to be greeted by the familiar sight of the suburban outskirts of the Katown megalopolis.\n\nHowever, Katown was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the lukewarm and verdant plains of the Northern Katzen Herzlands. Instead, in front of him stretched a large, arid plain beneath a scorching, nearly-equatorial sun. There was no megalopolis in sight, only scattered and evidently rather poor villages surrounding a moderately large city in the distance.\n\nPerhaps he had arrived too early, back when Flusion was warmer? Or maybe this Flusion was simply different from the rest... or perhaps, he thought, as he stared at the rustic villages, strangely bereft of all the usual aspects of Katzen militarization..."
katzen_AF.1.a:0 "...this wasn't Flusion at all!"

katzen_AF.2.t:0 "Under the Gaslight"
katzen_AF.2.d:0 "The tall, orange-furred Katzen was sitting in a nice, comfy room, alongside none other than Kaiser Kattail himself. He wasn't too sure why he was there other than that he had been selected for a so-called "Destiny Realization Program' based on his military leadership skills, academic studies, and, strangely enough, his appearance.\n\n"So.' the Kaiser spoke in a soft yet assertive voice. "Tell me. What is it that you like to do?'\n"Well... um... is this a date...?'\n"No, but I like that way of thinking. Carry on...'\n"Well I of course like a good military campaign, yes.'\n"Excellent. And do you yearn for the great beyond?'\n"I think I do yes, although I never really got the opportunity to really dive into what it actually is.'\n"Have you ever dreamed of piloting the moon?'\n"What?'\n"Well, have you?' the Kaiser said with an overtly serious tone in stark contrast with the question he had just asked.\n"Thinking about it... I think I did, when I was 6 or 7, yes. I was flying the moon with some giant cannon on it... it was pretty neat.'\nThe Kaiser's eyes brightened as the Katzen spoke. "Excellent. Then, I believe you've passed the test.'\n"Cool. What do I get?'\n"You get a new name.'\n"Pardon me?'\n"From now on, you are now Douclaw MacCathur, Grand General of the Katzenartig Imperium's armed forces. Do you accept?'\n"Douclaw MacCathur... that's a funny name. But, well, you're the Kaiser, so, sure... I suppose! Do I... really need the name, though?'\n"It is absolutely essential. Now, let's discuss tactics, shall we? You've got a lot to catch up on...'"
katzen_AF.2.a:0 "Hopefully Loris, Pawtton, and Meolson will be this simple."

katzen_AF.21.t:0 "Investigating the Magic"
katzen_AF.21.d:0 "At first, Kattail of course thought of simply departing from this Cycle. What was he to do without his trusty Katzens? And yet, this curious anomaly intrigued him, thus he set out to learn more about this strange world.\n\nWandering about the arid countryside, he quickly noticed that, while they weren't Katzens, the inhabitants of the area he landed in were most definitely feline, which made it surprisingly easy for him to get chummy with them and subsequently extract valuable information under the pretense of him being a wealthy Abyssinian expat returning to his homeland...\n\nIn a strange parallel with what's usually happening on Flusion during his arrival, he learned that these felines too were embroiled in political instability and stagnation, with many of them yearning for a proper regime change.\n\nBut the most interesting part to him had to be the wide variety of magical abilities reportedly displayed by the various species populating this world which, much like Flusion, was strangely rich and diverse. He eventually concluded that, while it would be a brazen departure from his habits, this world had...certain potential, when it came to furthering his ambitions.\n\nIn the end, maybe all that his grand plans of universal domination needed to finally succeed were merely... a little bit of magic."
katzen_AF.21.a:0 "And so his mind was set."

katzen_AF.22.t:0 "The New Imperium"
katzen_AF.22.d:0 "The actual takeover of 'Abyssinia' was, for lack of better terms, relatively mundane. The skillful usage of his immense technological and political knowledge from past Cycles made it easy for Kattail to rapidly gather a large following across the nation, which promptly marched onto the capital of Panthera. Of course, some false promises and manipulation had to be undertaken, but the repercussions of that would be dealt with in due time.\n\nNaturally, Kattail still expected [ABY.GetLeader] to resist and cause a civil war, but, much to his surprise, as he stepped into [ABY.GetLeader]'s palace and confronted him in person, the monarch quite simply stared at Kattail, before handing him the crown, seemingly almost... happy, to do so. And well, that was that. After generously allowing [ABY.GetLeader] to retire in a rural cottage, Kattail now found himself at the head of Abyssinia and its six million inhabitants.\n\nBut it was evident that this was only the beginning as the nation he had managed to take over was... not in the best of shapes, to say the least. Devastated by the Storm King, plagued by slave unrest, and threatened by Wingbardy's ambitions, Kattail knew that he'd need to put in quite a bit of elbow grease if he was to make any of it work."
katzen_AF.22.a:0 "An ocean of elbow grease, really."

katzen_AF.23.t:0 "Duty Calls"
katzen_AF.23.d:0 "Tailbeba Mewda sat in a seemingly endless line of Abyssinians, all waiting to get into a so-called 'Katzenification Office', dozens of which had recently been erected across Abyssinia by Kaiser Kattail.\n\nHaving been little more than a laborer all his life, he wasn't too sure what to expect and frankly hoped that this would be little more than a formality. After his livelihood was devastated by the Storm King's plundering, he had just barely managed to rebuild his life to an extent that he deemed acceptable and thus really didn't want to lose everything to the whims of some megalomaniac leader again.\n\n"Name, age, occupation, skills, ambitions?" The Katzen at the office's counter asked gruffly, snapping Tailbeba out of his thoughts.\n\n'Tailbeba Mewda, 37, laborer, hm, laboring, I guess? I did a bit of military training in my youth but nothing else... and...' Ambitions? That's an odd question, he thought. '...uuh... to travel the world, I suppose? I... never got the opportunity, being a peasant and all.'\n\n'Excellent. Then you're being assigned to the 1st Katzenkorps which is to be the Kaiser's finest. Forget about your peasantries though, the Kaiser will need the full potential of fresh Katzens like you if his visions are to be realized. As per the Katzenification Decree, you shall henceforth be known as Gustav Mewbert, proud Katzen of Katzennia,' the Katzen said, handing 'Gustav' some papers and a freshly stamped ID.\n\n'Well, welcome to your new life! You may now proceed.' announced the clerk as the advancing line already pushed the confused Gustav out of the office."
katzen_AF.23.a:0 "They'll get used to it."

katzen_AF.24.t:0 "To Drain a Sea"
katzen_AF.24.d:0 ""A... dam?" The lead engineer uttered in confusion to Kattail.\n\n"Yes, indeed. A dam! A big, beautiful dam, stretching from Cemareta to Jabal Tailiq which we have recently seized. Built out of the finest Katzen concrete and steel." Kattail said triumphantly.\n\n"But... but why?"\n\n"I'm glad you asked. Well, it will hold back the ocean itself and allow for the reclamation of hundreds of square kilometers of land from the Arabian sea. A network of canals will keep former cities connected to the sea while we'll later be able to redirect the evaporated water to irrigate the Zebhara and turn it into something actually useful for our purposes."\n\nDumbfounded, the head engineer thought for a bit. He and everyone else knew that this Kattail was a megalomaniac, but to dry a sea was a whole new level of insanity, really. "We'll... we'll need some time to think about the schematics, Herr Kai-"\n\n"Ah, the schematics, do not fret! I've got a few leads." Kattail said as he pulled out a thick pile of paper from a suitcase before setting it down in front of the engineers. "I've done some of the preliminary thinking by myself, you should find that most of the math checks out, we just need sufficient industrial capability and it should all work out."\n\nOf course, he could have provided the full schematics, but that would have been a bit too... suspicious. And besides, letting them fill in the blanks was a good test of their competence, Kattail thought as he watched his engineers trying to make sense of the plans..."
katzen_AF.24.a:0 "...the symbol of the new order."

katzen_AF.25.t:0 "The Interaction"
katzen_AF.25.d:0 "Meorge Pawtton, the proud Abyssinian-turned-Katzen serving as the head marshall of the Katzenarmee, was sitting in his well-furnished office in Katown. The rapid growth of the Kaiser's empire required constant attention in order to stave off catastrophic collapse and so that is exactly what Pawtton dedicated his life to, but right now he was simply enjoying a nice break with a bottle of Colthaginian whisky.\n\nAnd then... it appeared. In the corner of his eye, seemingly out of thin air, some sort of... creature? Monster? Entity? Pawtton was at an utter loss for words, for whatever that was, it looked nothing like anything he had ever seen before in his entire life.\n\nNow hovering in the middle of his office was a strange, L-shaped geometrical entity, made out of some unknown dark material criss-crossed by eerie glowing green lights and exhibiting a pair of what appeared to be circular "eyes" seemingly looking around the office as the creature slowly rotated to observe its surroundings, making some sort of low humming sound.\n\nInitially struck by some primordial fear of this supernatural entity, Pawtton quickly glanced at his bottle of whisky and then at the creature before shrugging and speaking up in a coarse, authoritative yet slightly drunk voice.\n\n"Hello? You are within the office of Katzenmarshall Meorge Pawtton, please state your business at once or face..." Suddenly, Pawtton's own voice was cut off, as if he simply could not speak anymore, followed by the creature turning around and facing him head-on, its circular eyes... staring deep into Pawtton's soul.\n\n"Face what? Elaborate, Pawtton. I am most curious, for I currently mean no harm." the creature "spoke" with an almost-ethereal voice which, given that the entity had no mouth to speak of, seemed to resonate within Pawtton's mind. And how did it know Pawtton's name? How come he seemed unable to speak seconds ago? How was it speaking with no mouth? Thoughts rushed around Pawtton's mind as he thought about his reply..."
katzen_AF.25.a:0 "...the might of my Katzenluger! Leave now, intruder!"
katzen_AF.25.b:0 "He unloads his Katzenluger and throws a grenade before taking cover under the desk!"
katzen_AF.25.c:0 "...nothing at all... just a friendly misunderstanding!"

katzen_AF.251.t:0 "Dauntless"
katzen_AF.251.d:0 ""Oh, you wish for me to depart? Most certainly." The creature would nonetheless do a few circles around the office, occasionally glancing at the shaking Pawtton while sometimes "picking up" some items and inspecting them, evidently using some sort of telekinetic ability, perhaps akin to unicorn magic.\n\n"Although." It said as it seemingly looked towards Pawtton's Katzenluger, "You may want to invest into better weaponry in the coming millennia."\n\nPawtton found the courage to speak up. "Well... I mean, that's not up to me, really... besides... millennia? We'll all be dead by then anyways. Everything dies doesn't it? I heard even the universe and creation themselves were gonna die in the end, so I don't bother with thinking so far ahead... better to focus on the present," he said, as the creature just stared at him.\n\n"Don't be so sure. Although, I like you, you have your charm, so I'll help you a bit, just this once." the entity said before Pawtton suddenly sensed his thoughts becoming faster and his mind sharper. "Farewell, for now." And with that, the creature quite simply vanished from Pawtton's office without a trace, disappearing into thin air leaving nothing behind.\n\nPawtton stared at the empty area where the creature used to be, and noticed that his mind truly did feel... clearer, as if his very consciousness somehow had been made more efficient. Was this the creature's doing? No matter, he thought. He glanced at his bottle of whisky, and, with his newfound clairvoyance, threw it out the window before resuming his break."
katzen_AF.251.a:0 "No more drinks for ol' Pawtton."

katzen_AF.252.t:0 "Oblivion"
katzen_AF.252.d:0 "Pawtton got up from beneath the desk to find the creature completely unfazed. His grenade had simply vanished and so had the shots fired at the entity. Just as Pawtton was about to scream something, his speech was once again cut off as the entity spoke up.\n\n"This, Pawtton, is most uncouth. I simply arrive for a gentle discussion with your kind, and such is how I am welcomed?"\n\nAs the creature spoke, Pawtton felt a feeling of primordial... hatred, for this pretentious trespasser. Without hesitation he called up reinforcements via an emergency button and soon enough dozens of Katzen soldiers stormed into the large office, surrounding the entity with armed rifles which soon began to fire. The entity, however, remained unfazed, seemingly just absorbing the machine gun fire into itself while continuing to stare at Pawtton, who, alongside the soldiers, began to panic.\n\nIt quickly turned into a veritable commotion as more and more soldiers rushed into the rooms with heavier and heavier weaponry, grenades and even anti-tank weapons, none of which had any effect whatsoever, although the creature's stillness led Pawtton to believe that it was perhaps being paralyzed by the assaults.\n\nEventually the entire building was evacuated and leveled by heavy artillery fire in an attempt to destroy the intruder, who then simply stood in the air where Pawtton's office used to be as the building collapsed. Then the cannons suddenly stopped firing and the hundreds of soldiers and civilians surrounding the area found themselves unable to speak as the creature spoke up.\n\n"Is this a competition? Fine then, I shall participate." With a flash, the entire area in a one-hundred meter radius surrounding the building simply disappeared into thin air, leaving Pawtton and the many soldiers to fall into the newly-formed crater.\n\n"I wish you good luck if this is how your kind reacts to the unknown. Farewell." And with another flash the entity simply disappeared without a trace, leaving hundreds of dumbfounded soldiers at the bottom of a new crater and a very, very confused Pawtton who swore to never again drink another drop of alcohol."
katzen_AF.252.a:0 "What was that all about?"

katzen_AF.253.t:0 "A Conversation"
katzen_AF.253.d:0 ""A misunderstanding? I can tell you wish you could shoot me, but are too afraid to do so. Well, not giving way to your basic instincts is good."\n\n"What... what are you?" Pawtton said in a shaky voice.\n\n"Me? What I am will be revealed in due time, although not to you. I would say more, for my kind hates such mysteries, but that would be going against the protocols. You are a military commander, are you not Pawtton? I have perused through your memories and your kind is expanding at a rapid pace, which I find fascinating. Are you happy about it?"\n\nWas the creature asking Pawtton about how he felt? Did it just read his mind? Pawtton felt overwhelmed but, thanks to his rigorous training, quickly reasserted himself and spoke once more.\n\n"Well, yes. I do like it, it is pleasant to watch my kind finally rise out of the mud it had been wallowing in for the past decades or so, all thanks to the guidance of Kaiser Kattail."\n\n"Excellent. May I join you? I know you are about to say "Excuse me?", so I will answer ahead of time. I am curious about the way your kind engages in terrestrial warfare and wish to partake in it, for it is a subject of great interest to my consciousness. If not, that is alright, I shall depart and you will not be bothered anymore. By the way, you may call me however you'd like, if that makes you comfortable."\n\n"Join... join us? Well... uh... I'll call... I'll call you Herb, since you're a bit green, like grass, I suppose, yes? I'll... I'll think about it, yes?" Pawtton was dumbfounded. Evidently that... thing, Herb, was leagues beyond anything anyone on this planet could conceive of, and it wanted to join them? It all made so little sense... and yet Pawtton could sense that Herb was being genuine, somehow. The way it spoke directly into his mind felt eerie, yet comforting and so... unfathomably honest and clear."
katzen_AF.253.a:0 "You shall make a fine general, Herb!"
katzen_AF.253.b:0 "Perhaps you'll want to work in the research department instead?"
katzen_AF.253.c:0 "We're... fully staffed at the time, sorry Herb."


katzen_AF.26.t:0 "Kattail Ad Aeternum"
katzen_AF.26.d:0 "Kattail, alongside his escort, strutted through the vast vaults of The Cave. Most of the artifacts stored there, while interesting in their own right, were mostly curiosities of little actual value for his plans.\n\nThey would thus be allowed to remain there with oversight from Katzen scientists who would be working with the Obsidian Council, whom promises of funding and cooperation had managed to sway to his side, in order to ensure the continued security and study of these magical trinkets.\n\nSome of the artifacts were far more dangerous, but also much more interesting. These would be studied extensively in order to bolster the Imperium's still lackluster science base, in a final bid to finally drag the Abyssinians out of the mud of technological backwardness which had impeded the Kaiser's conquest for too long.\n\nBut the Kaiser soon came face to face with what was perhaps The Cave's most important item. A large resplendent artifact from ages past, gleaming with ethereal purple energy, whose visible age only made it all the more enthralling.\n\nIt seemed as if it was of near-infinite complexity, orders of magnitude beyond what the people of this planet could have ever produced in their entire history. To everyone, its origins remained shrouded in mystery, with many believing it to be divine in origin, a construct perhaps forged by Boreas himself.\n\nBut to Kattail, the answer was obvious: the item's creator was none other than Aeternum, the galactic core's ancient precursor civilization. It seemed that, just as they had tempered with Flusion, so had they also tempered with this world and its people. Thus, so many more of these artifacts were almost certainly scattered throughout the planet.\n\nAnd Kattail intended to find each and every single one of them."

Sand, sand, sand, as far as the eye could see, pretty much the only sight she had seen during her entire life.\n\nThere had been hints of change, though. Reportedly, the region had fallen under the control of a certain "Kaiser Kattail", and every so often she spotted some railway or settlement being built in the distance, a distance which she preferred to keep as she didn't mind her lifestyle all that much.\n\nShe had her spot within her community; that was all she needed. Besides, whoever that Kaiser fellow was, he likely didn't care much for a few nomads in the sand, she thought. While tall felines clad in strange attires occasionally approached her with "job opportunities", she always declined and it seemed to be keeping change at bay.\n\nUntil it started raining. "Tis the annual rainfall", the elders said. "It will end soon.", except it, of course, did not end. Drizzle turned into rainfall washing over the Zebhara as the desert's oasis swelled into gargantuan lakes, often swallowing entire heritage sites beneath the waves in the process.\n\nIdir barely had any time to process these changes before a flurry of gargantuan tracked construction vehicles began tearing the desert asunder with a vast network of canals, followed by wave upon wave of eager settlers planting forests, building cities, and constructing solar panel networks in the vast expanses where her people used to roam.\n\nShe eventually found herself having to join these settlers if she was to carve herself a spot in this strange new world, but not without swearing to never forget the sight of the beautiful white sand glistening in the sun. \n\nIt was all she had left from her world."

katzen_AF.271.d:0 "Tailbeba, or Gustav as he was now called, sat alongside many other Abyssinians in a large newly-erected building in Panth... Katown, which the Kaiser humbly dubbed the Kattail Military Academy.\n\nMuch like the recruitment office that had dragged him into this strange new life, many of these had popped up throughout the nation, often within the same buildings as the office, all with the supposed goal of preparing the populace for the "upcoming trials', whatever that meant.\n\nHowever, perhaps due to Abyssinia's rather crippling lack of modern military masterminds, Gustav and many hundred if not thousands of Abyssinians were listening to none other than Kaiser Kattail himself speak about his plans for the nation, with his speech being relayed to the other academies via radio.\n\nFor hours and hours, Kattail went on about a vast variety of subjects, ranging from new-era military doctrines involving armored vehicles to societal transformation and new exciting technologies to be implemented across Abyssinia.\n\nGustav emerged out of the lecture feeling overwhelmed by it all, and so he sat down in a large park next to the building to allow his laborer mind to process the vast amount of information he had just been given. He just sat there, taking in everything, when his thoughts were, once again, interrupted by the sudden sound of someone else's voice.\n\n"Pretty nifty speech, huh?' a black-furred Katzen clad in an impeccable military outfit addressed him. "You look a tad lost. The name's... Hans. Used to be Yelekai but I'll admit that Hans has a nice ring to it. What's yours?'"

I used to be some lowly laborer before this, so getting all these opportunities is nothing short of refreshing. Incredible how Kattail is making it all work, huh?'\n\n"I... used to be a laborer too... I didn't mind it too much, admittedly. Although the Storm King really messed everything up and I had to start nearly from scratch rebuilding everything.'\n\n"Ah! The Storm King! Didn't you hear? The Kaiser said that we'd make the Yetis pay back what they inflicted upon us a thousand times. Isn't that sweet? Frankly, I just want to do something more with my life than till soil until I become soil myself if you catch my gist.'\n\n"That's... one way of looking at it, I suppose?' Gustav said, staring into the distance where many Abyssinians and numerous freed slaves were busy working on construction projects... prompting Gustav to think about the way Kattail had somehow managed to do so much for Abyssinian society in so little time. Perhaps Hans was right to be excited? Yet he couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all moving far too fast. All it'd take is one mistake...\n\n"Not very chatty, are we? Well, the Kaiser said it was important to develop a sense of camaraderie between Katzens, so, want to be friends?'\n\nGustav looked up, having almost forgotten about Hans' presence already. "Oh? Friends? Friends... friends. Sure. Let's be friends, it... can't hurt, really.' Gustav said in a low voice. Having lived a somewhat lonely life in rural Abyssinia for most of his life, he wasn't really used to talking with complete strangers like that, especially such overtly ambitious ones, but he figured he'd give it a shot anyway. If anything, maybe it'd help him fit in better.\n\nAfter all, he had already rebuilt his life from scratch once, what's a second time?"

katzen_AF.273.d:0 "Assur, Anseruk, Mane'a, Mareib, Trotgiers, Gallarb,... dozens of other major cities had fallen under Katzennia's dominion, and Kattail could not be prouder of his soldiers. Under his guidance, they marched from the arid plains of Abyssinia, through the fertile shores of the Arabian Sea, all the way to Cape Hestraya and beyond to the South Pole, swelling his empire from just Abyssinia to a monstrous superstate engulfing a large chunk of western Zebrica.\n\nThis, of course, warranted celebration. Across the newly captured cities of Katzennia, columns of KK-Panzers followed by hundreds if not thousands of foot soldiers paraded down avenues and boulevards. Much to Kattail's delight, these cohorts were made up not only of Abyssinians but also a myriad of other species that had stopped seeing the Katzens as invaders but rather as allies worthy of their cooperation.\n\nAnd yet, watching the largest of the parades from atop a balcony in Katown, he knew this was nowhere near enough. All across his new empire countless partisans and freedom fighters were already arraying themselves against his rule and that of the Katzens.\n\nThese would have to be stamped out quickly before the problem grew out of control, he thought, as he began working to establish proper integration protocols and widespread counter-insurgency tactics with his intelligence agency, to ensure his empire was ready to weather the incoming storm about to be unleashed upon it.\n\nAs indeed! To many external observers, Abyssinia has gone far, far beyond the nation's wildest dreams, and was surely satisfied with its new conquests. But to Kattail, this was only the very, very beginning of his great journey across this world. Soon, the Hippogriffs and the Yetis would fall, followed by the rest of the continent, and then, the world.\n\nBut for now? It was time to enjoy the parades, and despite having seen such parades thousands if not millions of times by now... they never got old."

Except that, well, this region brought with itself the Llama species into the empire.\n\nYet another one, Loris thought! He had nothing against Llamas, of course. Nothing against anyone, really, except for strange 'ice cream people' that sometimes appeared in his dreams, but they weren't real so it didn't matter. But this complicated things. Zebrica, and the world as a whole, had so, so many species, and uniting it as Kattail intends is going to have to require somehow unite all of these species into a singular, semi-cohesive civilization.\n\nBeyond the obvious cultural differences, which could be alleviated with time, every species had different needs for housing, exercise, rest, diet, education, and with these Loris really had no choice but to try and aim for the best possible middle-ground satisfying as many species as possible in a given area so as to avoid segregation.\n\nKattail insisted that 'Everyone could become a Katzen'. Sounds nice in paper, yes, but when you've got two species with completely different psychologies, beliefs and physiological needs, well that's a lot of sleepless nights for Loris. And when you've got twenty or thirty?\n\nWell let's just say that, even with all the proper hierarchy and all the advisors in the world, poor old Loris hasn't had the chance to properly hit the hay for quite some time now. But it was all for the greater good, he thought. It'll all be worth it in the end, when we're all a big, happy family spanning across the entire world.\n\nLoris sighed as he reviewed the latest warplans and realized that, well, Hindia and Kiria were likely next, and with them, many, many hours of tireless work spent making sure that family didn't break apart..."

katzen_AF.275.t:0 "Evening it Out"
katzen_AF.275.d:0 "With the fearsome Yetis subjugated beneath Katzen might, Kattail felt that it was time for what one could call a little righting of historical wrongs. Indeed, while he obviously wasn't there, several years ago the Storm King and his legion swept over Abyssinia and pillaged nearly everything of value out of the nation, leaving the entire country in a state so sorry that it would likely have lasted for several more years had he not intervened.\n\nKattail thus visited the palace in the Eye of the Storm, which once served as the Storm King's seat of power. And so as to reward his loyal Abyssinians for sticking with him all the way to the ends of Zebrica, he ordered it to be quite literally dismantled stone by stone, to have those stones shipped back all the way to the Abyssinian homeland, and then for the palace to be rebuilt and turned into a museum to both old Abyssinian culture and history as well as its recent newfound Katzen glory.\n\nWhile the Abyssinians themselves cheerfully welcomed this development, Kattail of course expected the Yetis to protest. They were however fearsome warriors which would be of great help to Kattail's crusade, and thus he took great care to ensure the Yetis were nonetheless treated fairly as an integral part of his ever-expanding empire.\n\nAs with other conquered nations, religious rights for the Yeti's ancestor worship were enshrined while Kattail personally overlooked most of the occupation of Yeti lands in order to ensure that his armies did not commit too many (or ideally, none at all) revenge-fueled war crimes. He additionally promised the construction of a grand and monumental power plant intended to fully utilize the Eye of the Storm's potential, which will provide near-limitless power to the Yeti lands and beyond.\n\nDespite his best efforts, it will obviously still take several years of arduous work for the relationship between Yeti and Abyssinians to be fully mended, but Kattail felt confident that eventually, both species would see eye-to-eye under the glory of Katzen militarism.\n\nHopefully."

Now, naturally, being the good Katzens that they are, they had drafted up plans to utterly devastate this wild patch of untamed nature and replace it with the glory of efficient Katzen civilization, just like they had planned for the jungles of Zebrica and Southern Equus.\n\nIt was to be glorious. Conventional and white phosphorus bombardment, bioweapons, pesticides, heavy explosives, and even several nuclear strikes were to be unleashed upon tactical locations across the Everfree in order to wipe it off the map in one fell swoop before its supernatural properties could save it. Within days the the equipment had been prepared and all they needed to begin was the Kaiser's word.\n\n'No.'\n\n'What... what do you mean, no, mein Kaiser?' The Katzen officer in charge of the operation said, bewildered. 'You want us to burn down the jungles of Zebrica and Equus, yet you wish for this vile patch of defiant nature to stand against our rule?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'...why? It stands no chance against our might, does it not?'\n\nKattail seemed slightly uneasy as if remembering something traumatic. 'Yes, but consider that it would make a nice nature preserve. We can study it, for science and magic, yes?'\n\n'Hm. I suppose so. Are you absolutely certain?'\n\n'My word is final. Establish a perimeter and move in our research teams at once, but don't, EVER, harm the Everfree. Failure to comply will...' He'd stare into the distance for a bit. '...end badly for whoever did it. Got it?'\n\n'Got it. We'll see what we can do.'\n\n'Excellent.' Kattail said, suppressing what seemed to be a sigh of relief."

The dark magic of Magehold was amongst the most powerful on the planet, and thus matching preparations had been made for a grand conflict pitting the living against the dead.\n\nAnd yet Gustav couldn't help but feel... disappointed. In mere days, the terrifying undead hordes had been ground to dust under KK-Panzer tracks, sometimes coming back to life only to be crushed once more. His division found itself impeded more by logistical troubles in the far north rather than by the actual undead themselves.\n\nThe storming of Magehold too was just as anticlimactic. A barrage of strangely well-placed howitzer shots leveled nearly the entire fortress before infantry squads moved in to clear out the stragglers. Was that it? Surely it couldn't be. Surely the peninsula's dark magic would cause something to happen and the fight would be on once more.\n\nHowever, all that Gustav got to witness was the quietude of the windswept plains of the north followed by the scurrying of Katzen countercurse divisions moving in to purify the area and integrate it into the empire. Gustav had seen it all, from Equus to Zebrica and Griffonia. He was a weary veteran by now, ready to take on the entire universe for his Kaiser, and frankly? This whole ordeal felt like an affront to his skills."

katzen_AF.28.d:0 "At last, it is complete. Likely the greatest feat of engineering in the world, perhaps in all of history, has been realized according to Kattail's grand plan, as indeed, the almighty Riesigerkatzenpanzer is now operational.\n\nFive hundred meters in length, two hundred meters tall, and weighing over three hundred and fifty thousand tons, it is to be the ultimate manifestation of Katzen dominance. Its gigantic Bergbrecher tracks, powered by dozens of nuclear reactors embedded into the vehicle's fortified innards, make the very ground tremble as the vehicle rolls out of its gargantuan construction yards near the outskirts of Katown.\n\nAs is to be expected for such a vehicle, it features hundreds of cannons, aimed at laying waste to enemy infantry, armor, and aircraft alike, all while remaining nearly indestructible thanks to its meter-thick armor. It is estimated that it will cost four hundred million Katzmarks to fire this weapon for twelve seconds.\n\nAnd yet all of these pale in comparison to the vehicle's most powerful asset: the almighty Kontinentale Sturmer. This fearsome weapon is capable of lobbing a shell consisting of seven thermonuclear warheads at any point on the planet, tearing the sky and land asunder and bringing devastation upon our foes like a mechanical angel of death. Kattail is hopeful that we will never, ever have to fire it.\n\nThe vehicle, which has now been dubbed "Dominiontracks', as well as its crew of fifteen thousand loyal Katzens, is now awaiting orders near Katown. Should we wish to incinerate a state in nuclear hellfire, we may now do so."

The Kontinentale Sturmer is ready, and within minutes, the railgun, over 150 meters in length by itself, fires.\n\nA massive explosion follows the projectile, the sabot shell being twenty meters itself at the largest, as it screams across the sky. The immense force of the Sturmer bends the land surrounding it as trees lean backward in the wake of the sonic boom as the shell flies high into the sky, rupturing the cloud layer in mere seconds and vanishing from sight.\n\nBut it doesn't take long for it to return. Within mere minutes the shell climbs to its apogee, thousands of kilometers into the heavens themselves, before turning around and detonating its propulsive nuclear charges in rapid succession. This accelerates it to tens of thousands of kilometers per second before its fairing separates, revealing its seven thermonuclear warheads.\n\nThe warheads puncture through the atmosphere in less than two seconds before detonating with full force over [From.From.GetName]. In the blink of an eye the fury of seven suns tears apart the landscape, setting plains alight and turning entire woodlands into little more than tinder for the flames, while any rivers in the vicinity are near-instantly flash-boiled as millions of tons of water evaporate into superheated steam.\n\nAny enemy forces or military installations in the area are essentially removed from existence before they are allowed to react. Meanwhile, the sound of the explosion is heard several times everywhere as it circles the planet several times over like a testimony to the wrath of the Katzenartig Imperium sent to the entire world.\n\nAs Kattail watches everything unfold, he hopes that this warning shot will suffice."

Now the groups brutally slaughtering each other seemed to be led by... a random pony declaring herself to be the new princess, a genocidal unicorn race supremacist, a "super communist," and a... musician? To top it off, at the center of it all was the hypocritical "Princess of Friendship" and regent of the missing alicorns, Twilight Sparkle. She seemed to have become an utterly ruthless and bloodthirsty ruler in the other alicorns' absence.\n\nKattail made a note to himself to be very careful with how he treated the common ponies of Equestria once he liberated them from the wanton chaos and destruction they seemed too eager to inflict upon themselves. Their mental fortitude was clearly minimal if they jumped to such extremes after a few weeks of a lack of leadership.\n\nFunnily enough, the economy of the communist faction seemed to be soaring despite nobody there seeming to know anything about economic theory. They believed it to be successful, and so it was.\n\nKattail didn't expect these factions to be difficult to deal with, so long as they were focused on fighting one another."

A most unusual occurrence had transpired within the region of the world known as the Herzland, causing a swift reconstruction of the Griffonian Empire into... Kattail squinted as he reread the words before him, "An Imperium of their own." He allowed himself a chuckle. In addition, the former Griffonian Republic seemed to have vanished overnight, and in its place came a chaotic death cult themed around one of the local deities.\n\nWhile these new developments were alarming, Kattail theorized that if he acted swiftly and decisively, then he could crush these new problems before they figured out how to utilize the full potential of their advanced technology."

Kattail grimaced. Evidently, there was some unknown factor at play. A magical artifact, perhaps? Were they utilizing Aeternum relics? He didn't know. But he had to defeat them, and soon, or his time here might be wasted.\n\nHe glanced one last time at the report.

With the surrender of both the mighty Arisians and the dreaded Yetis, as well as the ongoing implementation of wondrous megaprojects across Zebrica, Kattail now found himself at the head of what would soon become this world's greatest superpower.\n\nGiven his knowledge of war and the vast resources now available to him, the next step was obvious. While it remained relatively secretive for now so as to not stir up the still-integrating populations too much, a series of ambitious warplans was already being drafted, aiming to sweep over the rest of Zebrica and strike at both Griffonia and Equus in order to finally secure Kattail's hold over the entirety of this world.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of it all, Kattail felt... uncertain. Was this really worth it? This world was not Flusion. Yes, it was rich and populated, but it wasn't quite as rich and quite as populated as the planet he was used to.\n\nBut, most importantly, while he usually enjoyed the support of several billion Katzens on Flusion, here he only had a few scant hundred million to work with, with the rest having to be assimilated into his society which of course complicated things quite a bit.\n\nWould this world's potential be sufficient to realize his grand vision? Would he even be able to defeat the remaining two-and-a-half continents with what he had amassed thus far? Or was all of this little more than a waste of his time, an illusion of victory propped up by the Kaiser's general ignorance of this world's true nature?\n\nKattail pondered for a bit. His arrival on this world was likely just a fluke, and Cycle-shifting now would certainly return him to his beloved world of Flusion, where he could once again return to his usual strategies. Should he leave this world, which had proven to be a nice experiment and a distraction from his usual schemes, he had no doubts that the Abyssinian to whom he entrusted the role of Loris von Kattensbach would do a fine job at taking over for him, so at least his departure would not cause a catastrophic collapse.\n\nBut he couldn't deny this world had great potential, only waiting for a guiding hand to realize it and bring its inhabitants to galactic glory.

From the south pole to Kiria, to the Mountain, across the sea to Wingbardy, Griffenheim, and Cloudbury, to the hellscapes of the frozen north and onto the vast, once-indomitable Equestrian continent, the Katzen flag flew both metaphorically and physically.\n\nFor perhaps the first time in this world's history, billions of sapients from dozens of different species now found themselves united under one rule. His rule, but also their own rule. As indeed!

Through strife and triumph, he had once again built himself a proper power base from which to spread across the very heavens themselves.\n\nSoon enough, once all resistance has been properly pacified, he and his billions of citizens shall take a grand leap into the great unknown and accompany him toward galactic conquest, just as he had done with Flusion countless times prior.\n\nBut he wasn't quite ready yet, for there was one last thing to be done.

This, however, is being done at the utter expense of our defensive and economic capabilities, and it is evident that utter doom awaits Kattail's empire should this final assault fail..."

 katzen_AF.601.d:0 "Katzen artillery mercilessly pummeled the kirin defenses, blasting apart their strongpoints and scattering their infantry. Planes roared over the heads of advancing infantry and tanks, adding bombs and rockets and cannon fire to the chaos.\n\nMany kirin believed that their capital, home of the Matriarch, cradle of kirinkind, the very foundation of their Realm, would stand free for as long as the mountains did. Unfortunately for them the Katzen came to put an end to that belief. As land after land fell to the invading Katzen, the kirin thought that they wouldn't make it past the mountains and forests that shielded them from the rest of the continent's wars. But come through them they did.\n\nMany brave kirin had died at the frontier, and many more would die here, defending the approaches to the capital. The wrath of the invaders shattered the Banners of the Realm. Time and time again, the numbers and the technology of the Katzen overcame the spirit of the kirin. In just mere hours, the defenders either fled or lay dead. Now there was little to no resistance left. Vermillion would fall."
 katzen_AF.601.a:0 "Another jewel soon added to Kattail's crown."

 katzen_AF.602.t:0 "A New Life"
 katzen_AF.602.d:0 "Zenora couldn't believe her ears. When the Katzen came to Colthage and forced the Republic to capitulate, she had feared for her life and the lives of her family. They had hid together in the countryside, having fled the city before Katzen tanks rolled through the streets. Like many other refugees, however, the invaders eventually caught up to them, but what they did once the war for Colthage was over surprised her.\n\nDespite the great violence unleashed by the Katzen to conquer Maregypt and the other countries until they made it to Colthage, these new invaders weren't interested in enslaving them like the Chiropterrans did. Instead, they saw the Katzen begin reconstruction efforts and encouraged the populace to return to work and continue with their lives.\n\nZenora couldn't believe her own eyes when she saw a poster on the town board announcing a request for workers. She had thought it impossible to get a job back in the city, but seeing this opportunity open not only for her but for other zebras? The mare knew herself to be a competent scribe, and it seemed that not only were the Katzen interested in getting creatures into the factories again but also the skilled and educated into offices and other workplaces. She gave it a read and eventually found a nearby office that she could make an application for.\n\nFor once, since the capitulation, Zenora smiled."
 katzen_AF.602.a:0 "Perhaps there is hope after all."

 katzen_AF.603.t:0 "Promotion"
 katzen_AF.603.d:0 "Work wasn't easy, but it definitely was something she was good at. Zenora was quickly hired by the firm she applied to. She was made a secretary for the manager, a Katzen, and she proved herself a worthy asset to him.\n\nShe had given the firm vital service for a year and a half, not once failing to come to work on time and not once failing to be on time with her reports and the completion of other tasks. For all of this, she was summoned to the office of her superior just after work. Trying not to show her nervousness, she stood up from her desk and entered her manager's office, hoping that she had not come in for a scolding. She was certain that she had done well, forgiven only for very slight errors or mistakes. That was the worst of anything she did. So what was going to happen to her now?\n\nZenora sat down and faced her manager. The katzen was a good creature, reasonable but firm. He sat at his desk and said, "Thank you for all the work you do and the time you put in. You're one of our best employees and I didn't want to ignore that. With the way the economy is going, I think it's the proper time for rewards for you, indeed. Why don't you consider stepping up the ladder and becoming the head secretary for our firm as we expand? This promotion will improve your pay and give you more benefits. What do you think?"\n\nOnce again, Zenora couldn't believe her ears. She teared up and struggled not to be too overcome with emotion. The katzen patiently let her process this before eventually the zebra finally restored her composure."
 katzen_AF.603.a:0 "Rising up the ladder."

 katzen_AF.604.t:0 "Katzenification"
 katzen_AF.604.d:0 "It had been quite the effort to wrangle all of her relatives into the city she lived in. Despite now having settled herself down again in the city she fled from during the conquest of Colthage, she had to live with the fact that many of her family had scattered themselves across the former Republic. At first, she didn't think that was much of a problem as they all adapted to a new but strange life under the Imperium. Zenora was relieved that she could look after herself and her new family of two little foals which she adopted with her husband, a Katzen named Dreifuss.\n\nShe was content with this, but she had always felt that she wasn't exactly equal to the Katzens, despite her husband being loyal to her. That changed when the Imperium declared the protocols, allowing creatures like Zenora and her family to acquire citizenship. That, however, required that they, like many others, make appointments so they could be processed.\n\nNow that everyone she cared about was in the city, at least those close enough but still needed coming into the city for processing, Zenora brought them all over to the city hall. The wait was long, but eventually they were able to get new papers that officially proclaimed them as citizens of the Imperium. Now they were Katzen. Now they were equals, no longer bound to the past, to a corrupt Republic."

 katzen_AF.605.t:0 "Lead Me, Follow Me, or Get Out of My Way"
 katzen_AF.605.d:0 "The general marched down the line of recruits, inspecting them with careful eyes. Though this would be one out of many new divisions ordered by the Kaiser to form, this particular one would be a first in the history of the Katzen army.\n\nUnlike the very first divisions that formed in Abyssinia, this one would be composed of creatures from all over the empire. Ponies, zebras, horses, hippogriffs, and more. This would be a first of many planned mixed combat units intended not for garrison duties but for true active duty in the many wars being fought and to be fought. While the logistics of creating such a division certainly needed adjustment and reinforcement, the top officers of the Katzen army were satisfied.\n\nThe next step would be to train this division. If they wished to prove themselves worthy of the empire, then their deeds must be done not through foolishness. General Pawtton would hate to be disappointed and the great katzen would shape these creatures up to not only earn this honor but to become deserving of what shall transform them into equals of the founders of the Imperium.\n\nWasting no time, the general finished his inspection, faced the division, and began to deliver his speech.\n\n"You will know me as General Pawtton. You, soldiers, shall begin your training under my command. Though you all hail from different lands, you will earn your place in the Imperium as Kats. But to do so, you must give me your best. Perform well and you will survive. Sweat hard so you may not shed your own blood and waste your lives. Instead, I expect you to kill the poor dumb bastards opposing you and not get killed in turn. Will you follow me?"\n\nA roar rose out from the creatures and the general smiled at his new soldiers."
 katzen_AF.605.a:0 "Hopefully it'll work out."

 katzen_AF.606.t:0 "Dare to Die"
 katzen_AF.606.d:0 "Captain Torch Light had fought day and night with his Katzen-loyal kirin. Out of the hundreds that once made up his battalion, only half remained after a long battle with the enemy. Yet, they have inflicted greater damage to the enemy, even capturing several vehicles and prisoners. He and some of his kirin even turned nirik at times, driving back reinforcements and inspiring his comrades to fight on. But at the end, he frowned at the reports, realizing that only they and a handful of other battalions made it through the bloodshed for the river crossing.\n\nThey were hoping they would be allowed to move forward for a counter-offensive, but they were all ordered to stand down. What was going on? The silver scaled kirin decided not to question it, consulting the rest of his orders. He and his unit, whatever was left of it, were ordered out of the front lines officially to rest and refit. But just as they were about to make it to one of the resupply bases, they were met by a car of senior officers who ordered them to stop and present themselves.\n\nWhilst some of his subordinates grumbled about their wounded and exhausted comrades, they all obeyed. They formed their lines and did their best to look presentable, despite so many of them being filthy after ceaseless fighting. Were they being reprimanded?\n\nInstead of barks and disapproving looks, the katzen generals and their non-katzen subordinates instead bowed to them. What murmurs rose amongst the kirin were quickly silenced as Captain Torch Light was ordered out of the formation. One of the katzen generals faced him, looked him up and down, and presented him the Uranium Cross. The kirin, wide eyed and stunned, could only watch as the general pinned the cross with the uranium atom upon the chest of his uniform. He opened his mouth to speak, but the general instead ordered him and his subordinates to continue on to their destination. However, before they were allowed to leave, Torch Light was given a box and instructed to take care of decorating his own soldiers. The car and staff at last departed from them, leaving Torch Light and the kirin to continue on their way."

She looked forward, at the sweeping hills of crops of her farm, and then looked back at the document.\n\n"...overpass?" Sunny whispered, once again, baffled by the word in the context.\n\n"Evicted for an overpass?" Sunny questioned, "... to where?"\n\nSunny Smiles would find out soon, as the immense machinery arrived the next day. To give the government credit, she would be lodged in an apartment in a city she had never heard of. She left, ferried away in a bus filled with the other farmers from the region, and left their crops behind.\n\nThe work proceeded at a breakneck speed, as colossal machines moved earth and soil and scarred the ground with viciously efficient construction. Soon enough the gleaming lanes of concrete sprouted out of the ground like a cancerous maze of grey, and the crops shrunk under the shade.\n\nThe machines moved on, and behind them the roads were abandoned. Weeks later, Sunny Smiles would be with her friends enjoying the view from atop their apartment- and gazing towards the distant curve where their homes had been.\n\nIt was, it had so turned out, been a mistake. A simple misreading of measurements, old Abyssinian miles not converted to Katzen kilometers, and yet there was no going back. The terrifying efficiency of their tools had turned their own fallible minds into weapons against the very earth, but even now weeds and grasses started to consume the wound. In time, it would be dust. Like everything would be.\n\nSunny Smiles however was not filled with such philosophical ponderings, for her new apartment was exactly as far south as the now converted units, and the machines would arrive tomorrow.\n\nWith an upward scowl, Sunny looked to the heavens as if her glare would even be noticed by whatever cruel mind had set this all in motion."

 katzen_AF.607.t:0 "A Salty Tale"
 katzen_AF.607.d:0 "As it is known, of the big issues faced by the Zebtropa project is none other than salt. Indeed, the land reclaimed from the Arabian Sea is extremely salty and as such methods have been devised to help desalinate the new land, such as bioengineered plants capable of thriving in high-salinity environments that extract the salt out of the land.\n\nThese plants have been grown and spread throughout the new land by the millions, thus rendering the land more habitable. As the goal of the project was to turn one big sea into a myriad of smaller lakes, an aquatic version of this plant was created, which when injected into the salty lakes leftover by the retreating sea could clump the salt together into huge chunks that are later easily recovered from the water, enabling the Imperium to transform saltwater lakes into more habitable freshwater reservoirs. Developed with support from the mainland, these two plants have been an efficient and ecological way of dealing with the salinity issue.\n\nIn addition to these plants, large 'scraping' vehicles which somewhat resemble combine harvesters, generally based on a mechanised infantry vehicle chassis, have been constantly crisscrossing the reclaimed land to scrape up the salt from the ground and pave the way for the introduction of the aforementioned plants by rapidly decreasing the ground's salinity to non-toxic levels.\n\nWhile the operations to desalinate the new land have been mostly successful, this has had the peculiar yet expected side-effect of granting the Imperium access to truly mind-boggling quantities of cheap salt harvested directly from the former seabed, to the point that the Katzens now produce more salt daily than the entire planet does in a full year.\n\nUnder Loris' advice, this salt has been massively exported across the world, which have reportedly caused salt market crashes everywhere due to the sheer quantity being injected into the market While not quite as good as other 'high-quality' salt brands, the Arabian Salt has quickly grown to become the most widespread form of salt sold throughout the world, making up a record 85.7% of salt sales both within and outside of the Imperium in the last quarter."

Like a dead clock being right twice a day, she was right, and she'd get the truth sooner or later.\n\nPerhaps to his benefit.\n\n"Just to be clear," Kattail said, "You believe that I've uncovered ancient alien records to use them for imperialist gains. Your plan now, I can only guess, is to help accelerate this... er, 'futuristic capitalism' until it collapses under its own weight, then use our 'alien' technology to contact their makers who, apparently, are also communists." He blankly looked at Posada floating in the water, whose withering glare accused him of so much. "Even if this alien stuff were true, why should we accept a brazen revolutionary like you?"\n\n"Because you'll face the march of history," she answered, her waterproof mic conveying her voice. "If you bring me in, you'll have a high-ranking scientist who isn't afraid to explore where others don't tread, and more importantly, you'll have someone who listens to the heart of your workers, all tens of millions of them. They will revolt eventually, whether from us here or the aliens coming back to us, and whether they'll skewer you in the end will depend on what I can do.

Of course there were still tensions and clashes given how fast everything was moving, but Kattail was confident that would be resolved in due time.\n\nThe implementation of novel industrial methods and production chains across the nation enabled the production of modern equipment to slowly yet surely fulfill Kattail's dream of a grand Katzenarmee, which was steadily swelling with fresh recruits from across the nation as it prepared to march beyond Katzennia's borders and expand Kattail's dominion over the continent.\n\nAnd it desperately needed to, as, unbeknown to most, these "miraculous" transformations of Abyssinian society came at a cost, for Kattail's delicately-tuned economic and societal model, which had for now succeeded in uplifting Abyssinia, was not actually stable on its own.\n\nJust like the Katzenartig Imperium back on Flusion, it was built on and for one thing: war. In order to keep the industries running, the companies working, and the army growing, Kattail's hypermilitarized society needed a constant influx of fresh territories, population, and resources to be assimilated into itself, lest it would first slow down, then stall, and eventually, collapse in on itself under the weight of its bloated military spending and overmilitarized infrastructure.\n\nThus, as Kattail and his high command enacted their warplans upon Katzennia's southern neighbors, the race was on. Katzen boots and tracks were about to flood over the continent, and this flood had to never, ever stop, until there was nothing else to conquer, lest Kattail's supposedly "miraculous" modernization reforms were to be his own undoing..."

 MCW_kiania_friere_desc:0 ""They speak of every achievement, everything Macawia has gained in the last few years as if I personally heralded it, you know? As if every harpy that made up the whole was simply a vessel for my will, incapable of acting to benefit those around them. Perhaps it's telling, then, that they would choose that over the truth. No one likes it when the answer is right beneath their beaks."\n\n§YBorn§!: 7th March 982, Sao Penario\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a wealthy trading family in Sao Penario, the Friere twins were inseperable for most of their formative years. Both excelled at different subjects, but they decided to enter the Macawian bureaucracy at a low level to work their way up together. Their efforts caught the eye of then-incumbent Julio Penario, who wished for a single protege to teach the ropes to. After some time they were able to convince him to take them both, but challenge them against each other every so often in order to prove who would truly follow his footsteps.\n\nAfter a few years and a low blow by Kiaque, who'd clearly lost sight of their original goal, Kiania was left to her own devices, alone in a world she and her brother were meant to better together. But she did not give up, she couldn't. Utilising her particularly fiery brand of Harmony she was able to slowly take hold of the growing distaste with Julio's PRA and use it to form a rapidly growing counterweight.\n\nNow she stands atop her amassed people, ready and willing to reshape Macawia as she needs. While there may be no rest in sight for her, perhaps there may be a chance to reconcile with her brother.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §GBlakasmoko§!"

Kiaque never held it against her, as Julio described that she was 'tired of having to take care of him,' but he couldn't say it didn't hurt to hear. To avoid wallowing on it, at Julio's behest, Kiaque threw himself into the training fully.\n\nBy the end of his political tutelage, even in the middle of the PRA's semi-collapse, Kiaque was sure he'd be the one to succeed Julio and lead Macawia into the world stage. He was right, for better or worse. Now, with his work piling high before him, Kiaque hopes to find a chance to reconcile with his sister.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §GBlakasmoko§!"

 MCW_eloa_queruscos_desc:0 ""The flames of revolution burn so brightly the light of all others seems almost faint in comparison."\n\n§YBorn§!: 4th November 987, Querescos\n\n§YBiography§!: To call Eloa brutal would be to call a Griffon greedy; Woefully obvious and pointless. From a young age, her rough and tumble nature dragged her into conflicts again and again. With older students, with teachers, with military instructors and with anyone who slighted her as she grew. In an attempt to curb her attitude, her professors pushed for her to join the navy.\n\nIn spite of their hopes, she thrived in her new environment. Her disrespect of superior officers keeping her on the edge of being discharged, while her surprising diligence and dedication to any tasks she was assigned to managed to win enough respect to always keep her from it. Because of this Eloa has gained a reputation as a dog who works best when left to complete her tasks off the leash.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of her temperament, she was passed up for promotion time and time again. She would have remained in her minor position for years, if her superior officers didn't throw away their whole hand. Eloa knew that if and when the coupsters fell, the hatred their actions generated would fall on the rest of the navy, including her and her few friends. Thus, she acted.\n\nHer long-time comrade Alipha acted as the kind star for the revolution to follow, while Eloa fell into the role of an effectively brutal revolutionary, a role she took to with her normal diligence, dedication and efficiency. Now she stands at the head of the revolution, her allies in line behind her, ready to do what needs to be done.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §GStardustSpix§!"

I would not call for a revolution if there were any other options, but our hands are tied!\n\nLiberdade ou morte! Uma Macawia grátis para todos!"\n\n§YBorn§!: 6th December 986, Pombal\n\n§YBiography§!: One would not expect Alipha to be capable of such a feat, perhaps they wouldn't even expect them to be able to kill, but she stands here nevertheless. Born to a fairly well off couple of sailors in the Força Naval de Macaia, Alipha was raised to be kind. Her parents showed her their jobs on ships, allowing Alipha to learn the makeup of Macawia's aging fleet from a young age.\n\nEventually she found herself joining up to the force, against the wishes of her parents, and ended up thriving through the harsh training. Alipha was able to position herself as a promising fresh face, ready for a minor officer role, only for her kindness to those she found herself above to keep her locked in place. After years and years of her suggestions being ignored and pushed back, Alipha began to befriend her fellow sailors further. A few extra coins here, some more gruel there, and Alipha found herself a few useful allies alongside some very useful connections.\n\nAnd so she waited. Her superiors, for all their skills with ships of old, were greedy. It would only take, say, a few years before they've overplay their hand. Instead it took them a few weeks.\n\nIn the rush to secure her own position and eliminate any chances of the old guard surviving, Alipha used her good reputation to bring Harpies to her side. With Eloa, one of her sailor friends, backing her up with the more...brutal aspects, she was able to finally secure what was left of the country.\n\nNow she just needs to find a way to fit things back together, preferably in her own way.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §GStardustSpix§!"

 MCW_bastion_of_democracy_desc:0 "In a continent filled with autocracies, monarchies, and tyrants, Macawian democracy, our beautiful way of life, stands alone. But freedom is not free, just off our shores lays an old enemy, the Colthaginian 'Republic' has its dagger pointed toward us, poised to strike at our Western Islands. To maintain our way of life, we must check this threat."

 MCW_sink_or_swim_sink_modifier:0 "El Plano Engulfico"
 MCW_sink_or_swim_sink_modifier_desc:0 "Relatively conservative compared to other proposals for a financial restart in Macawia, a bundle of bills informally called "El Plano Engulfico" has made the rounds across the country, running on a platform of restarting the country with one weapon: a wholly new currency.\n\nEnough to upset the status quo but also as apolitical as possible to garner as much support from every side of the political aisle, El Plano Engulfico posits a multi-stage process of first creating a never-changing 'fake currency' for products and services to be compared against while building a new 'true currency' to slowly adjuts itself to the fake one. As one proponent of the bill said, "Everyone is scared and confused in an uncertain economy, so we asked ourselves, 'Then why not make it certain?'"\n\nWhile the plan seemed monstrously simple, almost naive, it is clear that it  is producing its intended outcome. Prices are stabilizing, domestic and international investment is being secured, and the average harpy is finding their concerns reduced one by one... thanks to play money."
 MCW_sink_or_swim_rise_modifier:0 "Carta da Fênix"
 MCW_sink_or_swim_rise_modifier_desc:0 "The Phoenix Charter is the collective name for a series of bills and related political micro-movements that seek to establish an unprecedented unity of modern left- and right-wing elements to jumpstart the Macawian economy: tri-lateral collective bargaining agreements between the workers, the corporations, and the government. Initially derided as both socialist and capitalist (and sometimes supremacist), The Phoenix Charter appealed to many parliament members if only after tiring negotiations, showing off its multi-partisan nature before it was even put into law.\n\nIn short, each sector of the economy—for example, agriculture, tourism, and mining—would be populated by workers' unions, corporate boards, and selected local representatives of the economics ministry. Each sector would then write and uphold its own laws as long as each party agrees to it, with each party on equal legal standing.\n\nWhile it is certainly not a perfect system, its early results seem to be promising. Steering the tide away from unstable revolution while kickstarting progress for the lower classes has, at least for now, sown the seeds for a more permanent peace."
 MCW_sink_or_swim_swim_modifier:0 "The Tidal Theorum"
 MCW_sink_or_swim_swim_modifier_desc:0 "A major flaw in a laissez-faire democracy is how it can facilitate sloth and apathy. A harpy can be proud of their rights and liberties, but said rights couldn't help them stare down the barrel of a multi-national company's metaphorical gun and win. It would take a mightier creature to right systemic wrongs. A caudillo, perhaps...\n\nBut while President Kiaque will never go as far as declare a military dictatorship just to fix the economy, the resemblances can't be helped after him personally approving a package of bills known as The Tidal Theorem, granting him and select other creatures special powers to address the woes of socio-economic inequality. Viewing the poor and downtrodden as, in practice, outside of the economy and needing to be brought back in for their own safety, The Tidal Theorem allows the president and the relevant lower-level authorities to strongarm offending corporations and other institutions into uplifting the lower classes, including their workers—all on pain of taxes, jail time, or worse, up to and including the dissolution of trusts.\n\nWhen the above is laid on a moral foundation of supporting the oppressed against a singular evil menace, it no doubt has had both its supporters and its deadly effective results, although Kiaque insists that it is not socialism he is practicing."
 MCW_sink_or_swim_coup_modifier:0 "Running On Empty"
 MCW_sink_or_swim_coup_modifier_desc:0 "The economy is in shambles! Yet again! As necessary as the navy takeover was to protect Macawia's legacy, it came with the unfortunate side effect of crushing any positive changes made by the previous government to rekindle the nation's development. It is paramount we address the issue as soon as possible, before the consequences become too drastic for the new regime."

 MCW_army_abroad:0 "An Army For Abroad"
 MCW_army_abroad_desc:0 "Our guns have laid dormant, unused. For all its faults, Macawia has no serious need for so many soldiers standing around on its soil. Deterrence can only go so far before it becomes selfish hoarding and busywork.\n\nWe have forgotten that we are a beacon of democracy, a light of liberty, to the world... and what use is a light if we are to hide it under a basket, afraid it will be snuffed out?\n\nOur armed forces shall be taken off of home duty. They will be trained to fight where they will be needed most."
 MCW_army_abroad_2:0 "An Army For Abroad"
 MCW_army_abroad_2_desc:0 "What is a Macawian's duty, their call to arms? A healthy sense of nationalism? That is only half the answer, for many nations with atrocious values and ideals have their ardent supporters to this day, and unfortunately, said nations also possess standing armies competent enough to best our own.\n\nWhat is our call, then? That they shall answer not to those in power but to those utterly stripped of it. We have the training and the firepower, the victims of oppressive regimes do not. An ordinary warrior will fight to gain territory or, more nobly, to protect the ones they know and love back home... but the Macawian will study foreign lands, train in them, live off the earth of a new country, and risk their life for a complete stranger.\n\nFor with Macawia, the stakes are independence or death."
 MCW_army_abroad_3:0 "Harmony's Strongest Warriors"
 MCW_army_abroad_3_desc:0 "Rumors swirl of the rest of the world seeking to emulate the Macawian model of harmonic intervention. True, this is admirable, but they forget a crucial component of our formula: that every member of the squad, of the battalion, and of the entire army group must not be needlessly chained by command but instead be free to act as they see fit, trusting themselves like true commandos on the field.\n\nAnd no, this is not to promote selfish show-offs. If anything, this leeway is the martial embodiment of the freedom so engrained in the Macawian way of life. We do not just advocate for democracy in our politics but in every facet of our existence. Only in this can we advance harmony: by being mature enough to strike out on our own in saving others from the oblivion of tyranny."
 MCW_army_at_home:0 "An Army For Home"
 MCW_army_at_home_desc:0 "The Macawian way of life is under threat of extinction. That may not be obvious now, but every citizen will do well to notice the alarming trend of revolutions and counter-revolutions, both buttressed by ideas not exactly welcoming of the freedoms we enshrine.\n\nWith this in mind, the Macawian military has taken crucial steps forward in ensuring that, should the rest of the world die in the dark, the light of harmony shall survive here. Training operations are happening right now, conducted across the islands, simulating invasions on our very own beaches and homes, pushing as far to the inner jungles. Every soldier is getting a crash course on fighting in familiar places, because there exists the very real possibility that the real deal may not be far off..."
 MCW_army_at_home_2:0 "An Army For Home"
 MCW_army_at_home_2_desc:0 "To shoot at your foes in a far-away country for a cause far removed from everyday life is, understandably, a deal breaker for many would-be volunteers for any army. Even the concept of protecting one's country can at times turn nebulous, especially in an archipelago, where a São Penário may not have any personal relations with an Ornithian.\n\nBut the sights and sounds of armed and armored harpies coming at your door, asking for weak points in your neighborhood, how you could theoretically hold your home town against the apocalypse until nothing more can be done...\n\nThat, more than any proper training, would light a fire in anyone, civilian or not, to brace for any onslaught."
 MCW_army_at_home_3:0 "The Children Of Branickii"
 MCW_army_at_home_3_desc:0 ""Visualize the end of the world, the unthinkable. The identity of who has caused it or the 'righteous cause' they may use to justify their actions—it does not matter. Imagine them all the same, circling around where you live like vultures poised to strike. Now remember the many skills and capabilities you must possess to delay utter disaster, to afford your loved ones just enough time so that a slaughter would instead be an evacuation. You will have to do desperate things just to maintain a level head."\n\n"However, that is only about protecting your unarmed friends and family. Do not forget your squadmates. Enough pithy slogans have been said about teamwork: how you communicate with each other will mean precious days, hours, minutes, seconds. You know these opposing forces cannot be stopped, but what you know is that, together, you all can make them pay dearly for every inch of soil, for this is your soil. You know these parks, these schools, these streets, these homes like the back of your claw. And you will know, too, that it will burn in flames."\n\n"Then, stop picturing all this in your head. Just by thinking of the unthinkable, you've gotten into the mindset fitting for a perfect warden of these isles. You will not need me to push you to excel, because, above all else, you will do anything to keep that tragic imagination just that: a harmless imagination.""

From a young age, her rough and tumble nature dragged her into conflicts again and again. With older students, with teachers, with military instructors and with anyone who slighted her as she grew. In an attempt to curb her attitude, her professors pushed for her to join the navy.\n\nIn spite of their hopes, she thrived in her new environment. Her disrespect of superior officers keeping her on the edge of being discharged, while her surprising diligence and dedication to any tasks she was assigned to managed to win enough respect to always keep her from it. Because of this Eloa has gained a reputation as a dog who works best when left to complete her tasks off the leash.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of her temperament, she was passed up for promotion time and time again. She would have remained in her minor position for years, if her superior officers didn't throw away their whole hand. Eloa knew that if and when the coupsters fell, the hatred their actions generated would fall on the rest of the navy, including her and her few friends. Thus, she acted.\n\nHer long-time comrade Alipha acted as the kind star for the revolution to follow, while Eloa fell into the role of an effectively brutal revolutionary, a role she took to with her normal diligence, dedication and efficiency. Now she stands at the head of the revolution, ready to do what needs to be done.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! StardustSpix"

Born to a fairly well off couple of sailors in the Força Naval de Macaia, Alipha was raised to be kind. Her parents showed her their jobs on ships, allowing Alipha to learn the makeup of Macawia's aging fleet from a young age.\n\nThough their attempts to disuade her from the naval force came to naught, as she ended up sneaking off one night to join up in order to help protect her home. Alipha was able to position herself as a promising fresh face, ready for a minor officer role, only for her kindness to those she found herself above to keep her locked in place. After years and years of her suggestions being ignored and pushed back, Alipha began to befriend her fellow sailors further. A few extra coins here, some more gruel there, and Alipha found herself a few useful allies alongside some very useful connections.\n\nAnd so she waited. Her superiors, for all their skills with ships of old, were greedy. It would only take, say, a few years before they've overplay their hand. Instead it took them a few weeks.\n\nIn the rush to secure her own position and eliminate any chances of the old guard surviving, Alipha used her good reputation to bring Harpies from across the isles to her side. With Eloa, one of her sailor friends, backing her up with the more...brutal aspects, she was able to finally secure what was left of the country.\n\nNow she just needs to find a way to fit things back together, preferably in her own way.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

In this, perhaps, eternal life could be found in a legacy cemented in the cult of the cadet.\n\nIn light of Macawia's new owners, Inacio Guerra falling to the top was the logical conclusion of a navy gaining for itself a nation-sized playground. Hailing from a long line of modern-day officers and pre-republic pirates, Inacio was a storybook hero come to life: able to back up his bluster about freedom with shot and shell, he would regale everyone with tales of his feats on the seven seas, his only regret being that he bemoaned how there was little action at all to do his duties in. Fortunately, with a reborn governance and the legend himself at the seat of power, Macawia would take up its sword and destroy tyranny worldwide once and for all, with Inacio's name forever carved into the annals of history. Who wouldn't love a president that charged headlong into battle?\n\nNow, like with storybooks for children, his recounting of tales sounds too perfect to be real.

Born and raised in the suburbs of Manehattan to some rather adventurous parents, Midnight Lancer is a friendly stallion who grew up with a burning passion for flight. During his youth, the pegasus travelled with his parents across Equestria and beyond, exposing the pony to many different worldviews and perspectives on life. One visit in particular showed Lancer the incredible potential of airships, igniting a burning passion for aviation that would grow alongside him.\n\nThe pegasus arrived in Macawia in 1001, hoping to work alongside the harpies who mastered the skies and inspired him as a colt. He spent years working his way up the ranks in the newly established Air Force, doing everything he could to show his commanders that the best way forward is with a fast, powerful strike. After the battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, Midnight realized the age of the airship was nearing it's end, and advocated for leadership to experiment with the airplanes he felt would soon replace them. Fellow pilots who served with Lancer describe the pegasus as chipper, overly trusting and a bit jumpy when caught off guard, but they all agree he's nothing if not passionate for his work. Some may say a pegasus doesn't belong in a nation of harpies, but Midnight is determined to help these birds soar.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opalradiance"

 MCW_what_free:0 "Define The Rights Of Those Who Toil"
 MCW_what_free_desc:0 "Six, eight, twelve hours; how much a harpy works depends on what they're doing, where they're doing it, the phase of the moon and how their boss is feeling at the moment. It might be heavy-handed, but standardized work hours and pay are the bare minimum we should aim for."

 MCW_shift:0 "Change The Wording"
 MCW_shift_desc:0 "Our long lives and splendid memories mean that subtleties and tone are almost as important for communication as words themselves.

 macawia_political.1.t:0 "The Sunset Years" #Comma
 macawia_political.1.d:0 "Here lay the sunset years of his term, a five or seven PM sit-down at his desk. Or it had been. The president stood up after the last signature, leaving behind pen and pipe for a break and the vista that never failed to take his breath..\n\nThe view overlooked the vibrantly colourful strings of houses that danced from the ever-full ports to here, an office that had never resembled something corporate with all the plants that suffused it. From the distant windows crackled a radios honed in on the same bossa nova station, soulful strums of strings backing up a solemn croon: time for dinner, time for a break.\n\nYet the break over the new year had not given Julio much time to recover. The stereotype of Macawians lazing around under the sunshine was cold comfort for him at the start of the day, when meetings and reports and crammed every half-hour of his, remnants of a term birthed while mainland Zebrica writhed under the Storm King. Still, the finish line was in sight; if only for a brief moment, he—and the world—would have their respite.\n\nThe clack of a door knob then the ruffling of papers had him look back. His secretary blushed, a new stack of reports already on his desk. "My apologies." Her words rang reedy, but the nerdy aesthetic never came off as awkward. "Labour disputes, and the navy wants your opinion on some overseas ship designs."\n\n"It's alright, Santana," he said with a wave of the claw. "Just don't stress yourself. The night's young. Leave tomorrow's decisions for tomorrow... ah, and have a good night as always.""
 macawia_political.1.a:0 "His pipe lay by his desk, tempting him long after she left."
 macawia_political.2.t:0 "Caffeine"
 macawia_political.2.d:0 ""It's historic, isn't it?" Julio said to the zebra diplomat from Kása, taking the plank off and so the blimp took off into open skies. They both nursed their cultures' respective wake-up juices, fitting for a dawn whose rays slanted against zig-zagging hill roads and pedestrian bridges that cut through the heights like nothing, all to the smell of a hundred distant breakfasts. "Historic, just like our nations' friendship, Miss Bermuela." For her part, the Kásan was quite positive, showed little fear of heights.\n\nJulio's eye caught a familiar beak. "Yes, Kiaque! It's nice to see you. Say, this is Bermuela, head of the Kásan embassy right here... and Bermuela? This is Kiaque Freire, a rising star within the party. It's only natural that you both meet, and..."\n\nKiaque, him and his yellow face, had put away his papers on the railing, having laboured over the graphs and charts on his docket. (His own drink went unnoticed.) Julio, his political mentor, had advised him to make connections, and this young zebra seemed to be it. "It's very... very nice to meet you, Miss Bermuela."\n\n"Nice to meet you, too," she said, all polite with hoof outstretched.\n\nHis feathers felt wet. His beverage had tilted over—caught it just in time—papers flying away, nabbed them mid-air. Half-forcing the words out, making strict eye contact with her, "You must be from the Free State! I surely know an Ilha Roscan on sight." She didn't say anything—was he wrong? Maybe she was amused at his mistakes... he glanced at his own papers, then at Julio's strangely neutral expression staring at empty space... the empty space where Bermuela was still holding out her hoof. He quickly took it and shook it. "Say, when can we meet once again? I'd like to know you... and your country more, yes.""
 macawia_political.2.a:0 "In a hurry or a worry, and it's just some-thirty in the morning."
 macawia_political.3.t:0 "Sacred Recesses of Liberty"
 macawia_political.3.d:0 "Vibrant frescoes depicted not gods but the common harpy shining through in multi-coloured fashion, watching as a cloud of rainbow witnesses over filled-up legislature seats, the circular room leaving no literal sides to take even during a debate.\n\n"...but fellow harpies, as Equestrians say, a rising tide lifts all boats!" on rambled a PRA speaker, tugging his suit for cheap authority every other sentence, "and what the PTRJ proposes is fuelled by emotionalism! Why pass up the opportunities other countries will give to us so freely? No, the average Macawian will see their standard of life soar and without needless toil! Let the world have their low-effort labour; it's up to us use the profits to teach our Macawians higher-value skills."\n\nHis party's head sat behind him; he had heard better. The real meat would come later, and here rose a fast-rising star from the PTRJ. The twin sister of his protege in the PRA... oh, how Kiania would make her salvo against his own party's surface-level arguments: There was a sense of pride in Macawians instantly benefiting from their own discovery, and the PRA's trade policy would stifle poorer entrepreneurs here who couldn't compete with a foreign country's coffers.\n\nThen she looked at him from the other side. A withering glare that her feathered hat couldn't make any less dreadful. He knew how she viewed him: the top of an ancient, decaying—\n\n"Do well!" shouted her brother Kiaque from the other side. Shushes shot from Kiania, and Julio found himself surprised by joining in. His expert apprentice in the PRA breaking decorum?"
 macawia_political.3.a:0 "At least Kiania ignored the nuisance."
 macawia_political.4.t:0 "Alive, if Not Exactly Well"
 macawia_political.4.d:0 "Another session at the legislature loomed large. Elections would barge in not long after. They weren't today. They didn't matter.\n\nWhen Julio drank in the twilight sky after work, he'd already booked an extended weekend, a sort of political sightseeing across the country. Token points for the PRA aside, a pile of letters and reports had gathered not dust but crumpled edges courtesy of his worried claws and feathers.\n\nPorto Alto: resorts as colourful as the slums whose inhabitants were press-ganged to making touristy facades at gunpoint to service the Brancas, yet another political dynasty; Rio de Jandaia: temples built in the name of the industrious deity Roseifrons, spires peppered everywhere to stretch to the heavens and the pockets of devotees draining their muscles on a god whose spiritual mentors couldn't lift a single limb; Parrotana's inner jungles: foliage shrouded grey operations, of arms changing owners and involuntary donors of worse... and whether towards Ornithia or Uusi Hirvimaa, buccaneers shattered sea and sky alike. And above it all, the navy would riot if they wouldn't be considered—or wouldn't be given concessions, rather.\n\nPicturesque countrysides aside, here lay an oblivious paradise. Half a century of guilt, of burdens, would've broken his back if it could. His bed offered no comfort, yet restlessness bred thoughts... perhaps predictions of what was to come—a shapeless dream that yet lingered in his mind long enough to make him say, to start the session the next day:"

 macawia_political.5.t:0 "Brittle Omens"
 macawia_political.5.d:0 "The port of the peninsular city of Qeshaym jutted out into would-be Macawian waters, emblazoned on the shores with terraces and palm trees. A city of ancient towers and rowdy markets, this Colthaginian (or Coltvan) experience had much to offer Kiania as a roving tourist, and hawkish zebras often pointed her out as someone with much cash to part with.\n\nYet, it was no vacation, even if she yearned it to be. The inner blocks housed telltale signs of an underworld on the move, papered over with posters and messages featuring the Zarcas' faces. The files she'd read told of further discontent, of disgruntled farmers—of creatures Zarca could use as step one in a bid to re-arm Colthage, and then... for all the PRA's faults of being in uncontested and corruptible power for half a century, at least the names and policies shifted. But a tyrant was here, ruler of a republic of dirt but an empire of yet more—the conclusion of a dozen eavesdropped conversations, of Coltvan zebras dreading the Sufrit's next move and hoping for some revolutionary Zesh (whose name was long and full of letters).\n\nThe neutral smell of a small plate that offered honeyed grain, peppered with bits of falafel, said as much. It looked empty by her table. Past the practised smiles for visitors and the guards or garrison that watched her, Colthage's own troubles may as well be a terrifying, bullet-braced forge.\n\nShe'd had enough."
 macawia_political.5.a:0 "The legislators need to know."
 macawia_political.6.t:0 "Every Hoofstep Met Fiercely"
 macawia_political.6.d:0 "A complete and utter disaster.\n\nGeneral Zloberto Zarbosa walked down the line, inspecting the soldiers standing in formation, or rather, what was left of them. Each one was covered in little yellow splats of paint, representing gunshot wounds. Ninety percent of his formation 'died' in the simulated naval invasion, rendering his division completely combat ineffective. While technically achieving his objectives, in reality, he would've been driven back to the ocean in the ensuing counterattack.\n\n"So. Will we call it a draw?" Field Marshal Fethee de Selva, the defending commander, said with a grin on his face, approaching the general.\n\nZloberto laughed, "Yes. Let's call it a draw." He couldn't help but smile. How could he not? knowing the fate of any invader who would dare step on Macawian soil."
 macawia_political.6.a:0 "The best offence..."
 macawia_political.7.t:0 "The Strength and the Courage"
 macawia_political.7.d:0 "Cameras up on high set the scene. Their airship offered them a sweeping view of pristine mountains and lush jungles, divided by rivers and cities that bled bustle for every multi-coloured "ant" that was really a free harpy moving about his or her special business. On the side, the narrator for the film practised her lines—special emphasis on the words, "Macawia Grande". The pride and joy, a paradise so good, the suggestion was simple: Love it or leave it.\n\nOther actors with other motives rehearsed for when they'd land at their next shoot: officers' hats bearing Colthage's zebra emblem, helmets and horns of typical Chitali warriors, packets of fake blood to spill, directions to show a sword and gun shoved into frame from off-screen over screams. Screams that stabbed Kiaque's ears and heart. "Mister Penario, how does this not look like overkill? Colthage has been a rival, and the Hindians competed with us historically, but... "\n\n"But what?" Julio asked over his apprentice's shifting eyes, president and overseer of the project. "It's the paradox of liberty: we fight to preserve it, yet tread carelessly and we spawn a generation who ignores their parents' sacrifices. These films for cinemas, schools, and more will rapidly wake up the republic."\n\n"Still, Mister President, we have to think long-term! We'd be shifting our ethos to something more martial, more authoritarian, more—!"\n\n"If someone threatened your sister's right to life with a knife, how would you act? What would you regret?"\n\n"I'd... I'd fight, yes, but regret? What did I do wrong, then?" he could only reply to Julio's sigh."

 macawia_political.11.t:0 "Shaking Hooves" #Guest Starring and Writing Midnight Lancer
 macawia_political.11.d:0 "After a long day of meetings, Kiaque stared at the door to his office with trepidation. Julio didn't seem to care much when he raised the request to meet with the heads of the air force, noting that they were a 'non factor', though that only made the harpy more invested in seeing them. With how focused the army and navy were on politics, why hadn't the air force seen the same kind of inclination? The presidential protégé sat in his chair, deep in thought when a soft knocking came from the other side of his door.\n\nStepping into his office was the second in command of the Força Aérea Macaia, Augusto Constant. "At last we finally meet, meu amigo! I have heard much about you from my subordinates, Mister Freire, we're all watching to see what you'll do when the time comes!" The officer stepped forward with a smile larger than even the 'nicest' of admirals, holding out his hand to the protégé. These honest pleasantries had caught Kiaque off guard, as such a demeanor was nothing like he had seen when meeting with the navy, though he shook his hand all the same.\n\nFollowing shortly behind him was someharpy, or rather.. somepony, he had not seen before. Trotting into the office with a saddlebag full of papers was a small, dark furred pony with wings and a cyan blue mane. "Sorry for the tardiness, Mister Freire, I'm Sky Marshal Midnight Lancer! It's been a while since we've met with a big wig." Flying up onto his desk, the pegasus held out his hoof for Kiaque. "Good to meet ya!"\n\nTime seemed to freeze for a moment as the pegasus rested his hooves on a desk worth far more than his salary and documents far more important than himself, the second in command staring at him with a mixture of shock and horror. Before he could respond, however, Kiaque reacted. Surprisingly, no yelling or admonishment came forth from the soon to be president, instead a chuckle escaped him that slowly evolved into an uproarious laugh. It was absolutely absurd that in a nation of harpies standing so tall, his air force was led by this little pony. Midnight tilted his head in confusion, but was quickly met with a shake of his hoof."

 macawia_political.14.d:0 "Julio's words shot through Kiaque's mind when the head of AMIGO himself—Nicolau de Pyrrhura decked in pristine white blazer and obsidian skivvy—plopped a leg onto the president's table: "Keep them happy. It is best to preserve the balance...."\n\nThe cocky grin on Nicolau's face, sunglasses angled just right to briefly blind Kiaque with the setting sun's rays, made that difficult. Upon entry, the intelligence officer had gushed about his radio show and the future of warfare: information. Following Julio before him, Nicolau said, and funding AMIGO the same old percentage would finally give Macawia a dangerous advantage in the Middle Sea. And beyond.\n\nThen Kiaque held up a hand of negation. "I understand that you talk a big deal and you mean it, but the republic does not benefit from a presidential pushover."\n\nNicolau's sass left him. "This agency's seen upstart candidates like you in every generation and we've negotiated with every last one of them. What makes you think you can drive us a hard bargain?"\n\n"Let's say that I'm an avid listener. Gutsy for someone who deals in secrets to broadcast everything, but I digress." Sliding a folder across the table, he went on, "Yet for all your talk about the future of warfare, the future itself is uncertain. I need to know if the AMIGO of today can handle something... routine. You will get the funding you've always had, provided you make our national waters privateer-free."\n\nOpening up the documents, Nicolau then scanned its contents. "Secrets I don't know about?

 macawia_political.15.d:0 "Kiaque had remained spooked when the AMIGO agent that woke him up in the wee hours—dressed in unassuming clothes that blended in with the foliage—had left an envelope on the window sill. Or at least he might've been an AMIGO agent; he might as well've been an errand boy, paid by the organization to send a letter to the president then scram.\n\nWithin the envelope, a gallery of photographs and notes. A pirate, one marked with the name Miyopista, was first shown mottled with lashes and bruises carving their way through his back, only for other pictures—its subjects bloodied and pulped, fortunately of other brigands—to come in and offer a comparison: AMIGO's "interrogation methods" seemed much lighter than what these criminals did to their own.\n\nThe next set of pictures and notes detailed the finest medical assistance Macawia had to offer for Miyopista to recover from his many injuries, along with a buffet for nourishment. Some insanely quick rehabilitation later, he apparently had spilled the beans on his hard life as a thug—no loyalty among this sea of thieves, he claimed. The Macawian government would give him a good life, AMIGO then said, if only he would rat out his old friends and lead the charge... on the pain of blackmailing his non-pirate family and friends about his whereabouts, revealing that he didn't die nobly as a cadet but instead turned rogue, heaping cruel shame upon his name.\n\nThe final photograph was him capturing his former captain, locking him up in a cage like a wild animal, to be exhibited as a trophy for justice. His ex-best friend. Not a smile could be found. Resentment and wrath, Kiaque could see in the latter's eyes, but in Miyopista's?\n\nFear."

 macawia_political.16.d:0 "The Macawian archipelago, well known for its many islands and bays that served as important trade routes for plenty a mercantile focused polity in the past, is a veritable treasure trove of resources. That is, its largest islands are, while the smaller ones that lack permanent settlements are usually ignored, citing expenses in setting up the necessary infrastructure to exploit them. It was simply easier and more profitable to trade our excess for demanded materials.\n\nRecent events have presented a change in our national strategy. A trio of deluded prospectors, going off faulty information, has discovered a deposit of oil! This is the sort of breakthrough that was needed to fuel our naval modernisation, as coal-powered engines are rapidly becoming obsolete in contemporary times. There is only one issue, besides the cost of setting up a well to tap into it.\n\nIt was discovered on an island located closely to [CTH.GetNameDef]. In their ascendant periods, [CTH.GetAdjective]s were all too happy to claim it as part of their lands, but Macawian ships warded off any attempt to turn that idea into reality. In the past, the price of defending it was only national pride, but now it is of vital priority to ensure it doesn't fall into their hooves."

The rest of the world might have given us a strong, healthy right arm, but if we're not careful, it'll mercilessly cut off the left.

Her own private thoughts were also a mystery. Some said she was a communist; others said she was secretly a fascist. Some claimed she was a deranged mix of both. None denied her enthusiasm.\n\nBut Kiaque knew Eloa. It was hard to properly label her as belonging to any one party. She constantly questioned any and all doctrine and dogma, and she wasn't afraid to ask the hard questions.\n\n"So, that's it, then? The job is mine?" They hadn't spent that much time together, but Kiaque knew a sly smile when he saw it. "Because I have... ideas. A great many ideas. Lots of ideas! You won't regret this!" At least her enthusiasm was genuine. What plans did she have for the future?\n\n"We can't keep using our old strategies. At this point, Kiaque, my friend, we're just applying a tiny bandage to a missing arm. The new millenium is the time for change; I can feel it."\n\nKiaque raised an eyebrow at her.

It wasn't addressed to the head of the party, or to the President, or to his government in general; no, it was addressed to Kiaque Ara Freire in particular.Curious, he walked up to his desk, picked it up, and read the writing on the envelope. It had been sent by Eloa, and judging from the ink stains and droplets around the letters, it had been written either in a hurry or in a frenzy. What was inside?\n\nKiaque used Penario's letter opener to cut away a section of the envelope. It had been a former president's, long ago, passed down from government to government like a family heirloom. He started reading, pacing around the room as Eloa described her first mission in detail. He smiled as he read her words; the letters he received were usually written in a dull, formal tone. What had she done? He thought as he turned around with the letter in his hands. Eloa's tale started like many others these days, with her and some of her colleagues working together to uncover a pirate ring planning an illegal attack on a seaside town. Some of her allies had infiltrated the crew, earned a small degree of trust, and arranged a meeting with their captain at the docks. Unorthodox, but still technically legal.\n\nKiaque stopped in his tracks as he read what happened next. Eloa had marched into the docks and confronted the captain by herself. According to her, they had had quite a lively chat before she lost her patience. What? He sat down, his full attention on the letter now. The remainder of the letter was written as if it were the grisly retelling of an epic battle, one that ended with Eloa smashing the gang leader's beak into the docks before throwing him into the sea.\n\nKiaque wondered, perhaps, if not all of the tiny droplets splattered on the letter were ink. That night, he didn't need Macawian coffee to stay awake."

The Partido Republicano Alto had always been a fairly broad coalition, pulling many Macawians together despite their differences. Together, they'd secured a record nine terms in office, something which few true democracies around the world could rival.\n\nThreats to split from the coalition were frequent, of course, but they were usually just that, a way for a group within the party that was (or felt) neglected to make its voice heard. However, this time, it was no mere threat.\n\nSome of the more enthusiastic, for want of a better term, harpies on the party's left wing had decided that enough was enough, and that they weren't willing to deal with a traitor who sold out Macawia and its workers to "the heartless beast of international capitalism". They had split and formed their own party, the (Julio had to squint to read the name, as it had been scribbled over and rewritten many times) Movimento Democrático Macaia.

 macawia_coup.1.d:0 "For fringe radio host Sarmieto, what had once been decried as mad theories found instead vindication with the new bosses in São Penário showering him with many benefits. He didn't want much, just commercials about his show on state stations and a promise that he would not be suppressed. Of course, a military coup was nothing to sneeze at—he'd thought the elites were finally gunning for him! Instead, they'd come for the president and his slow, rotten, and geriatric band of corrupt politicians blinding everyone from the truth. Sarmieto's only condition, Inacio had told him, was to not do anything stupid. Everything else? He could say anything to his heart's content, broadcast to every home.\n\nA suggestion from Inacio about Kasa, however, had set the scene.\n\nSarmieto proceeded to babble on about Kasa. He'd been a rare adversary against the zebras and their ilk; only he'd known all along about what they were stealing from the Macawians, from their saviors. To his amazement, he'd been proven right far quicker than he could've ever imagined: Were the prices of bread going to rise thanks to a cabal of Kasan executives meddling in Macawian bakeries? They would! Would there be retaliations from Kasans on sea as their petty "thanks" for being given democracy and safe harbor? Yes, for the papers reported on a Macawian shipwreck a day later. Were Macawian tourists and immigrants in Kasa escaping in droves with horror stories about the criminal underbelly of Seguro? Suddenly, an army of harpies rushed to write him letters asking if they could share their stories on air.\n\nMaybe we'll even go to war some day, he then mused tonight. Somewhen, somehow, they would soon dismantle the monster that was Kasa and its insidious pretense of freedom."

The parasites would suck them off no more Inacio would do them the final disservice they deserved: dishonoring Mansu Erba's grave once and for all, that idiot of a pacifist.\n\n"What do you mean she can't be found!?" he then yelled at a portable telephone as he and his team stood in the middle of some Kasan nowhere, cross-referencing maps and witness testimony of where Mansu could've possibly been buried.\n\n"Oh, uh, you see sir," the shaky voice of a no-name official called in from the other side, "when she died... the plan wasn't a burial."\n\n"They turned her into ash, didn't they? I can spit on them!"\n\n"The ashes... they exist. Just scattered—"\n\n"Tell me what river they threw her in and I'll personally see to it that it is dammed so it will never flow again then we'll bombard it into oblivion!"\n\nA gulp could be heard across the phone, the gulp heard across Kasa.

To pay tribute to the home islands, even if minimal, had been the norm, the usual price for their piracy, but now, their superiors had no moral authority. Bandits—not proper code-abiding pirates—had taken over São Penário and the rest.\n\nBut Celaeno had been prepared for contingencies. Her tall figure overlooked the rest of her space: a radio station nested upon the mountains, right by piers where her crew's airship was waiting for her word.\n\n"Tanakama, Uusi!" she called. "Today is your time to shine! The republic as we know it has fallen, but that doesn't have to be the end! Isn't this what we strived for!? Everyone with a gun or a sword, raise your eyes to the skies and get on board! If the harpies across the sea can't get harmony right, we will!"So as the sun set, flags would both rise on poles and sway upon passing airships, hastily taking on the colors of an independent island against a dusking horizon. Celaeno bore witness to the displays of newfound patriotism on her way home, floating through the clouds at the dawn of a new age. At long last, the creatures of Tanakama obtained liberty. The road ahead would still be rocky, to be sure—being a lonely island nation had its own problems, and many of the deer here might not still be fond of ceding their home to outsiders right now—but for the pirate captain, the adventure had just begun."

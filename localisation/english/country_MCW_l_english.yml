No one likes it when the answer is right beneath their beaks."\n\n§YBorn§!: 7th of March 970, Sao Penario\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a wealthy trading family in Sao Penario, the Friere twins were inseperable for most of their formative years. Both excelled at different subjects, but they decided to enter the Macawian bureaucracy at a low level to work their way up together. Their efforts caught the eye of then-incumbent Julio Penario, who wished for a single protege to teach the ropes to. After some time they were able to convince him to take them both, but challenge them against each other every so often in order to prove who would truly follow his footsteps.\n\nAfter a few years and a low blow by Kiaque, who'd clearly lost sight of their original goal, Kiania was left to her own devices, alone in a world she and her brother were meant to better together. But she did not give up, she couldn't. Utilising her particularly fiery brand of Harmony she was able to slowly take hold of the growing distaste with Julio's PRA and use it to form a rapidly growing counterweight.\n\nNow she stands atop her amassed people, ready and willing to reshape Macawia as she needs. While there may be no rest in sight for her, perhaps there may be a chance to reconcile with her brother.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Blakasmoko"

Kiaque never held it against her, as Julio described that she was 'tired of having to take care of him,' but he couldn't say it didn't hurt to hear. To avoid wallowing on it, at Julio's behest, Kiaque threw himself into the training fully.\n\nBy the end of his political tutelage, even in the middle of the PRA's semi-collapse, Kiaque was sure he'd be the one to succeed Julio and lead Macawia into the world stage. He was right, for better or worse. Now, with his work piling high before him, Kiaque hopes to find a chance to reconcile with his sister.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Blakasmoko"

 MCW_eloa_queruscos_desc:0 ""The flames of revolution burn so brightly the light of all others seems almost faint in comparison."\n\n§YBorn§!: 4th of November 970, Querescos\n\n§YBiography§!: To call Eloa brutal would be to call a Griffon greedy; Woefully obvious and pointless. From a young age, her rough and tumble nature dragged her into conflicts again and again. With older students, with teachers, with military instructors and with anyone who slighted her as she grew. In an attempt to curb her attitude, her professors pushed for her to join the navy.\n\nIn spite of their hopes, she thrived in her new environment. Her disrespect of superior officers keeping her on the edge of being discharged, while her surprising diligence and dedication to any tasks she was assigned to managed to win enough respect to always keep her from it. Because of this Eloa has gained a reputation as a dog who works best when left to complete her tasks off the leash.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of her temperament, she was passed up for promotion time and time again. She would have remained in her minor position for years, if her superior officers didn't throw away their whole hand. Eloa knew that if and when the coupsters fell, the hatred their actions generated would fall on the rest of the navy, including her and her few friends. Thus, she acted.\n\nHer long-time comrade Alipha acted as the kind star for the revolution to follow, while Eloa fell into the role of an effectively brutal revolutionary, a role she took to with her normal diligence, dedication and efficiency. Now she stands at the head of the revolution, ready to do what needs to be done.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! StardustSpix"

I call you all today, not as revolutionaries or comrades, but as liberators! Liberators of our home, which has fallen into the hands of such vile beasts! Were there another way, I would not call for a revolution, but this is the only choice that remains!\n\nLiberdade ou morte! Uma Macawia livre para todos!"\n\n§YBorn§!: 6th of December 968, Pombal\n\n§YBiography§!: One would not expect Alipha to be capable of such a feat, perhaps they wouldn't even expect her to be able to kill, but she stands at the peak nevertheless. Born to a fairly well off couple of sailors in the Força Naval de Macaia, Alipha was raised to be kind. Her parents showed her their jobs on ships, allowing Alipha to learn the makeup of Macawia's aging fleet from a young age.\n\nThough their attempts to disuade her from the naval force came to naught, as she ended up sneaking off one night to join up in order to help protect her home. Alipha was able to position herself as a promising fresh face, ready for a minor officer role, only for her kindness to those she found herself above to keep her locked in place. After years and years of her suggestions being ignored and pushed back, Alipha began to befriend her fellow sailors further. A few extra coins here, some more gruel there, and Alipha found herself a few useful allies alongside some very useful connections.\n\nAnd so she waited. Her superiors, for all their skills with ships of old, were greedy. It would only take, say, a few years before they've overplay their hand. Instead it took them a few weeks.\n\nIn the rush to secure her own position and eliminate any chances of the old guard surviving, Alipha used her good reputation to bring Harpies from across the isles to her side. With Eloa, one of her sailor friends, backing her up with the more...brutal aspects, she was able to finally secure what was left of the country.\n\nNow she just needs to find a way to fit things back together, preferably in her own way.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

When I'm up there, with the only thing between me and death being this fragile angel I call my plane, I feel like a completely different pony. I feel... alive..."\n\n§YBorn:§! 25th of August, 980\n\n§YBiography:§! Born and raised in the suburbs of Manehattan to some rather adventurous parents, Midnight Lancer is a friendly stallion who grew up with a burning passion for flight. During his youth, the pegasus travelled with his parents across Equestria and beyond, exposing the pony to many different worldviews and perspectives on life. One visit in particular showed Lancer the incredible potential of airships, igniting a burning passion for aviation that would grow alongside him.\n\nThe pegasus arrived in Macawia in 1001, hoping to work alongside the harpies who mastered the skies and inspired him as a colt. He spent years working his way up the ranks in the newly established Air Force, doing everything he could to show his commanders that the best way forward is with a fast, powerful strike. After the battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, Midnight realized the age of the airship was nearing it's end, and advocated for leadership to experiment with the airplanes he felt would soon replace them. Fellow pilots who served with Lancer describe the pegasus as chipper, overly trusting and a bit jumpy when caught off guard, but they all agree he's nothing if not passionate for his work. Some may say a pegasus doesn't belong in a nation of harpies, but Midnight is determined to help these birds soar.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opalradiance"

 MCW_corporate_chrome:0 "Privatise Chromite Mining"
 MCW_corporate_chrome_desc:0 "Ornithia's ample deposits of chromite must be the backbone of our future naval production.

 MCW_united_for_progress:0 "United For Progress!"
 MCW_united_for_progress_desc:0 "There are some, especially in Colthage, who think that having a parliament means we spend all of our time squabbling amongst ourselves while no work gets done.

 MCW_support_coffee:0 "Hold Up The Coffee Industry"
 MCW_support_coffee_desc:0 "Coffee is the lifeblood of bureaucracies around the globe.

 MCW_chrome_mines:0 "Develop Our Chromite Mines"
 MCW_chrome_mines_desc:0 "Chromium is an essential resource for building and maintaining a modern fleet. Luckily for us, it is plentiful on our western island. We need only to expand our current mines to feed our navy further. So what if conditions are made 'unsafe for workers' in doing so?"
 MCW_look_away_from_unsavoury:0 "Turn The Eyes Away"
 MCW_look_away_from_unsavoury_desc:0 "AMIGO's charter clearly states its goal: to protect Macawia from threats both external and internal. Nowhere on that document does it say that they should be given more power than absolutely necessary. While it is possible for the President to influence their actions somewhat, he can't control their every move, nor does he have control over the actions of individual agents."
 MCW_more_exports:0 "Subsidise Refineries"
 MCW_more_exports_desc:0 "An excess of raw materials means little if we lack the refineries to make use of them. By giving substantial grants for the expansion of our current refineries as well as building new ones, we can make the natural resources we already have more valuable."
 MCW_dislodge_mogul:0 "Dislodge The Moscada Mogul"
 MCW_dislodge_mogul_desc:0 "Allowing the duke of Moscada to run for governor after the unification was a mistake. His sly maneuvering ensured that today the city is little more than his family's personal fiefdom, his grandson in particular being a living insult to Macawian democracy. After some suspiciously spectacular election victories, the president has decided to allow AMIGO to make an example of them."
 MCW_professional_shippers:0 "Professionalise Trade Fleets"
 MCW_professional_shippers_desc:0 "Ferrying our resources to foreign markets will require an investment into our merchant fleet. We can expand it by building up new dockyards, which can also be converted to military use should the need arise."
 MCW_develop_inland:0 "Develop Our Inland Connections"
 MCW_develop_inland_desc:0 "Without proper roads and rail networks, our economy will be completely stunted. By facilitating internal movement, we can expand the financial opportunities for the average citizen. The new construction projects will also put a decent dent into our unemployment problem."
 MCW_plan_steel:0 "Plan Steel Production"
 MCW_plan_steel_desc:0 "An economy in the modern world is nothing without steel, everything from guns to factories is made from it. To truly compete with other powers, we must develop a strong domestic steel industry. Without it, it would only take a blockade to cripple us."
 MCW_time_to_choose:0 "The Issues Plaguing Us Today"
 MCW_time_to_choose_desc:0 "While Macawia might seem like a pleasant paradise from the outside, the truth is it's anything but. Poverty, crime, a sinking economy, and the navy's ironclad agenda are but a fraction of the issues we must address if we are to become what we are meant to be."
 MCW_blue_pill:0 "A Bastion Of Democracy..."
 MCW_blue_pill_desc:0 "The Storm scare should give us pause: When push comes to shove, how prepared are we to defend our rights and liberty? How ready are we to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves? This republic is indeed more than the soldiers and sailors it yields, but we must support them if we are to remain a safe haven."
 MCW_keep_it:0 "...If We Can Keep It"
 MCW_keep_it_desc:0 "Across the waves lays dormant an old enemy. The people of Colthage have held a dagger against us for centuries. Their growing naval strength is undeniable, as is their government's evil. Without question, they remain the greatest threat to our liberty. Something must be done."
 MCW_fite:0 "Fight For What Is Right"

 MCW_atlantis_mentality:0 "Aris Mentality"
 MCW_atlantis_mentality_desc:0 "We must be prepared should the worst come to pass. A simulated naval invasion exercise will be conducted on the beaches of Baía Listada. Two teams of a thousand soldiers will be organized, with one team simulating an enemy force trying to take the beaches. The lessons learned in this exercise should prove valuable in a worst-case scenario."
 MCW_red_pill:0 "An Archipelago Of Equals"
 MCW_red_pill_desc:0 "How freedom became possible in Macawia was through force, if only partly. Before the Republic of Sao Penario diplomatically turned the disparate isles into Macawia, they had to prove their principles in combat. To answer the injustices of today, then, we must be ready to uphold the rights of everycreature, not just everyharpy."
 MCW_fight_for:0 "Something To Fight For"
 MCW_fight_for_desc:0 "The means to fight means nothing without the will to fight. Our population is not ready for war, the years of peace have created an apathetically complacent mindset. We must take the initiative and use the newly formed mass media to remind our people of the threats that lie off our shores."
 MCW_do_what_we_must:0 "Do What We Must"
 MCW_do_what_we_must_desc:0 "Much of Macawian industry is dedicated to producing pointless luxury goods for a minority of the elite.

 MCW_anyway_this_cake:0 "Because We Can"
 MCW_anyway_this_cake_desc:0 "How exactly are we supposed to defend Macawia with snow globes and fancy toasters? Our luxury goods industry has given us a great reputation abroad, but it won't stop Colthage from invading the moment the opportunity presents itself. As much as it pains us, we must nationalize some of these industries if we are to survive."
 MCW_ahm_tired:0 "Does The Army Need That Much?" #TEMP
 MCW_ahm_tired_desc:0 "It's not like we'll ever need them if the other branches of our military do their jobs right. All the Army needs to do is maintain order in Macaia so the Navy and Air Force can do what they do best. Like anyone's ever going to manage to invade our islands..."
 MCW_ahm_scared_again:0 "What Of The Air Force?"
 MCW_ahm_scared_again_desc:0 "The Air Force is rather new in Macawia's history, and as such, isn't looked at too closely compared to her naval and army counterparts. While the other branches are focused on securing political power and influence over government officials, the Força Aérea Macaia, mostly thanks its very young age, has been largely untouched by the political dynamics of Macawia."
 MCW_spiral_stair:0 "Meet With The Admirals"
 MCW_spiral_stair_desc:0 "The navy is an impenetrable stronghold of influence in the republic. They may overstep their boundaries once in a while, but with a possible war with first the yetis and now anyone else in Zebrica given enough time, their hawkishness can be forgiven. Yet, even they must be tempered and must trust the democratic process."
 MCW_spiral_stair_two:0 "The Matter Of Fuel"

 macawia_political.1.t:0 "The Sunset Years" #Comma
 macawia_political.1.d:0 "Here lay the sunset years of his term, a five or seven PM sit-down at his desk. Or it had been. The president stood up after the last signature, leaving behind pen and pipe for a break and the vista that never failed to take his breath..\n\nThe view overlooked the vibrantly colourful strings of houses that danced from the ever-full ports to here, an office that had never resembled something corporate with all the plants that suffused it. From the distant windows crackled a radios honed in on the same bossa nova station, soulful strums of strings backing up a solemn croon: time for dinner, time for a break.\n\nYet the break over the new year had not given Julio much time to recover. The stereotype of Macawians lazing around under the sunshine was cold comfort for him at the start of the day, when meetings and reports and crammed every half-hour of his, remnants of a term birthed while mainland Zebrica writhed under the Storm King. Still, the finish line was in sight; if only for a brief moment, he—and the world—would have their respite.\n\nThe clack of a door knob then the ruffling of papers had him look back. His secretary blushed, a new stack of reports already on his desk. "My apologies." Her words rang reedy, but the nerdy aesthetic never came off as awkward. "Labour disputes, and the navy wants your opinion on some overseas ship designs."\n\n"It's alright, Santana," he said with a wave of the claw. "Just don't stress yourself. The night's young. Leave tomorrow's decisions for tomorrow... ah, and have a good night as always.""
 macawia_political.1.a:0 "His pipe lay by his desk, tempting him long after she left."
 macawia_political.2.t:0 "Caffeine"
 macawia_political.2.d:0 ""It's historic, isn't it?" Julio said to the zebra diplomat from Kása, taking the plank off and so the blimp took off into open skies. They both nursed their cultures' respective wake-up juices, fitting for a dawn whose rays slanted against zig-zagging hill roads and pedestrian bridges that cut through the heights like nothing, all to the smell of a hundred distant breakfasts. "Historic, just like our nations' friendship, Miss Bermuela." For her part, the Kásan was quite positive, showed little fear of heights.\n\nJulio's eye caught a familiar beak. "Yes, Kiaque! It's nice to see you. Say, this is Bermuela, head of the Kásan embassy right here... and Bermuela? This is Kiaque Freire, a rising star within the party. It's only natural that you both meet, and..."\n\nKiaque, him and his yellow face, had put away his papers on the railing, having laboured over the graphs and charts on his docket. (His own drink went unnoticed.) Julio, his political mentor, had advised him to make connections, and this young zebra seemed to be it. "It's very... very nice to meet you, Miss Bermuela."\n\n"Nice to meet you, too," she said, all polite with hoof outstretched.\n\nHis feathers felt wet. His beverage had tilted over—caught it just in time—papers flying away, nabbed them mid-air. Half-forcing the words out, making strict eye contact with her, "You must be from the Free State! I surely know an Ilha Roscan on sight." She didn't say anything—was he wrong? Maybe she was amused at his mistakes... he glanced at his own papers, then at Julio's strangely neutral expression staring at empty space... the empty space where Bermuela was still holding out her hoof. He quickly took it and shook it. "Say, when can we meet once again? I'd like to know you... and your country more, yes.""

 macawia_political.3.d:0 "Vibrant frescoes depicted not gods but the common harpy shining through in multi-coloured fashion, watching as a cloud of rainbow witnesses over filled-up legislature seats, the circular room leaving no literal sides to take even during a debate.\n\n"...but fellow harpies, as Equestrians say, a rising tide lifts all boats!" on rambled a PRA speaker, tugging his suit for cheap authority every other sentence, "and what the PTRJ proposes is fuelled by emotionalism! Why pass up the opportunities other countries will give to us so freely? No, the average Macawian will see their standard of life soar and without needless toil! Let the world have their low-effort labour; it's up to us use the profits to teach our Macawians higher-value skills."\n\nHis party's head sat behind him; he had heard better. The real meat would come later, and here rose a fast-rising star from the PTRJ. The twin sister of his protege in the PRA... oh, how Kiania would make her salvo against his own party's surface-level arguments: There was a sense of pride in Macawians instantly benefiting from their own discovery, and the PRA's trade policy would stifle poorer entrepreneurs here who couldn't compete with a foreign country's coffers.\n\nThen she looked at him from the other side. A withering glare that her feathered hat couldn't make any less dreadful. He knew how she viewed him: the top of an ancient, decaying—\n\n"Do well!" shouted her brother Kiaque from the other side. Shushes shot from Kiania, and Julio found himself surprised by joining in. His expert apprentice in the PRA breaking decorum?"

They didn't matter.\n\nWhen Julio drank in the twilight sky after work, he'd already booked an extended weekend, a sort of political sightseeing across the country. Token points for the PRA aside, a pile of letters and reports had gathered not dust but crumpled edges courtesy of his worried claws and feathers.\n\nPorto Alto: resorts as colourful as the slums whose inhabitants were press-ganged to making touristy facades at gunpoint to service the Brancas, yet another political dynasty; Rio de Jandaia: temples built in the name of the industrious deity Roseifrons, spires peppered everywhere to stretch to the heavens and the pockets of devotees draining their muscles on a god whose spiritual mentors couldn't lift a single limb; Parrotana's inner jungles: foliage shrouded grey operations, of arms changing owners and involuntary donors of worse... and whether towards Ornithia or Uusi Hirvimaa, buccaneers shattered sea and sky alike. And above it all, the navy would riot if they wouldn't be considered—or wouldn't be given concessions, rather.\n\nPicturesque countrysides aside, here lay an oblivious paradise. Half a century of guilt, of burdens, would've broken his back if it could. His bed offered no comfort, yet restlessness bred thoughts... perhaps predictions of what was to come—a shapeless dream that yet lingered in his mind long enough to make him say, to start the session the next day:"

 macawia_political.5.d:0 "The port of the peninsular city of Qeshaym jutted out into would-be Macawian waters, emblazoned on the shores with terraces and palm trees. A city of ancient towers and rowdy markets, this Colthaginian (or Coltvan) experience had much to offer Kiania as a roving tourist, and hawkish zebras often pointed her out as someone with much cash to part with.\n\nYet, it was no vacation, even if she yearned it to be. The inner blocks housed telltale signs of an underworld on the move, papered over with posters and messages featuring the Zarcas' faces. The files she'd read told of further discontent, of disgruntled farmers—of creatures Zarca could use as step one in a bid to re-arm Colthage, and then... for all the PRA's faults of being in uncontested and corruptible power for half a century, at least the names and policies shifted. But a tyrant was here, ruler of a republic of dirt but an empire of yet more—the conclusion of a dozen eavesdropped conversations, of Coltvan zebras dreading the Sufrit's next move and hoping for some revolutionary Zesh (whose name was long and full of letters).\n\nThe neutral smell of a small plate that offered honeyed grain, peppered with bits of falafel, said as much. It looked empty by her table. Past the practised smiles for visitors and the guards or garrison that watched her, Colthage's own troubles may as well be a terrifying, bullet-braced forge.\n\nShe'd had enough."

Ninety percent of his formation ‘died’ in the simulated naval invasion, rendering his division completely combat ineffective. While technically achieving his objectives, in reality, he would’ve been driven back to the ocean in the ensuing counterattack.\n\n"So. Will we call it a draw?" Field Marshal Fethee de Selva, the defending commander, said with a grin on his face, approaching the general.\n\nZloberto laughed, "Yes. Let's call it a draw." He couldn’t help but smile.

On the side, the narrator for the film practised her lines—special emphasis on the words, "Macawia Grande". The pride and joy, a paradise so good, the suggestion was simple: Love it or leave it.\n\nOther actors with other motives rehearsed for when they'd land at their next shoot: officers' hats bearing Colthage's zebra emblem, helmets and horns of typical Chitali warriors, packets of fake blood to spill, directions to show a sword and gun shoved into frame from off-screen over screams. Screams that stabbed Kiaque's ears and heart. "Mister Penario, how does this not look like overkill? Colthage has been a rival, and the Hindians competed with us historically, but... "\n\n"But what?" Julio asked over his apprentice's shifting eyes, president and overseer of the project. "It's the paradox of liberty: we fight to preserve it, yet tread carelessly and we spawn a generation who ignores their parents' sacrifices. These films for cinemas, schools, and more will rapidly wake up the republic."\n\n"Still, Mister President, we have to think long-term!

 macawia_political.11.d:0 "After a long day of meetings, Kiaque stared at the door to his office with trepidation. Julio didn't seem to care much when he raised the request to meet with the heads of the air force, noting that they were a 'non factor', though that only made the harpy more invested in seeing them. With how focused the army and navy were on politics, why hadn't the air force seen the same kind of inclination? The presidential protégé sat in his chair, deep in thought when a soft knocking came from the other side of his door.\n\nStepping into his office was the second in command of the Força Aérea Macaia, Augusto Constant. "At last we finally meet, meu amigo! I have heard much about you from my subordinates, Mister Freire, we're all watching to see what you'll do when the time comes!" The officer stepped forward with a smile larger than even the 'nicest' of admirals, holding out his hand to the protégé. These honest pleasantries had caught Kiaque off guard, as such a demeanor was nothing like he had seen when meeting with the navy, though he shook his hand all the same.\n\nFollowing shortly behind him was someharpy, or rather.. somepony, he had not seen before. Trotting into the office with a saddlebag full of papers was a small, dark furred pony with wings and a cyan blue mane. "Sorry for the tardiness, Mister Freire, I'm Sky Marshal Midnight Lancer! It's been a while since we've met with a big wig." Flying up onto his desk, the pegasus held out his hoof for Kiaque. "Good to meet ya!"\n\nTime seemed to freeze for a moment as the pegasus rested his hooves on a desk worth far more than his salary and documents far more important than himself, the second in command staring at him with a mixture of shock and horror. Before he could respond, however, Kiaque reacted. Surprisingly, no yelling or admonishment came forth from the soon to be president, instead a chuckle escaped him that slowly evolved into an uproarious laugh. It was absolutely absurd that in a nation of harpies standing so tall, his air force was led by this little pony. Midnight tilted his head in confusion, but was quickly met with a shake of his hoof."

It was simply easier and more profitable to trade our excess for demanded materials.\n\nRecent events have presented a change in our national strategy. A trio of deluded prospectors, going off faulty information, has discovered a deposit of oil! This is the sort of breakthrough that was needed to fuel our naval modernisation, as coal-powered engines are rapidly becoming obsolete in contemporary times. There is only one issue, besides the cost of setting up a well to tap into it.\n\nIt was discovered on an island located closely to [CTH.GetNameDef]. In their ascendant periods, [CTH.GetAdjective]s were all too happy to claim it as part of their lands, but Macawian ships warded off any attempt to turn that idea into reality.

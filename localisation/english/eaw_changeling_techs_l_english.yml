 #### Drones
 tech_changeling_a:0 "Specialised Factory Drones"
 tech_changeling_a_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialised tasks, we should look into how to improve our workers. Training a caste drones of workers specifically to work in factories, with the appropriate physical build and techniques to use in the workplace."
 
 tech_changeling_a2:0 "Specialised Miner Drones"
 tech_changeling_a2_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialised tasks, we should further train our workers. We should train a caste of miner drones with the aims of increasing the output of raw resources in the mines. The trained workers will have tougher carapaces from a special diet, and increased stamina for longer shifts underground."
 
 tech_changeling_a3:0 "Specialised Engineer Drones"
 tech_changeling_a3_desc:0 "Our drones need to be trained for specialised tasks, we should begin training our troops for specialised engineering tasks. We need dedicated combat engineers to construct temporary fortifications for the soldiers on the front lines. A tougher and stricter training regimen should give these engineers the strength they  need to put up defences quicker than usual."
 
 #### Love Tree
 tech_changeling_b:0 "Love Extraction"
 tech_changeling_b_desc:0 "Extracting love from another living creature, normally a pony, is a natural process for a changeling. To meet the increased demands of a growing nation, the natural magic involved in the process can be improved through research." 
 
 tech_changeling_b2:0 "Love Refining"
 tech_changeling_b2_desc:0 "War does not breed much love among the races of the world. To survive and fight in prolonged wars, we must find a way to get the most out of all the love we can harvest."
 
 tech_changeling_b3:0 "Advanced Breeding Techniques"
 tech_changeling_b3_desc:0 "A surplus of love means more changelings. We can look into methods of making more changelings; these methods can then be taught to the general populace. But first, our hypotheses must be 'tested' on some willing members of our science division."
 
 #### Military
 tech_changeling_c:0 "Warswarms"
 tech_changeling_c_desc:0 "A Warswarm is a group of changelings who have formed a unit to punch a hole in the enemies' front line. They are a versatile unit of changelings with the capacity to wreak havoc on the battlefield."
 
 tech_changeling_c2:0 "Magical Fuel Additives"
 tech_changeling_c2_desc:0 "Improvements to fuel technology and magical innovations have lead to the development of magically enhanced fuel to our vehicles.

 tech_changeling_c3:0 "Magical Munitions"
 tech_changeling_c3_desc:0 "Magically enhanced munitions are the natural next step for us to take.

 ## Strategic Path: Country modifiers
 tech_infiltrators_di:0 "Strategic Infiltration"
 tech_infiltrators_di_desc:0 "Favouring large scale infiltration, the strategic infiltration doctrine will allow infiltration companies to covertly suppress rebellious groups of individuals. It also details the proper way to scout the enemy."
 
 tech_shock_drop_cocoons:0 "Shock-Drop Cocoons"
 tech_shock_drop_cocoons_desc:0 "Changeling paratroopers will receive specialised training in tactical airborne insertion via shock-drop cocoons, which were first trialed during the Canterlot Invasion of 1002. Shock-drop troopers will rain down from planes in hardened and magically-protective cocoons that will smash into enemy positions, a brutal barrage of steel and chitin."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di2:0 "Chameleon Cloaks"
 tech_infiltrators_di2_desc:0 "The development of magically enchanted cloaks that can help hide the identity of a disguised or concealed changeling infiltrator. These cloaks also allow soldiers to blend in with terrain, not good enough to fool somepony on the ground but good enough to mostly hide them from enemy air support."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di3:0 "Spy Networks"
 tech_infiltrators_di3_desc:0 "Establishing spy networks in nations across the world will allow for better gathering of intelligence on the plans of local or opposing nations. A more local spy network would suppress any groups of partisans trying to organise themselves in territory we occupy."
 
 tech_infiltrators_di4:0 "Massive Impersonation"
 tech_infiltrators_di4_desc:0 "The mass impersonation of individuals in nations will allow us to perform subversive activities at a reduced cost. With more disguised changelings around to carry out plans, the easier it becomes to organise plots of subterfuge in other countries."

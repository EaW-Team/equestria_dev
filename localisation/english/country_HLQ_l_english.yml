HLQ_beasts_of_labour_idea:0 "Beasts of Labour"
HLQ_beasts_of_labour_idea_desc:0 "Ponies, traitors and other indesirables are far more useful alive than dead. This virtually free workforce can be strategically used to further increase our industrial output, in exchange for pressing them into forced service at the frontline."
HLQ_stormgriff_1:0 "Sturmgreife Assault Brigades"

HLQ_the_plague:0 "The Purple Plague"
HLQ_the_plague_desc:0 "So dubbed because of the purple colour its victims' faces take on before death, the Purple Plague is quite possibly the most catastrohpic disease the Griffonian Far-East has ever seen.

HLQ_officer_reforms_idea:0 "New General Staff"
HLQ_officer_reforms_idea_desc:0 "In the past, the command structure was weak and most of the decisions were made ad-hoc by knightly leaders on the field.

HLQ_volksgrenadiers_idea_desc:0 "A new recruitment program conceptualised by our general staff, the Volksgrenadiers are a new military formation focused on deployment of explosive ordnance to devastate our foes.

HLQ_pony_minorities_2_desc:0 "In spite of nearly three hundred years of colonisation and Griffonisation, there are still plenty of ponies living in Hellquill, still holding onto their ancient way of life and traditions.

HLQ_pony_minorities_3:0 "Pony Collaborators"

HLQ_free_transit_idea_2_desc:0 "[HLQ.GetLeader] has expanded the terms of the Neuland Act, opening an official government agency to more efficiently process immigrants arriving to Hellquill. Those who profess holding anti-pony opinions are more quickly approved than the others griffons."
HLQ_anarchy:0 "The New Regime"
HLQ_anarchy_desc:0 "Since its formation in the crusades of Grover II, Hellquill has always stood as a firm rock against the pony tide, even as their wealth and griffonpower waned over the years. There could be no hope for a violent revolt against the established order, for the militant knights controlled most aspects of the state's apparatus.\n\nNogriff could have predicted, though, that the mutiny would come from one of the knights' own, and now Hellquill is in turmoil as the normally rigid state structure suffers due to the ongoing anarchy."

HLQ_anarchy_2_desc:0 "Since its formation in the crusades of Grover II, Hellquill has always stood as a firm rock against the pony tide, even as their wealth and griffonpower waned over the years.

HLQ_stormgriff_rebellion_desc:0 "Incensed by the takeover from [HLQ.GetLeader], the Sturmgreife have launched their own reactionary uprising, intent on maintaining their standing in Hellquill.

HLQ_knight_scholars_idea_desc:0 "Under orders from [HLQ.GetLeader], all scientific facilities have been placed under supervision by his chosen knights, with orders to focus research exclusively on practical matters.

HLQ_stormgriff_4:0 "The Knights Of The Black Bolt"
HLQ_stormgriff_4_desc:0 "Compromises with the surviving Sturmgreifen has allowed them to continue serving in our armed forces, as specialised shock troops. It would seem that we have more in common than previously thought, making this a practical arrangement."

HLQ_pony_minorities_4:0 "Pony Serfs"
HLQ_pony_minorities_4_desc:0 "Ponies could never be equal to griffons, but it wouldn't be right to simply throw them away. Their real purpose is to be an exploited workforce fit only to serve their griffon masters in whichever capacity we deem satisfactory."
HLQ_levy_laws_idea:0 "The Steuergesetz"
HLQ_levy_laws_idea_desc:0 "War is on the horizon, approaching steadily, which calls for a swift response in the form of a mass levy on every able-bodied griffon. Their complaints do not interest us in the slightest; collective sacrifice is necessary to achieve the final victory over the ponies."

HLQ_knightly_squires_idea_desc:0 "In the glorious past of ages yore, when our valiant ancestors still fought with polearm, sword and shield, experienced knights would often have a squire accompanying them in their travels. They would be responsible for carrying their senior's equipment, as well as handling minor errands, and in return, the knight would teach his squire everything he knew.\n\nThis arrangement faded over time, but training a knight still remains a harsh exercise, with their heavy armour and large caliber weaponry. It is natural that prospective knights should once more begin their training earlier, to be prepared for the demanding rigours of the future."
HLQ_enchanting_workshops_idea:0 "Enchanting Workshops"
HLQ_enchanting_workshops_idea_desc:0 "Griffons have always been proficient in enchantment, owing to their lack of magic, but the process has been expensive for a long time.

HLQ_train_the_officers_idea:0 "Knightly Valour"
HLQ_train_the_officers_idea_desc:0 "Officers should always lead by example, to inspire the soldiers under their command to perform ever greater feats of bravery and gallantry. Such is the way of a knight, to selflessly give himself in pursuit of a greater end."

HLQ_joint_police_force_idea:0 "The Bundespolizei"
HLQ_joint_police_force_idea_desc:0 "The civilian police force across [HLQ.GetName] has been largely disorganised, relying on volunteer constables and nightwatchers to deter criminals. With the growth of our nations, the need to effectively maintain the peace has increased as well, leading to the formation of a single organised force to ensure the safety, health and possessions of our citizens across the realms of Hellquill, Longsword and Lushi."
HLQ_pride_in_the_monarchy_idea:0 "The Federal Monarchy"
HLQ_pride_in_the_monarchy_idea_desc:0 "Although the triple crowns of Hellquill, Longsword and Lushi are united over a single mighty banner, the constituents of our nation have retained significant autonomies in their internal management.

HLQ_monarchist_centralism_idea:0 "The Zentralistisch Constitution"
HLQ_monarchist_centralism_idea_desc:0 "The constituents of our nation are nominally equal to one another, yet Hellquill takes primacy as the most developed and populated part of it. Thus it comes to no surprise that decisions are primarily made to benefit Hellquill's interests."

HLQ_the_princes_men_idea_desc:0 "[HLQ.GetLeader], recognising the dangers poised by outside influences, has formed a clandestine taskforce to investigate any suspicious activities. Like a firm claw, they shall keep a tight grip on any who would threaten his majesty's rule."

HLQ_reinforce_lingustic_equality_idea_desc:0 "With five languages spoken across [HLQ.GetName], intellectually minded citizens raised their concerns over linguistical rights. Instead of enforcing one as the nation's sole official language, [HLQ.GetLeader] has graciously declared that all major spoken languages in the kingdom enjoy equal rights and protection. It may prove to be a headache for the bureaucrats, but the populace are at peace."
HLQ_dreams_of_conquest_idea:0 "Gerar's Dream"
HLQ_dreams_of_conquest_idea_desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has always been an idealist, but his ambitions were curtailed by the relative small size of his previous realm.

HLQ_the_peoples_courts_idea:0 "Volksgerichte"
HLQ_the_peoples_courts_idea_desc:0 "With Hellquill's traditional judicial system having been defanged by or even become compliant to the Reformisten's foul influence, the Volksgerichte, or People's Courts, have been hastily formed by the revolutionaries in order to try and sentence the various officials and supporters of the Reformisten for their heinous acts in every town they may be found in."

HLQ_worker_self_management_idea_desc:0 "One of the primary tenets of Marksist ideology is the return of the means of production to the workers.

Swift measures are required to reestablish the public trust in the state.\n\nOnly a few more token measures are needed to restore a functioning economy in [HLQ.GetName]."
HLQ_privatisation_idea:0 "Privatisation"
HLQ_privatisation_idea_desc:0 "Although the state would love to have complete control over its resources, the realities of life necessitate the deevolution of responsibilities. National agencies and factories shall be offered to the highest bidder, in hopes that they'll perform a better job as the state focuses on higher priorities. There'll be certain regulations to ensure quality of products and services remains acceptable."
HLQ_agricultural_support_2_idea:0 "Bauernfonds"
HLQ_agricultural_support_2_idea_desc:0 "Agriculture has greatly progressed since the origins of civilisation itself, but it remains a risky occupation. Natural disasters or bandit raids can ruin a farmer's entire yield, leaving them unable to provide for their family or sell their products. Additionally, advances in agriculture, such as artificial fertilisers, leave those who cannot keep up with expensive novelties behind. Thus it is necessary that the state intervenes to provide the primary sector with the needed resources to flourish."
HLQ_military_industrial_complex_idea:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
HLQ_military_industrial_complex_idea_desc:0 "In a militaristic state like [HLQ.GetName], it is important for the armed forces and the industrialists who provide them with firearms, ordnance and supplies to cooperate so that greater results are achieved in terms of production. The state must not lack a proper defence."
HLQ_mass_nationalisation_idea:0 "Mass Nationalisation"
HLQ_mass_nationalisation_idea_desc:0 "Only the state can be entrusted to manage the full extent of its resources and capabilities. Crony capitalists would simply exploit the workforce and pay a pittance of their dues to the state, while pocketing untold profits for their ignoble pursuits. Thus it become necessary for the state to intervene in all matters of economy, to ensure a future in which nocreature will be lacking."
HLQ_cult_of_labour_idea:0 "Arbeitskult"
HLQ_cult_of_labour_idea_desc:0 "Work provides purpose and fulfillment. Without nothing to do, we grow lazy and slovenly. Only through a diligent work ethic can we succeed as a state."
HLQ_reform_religionus_organisations_idea:0 "The Gift Of Charity"
HLQ_reform_religionus_organisations_idea_desc:0 "Following the restructuring of the knightly order in [HLQ.GetName], its civilian components have gradually lost authority and purpose.

HLQ_public_housing_idea_desc:0 "How can anycreature feel safe without a roof over their head?

HLQ_proper_welfare_idea_desc:0 "What better showcase of virtue than to provide for those in need?

HLQ_support_settlers_idea_desc:0 "Over the years, Ost-Griffonia has developed an identity separate from its Herzlander origins, owing to influence from the Riverlander ponies. Yet the primary traits that make a griffon proud and strong remained, and these are the values any prospective settler should be taught."
HLQ_give_everyone_guns_idea:0 "A Rifle In Every Home"
HLQ_give_everyone_guns_idea_desc:0 "These are dangerous times, and everycreature needs protection.

HLQ_call_of_the_east_idea_desc:0 "A great deal of land remains unsettled and underused, owing to the remoteness of the region combined with the always present pony threat.

HLQ_standardise_rectuirment_practices_idea_desc:0 "The requirements for recruitment in the knightly order and their auxiliaries have often varied and remained inconsistent, depending on the whims of a Grandmaster's priorities.

HLQ_a_new_faith_idea_desc:0 "Once confined to secluded gatherings in basements, the teachings of the Ogledd society have been publically revealed to complement the orthodox griffon beliefs. The state's law requires everygriff to adopt this new idea in its entirety, which includes priests of the Three Temples, who are ordered to spread the word.

There is plenty of secondary tasks that should be left to them, for soldiers have more important tasks than digging trenches and carrying supplies.

HLQ_siegfrieds_retirement_desc:0 "Siegfried's long reign has been successful and good for Hellquill. Under him, we continued to hold back the eastern invaders. And yet, his will to lead has faded over these long, trying years. He has now uttered the wish to resign and step down as Grandmaster of the Hellquillian Order. He will continue to support our cause, but this leaves us with a great power vacuum, one that many within the nation are eager to exploit..."

HLQ_reconciliation:0 "Springtime In Hellquill"
HLQ_reconciliation_desc:0 "The Inner Circle has chosen the voice of reason and elected August von Ortelsberg to the rank of Grandmaster of our Order. With his promising ideas and humble charm, he may finally bring peace to our land and unite ponies and griffons once and for all."
HLQ_griffon_colonists:0 "Invite Griffonian Refugees"

HLQ_education_effort:0 "Address The Educational Fracture"
HLQ_education_effort_desc:0 "For decades, the Order of Hellquill has failed to invest in our younger generations, causing ever increasing harm to our people.

HLQ_ost_griffenheimer_identity:0 "The Ost-Griffonian Identity"
HLQ_ost_griffenheimer_identity_desc:0 "There is a clear line to be drawn between us eastern griffons and those to the west. They have chosen to cling to obsolete traditions and doomed ideologies while we shall embrace pluralism and freedom. That is our way!"
HLQ_further_colonization:0 "Support Settlers"
HLQ_further_colonization_desc:0 "Newly arrived settlers have a naturally hard time getting started. We must do our best to aid them with building up a new identity and life as best as we can. We will also ensure that they won't butt heads with the native ponies."
HLQ_enter_industrial_age:0 "The Hellquillian Industrial Revolution"
HLQ_enter_industrial_age_desc:0 "Our industrial sector has been neglected for times immemorial, as attention was focused more on maintaining our border holds and producing weapons for soldiers. This changes now, and the civilian industry shall be improved."
HLQ_open_dialogue:0 "Open Dialogue"
HLQ_open_dialogue_desc:0 "For too long, we have stuck our heads in the sand about the ponies. They won't go away, nor should they and it is time for us to finally talk to them and embrace them.

HLQ_build_relations:0 "Revise Discriminatory Laws"
HLQ_build_relations_desc:0 "We must do our best to start rebuilding good relations with the ponies in Hellquill. And while dialogue is one thing, acts always speak louder than words.

HLQ_support_pony_towns:0 "Support For Pony Towns"
HLQ_support_pony_towns_desc:0 "Pony towns are far older than the Griffon ones in Hellquill but, due to our hostility, they have been neglected and left in squalor if not outright damaged by repression.

HLQ_cultural_revival:0 "The Grand Cultural Revival"
HLQ_cultural_revival_desc:0 "While Pony culture was previously actively suppressed, it has survived in rural towns and ghettos.

HLQ_pony_knights:0 "Ponies In The Ranks"
HLQ_pony_knights_desc:0 "Ponies partisans have shown time and time again that they are willing to fight tooth and hoof for their lands and so have we. If we are to build Hellquill as our common home, it is time for us to welcome ponies within the ranks of the Wehrmacht."

HLQ_memorial_for_victims_desc:0 "Many times in history, ponies and Griffons clashed and fought one another. Seldom something changed, but everytime both sides took heavy losses.

HLQ_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Codify Anti-Speciesism Laws"
HLQ_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "To end discriminatory regulations in Hellquill was one of the greatest changes in Hellquill's history. Unfortunately, speciesism continues to plague our citizens' daily life. It is time to enact new legislation banning such discrimination and punishing those who would try to continue the foolish wars of the past."
HLQ_limited_nationalisation:0 "Limited Nationalisation"
HLQ_limited_nationalisation_desc:0 "For two centuries, we have thought that the tools to govern were steel, honour and gunpowder. How foolish we have been.

HLQ_united_identity:0 "Integral Nationalism"
HLQ_united_identity_desc:0 "So much has been achieved to bury the hatchet between Ponies and Griffons but we cannot let things at that. We are not simply a meeting between two worlds but a third in the making! With Griffon copper and Pony tin, we shall forge a brand new Hellquillian bronze in this crucible that is our common Nation!"
HLQ_the_ponies:0 "The Zmānenawinan Peraīninsnas Wīrija Mandate"
HLQ_the_ponies_desc:0 "The people has finally spoken and it has proven that Hellquill has indeed truly changed! River Breeze, the very first Pony to lead Hellquill in two centuries, will have much to do to right the wrongs of the past. However, we can now have full trust that the era of Griffon domination is over."
HLQ_represent_everyone:0 "A Home For All"
HLQ_represent_everyone_desc:0 "August must be credited for his work towards Ponies but by lack of will or means, he couldn't go beyond the idea of Hellquill as a bipolar compromise. We need to rework our laws to make Hellquill a house for all, regardless of species or class. None of us shall be truly free until all creatures in Hellquill are!"
HLQ_public_housing:0 "A Roof To Sleep Under"
HLQ_public_housing_desc:0 "For too long, Hellquill has been thought as a frontier territory with barely livable farms for settlers and forgotten hamlets for natives. It is time for us to get building to provide each and everycreature in Hellquill a dignified place to call home. We cannot find peace if half of us sleep and eat in the cold and rain."
HLQ_proper_welfare:0 "Bread To Eat"
HLQ_proper_welfare_desc:0 "Poverty and misery in Hellquill have been left as a fact of life, a necessary evil when all that was needed was getting ready for one final war.

HLQ_public_works_projets:0 "And A Job"
HLQ_public_works_projets_desc:0 "Should one creature crunch the numbers of the daily occupation of the Hellquillians, they would shutter to see how many fought one way or another or simply struggled to survive.

HLQ_republic:0 "The Sozialliberale Mandate"
HLQ_republic_desc:0 "The people has spoken! Von Ortelsberg gave Hellquill its freedom and its people has taken it, electing its very first civilian head of state.

HLQ_economic_advancement:0 "Ausschuss Für Wirtschaftsförderung"
HLQ_economic_advancement_desc:0 "For too long, Hellquill has been managed by knights and soldiers with little understanding of economics. As a result, the opportunities of the Frontier have been left unexploited and our development has been left stunted.

HLQ_rapid_industrial_development:0 "The Leapfrogging Theory"
HLQ_rapid_industrial_development_desc:0 "It is undeniable that our nation is a backwater, left forgotten between two worlds. However, Reiner has developed a theory.

HLQ_gospel_of_wealth:0 "The Gospel Of Wealth"
HLQ_gospel_of_wealth_desc:0 "Our religion has always been a duality between industrious and bellicose spirit.

HLQ_strong_executive:0 "A Strong Executive"
HLQ_strong_executive_desc:0 "If Hellquill is to achieve anything, we cannot let ourselves be held back by endless chatter and concertation.

HLQ_support_settlers_desc:0 "The ideal by which Hellquill has lived for so long has now been put to rest. But now, we find ourselves lost in this Frontier. What shall we be?

HLQ_give_everyone_guns_desc:0 "For too long, our farmers have complained about the anti-gun laws of the Order of Hellquill. Despite living in one of the most dangerous regions of the continent, they were denied the means to defend themselves. Let us entrust them with the power to provide their own safety!"
HLQ_agrarian_legacy_of_ost:0 "The Landwirtschaftsfonds"
HLQ_agrarian_legacy_of_ost_desc:0 "Hellquill is a land of farmers more than it is one of knights. It is time that our institutions recognize this. We will create a cooperative agrarian movement, one which aims will be to give a voice to a whole class of pious, industrious and powerful farmers. Our new wisdom shall come from the countryside!"
HLQ_regional_system:0 "Regionaldemokratismus"
HLQ_regional_system_desc:0 "Hellquill is a nation of Griffons and Ponies. We have made our peace with this but it would be foolish to try and rule over such a nation with one-size-fits-all legislation. Let us organize a new institutional system to let creatures decide for themselves on matters that concerns them!"
HLQ_finish_education_reforms:0 "A Modern Hellquill"
HLQ_finish_education_reforms_desc:0 "The democratic reforms have transformed Hellquill but without a proper education, the future generations are sure to forget the lessons we have learned. A great educational reform must be put forward to help our nation transition into the modern world. Peace and prosperity demand it."
HLQ_reform_the_knights:0 "Reform The Knights"
HLQ_reform_the_knights_desc:0 "August von Ortelsberg's reforms have put the Order of Hellquill in a strange position. Hellquill is no more an army which possesses a state. Yet, our rules and charters remain unchanged. It is time to reform the Knights of Hellquill into a proper military force, serving Hellquill and no more the old mission of Grover II."
HLQ_invite_longsword:0 "Invite Our Friends"
HLQ_invite_longsword_desc:0 "For a long time, Hellquill and Longsword have cooperated as friends and allies to combat the Ponies to the East. Now, as we have made peace, it is time to reach out to the Longswordian and help them heal from the wounds of the civil war. Our great society won't be whole without the Longswordians."
HLQ_between_giants:0 "The Crossroad of Griffonia"
HLQ_between_giants_desc:0 "Hellquill lies at the Center of Griffonia, and forms the natural bridge between the heart of the Empire and the Ponies of the East. We must find a way to exist in this precarious position in a way that will promote peace, prosperity and security for all in this continent but also first and foremost for our citizens."
HLQ_towards_a_better_future:0 "Towards A Better Future"
HLQ_towards_a_better_future_desc:0 "Despite a perilous choice, Hellquill has been transformed and has proven the strength of its new institutions. We have rebuild and reinvented ourselves. And now, we will march forward towards our future, with pride in our new ideals, trust in our identity and peace among our ranks. What a happy day this is!"

HLQ_status_quo:0 "The Last True Knight"
HLQ_status_quo_desc:0 "The Inner Circle has opted for tradition and stability. Urlach ap Cyrod, after years of impeccable service, shall lead us forward. We can take pride in having such a model knight carry the mantle of Aloysius."
HLQ_speak_with_van_ortelsburg:0 "The Scholar-Knight Of Hellquill"
HLQ_speak_with_van_ortelsburg_desc:0 "The Inner Circle has rejected the bold proposals of August von Ortelsberg. However, the Grandmaster couldn't help but feel that maybe there had been some truth in his words. The age has indeed changed and perhaps the scholar has sensed something that maybe of interest. We shall arrange a meeting."
HLQ_open_dialouge_with_ponies:0 "The Lawful Pony"
HLQ_open_dialouge_with_ponies_desc:0 "After their meetings, August advised the Grandmaster to meet with one of the chief representatives of the Posniak community. One lawyer named River Breeze who is said to speak Herzlander without any trace of an accent and a devout believer in our gods. Let us meet this rare character and hear what he has to say."
HLQ_work_with_posniaks:0 "Support From The Posniak Community"
HLQ_work_with_posniaks_desc:0 "The extensive knowledge of August on the history of Hellquill has proven to be extremely enlightening. Without committing to radical reforms or heavy investments, there are many steps that can be taken to mend relations with the Posniak community. To use their cultural name for a start."
HLQ_towards_a_better_future_hopefully:0 "Pragmatic Harmonism"
HLQ_towards_a_better_future_hopefully_desc:0 "Against the old wisdom of the Order, meeting with the native minorities within Hellquill has proven to be productive. Perhaps it is time to play the game of modernity and to infuse some form of Harmony as they call it into our dogmas and in a fashion that conform with our identity. How exciting."
HLQ_trust_in_von_soldau:0 "Trust In Von Soldau"
HLQ_trust_in_von_soldau_desc:0 "While few dare question the honour and character of our Grandmaster, it must be observed that few in Hellquill like him. Of course, he cares little for such things but in this age of tomfoolery, it appears to be important. As many seem to like Carl Von Soldau, it may be wise to meet with him and exploit this popularity."
HLQ_birth_of_ost_griffonien_bund:0 "Nurture The Bund"
HLQ_birth_of_ost_griffonien_bund_desc:0 "With the support of von Soldau, we can improve our standing among the masses of settlers. However in order to truly benefit from his popularity among the masses, we will have to dedicate significant resources to make this Ost Griffonien Bund a true institution of Hellquill. Otherwise, it would remain a simple political ploy"
HLQ_convince_stackelberg:0 "The Black Knight Of The Reformisten"
HLQ_convince_stackelberg_desc:0 "For all their excesses and hatred, the reformisten remain a driven bunch of griffons dedicated to Hellquill. After all, many of them are young recruits who have been lead astray. The Grandmaster is sure that it may be possible to reach out to them. And for that, an old friend of his may just be able to help..."
HLQ_arrest_edler:0 "Edler The Heretic"
HLQ_arrest_edler_desc:0 "For too long now, Edler von Wingenberg, the deranged leader of the Sturmgreife, has been allowed to spew his insane and heretical rants. He is too far gone to ever listen to reason. There is no alternative to removing him permanently."
HLQ_discrete_murders:0 "Curtailing The Sturmgreife"
HLQ_discrete_murders_desc:0 "The Sturmgreife are by far the most extremist faction of the reformisten. They won't stop until an armed revolution has swept all remains of what Hellquill stands for and that the Griffking River is awash with the blood of the Ponies. They will have to go, lest we shall share the fate of Longsword."
HLQ_operation_downfall:0 "Reprimand Wingfried"
HLQ_operation_downfall_desc:0 "The so-called Black Cloaks threat is rescinding but trouble won't truly be over until the Katerinian has learned his lesson. We shall call for a meeting to make him understand and acknowledge his future place into the Order. One of service, obedience and silence."
HLQ_wholesale_education_reforms:0 "Religionsunterrichtsge-\nsetz"
HLQ_wholesale_education_reforms_desc:0 "It is undeniable that our good old Hellquill has lost its ways when it comes to education. Far from our founding ideals, we oversee a nation that struggles to even read and lapses in their moral duties. We shall give unto our Temples the proper authority and funding to teach a new generation of pious, intelligent and knowledgeable Hellquillians, beyond the rifts of species."
HLQ_call_of_the_east:0 "Drang Nach Osten"
HLQ_call_of_the_east_desc:0 "Historically, Hellquill has sought to settle its lands through land seizure and forceful removal of natives Ponies. If we are to have peace, this is no longer an option. Instead, we shall promote an ideal of incremental and gentle immigration from the West. After all, rushing oneself is a sure way of failing. We have time."
HLQ_urban_growth:0 "Ordensstaat Free City Development Scheme"
HLQ_urban_growth_desc:0 "The cities of Hellquill have stagnated for too long and as much as it pains us to recognize it, our hold on their institutions may be to blame. It is time to grant the civilians some autonomy in local affairs not unlike the old Imperial Free Cities model. Who knows. Perhaps a new Romau or Skyfall may come out of it?"
HLQ_rural_support:0 "Working With The Bund"
HLQ_rural_support_desc:0 "Reports of membership from The Ost-Griffonische Bund have shown it to be rather successful and Carl von Soldau has played his part perfectly. Now, we may begin to better align our political agenda with that of the settlers and entrench ourselves in the countryside. Hopefully, it should allow us to have more control over them and prevent any unfortunate affairs with the rural Posniak communities."
HLQ_assist_pony_towns:0 "Pony Settlement Modernisation Scheme"
HLQ_assist_pony_towns_desc:0 "There is no question that the Posniak settlements in Hellquill are in a dire state of disrepair and underdevelopment. We have little means to directly invest in them but we could find a way to redirect private funds towards those destitute place and give our griffon inhabitants a stake in their development."
HLQ_lessen_restrictions_on_ponies:0 "Loosen Discriminatory Laws"
HLQ_lessen_restrictions_on_ponies_desc:0 "Despite our reservations, the accommodations of Posniaks recommended by August von Ortelsberg have proven to be effective. Reports indicate that acts of terrorism and partisan recruitment are receding and skepticism among the Inner Circle is as well. It is time for us to safely uphold our end of the bargain."
HLQ_take_longsword:0 "The Longswordian Mistake"
HLQ_take_longsword_desc:0 "South of the Griffking River lies the County of Longsword. Our brothers and sisters in arms. Our family. Our failure. We have remained idle as Count Pallas Dusktalon fell ever deeper in the clutches of the worst excess of the reformisten. Now these once prosperous lands lay ravaged by war. It is time for us to intervene and bring back order there."
HLQ_build_the_ostwall:0 "Refurbish The Ostwall"
HLQ_build_the_ostwall_desc:0 "Between us and our enemies in the Riverlands stands the Ostwall, a once powerful line of defense that we used to call our pride. Years of neglect and the war in Longsword left it in a poor state and should war come, the ponies will make short work of it. While there is no question that we would prevail, repairing the wall would drastically reduce the blood price of victory. This is our duty."
HLQ_the_military_frontier:0 "The Militärgrenze"
HLQ_the_military_frontier_desc:0 "When one imagines the frontier, they picture a land of endless possibilities and wild landscapes. However, this frontier of ours exists out of the consequences of war. But they may be forgiven to forget that considering the poor state of our outposts and fortresses. It it time to repair and refurbish them, if only to protect our citizens and settlers. Should war come, they will be needed."
HLQ_affirm_oaths:0 "Reaffirm The Oaths"
HLQ_affirm_oaths_desc:0 "Ever since we cut ties with the Empire, many among us have had a sense of lost purpose. If we do not serve the Empire, who are we indeed? Grandmaster Trappenfeld has failed to answer this question. And so, the answer lies like always in tradition. We shall reaffirm our old oaths and customs. The Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury stands and shall do so for centuries to come!"
HLQ_centralising_the_order:0 "Centralising The Order"
HLQ_centralising_the_order_desc:0 "The Longswordian Bloodbath has been a teachable moment for us all about the danger of a divided military command. We need to uphold once more that our Order of knights is the legitimate and sole bearer of the right to wage war in this land. Minor orders, mercenaries and paramilitary forces shall obey us or be treated as common criminals."
HLQ_absorb_reformisten_remnants:0 "Absorb The Reformisten Remnants"
HLQ_absorb_reformisten_remnants_desc:0 "Now that the dust is finally settling on the whole Black Cloak affair, we can work on integrating those souls laid astray by the Katerinian. It will take some work to make sure that they know of their place this time and that they don't try to pick a fight with our allies among the Posniaks. But in the end, we will have some valuable soldiers standing for Hellquill."
HLQ_standardise_rectuirment_practices:0 "Rekrutierungsstandar-\ndisierungsedikt"
HLQ_standardise_rectuirment_practices_desc:0 "Recruitment into the Wehrmacht has been difficult. While our knights still remain the pinnacle of Griffonian warrior tradition, the lowly soldiers are a poor sight to see. It is time for us to revise our recruitment standards and put an end to this deplorable race to the bottom that has been allowed to happen."
HLQ_pony_recruitment:0 "The Ritterliche Hilfsponykorps"
HLQ_pony_recruitment_desc:0 "North of the Riverlands live the so-called Hillponies. While they are generally aligned with their southern brethrens, they have historically been far less hostile to us than the River Ponies. It just so happens too that many in these lands barely make by. By sending some clever recruitment officers, we could enroll a fine foreign volunteer corps."
HLQ_segregated_military:0 "Pony-Integrationsgesetz"
HLQ_segregated_military_desc:0 "The Posniaks have proven themselves to be somewhat reliable after all and many of them have shown to be willing to serve their homeland. While some still bristle at the idea, there is both need and merit in the idea of allowing the Ponies of Hellquill a place in the Wehrmacht. Henceforth, we shall give them a place to serve at last, not as knights but as soldiers and support. Trenches need digging after all."
HLQ_shield_of_griffonkind:0 "The Sword And Shield Of Griffonkind"
HLQ_shield_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "With our defenses refurbished and peace among our ranks, Hellquill stands as a proud nation and having proven that one need not fall to extremism or modernity run amok. We are ready to uphold our old vows and guard the West. Not as passive watchgriffs or stupid grunts but as wise and cunning knights."

HLQ_black_cloaks:0 "A New Hellquill"
HLQ_black_cloaks_desc:0 "The Council has decided that, in an effort to elevate Hellquill to greatness, Wingfried von Katerinburg shall take over. He and his Reformisten movement shall reform our society into something greater, something that shall last for a thousand years!"
HLQ_black_cloaks_in_government:0 "The Reformisten In The Council"
HLQ_black_cloaks_in_government_desc:0 "With his newly gained power, Wingfried has arranged many high-ranking members of his movement to be put into the Council. They are unlikely to oppose his policies now, leaving him free to do whatever he has in mind for our nation."
HLQ_paramilitaries_in_the_streets:0 "Militarise The Police"
HLQ_paramilitaries_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Our Police force is not strong enough to keep the ponies and dissidents in line. Wingfried has proposed to militarise them by turning them into paramilitary groups which any fanatic teen can apply for. This will not only show young Griffons the strength of the new Hellquill, but it will also keep the pressure on our domestic enemies."
HLQ_not_safe_at_home:0 "Organise The Geheimdienst"
HLQ_not_safe_at_home_desc:0 "In order to keep a watchful eye on our citizens and our neighbours, our secret service shall provide us with valuable information. You have to be on the lookout, these days, after all..."
HLQ_reign_of_terror:0 "A Reign Of Terror"
HLQ_reign_of_terror_desc:0 "The ponies within our borders not only pose a problem, but an immense threat to the stability and well-being of our nation and citizens. It's time to start the process of ridding ourselves from them. Hellquill will always be home to Griffons, and Griffons only!"
HLQ_what_minorities:0 "Pacify The Ponies"
HLQ_what_minorities_desc:0 "For all our grand plans, we simply cannot shoot every single pony residing in Hellquill. It would be unfeasible, we do not have enough bullets, and the rats would warn each other. Instead, we'll pursue an active campaign of encouraging the ponies to emigrate, and those who stay will be pacified to ensure they don't cause any trouble."
HLQ_a_bullet_for_the_traitors:0 "A Bullet For The Traitors"
HLQ_a_bullet_for_the_traitors_desc:0 "Some Griffons seem to actually believe that ponies and Griffons are "equals". Very well. We shall give them an equal treatment to the ponies. Namely, a firing squad."
HLQ_new_generals:0 "A New Generation Of Officers"
HLQ_new_generals_desc:0 "Our movement has inspired many veterans and upstarts alike to take up arms. What they need is capable leaders, who are trained in the new order, free from the trappings of outdated traditions. Certainly, we can count on our most fervent followers to provide a capable, commanding claw."
HLQ_outdated_traditions:0 "Dispose Of Urlach"
HLQ_outdated_traditions_desc:0 "Urlach and his clique are our main opposition in revolutionising Hellquill. They cling to their precious traditions, and the duty of protecting the Empire, but they do not see the larger picture that is the pony threat. We'll find a suitable method of eliminating Urlach."
HLQ_remove_the_old_guard:0 "Deal With The Old Guard"
HLQ_remove_the_old_guard_desc:0 "While some members of the old guard have jumped onto our movement's policies, many believe that we are simply too radical. Their opposition is a hurdle for us and Hellquill overall, and we must get rid of these troublemakers as soon as possible."
HLQ_the_stormgriffons:0 "Formalise The Sturmgreife"
HLQ_the_stormgriffons_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht serves the leader of Hellquill, but we cannot be certain of their absolute commitment to our goals. Instead, we'll officialise the Sturmgreife, our paramilitary organisation, to serve as an official extension to our army as a whole. The devotion will make them our best warriors."
HLQ_longsword_destroy:0 "Longsword Must Submit!"
HLQ_longsword_destroy_desc:0 "Longsword has long been an ally to us, though they fail to take a more aggressive stance towards the East, like us. It's about time we absorbed them into the Hellquillian nation, so that we can fight our enemy together."
HLQ_neuseland_project:0 "The Neuland Act"
HLQ_neuseland_project_desc:0 "Some parts of our country remain relatively unpopulated. As such, we must kickstart a grand campaign of resettlement and migration, so as to populate even the most desolate of places. Various incentives shall attract new settlers, which will pay taxes, so that we may fund our goals."
HLQ_education_and_indocrination:0 "Education And Indoctrination"
HLQ_education_and_indocrination_desc:0 "Our citizens, young and old alike, must be taught the truths of life. This shall reach from basic mathematics and writing, all the way to the natural rivalry between Griffons and ponies."
HLQ_make_way:0 "Pave The Way"
HLQ_make_way_desc:0 "Our nation must prepare to fight the enemy, and as such, our industry must grow. More factories, more weapons, more troops to slaughter this dangerous foe."
HLQ_the_new_frontier:0 "The Brave New Frontier"
HLQ_the_new_frontier_desc:0 "Hellquill continues to lag behind when it comes to industry and nowhere is it more obvious than in the countryside. To solve this, we will entice our wealthy citizens to invest by encouraging the formation of trusts through massive deregulation, land sales and the ability to call upon prisoners sentenced to hard labour to come and work for them. No more obstacles!"
HLQ_the_industrial_revolution:0 "Reinvesting The Spoils"
HLQ_the_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "If Hellquill is to stand strong against the pony threat, it needs an industry capable of sustaining modern warfare. Fortunately, since taking power, we have been able to put our claws on a massive amount of land, property, material and capital. Now, we can repurpose these disjointed assets into an industrial capacity fit for war. From what those traitors stole from our coffers, we shall make rifles and cannons!"

HLQ_the_kingdom_of_hellquill:0 "Disband The Order"
HLQ_the_kingdom_of_hellquill_desc:0 "The knightly order of Hellquill is an anachronism of past centuries, whose role is now superficial in the rapidly changing world. More importantly, it cannot handle the pony threat adequately. Instead, Wingfried will reform the state in a more suitable form, and he expects loyal griffons to take part."
HLQ_the_moderates:0 "The Abwarten Und Lehre Doctrine"
HLQ_the_moderates_desc:0 "In truth, Hellquill is not yet prepared to fully combat the looming threat from the east. Although we shall do our best to close the gap, we shall only commit to the final solution once we have sufficiently built up our strength. The radicals within the party must see reason, or become sidelined."
HLQ_new_judicial_code:0 "The Prerogative State"
HLQ_new_judicial_code_desc:0 "Strength is not strength unless wielded with determination and clarity of purpose, and the strength of the state is obliged to - above all other things - crush that which threatens its existence. That is why our leader must be supreme and whoever speaks against him must be crushed. Without that, there is no order. Without order, there is no strength."
HLQ_curtail_the_SG:0 "The Night Of The Sharp Claws"
HLQ_curtail_the_SG_desc:0 "The Sturmgreife have forgotten their place. After Edler's latest tirade turned his venom onto the Führer, Wingfried has chosen to respond drastically. There can be no dissent, and open dissent requires an extreme response."
HLQ_pony_collaborators:0 "The Ehrengürtel"
HLQ_pony_collaborators_desc:0 "It would be a waste to simply... not use the ponies for our goals. For all their talk of unity and racial strength, ponies are quick to abandon their kin once presented with an opportunity to gain an advantage. Thus, we shall aim towards persuading them to serve us in exchange for slightly better living conditions."
HLQ_reform_the_neuland_act:0 "Nationale Einwanderungsbehörde"
HLQ_reform_the_neuland_act_desc:0 "The Neuland Act has produced exceptional results, and what was once sparsely populated is now teeming with new towns and families, seeking a refuge in Hellquill. However, the initial tenets of the act have been rather stringent. We need to loosen the requirements for immigrant griffs, to populate every corner of the frontier. Everygriff is needed against the pony menace."
HLQ_the_hardliners:0 "The Task At Claw"
HLQ_the_hardliners_desc:0 "The pony menace cannot be allowed to continue to spread its tendrils unabated. They corrupt everything they get their muddy hooves on, and if we do not devote everything to curtailing their influence, griffons and their way of life will suffer for an eternity. Bring the fight to the Riverlands!"
HLQ_total_control:0 "Might Makes Right"
HLQ_total_control_desc:0 "The world is a ceaseless battleground for all life, and through this fighting the strong rise to the top. Fairness and blind trust are weaknesses and will leave you prey, whether it is between nations or individuals. Hellquill shall rise above it, and truly embrace the one true law of the universe: the Strong eat the Weak!"
HLQ_reform_the_secret_police:0 "Create The Abwehr"
HLQ_reform_the_secret_police_desc:0 "Our Secret Police is insufficient for the tasks that awaits them. In order to keep an absolute chokehold on those below us and enforce our Führer's rule, we must reform it so that its powers are as wide-ranging as they need to be."
HLQ_beasts_of_labour:0 "The Arbeitslager System"
HLQ_beasts_of_labour_desc:0 "The ponies are a plague on the world, but that does not mean they are without use. Actively slaughtering them is a waste of resources when we can instead use them to boost our own productivity by shifting over tasks suitable for these critters."
HLQ_test_subjects:0 "Ministerium Für Öffentliche Hygiene"
HLQ_test_subjects_desc:0 "Scientific research builds on experiments, and medicine requires a very particular kind of experiments. Thankfully, with our recent policies we have plenty of subjects available for these experiments."
HLQ_prepare_the_crusade:0 "The Grand Crusade"
HLQ_prepare_the_crusade_desc:0 "Everything has come to this crucial moment. The state has mobilised itself from the ground up to combat the pony filth. The secret projects have been completed, and our soldiers are numerous, well trained and armed to the beak. [HLQ.GetLeader] is certain that we shall stand victorious against the east, and establish a new empire to last for centuries. For the glory of griffonkind!"
HLQ_the_war_economy:0 "Everything For The Fatherland!"
HLQ_the_war_economy_desc:0 "Hellquill was never meant to be a civilian state. It was founded as a bastion against the east and she has been reborn as a military state without equal in its devotion and ability. To presume the luxury of peace is to forget what we are meant to be!"
HLQ_the_ostwall_building:0 "Construct The Ostwall"
HLQ_the_ostwall_building_desc:0 "To even the odds against the pony horde, a series of nested fortifications, redoubts, trenches and strongholds must be raised on the eastern border. Every natural advantage must be used so that we may hold the line, until we are poised to strike eastward. Spare no expenses for this task."
HLQ_prepare_longsword:0 "Expand The Ostwall"
HLQ_prepare_longsword_desc:0 "With the success of our initial implementation of the Ostwall, further funds have been approved to expand the bulwark across the entire border, in the lands previously controlled by the knights of Longsword. A strong, unbreakable line, which nopony will able to cross, manned by loyal griffons devoted to their duty."
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons:0 "Reform The Sturmgreife"
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons_desc:0 "The Sturmgreife are here to stay, yet the question arises what their exact role is to be within our armed forces. Certainly we could always use more frontline troops, but maybe a support role would be more sensible?"
HLQ_proper_cadets:0 "Junkerschulen"
HLQ_proper_cadets_desc:0 "The leaders of Hellquill are modern-day knights, skilled in logistics, tactics and strategy, well versed in the latest military advancements and more than capable to incorporate these in their own line of duty."
HLQ_finish_industry:0 "A Truly Modern Hellquill"
HLQ_finish_industry_desc:0 "The days of being little more than a frontier region are past, and now Hellquill has risen to be a nation as developed economically and industrially as any other. Those who thought we were mere thugs stand corrected before our achievements!"
HLQ_war_industry:0 "Cooperate With The Industrialists"
HLQ_war_industry_desc:0 "While they are not soldiers, the modern war requires the industrialists as well, and as long as they are aware of who truly is in charge, there is no reason we cannot build a military-industrial cooperation to shape our nation for the task in front of us."
HLQ_bring_settlers:0 "Settle The Frontier"
HLQ_bring_settlers_desc:0 "With the continued repossession of pony owned farmland, the state finds itself with nogriff to manage these tracts of land. With some subsidies, griffons who previously had little interest in agriculture can find themselves in ownership of many acres. As long as they conform to the quotas, we will allow anygriff to purchase as much land as they can afford."

HLQ_regular_economics:0 "Neues Geschäft"
HLQ_regular_economics_desc:0 "Although the economy has been propped up by the treasure taken from Diamond Mountain, it has not properly encapsuled every aspect of our nation and society, and many griffons continue to plow fields and toil in mines. We must use our available resources wisely to bring a full fledged industrial revolution to Hellquill."
HLQ_support_middle_class:0 "Support The Middle Class"
HLQ_support_middle_class_desc:0 "A strong middle class of citizens is required for a nation to prosper. They're the ones who can afford to invest into businesses, and spend their money on various amenities. Thus, it is imperative that we should expand our industrial centres to accomodate more workers, who'll earn their fair wage."
HLQ_work_smart:0 "Arbeite Schlau!"
HLQ_work_smart_desc:0 "Work smarter, not harder - while anygriff can be taught how to work on the assembly line, it takes more to educate them to understand their role in the production process. This crucial knowledge will allow our workers to notice defects and correct them, as well as suggesting their own improvements for the manufacturing process."
HLQ_foreign_industrial_deals:0 "Shake Claws With Blautronik"
HLQ_foreign_industrial_deals_desc:0 "Developing a modern arms industry from scratch is a difficult endeavour, thus we must look outside for assistance. Fortunately, friendly companies in the Imperial Heartlands would be more than happy to help us modernise, in exchange for a few grants and subsidies. A mutually beneficial exchange for all."
HLQ_fiscal_reforms:0 "Fiscal Reforms"
HLQ_fiscal_reforms_desc:0 "Our tax code is an archaic legislation mired in outdated protocols and vestiges of feudalism. It needs to be reformed to lessen the burden on the less fortunate citizens, while removing some unjust privileges the wealthy have enjoyed. A more proportional method of taxation shall be implemented, instead."
HLQ_steel_industry:0 "Expand The Wingenberg Coal Mines"
HLQ_steel_industry_desc:0 "Coal is the primary resource required for the production of steel, as well as powering up various machines. Existing mines must be expanded, as we are close to exceeding the current supply and production. It will ensure prosperity for our future, even for all the smog in the air."
HLQ_tungsten_industry:0 "The Soldau Tungsten Mines"
HLQ_tungsten_industry_desc:0 "An incredibly dense and robust metal, tungsten is crucial for the production of machine tools, armoured vehicles and artillery shells. However, it is quite rare and almost always found combined with other metals, which requires more modern processing facilities to extract this precious resource."
HLQ_oil_autarky:0 "Solving The Oil Issue"
HLQ_oil_autarky_desc:0 "As modernisation occurs at a rapid pace, we find ourselves lacking crucial resources that simply aren't present in the territory we control. While it is possible to import them, the costs are high and damaging for our industrial development. We'll assign our scientists to figure out a way to create synthetic oil and rubber."
HLQ_full_spead_ahead:0 "Full Speed Ahead!"
HLQ_full_spead_ahead_desc:0 "Already, our economical reform is showing tangible progress. Griffons flock to the cities in search of better employment, the use of machinery and electronics is becoming widespread, the nation as a whole is more prosperous and industrialised compared to a decade ago. We must continue striving to improve our Hellquill!"
HLQ_fascist_economics:0 "Nationale Wirtschaftsabteilung"
HLQ_fascist_economics_desc:0 "The first rule of any economy is that we do not have all that we require. And why is that? Hellquill's enemies are hoarding and stockpiling their resources, intending to halt our industrial progress. The state will have to intervene and control the industry, production of resources and flow of goods. It is the only way to survive."
HLQ_build_up_industrial_base:0 "Rapid Industrial Buildup"
HLQ_build_up_industrial_base_desc:0 "Our industrial capacity is insufficient for our needs, and what already exists is woefully outdated and sluggish. Bureaucracy and labour rights will have to be bypassed to drag Hellquill to the modern age, one machine at a time."
HLQ_appropriate_pony_farms:0 "Appropriate Dissident Farms"
HLQ_appropriate_pony_farms_desc:0 "The filthy ponies continue to squat at our land, hoarding and stealing food for themselves. Many continue to resist our transparent effort to cleanse Hellquill of their kind, leaving us with no other choice but to forcefully seize their farmholdings. What happens afterward to the destitutes is not our concern."
HLQ_collectivization_effort:0 "Kollektivierung"
HLQ_collectivization_effort_desc:0 "With most of the farmland now owned by the state, it is time to finish the process and eliminate any private ownership of the food production. Once this is completed, peasants will be assigned strict quotas in terms of grain and metals produced, ensuring our self-sufficient methods will continue to prosper."
HLQ_builder_squads:0 "Baubrigaden"
HLQ_builder_squads_desc:0 "Hellquill's infrastructure is insufficient for mass movement of our armies. Furthermore, construction tends to be delayed by lack of resources and workers. The state will once more have to intervene and form a dedicated group of builders, who will ensure everything is done on time, and any damage is repaired quickly."
HLQ_industrial_expansion:0 "The Beakstadt Industrial Park"
HLQ_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "Beakstadt is one of the few cities in Hellquill that have been industrialised before our reforms, and we consider it fitting that the government will invest in the expansion and modernisation of its industrial sector. It shall also create new jobs for the citizens, ensuring further natural growth."
HLQ_connecting_the_nation:0 "Nationaler Eisenbahndienst"
HLQ_connecting_the_nation_desc:0 "With previously underdeveloped areas of Hellquill becoming proper cities in their own right, we find ourselves with the lack of proper infrastructure to connect them. Existing roads are not optimal enough for the mass transportation of resources or units, thus we consider it mandatory to build railways to correct this issue."
HLQ_thriving_arms_industry:0 "Militärisch-Industrielle Zusammenarbeit"
HLQ_thriving_arms_industry_desc:0 "The union of industry and military is a natural one, based on the pressing need to supply our armed forces with sufficient material for their needs. This relationship will be bolstered by continued investments from the government in the firearm production sector."
HLQ_zinten_uni:0 "Fund The University Of Hellquill"
HLQ_zinten_uni_desc:0 "With Hellquill close to becoming fully modernised like the wealthy nations of the west, there is one crucial remaining task to fulfill. To achieve higher education, many citizens migrate westward, and some do not return. This damages the nation, as it needs every bright griffon, and thus the first institute of higher learning shall be opened in Hellquill."

HLQ_wehrmacht:0 "The Wehrmacht"
HLQ_wehrmacht_desc:0 "Now that we have stabilised our rule in Hellquill, we must think of defending ourselves from outside intruders. To accomplish this, the Wehrmacht must be established to create a modern armed force, which shall continue our proud knightly traditions."
HLQ_heer:0 "The Heer"
HLQ_heer_desc:0 "One of the branches, and perhaps the most important one owing to our location in Griffonia, is the Hellquillische Heer. As of now, it is mostly leftovers from the Knightly Order. We shall reform it and retool it to become a proper army, one that stands tall and proud."
HLQ_mass_assault_f:0 "As Many As Possible"
HLQ_mass_assault_f_desc:0 "The most important part of any war is to have as many guns on the field as possible. 1,000 griffons with guns will almost always beat 500 griffons with guns. We should aim to expand our army to be as large as possible. Quantity, after all, has a quality all its own."
HLQ_grand_assault_f:0 "Establish the OKH"
HLQ_grand_assault_f_desc:0 "The novel idea of a general staff has reached the desk of [Root.GetLeader]. With regards to this, they have floated a proposal to establish a high command with the purpose of better drawing up plans and contingencies for any sort of situation that might arise. We shall approve this proposal."
HLQ_superior_firepower_f:0 "Festung Artillery Doctrine"
HLQ_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "Ultimately, shells are cheap, griffons are expensive. We should focus on drowning our enemies in shells and explosions, not the corpses of our citizens. Ultimately, a live griffon is better."
HLQ_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
HLQ_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "There is also a new invention that has been making the rounds in the world lately. The armored divisions have seen great success elsewhere in the world, with new models and stories about both an armoured spearhead and 'lightning warfare' come in from all directions. We should adopt this."
HLQ_artillery_f:0 "Introduce The Leichte Feldhaubitze"
HLQ_artillery_f_desc:0 "A number of enterprising engineers have come up with an invention. Calling it the "light field cannon" they are hopeful that it will be put into mass production. Certainly now it will."
HLQ_anti_air_f:0 "The Flak Cannon"
HLQ_anti_air_f_desc:0 "Dangers can lurk both above and below. While the potential for a tunneling machine is still far, far out in the future, we should be wary of any bombing attacks from potential enemies. As such, we should invest into new anti-aircraft weaponry so that the skies may be forever clear."
HLQ_anti_tank_f:0 "The Panzerabwehrkanone"
HLQ_anti_tank_f_desc:0 "Trying to attack tanks and panzers with nothing but a rifle is a fool's errand. While individual infantry squads have seen success with throwing a grenade down the windpipe of a tank, this will not do on a wider scale. We need to spur development of specialized weaponry against this new weapon."
HLQ_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
HLQ_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "Lastly, in the reports, there was a proposal for a smokethrower or 'Nebelwerfer'. Of course, this was a cover for its real purpose, a new form for artillery that would rely on rockets, rather than shells. Certainly an idea worth pursuing for the better."
HLQ_infantry_equipment_f:0 "Retire The Antiques"
HLQ_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "A lot of weapons that we have lying around, and in the talons of our soldiers belong in a museum. It is about time that we modernized our weapons for the better so that they can train with something else than valuable antiques."
HLQ_support_equipment_f:0 "Modern Support Equipment"
HLQ_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "There is also the issue of the small things such as tents, medical supplies, and so forth. Like with the weapons, they really do belong somewhere else than with out soldiers, such as a surplus store. In any case, we shall initiate another reform and revolution to make sure they have something better than worm-eating blankets."
HLQ_osttruppen:0 "Die Ostlegionen"
HLQ_osttruppen_desc:0 "We will need everycreature for the Heer. A general recently mentioned forming so-called 'Ostlegionen' to take in all those that want to serve Hellquill even if they are not citizens. They shall serve as a foreign legion to bolster our numbers (and to conserve our own kin in battle)."
HLQ_cold_training:0 "Fighting In The Winter"
HLQ_cold_training_desc:0 "Winters are strong, and they can, if coming at the wrong time, completely ruin an army's day or month. While Griffons naturally are somewhat resistant to the cold, fighting for a long time can break down everything. We shall establish training regimens to make sure that out soldiers will be able to fight through the winter and into the summer."
HLQ_hill_training:0 "Die Bergsoldaten"
HLQ_hill_training_desc:0 "To the north and to the east lies hill after hill after hill. If we are to stand any hope of fighting our way through this, we need specialized training courses for all soldiers to make sure they know their way up a hill. And down a hill."
HLQ_motorized_f:0 "Army Motorisation Effort"
HLQ_motorized_f_desc:0 "Trucks are truly the thing that will carry us into the future. They can carry goods and soldiers so much further and faster than any carriage would be able to. Stepping up our production of this should be a key ingredient in our modern army."
HLQ_mobile_tactics:0 "Combined Arms Effort"
HLQ_mobile_tactics_desc:0 "But we need to have everyone working together. While we may not subscribe to the idea of 'Friendship is Magic', camaraderie and cooperation is key in any sort of army. The infantry, artillery and knights must all work in lockstep, lest someone exploits the cracks in the paint."
HLQ_tank_development:0 "The Panzer"
HLQ_tank_development_desc:0 "The fabled new invention. The Panzer. Our people recently acquired a test model from the Empire through various means. Reverse-engineering this will be a great help in building our own models later. Perhaps it will be the envy of the world."
HLQ_medium_tanks_f:0 "The Panther"
HLQ_medium_tanks_f_desc:0 "But we need more. The flimsy armor made of corrugated iron was too brittle. No, we need a bigger tank. The codename 'Panther' has already been assigned to the new project. It is expected to soon give results that we can leverage into a new version of the Panzer. Maybe a Panther this time?"
HLQ_officer_reforms:0 "General Staff Primacy"
HLQ_officer_reforms_desc:0 ""Plans may be useless, but planning is indispensable."\n\n That shall be the watchword for our military. We shall prepare for all eventualities, and all kinds of problems. Never shall we be caught unprepared."
HLQ_volksgrenadiers:0 "Die Volksgrenadiers"
HLQ_volksgrenadiers_desc:0 "We still need more warm bodies for our armies. We shall raise reserves to be thrown in when necessary. 'Volksgrenadiers', soldiers of the people, ready to jump to the call at a moment's notice. They will always be ready for the call, placing their trust in the nation."
HLQ_heavier_tanks:0 "Achtung Panzer!"
HLQ_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Nothing beats speed really. Well, maybe speed when it is in a heavily armored tank with a big gun on top. When the rumblings of its engine roar across the battlefield, they will know to flee from it, lest they will be destroyed."

HLQ_luftwaffe:0 "The Luftwaffe"
HLQ_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Airforce of Hellquill shall be our knights in the sky. They will cary on our old traditions in a new light and become the Luftwaffe."
HLQ_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
HLQ_import_fighters_desc:0 "The import of fighter craft from manufactories in the Empire and elsewhere will help us kickstart our air force program, and provide a backbone for future development."
HLQ_develop_fighter:0 "The Messerbeak"
HLQ_develop_fighter_desc:0 "Developing modern fighters should be a main priority for our air force division. If we are to control the skies we must do it with the best technology possible."
HLQ_CAS_f:0 "The Stuka"
HLQ_CAS_f_desc:0 "Planes that serve the purpose of directly attacking ground targets are key to the war in the sky. The enemy will flee before their tremendous firepower! Our new Stuka aircraft shall serve this purpose."
HLQ_air_superiority_f:0 "Control The Skies"
HLQ_air_superiority_f_desc:0 "Undeniably, our air philosophy should be to control the skies above the battlefield and using it to enforce our will on the war below. Rule over the air war will provide us with the tools needed to win all the battles we may encounter."
HLQ_strategic_destruction_f:0 "Burn The Fields"
HLQ_strategic_destruction_f_desc:0 "A more unorthodox tactic has recently come to the forefront of military theory in our airforce. It discards the necessity of complete battlefield control, in exchange for emphasising the destruction of enemy resources behind the lines of battle. This could be used well against many of the Order's enemies..."
HLQ_airbases:0 "The Beakstadt Air Fields"
HLQ_airbases_desc:0 "The establishment of modern airfields should be a high priority for our airforce. The necessity of locations to fly our planes out of is ever-present in discussions on strategy. To solve this a new airstrip shall be constructed around Beakstadt to serve this need."
HLQ_import_bombers:0 "Import Bombers"
HLQ_import_bombers_desc:0 "Importing bombers from across Griffonia will allow us to have a small reserve of aircraft for direct attack missions, and also serve a base for further design and manufacture."
HLQ_develop_bombers:0 "The Junker"
HLQ_develop_bombers_desc:0 "One of our most accomplished aeronautic engineers has been drafting new plans for better models of bombers for Hellquill. We should embrace these new designs and use them well."
HLQ_develop_strat_bombers:0 "The Clawnier"
HLQ_develop_strat_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers created for the sole purpose of destroying enemy infrastructure have been in development for a while now. But now, we finally have the resources to begin manufacture of these planes, and replace them should failures occur."
HLQ_airborne:0 "Create The Fallschirmjäger"
HLQ_airborne_desc:0 "Use of airborne infantry is an extremely effective tactic, especially with griffon's natural biological advantage. We should create a new airborne program in order to harness this power fully."
HLQ_develop_heavy_fighters:0 "The Jaguar"
HLQ_develop_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "The creation of a fighter plane on a larger bomber chassis that can be used for both dogfighting and ground strike missions will be a huge advancement for our air force. We should invest in this as much as we can."
HLQ_jet_experiments:0 "Jet Experiments"
HLQ_jet_experiments_desc:0 "Experimentation with jet engines has been theorised for a while now, but we finally have what we need to put it into practice. The griffons shall forever rule the skies!"

HLQ_kriegsmarine:0 "The Kriegsmarine"
HLQ_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "With the recent seizure of coastal territories for Hellquill, we can finally go about establishing a fleet for ourselves to protect our new land from any seaborne invasion. Plans have already been drafted and suitable dock locations have been approved."
HLQ_convoy_fleet:0 "The Hellquill Trade Fleet"
HLQ_convoy_fleet_desc:0 "With sea access comes more trade flowing into our nation. We must establish a new fleet of merchant convoys in order to pursue these new trade opportunities."
HLQ_destroyer_fleet:0 "Trade Escorts"
HLQ_destroyer_fleet_desc:0 "Escorting our trade ships is the main priority of our navy. New ships shall be designed to fit this purpose. It would be best to start with smaller vessels upon which we can base our future, larger blueprints."
HLQ_u_boats:0 "Adopt The U-Boat"
HLQ_u_boats_desc:0 "The U-boat is not a new innovation in naval war, but new developments are making them even more advanced. We should embrace these new ideas to create a fleet capable of striking at our enemies without huge amount of investment in large battlefleets."
HLQ_the_marine_infantry:0 "The Marine Stosstrupp"
HLQ_the_marine_infantry_desc:0 "Marines or naval assault troops will be of great use to our nation with our new coast, and the amount of rivers in our land. Investment in new marine divisions will hopefully pay large dividends."
HLQ_cruisers_f:0 "The Kreuzer"
HLQ_cruisers_f_desc:0 "Cruisers are good all-around vessels that will help us enforce our will upon the waves. We should pursue developments in this regard."
HLQ_battleships_f:0 "The Schlachtschiff"
HLQ_battleships_f_desc:0 "Battleships are the titans of the seas, if we are ever to be seen as a major naval power we will need to construct some of these iron behemoths."
HLQ_a_small_navy:0 "Raider Doctrine"
HLQ_a_small_navy_desc:0 "Forging our navy around the interception of enemy supplies and troops may seem like we are giving up control of the oceans. But it is simply to compensate for our lack of naval industry. We will project our power from below the surface..."
HLQ_a_large_navy:0 "A Surface Fleet"
HLQ_a_large_navy_desc:0 "We could never give up control of the surface! We will invest more in industry and ensure that our great ships shall never fail to bring our might upon the open waters!"
HLQ_our_own_shipyard:0 "A Home Port"
HLQ_our_own_shipyard_desc:0 "Establishing a new homeport for our navy in our coastal territory will allow for further repairs and production of naval vessels. With it, industry and employment will swiftly follow."
HLQ_naval_bombers:0 "The Naval Aviation Office"
HLQ_naval_bombers_desc:0 "The creation of aircraft for the sole purpose of attacking naval vessels should be a huge help to our navy, taking off the burden of many direct engagements."
HLQ_carries_f:0 "The Träger"
HLQ_carries_f_desc:0 "While the construction of an aircraft carrier may seem out of proportion for a nation like us, we will always strive towards greater goals, and see what we can achieve."
HLQ_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand The Shipyards"
HLQ_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "Expansion of shipyards will be a good way to increase the size and therefore capabilities of our navy. We can always use more ships, after consultation with our available reserve griffonpower, that is."

HLQ_groverist_takeover:0 "The Rise Of The Groverists"
HLQ_groverist_takeover_desc:0 "Wingfried von Katerinberg and his rabid lackeys have been put down. Hellquill will have to answer for their sins against our sacred mission. At least, our true path has been restored. Let us put ourselves to work!"
HLQ_initial_stabilisation:0 "The True Path To Greatness"
HLQ_initial_stabilisation_desc:0 "Ideologies are naught but useless chattering. Grover II has given us a mission both sacred and simple: to guard his realm and to carry on his great crusade against the Riverlands. That is our path and we mustn't be led astray from it. If we do, we shall fail in everything we do but if we don't, eternal glory awaits us!"
HLQ_lock_down_the_economy:0 "Lock And Key Economics"
HLQ_lock_down_the_economy_desc:0 "To trade is a fine activity but one that is contrary to our mission. We must be single minded in the fulfillment of our mission. We must produce what is needed only, live frugally and never allow our goods and resources to fall into the claws of our enemies through the winds of commerce."
HLQ_seize_foreign_assets:0 "Punish The Degenerate Industrialists"
HLQ_seize_foreign_assets_desc:0 "Our gods command us to be an industrious people but to blindly seek profit above all and forget the true lessons of the Trinity is among the most heinous crimes any creatures can commit. Unfortunately, Hellquill is rife with such criminals. Time for them to pay and to give their properties a moral purpose."
HLQ_protect_the_farms:0 "Protect The Villages"
HLQ_protect_the_farms_desc:0 "The partisan creatures lurk in all corners of our states. Such is their barbarian way of war. We must reorganize the peasantry and establish safe and fortified villages that can be easily reached by our forces while our forces are instructed to patrol the remaining lands with renewed vigilance."
HLQ_reuse_the_camps:0 "Refurbish The Castles"
HLQ_reuse_the_camps_desc:0 "For too long, we have left our castles wither away, like they were a simple obsolete tool. However, they are more than simple military headquarters. They are symbols of power and prestige which will inspire serfs, free griffs and soldiers to great things. They are the embodiment of our mission and as such need to be maintained."
HLQ_knight_scholars:0 "The Knechte Gelehrte"
HLQ_knight_scholars_desc:0 "To believe that a soldier is simply a body with a tool and that simply improving the tool or the numbers of them is the way to victory is the single greatest mistake of our age. As knights, we know that the way of the warrior is an art that must be honed through studies, meditation and dedication."
HLQ_new_foundries:0 "Ordensstaat Foundries"
HLQ_new_foundries_desc:0 "In this age of blood and tears, we will require great amount of steel to prevail. Sadly, our industry has been left disorganized and lacking. But with the degenerate capitalists' assets seized, we can reorganize new foundries, fit to equip an army strong enough to take on the Riverlands."
HLQ_weapon_forges:0 "Forges Of A New Age"
HLQ_weapon_forges_desc:0 "The ancient art of blacksmithing has declined with the advent of modern science and industrialization but the old wisdom of the smith guilds can still be saved. We can promote science and modern techniques while retaining our venerable spirit. Let us inspire our crafters and scholars for they are no mere "workers" and "scientists"."
HLQ_damnato_memorie:0 "Damnatio Memoriae"
HLQ_damnato_memorie_desc:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg and Edler von Wingenberg have committed the highest crimes imaginable by trying to annihilate what we stand for. Their names shall be struck from all records and their memory forever banished. May they who utter their name be as cursed as those who invoke The Old One."
HLQ_honorable_pardons:0 "Sway The Hardliners"
HLQ_honorable_pardons_desc:0 "The rebellion that is tearing our land apart is an unfortunate situation. Not all of the Sturmgreife were mindless goons of Edler and von Katerinburg. Some of them are good griffs, eager to serve and simply lead astray. We should try and reach out to them. Maybe we can redirect their anger towards more righteous ways?"
HLQ_raise_knightly_chapers:0 "Renew The Charter"
HLQ_raise_knightly_chapers_desc:0 "The crisis caused by Wingfried has emptied our ranks. We need to review the chapters of our order to elevate new commanders within our Inner Circle. We will use the occasion to review them and renew their charters, to make sure that the renewed Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury remains forever true to itself."
HLQ_crush_the_rising_KPH:0 "Slaughter The Reds"
HLQ_crush_the_rising_KPH_desc:0 "While the degenerate partisans keep agitating the country, traitors among our ranks try to steer our good folk away from their sacred duties. We must destroy them with renewed vigor and obliterate whatever this "KPH" as they call it is. Hellquill shall not suffer the false idol of communism."
HLQ_punish_the_ponies:0 "Punish The Degenerates"
HLQ_punish_the_ponies_desc:0 "For too long, pony partisans have been allowed to question our rule. We must make an example of them so that there will never be another uprising such as the Longsword Civil War. There may be no redemption for such degenerates."
HLQ_amends_with_the_sturmgreifen:0 "The Knights Of The Black Bolt"
HLQ_amends_with_the_sturmgreifen_desc:0 "With the Sturmgreife swayed, we can begin to provide them with legitimate knightly ways. It is obvious that they are ill-fit for our own order but we shall grant them the right to organize themselves into a brotherly chapter under proper supervision. They will henceforth be known as those of The Black Bolt."
HLQ_reform_the_knightly_orders:0 "Return To Tradition"
HLQ_reform_the_knightly_orders_desc:0 "Restoring order within our ranks after the errance of the traitorous pair has not been an easy task and has caused much disturbance for our Order. But now, our predicament is over and we may finally work to restore Hellquill as it has been before and as it should always be. Great truths don't become obsolete."
HLQ_reuse_the_work_camps:0 "From Camps To Castles"
HLQ_reuse_the_work_camps_desc:0 "The work camps left to us by the Reformisten were a mistake and a drain to us all. There is no need for ponies to waste away in open-air prisons that we must look after. Should the ponies and traitors learn the error of their ways and accept their rightful places, they should be left to live as serfs in our domains."
HLQ_levy_laws:0 "Restore The Steuergesetz"
HLQ_levy_laws_desc:0 "Each serf and bürger have duties towards the state that may be paid in kind, in coin or in service. Those that are unproductive or remain in such a state of poverty that they cannot pay may pay us our dues by serving within our levies or by helping maintain the infrastructure of our state. Such is their lot."
HLQ_restore_serfdom:0 "The Return Of Serfdom"
HLQ_restore_serfdom_desc:0 "A healthy society is a well-run one and nothing guarantees this more than to have each our own place, rank and duty. Us knights and nobles shall fight what battles need to be fought and rule what must. Scholars shall study. Priests shall pray. As for the rest, their place is to honestly toil, work the land and provide for the rest of us. Such is their duty and under our wings they shall carry it."
HLQ_decentralized_leadership:0 "Cuius Regio, Eius Iura"
HLQ_decentralized_leadership_desc:0 "Whose Realm, His Religion. It is a good and simple motto. Faith in the most holy Trinity will be the law of the land and all shall pray in their name for it is the great truth that we hold dear to our hearts since His Majesty Grover II granted these lands to us. Those who disagree will hold their peace or leave if they may."
HLQ_free_cities:0 "The Ordensstaat Free Cities"
HLQ_free_cities_desc:0 "Not all places in this realm must be villages or castles. We understand that as much as one needs their tools to carry on their duties, so much do they need places to do their craft as well. Therefore, we shall grant charters to several of our cities in the fashion of our emperors. They will be given special freedoms and privileges to trade, craft and learn as is needed from them."
HLQ_code_of_chivalry:0 "A Modern Code Of Chivalry"
HLQ_code_of_chivalry_desc:0 "The world has changed. There is no denying that and as much as chivalry is a moderating force that must be preserved, we must also be open to see it evolve. Let us update our rules and standards for the contemporary world. The spirit of chivalry lives on in the spirit of laws and traditions, not in their exact letter."
HLQ_all_shall_serve_the_state:0 "No Such Thing As Civilians"
HLQ_all_shall_serve_the_state_desc:0 "Hellquill is no idle realm. We are here to serve and our lives must be solely dedicated to our most sacred goal. All those who do not serve as serfs or productive members must be levied to fulfill our grand mission. The Grand Crusade requires bodies and Hellquill shall provide them!"
HLQ_arms_for_everyone:0 "A Weapon In Every Claw"
HLQ_arms_for_everyone_desc:0 "Only the most foolish of nobles would send unequipped masses to the slaughter. Our levies, just like our knights, require weapons for war and we shall provide. We will launch a great drive to acquire small arms for each griffon serving!"
HLQ_knightly_squires:0 "The Knappe Kadetten"
HLQ_knightly_squires_desc:0 "Our recruitment system has proven to be a failure, allowing for the corruption of the Reformisten and ruffians to creep into our ranks. We must renew the old path to knighthood of the squires and adapt it for the modern era. Only this way can we raise a new generation of gallant knights fit to serve His Majesty Grover's vision."
HLQ_guns_of_boreas:0 "The Guns Of Arcturius"
HLQ_guns_of_boreas_desc:0 "The days when weapons and even guns could only kill one creature at a time are long gone. Now, technology has improved and produces much mightier weapons. Howitzers and cannons can wreak havoc on large areas and groups. They are Arcturius' fury incarnate and we will treat them as such."
HLQ_enchanting_workshops:0 "Blessed Are The Gunmakers"
HLQ_enchanting_workshops_desc:0 "To craft a weapon is among the most noble arts. While they may not seem as grand as the doctors and priests who soothe body and soul, their craft makes the difference between life and death. A well-crafted weapon kills the enemy just as surely as the poor one shall its owner. Let us bless those smiths and their mission."
HLQ_train_the_officers:0 "No Place For Incompetence"
HLQ_train_the_officers_desc:0 "The meritocracy that the Reformisten promised us was a failure and only lead to political cronies to take higher position. So that it may never happen again, we will institute a new training regimen for officers in addition to our other programs so that only the truly best lead us through our great purpose."
HLQ_the_newest_armour:0 "The Mechanical Knight"
HLQ_the_newest_armour_desc:0 "His Imperial Majesty Grover II knew how to use the greatest weapons of his age and just like him, we will make use of what technology has to offer us. But we know that these weapons are more than mere clubs. They are sacred tools, tasked with the gravest of duties: taking lives. To yield them casually is Maar's work."
HLQ_nothing_but_war:0 "Totaler Krieg!"
HLQ_nothing_but_war_desc:0 "War is our calling. War is our duty. War is our craft. War is our reason to exist here and now. War is the only path to fulfilling our great mission. War is all there is until it is won. Only in finale and complete victory shall we rest."
HLQ_a_grand_fortress:0 "The Aloysiousian Wall"
HLQ_a_grand_fortress_desc:0 "The dreaded ponies in the Riverlands may be our eternal enemies but they must not be underestimated.

HLQ_the_ultimate_showdown:0 "The Grand Crusade"
HLQ_the_ultimate_showdown_desc:0 "For nearly two hundreds years, we have remained idle, unwilling to truly pursue the mission given to us by His Majesty Grover II. No more! Arise Hellquill! Arise knights of the realm! For duty is calling! The time has come to bring war to the ponies!"

HLQ_the_coup_of_national_salvation:0 "The Junta Of National Salvation"
HLQ_the_coup_of_national_salvation_desc:0 "Wingfried's crazed ambitions would have been the death of Hellquill. Thankfully, we were able to intervene before he could drag us all down with him, and though Hellquill is now reeling on the brink, the Kamphaus Junta stands prepared to safeguard the nation, and it has come up with an audacious plan to ensure this."
HLQ_offer_the_crown:0 "A Crown For A Prince"
HLQ_offer_the_crown_desc:0 "The prince of Lushi has agreed to our offer, and he shall now be crowned the prince of Hellquill as well! With this, our two nations are binding themselves together into a wholly new entity of a kind never seen before in these lands, one of two thrones, but one prince."
HLQ_prince_elias:0 "Prince Elias"
HLQ_prince_elias_desc:0 "Young prince Elias seemed at first a meek sort of prince to be elected, but in his first meeting with the Junta he already impressed them with his political acumen and clear vision for the new principality. All things considered, he seems to be just the kind of leader that Hellquill needs."
HLQ_destroy_what_remains:0 "Finish Off The Sturmgreife"
HLQ_destroy_what_remains_desc:0 "The rabid fanatics of the Sturmgreife would have twisted Hellquill into an obscene parody of itself, and we cannot rest until they are dealt with. Thankfully, Prince Elias has expressed a deep revulsion for them and has gladly agreed to sign a royal decree declaring the organization outlawed and to be hunted down to the last griff."
HLQ_the_new_constituion:0 "The Saiburg Constitution"
HLQ_the_new_constituion_desc:0 "While nominally united, our two nations are still radically different in basically every aspect. In order to rectify this, a framework must be established to define where the two united principalities shall be ruled as one, and where they shall remain separate. Saiburg, on the border between or two nations, is a perfect spot to declare our new constitution."
HLQ_agrarian_legacy:0 "Agrarian Legacy"
HLQ_agrarian_legacy_desc:0 "Prince Elias has been insistent that the Agricultural sector of the principalities should be given "due attention". He reasons that it provides plenty of work for unskilled laborers, provides more crops to eat or sell, and it will provide a sense of security for all those who have suffered in these last years." 
HLQ_joint_army:0 "The Bundesheer Scheme"
HLQ_joint_army_desc:0 "General Kamphaus has managed to get the prince's ear on the matter of the principality's armies. While dismissing Lushi's old-fashioned military and leaving Hellquill's ascendant, yet that goes against the very idea of the dual principality. Instead, Lushi's army shall be expanded and brought up to the same level as its northern kin."
HLQ_joint_police_force:0 "Unite The Constabularies"
HLQ_joint_police_force_desc:0 "Certain areas, such as law enforcement, must be unified even within our two principalities. By necessity, the law must be equal for all, as must its enforcement. With a unified federal police working to coordinate and aid the local Constabularies, we will be able to achieve this."
HLQ_pride_in_the_monarchy:0 "The Federal Principality"
HLQ_pride_in_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Our nation will not be a single entity, but rather two co-equal and separated nations standing together, united under our common prince. It is a curious solution, but it is the one that has been the most beneficial to both of us. Lushi is Lushi, Hellquill is Hellquill, but when these differences are respected, unity is only a step away."
HLQ_dual_parliaments:0 "Parliamentary Regionalism"
HLQ_dual_parliaments_desc:0 "It would be a truly heroic undertaking to attempt to bring all of our lands in under one single parliament, and that is effort better spent in any of the countless other challenges we face right now. Instead, we will divide the nation so that the old polities are largely intact and the local parliaments are empowered to better carry out our policies."
HLQ_dual_courts:0 "Adjust The Law Codes"
HLQ_dual_courts_desc:0 "Lushi and Hellquill have been distinct entities for centuries, and thus our law codes are... diverse, to say the least.

HLQ_ratify_rights_of_nobility:0 "Clarify The Rights Of The Nobility"
HLQ_ratify_rights_of_nobility_desc:0 "Lushi's landed nobility is remarkably different from the knightly orders of Hellquill, yet both are still nobles, and when one half of the nation's nobility have a slew of rights that the other doesn't there's way too much room for tensions to arise. It will likely annoy a lot of nobles, but it seems that the new crown will have to put his claw down to define what being a noble in the dual principality means."
HLQ_equality_treaty:0 "The Toleranzedikt"
HLQ_equality_treaty_desc:0 "Ponies have lived in these lands for centuries. At some point we will have to acknowledge this fact and realize that every pony that is attacked or expelled is a citizen of the state and a subject of the crown driven out for no real reason other than bloodthirst. Enough is enough, and from now on the ponies will have the crown's protection."

HLQ_pardon_some:0 "A Few Discreet Pardons"
HLQ_pardon_some_desc:0 "While the Sturmgreife are unruly, Prince Gerar has decided to prune the organization instead of tearing it up by the roots. There are some within the organization who can be of use, and while most of the organization will be wiped away, the secretive Group 225 will shelter some of them so they can work off their debt to the principality in a more... constructive manner."
HLQ_monarchist_centralism:0 "Centralise The Monarchy"
HLQ_monarchist_centralism_desc:0 "The Prince stands at the head of our two principalities, and if he is to be able to carry out his duties he must be endowed with power to not be hamstrung by bickering nobles or parliaments.

HLQ_the_princes_men:0 "Create The Krallen"
HLQ_the_princes_men_desc:0 "With this strange new nation that has arisen there is no shortage of separatists or hostile radicals out there.

HLQ_centralise_the_army_desc:0 "Military strength is the final word of the king. When diplomacy and politics fail, it is up to the king to be the one who brings overwhelming violence to bear to enforce his right to rule. The Royal Defense Force will be his fist in this matter."

HLQ_the_third_kingdom_desc:0 "Brodfeld has been savaged by infighting for years, and whatever resolutions that tormented realm seems to reach is little more than brief respite for it.

HLQ_integrate_prywhen:0 "The Triune Kingdom"
HLQ_integrate_prywhen_desc:0 "Brodfeld is now part of the dual principality, but with this the issue of under which grown it should fall has reared its ugly head. In order to not upset the power balance of the nation and also preserve Brodfeld's identity, the solution has been to let the Dual Principality become a trinity of crowns. Three peoples, three crowns, one nation."

HLQ_reinforce_lingustic_equality_desc:0 "This kingdom is as diverse as they come; from the southern coasts of Sydia to the hills of Wingenberg, and the creatures who live there are no less diverse.

The Triune Kingdom will maintain its commitment to being a home for each of the cultures that is part of it."
HLQ_the_kingdom_port:0 "The Sydia Concordat"
HLQ_the_kingdom_port_desc:0 "The inclusion of Brodfeld into our nation has given us something neither Hellquill nor Lushi ever has possessed; a seaport. Sydia will from now on serve as the gateway to the rest of the world for the entirety of our nation, and in order to make sure it can do so sufficiently, hefty investments will be needed."
HLQ_dreams_of_conquest:0 "Dreams Of Ost-Griffonia"
HLQ_dreams_of_conquest_desc:0 "Ost-Griffonia has been a dream for centuries among griffonkind, and yet today that dream is closer than ever.

HLQ_conquer_the_host_desc:0 "The cossacks have counted on their distance from the Griffonian Empire to hold onto their freedom for a long time, but it is time for this to end. They are brave fighters, and when we have broken them they will become proud fighters of the new empire."

HLQ_conquer_gryphus_desc:0 "The Free Towns of Gryphus have been a backwater for as long as anygriff can remember, and it's time to bring them into the fold.

HLQ_strike_at_lake_city_desc:0 "Our goal is finally within reach! Before us stand the unruly ponies of the east, ponies who for centuries have refused to allow the Ost-Griffonian dream to become manifest.

HLQ_contact_the_ponies_desc:0 "For years, the IIA has fought the good fight against the criminal rule of Dusktalon in Longsword. And while they were crushed by the Reformisten war machine, they have lived on. We need to reach out and let them know that they didn't fight in vain."

HLQ_revolutionary_tribunals:0 "The Revolutionary Tribunals"
HLQ_revolutionary_tribunals_desc:0 "Chief among the revolutionary concerns needs to be justice. Justice for the plunders, lies, insults and deaths.

HLQ_nationalise_collaborator_assets:0 "Punish The Collaborators"
HLQ_nationalise_collaborator_assets_desc:0 "Too many industrialists and landowners have been happy to collaborate with the Reformisten's criminal regime to advance their own interests.

HLQ_the_peoples_courts:0 "The Volksgerichte"
HLQ_the_peoples_courts_desc:0 "Hellquill's justice system has utterly compromised itself by giving a veneer of legitimacy to the Reformisten's criminal plans.

HLQ_no_mercy_for_sturmgreifen:0 "A Noose For The Black Cloaks"
HLQ_no_mercy_for_sturmgreifen_desc:0 "The Sturmgreife have proven themselves to be the very worst among the Reformisten. They weren't simple soldiers ordered into committing their crimes.

HLQ_hunt_down_military_remnants_desc:0 "Many of the Reformisten lay dead, either killed in the revolution or at the claws of their brethren.

HLQ_socialist_nationalism:0 "Socialist Nationalism"
HLQ_socialist_nationalism_desc:0 "The character of our nation is one of progressivism. It is the very reason that our people have revolted against the lies and imperialist ways of the Reformisten.

HLQ_recognize_the_cultures_desc:0 "Hellquill and Longsword lie between two different worlds and as such, any idea of cultural homogeneity is a fool's dream.

HLQ_worker_self_management:0 "Arbeiterselbstverwaltung"
HLQ_worker_self_management_desc:0 "We have seen what happens when the economy is run in an authoritarian fashion. Top-down management is inherently reactionary and oppressive.

HLQ_merge_police_and_sturmgreifen:0 "The Ordnungspolizei"
HLQ_merge_police_and_sturmgreifen_desc:0 "For too long our police force has allowed rot and decay to prevail in Hellquill because of a lack of will and tools.

HLQ_purity_tests:0 "Purity Tests"
HLQ_purity_tests_desc:0 "While us Griffons are naturally safe from the curse of magic, the Ponies still find ways to pervert us.

HLQ_expand_camps:0 "The Arbeitslager System"
HLQ_expand_camps_desc:0 "During the Wingfried years, we have seen how useful the use of forced labour from the Ponies and traitors has been to our industry. However, this has all been half-measures.

hellquill.1.t:0 "The Treasure Of Diamond Mountain"
hellquill.1.d:0 "Over thirty years ago, our noble knights invaded the savage dogs of Diamond Mountain and plundered each and every underground vault they had. Unintelligent beasts, they only hoarded wealth for the sake of wealth, and we have used this boon in an efficient manner in the past decades, slowly improving our living standards, armed forces and more. Yet even this vast treasure has its end, and we are left with only a fraction of the original sum. With the dogs having cowardly joined forces with the River Coalition, there is no hope of getting our claws on such a treasure any time soon and we will have to make do with it.\n\nThe Inner Circle of the Order is in agreement over the need to use it for investment and not to hoard it ourselves but not over what it should be spent on. Our civilian advisors are strongly recommending to invest in our weak industrial sector while knights are divided between attracting settlers and investing in our armed forces. [HLQ.GetLeader] will have the final decision on the matter."
hellquill.1.a:0 "These riches will help kickstart our industry!"
hellquill.1.b:0 "This wealth shall be used for our people, and attract settlers."
hellquill.1.c:0 "We are oathbound to use this treasure on matters of war!"

hellquill.2.t:0 "Siegfried's Retirement"
hellquill.2.d:0 "Grandmaster Siegfried Trappenfeld has served the Order of Hellquill well for many years, standing valiantly against the threat in the East. Sadly for us all, his will to lead us has slowly faded over these past couple of trying years. Much has changed in Griffonia with new ideas and threats emerging and Trappenfeld has lamented that his old age has made him ill-fit to face them. The Inner Circle has thanked him for his service and the now former Grandmaster will retire to his farm on the banks of the Griffking river. Now, the Inner Circle is to meet and debate among themselves as to what the Order is to become in this new millenium.\n\nThis election is occuring in a tense situation and is bound to be a crossroads for us. The emergence of the Reformisten movement has indeed caused much disturbance in Hellquill. Unhappy with the current situation, these ideologues led by the knight Wingfried von Katerinburg are calling for extreme solutions to the pony threat in the East. While Wingfried and his supporters have distanced themselves from the Longswordian genocide, we have had a taste of their policy. Yet, the Katerinian has gained a significant following and he may very well win out. His staunchest critic is Urlach ap Cyrod, a Rumarean knight, who claims that the mission given to their Order by his imperial Majesty Grover II is unamendable and sacred. His speeches have made him the de facto leader of the traditionalists.\n\nArguments between the two have quickly become heated and as the Inner Circle is about to meet, it is clear that there will be no chance of compromise between the two. However, in the background, another voice has emerged, that of the knight archivist August von Ortelsberg. A calm and erudite griffon, August is quietly calling for introspection and reforms, as well as welcoming the population into government. He has also advanced ideas of reconciliation with the ponies, much to the dismay of the Reformisten."
hellquill.2.a:0 "We thank you for your service."

hellquill.3.t:0 "August Takes The Helm"
hellquill.3.d:0 "August von Ortelsberg, though previously considered an outsider in the race to becoming the new Grandmaster of the Order, has in the end came on top. The bickering between Urlach ap Cyrod and Wingfried von Katerinburg made either of them unappealing to the knights. So much so that the Inner Circle has found himself much more receiving to the calm ideas of August despite them being initially hostile to the archivist.\n\nAugust, in his speech, has lambasted the bellicose ways of the Order. For two centuries, the Griffonian Empire had failed to push eastwards, he said. He argued that the Order's raids and warlike stance had reduced them to being no better than common bandits and that by pursuing this policy, they only kept the Riverlands on the warpath. He also criticized the crimes of Count Pallas of Longsword and the ideology of the Reformisten which he called a perversion of everything they ever stood for. He warned that slaughter as the beginning and end of any ideology would only bring about chaos and failure.\n\nAnd so, he would offer his claw to the ponies to establish a peaceful nation, one that could act as a crossroads of all species. It would be through peace that their ancient mission of guarding the East would be achieved."
hellquill.3.a:0 "Let us see what he can do."

hellquill.4.t:0 "Ponies Voice Their Concerns"
hellquill.4.d:0 "Despite August's von Ortelsberg promises of peace and harmony between Griffons and Ponies, there has been complaints about his policy of welcome western refugees. Griffons refugees are reportedly settling in lands that were previously owned by Ponies and were planned to be reserved for colonization. Many Pony advocates, River Breeze among them, and supporters of appeasement have criticized the move as rebranded Griffonian settlement.\n\nAdding to the controversy is the presence among August's circle of advisors of some supporters of an idea of "Species Critical Mass". According to this theory, a democratic Hellquill would only be workable if one group of creatures is both dominant and committed to equality. They argue that a narrow difference between creatures would only lead to the disintegration of the state between a Pony state and a Griffon state.\n\nNow, August has openly condemned the Critical Mass theory, fired some of its most vocal proponents from government positions and repeated time and time again that his welcoming of refugees is only driven by a creaturian duty to help save lives. he has also pointed to Ponies being part of the refugees albeit in very small numbers. But one can still wonders as to what the former archivists exactly thought about in his dusty libraries..."
hellquill.4.a:0 "Reassure our Pony Friends."

hellquill.5.t:0 "The School Debate"
hellquill.5.d:0 "Since its inception, the Order of Hellquill has had little understanding regarding education. For the settlers and knights of old, the only purpose of education were to help settlers to read about our laws and be taught about their duties towards the Grand Crusade and the Gods.\n\nAs modernity began to spread the idea of state education, the knights of Hellquill barely left a claw to implement the needed reforms. Both civilian charities and the temples did try and organize some private or religious schools but with their limited resources, they could only do so much. As for the Ponies in the countryside, they had more pressing concerns than to learn despite some initiatives here and there and the work of Griffon missionaries to try an convert some to the Trinitarian Griffonian Faith.\n\nNow, an avid proponent of education reforms stands as Grandmaster but the advisors that August called to his side were split on one central issue. How should the divide between Ponies and Griffons be addressed? August's supporters, among which Pony Rights advocates and former teachers from the countryside, proposed an ambitious and costly plans that would create a public school system welcoming any creatures of age and reach all communities into the country. Others, mostly knights from the old guard and civilian conservatives, called for a separate educational system with schools reserved for Griffons and other for Ponies. Extremists, mostly adversaries of August, even called for a two-tier system with most of our resources being sent to the Griffon-only schools. The proposal has been dismissed but has convinced some and, surprisingly enough, even some Ponies who fear a one-size-fits-all system would only perpetuate Griffon cultural hegemony and wish for schools that would respect their cultural differences."
hellquill.5.a:0 "There is no need for separate schools."
hellquill.5.b:0 "Griffons and ponies each have their needs."

hellquill.6.t:0 "Black Cloak Attack"
hellquill.6.d:0 "Groups of Griffons that are said to belong to the Sturmgreife, the paramilitary wing of the reformisten, have carried out an attack on multiple pony communities last night. Travelling from town to town, they went ahead and torched every building they could find, destroy or captured food rations and shot any pony that was brave enough to oppose them. When troops arrived, the raiding party was already gone, nowhere to be seen. Rumours claim that Edler von Wingenberg, leader of the SG, was part of these attacks himself, but no one truly knows. We have no information on the whereabouts of Wingfried von Katerinburg himself but there is little doubt that he has at least approved of the attacks."
hellquill.6.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

hellquill.7.t:0 "Birth of the Druwi Movement"
hellquill.7.d:0 "The last months has seen a curious explosion of activities in cities and pony towns. As more and more seem to begin to trust August von Ortelsberg's promises of reform and equality, tensions are beginning to dissipate.\n\nAs a consequence of this, reports are coming in of many cultural initiatives among ponies that have been described as a renaissance movement, or "Druwi" in the Posniak dialect. An effort - supported by August - is ongoing to codify the language and publish modern dictionaries and textbooks for a future recognition of the dialect as an official language. Posniak artists are beginning to produce artworks and literary pieces with frantic enthusiasm to the point that some theorizes that they are actually making public work that they made in secret during the censorship days. In the countryside, traditional parties are being held. Newborn fillies and foals are given names long forgotten or even banned under previous regulations.\n\nThere are even reports of some groups trying to resurrect the old Posniak faiths. This religious development has actually provoked some controversy among the Hellquillian prelates who fear that the Trinitarian character of Hellquill is being threatened. As a result, August has spent a great deal of time to try and alleviate their fears. Despite this, it seems as if it is indeed springtime in Hellquill!"
hellquill.7.a:0 "Swentinimai! Is that how they say?"

hellquill.8.t:0 "Wingfried's Arrest"
hellquill.8.d:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg was apprehended today in his mansion near Beakstadt. A group of officers rushed into his home and secured him before he could escape through a backdoor.\n\nDespite the growing pressure, the leader of the Reformisten movement seemed to have thought that he was untouchable. During his interrogation, he tried to claim special privilege and demanded to be extradited to his native Katerin. He was quickly reminded that as part of his oath of knighthood, he had given up on such rights and was fully under the jurisdiction of Hellquill.\n\nWith Wingfried in our captivity, the Black Cloaks have lost their head. But while there are others still out there, they and everyone in Hellquill can now rest assured that August von Ortelsberg isn't to be trifled with. The Black Cloaks better get to improve on their hiding skills."
hellquill.8.a:0 "Well done."

hellquill.9.t:0 "The Von Katerinburg Trial"
hellquill.9.d:0 "The Court had gathered to decide the fate of Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the Black Cloaks. Despite the court being packed, there was no sight of many of his supporters. Finally, the Katerinian was called by the judge. He looked twitchy and nervous. When he finally spoke, it was with a consumed anger.\n\n"Hellquillians! I stand here today exposed to lies and slander simply because I dared object to our so-called Grandmaster's grab of power! I know nothing of those whose actions the court tries to pin on me. Anyone who has met me knows that I am incapable of such things. My only crime is that of loving Hellquill and wishing the best on my fellow Griffons! All I ever did in my life was aimed at achieving peace for us, the Hellquillians.\nThe only thing that I realised, unlike those who claim to lead us, is that we must fight our enemies, not invite them for dinner. Have you forgotten the past, I ask you!? Is our very nation of Hellquill not built on the very principle of standing against ponykind? Is this not the truth? If ponies are our friend and equals, then why have they willingly attacked and raided our people many times in history? Would you call those things "equals", Your Honour? Would you really? I have tried to warn you all of the danger but you seem to be deaf to reason!\n\nHe paused for a moment to collect himself.\n\nI am Wingfried of the house of Von Katerinburg. As such, I am accustomed to being unjustly treated! But despite this, I hope this court can have the slightest modicum of respect and acknowledge that I am a griffon of princely blood. I am not to be treated like a common peasant and I demand to be let go!""
hellquill.9.a:0 "Imprison him."
hellquill.9.b:0 "Exile him."
hellquill.9.c:0 "Send him to the gallows."

hellquill.10.t:0 "A New Hellquill"
hellquill.10.d:0 "As his car was riding through the city of Hellquill, August was pondering on everything that had happened since he had taken over. It hadn't been an easy journey. Putting an end to the Black Cloak terrorism had been a bloody affair which had caused tension with his fellow knights, some of which had been intrigued by what Wingfried was proposing. But it was all over. There had been mistakes along the way too. Perhaps he had compromised too much? Or too little. He wasn't always sure.\n\nThe car stopped in front of a crossroads on which. Two carriages were stuck on the road with members of each convoy arguing with each other after what seemed like a small traffic incident with strollers watching the scene. He leaned on the window to look at the scene. Months ago, he would have been scared by the idea of an ambush by Black Cloaks or Pony partisans but it had all been so calm lately. He smiled as his escorting knights marched to make way to see that the arguing creatures were mixed groups of Griffons and Ponies. How quickly things were changing in Hellquill, he thought. They were finally learning to live together. It was so liberating... This. This was peaceful life at last.\n\nAs the car resumes its way towards the castle, August's face became serious again. He had done much yes. But now. Now there was more to do. He had invited civilians and Ponies into the government and the administration but it was not enough. Now, he had to convince the knights that maybe, just maybe, their time was nearing its end."
hellquill.10.a:0 "Let's hope I can convince them a second time."

hellquill.12.t:0 "The Republic"
hellquill.12.d:0 "After a tumultuous three days of discussion with the Inner Circle, August sat in his office, exhausted. Both Carl von Soldau and Urlach ap Cyrod hadn't joined. Urlach had made himself rare at the castle since his political retirement. As for Carl... He and August had had an agreement outside of the council room. They both understood that times were changing and that some reforms just wouldn't be rolled back but they agreed that they would let each other be. A political danger for sure but one more guarantee for the future. Yet, it had been much more difficult than he had thought.\n\nAugust had made the case to transition to a republican form of government. The reactions had been strong. Some, like Wilhelm Stackelberg, called the move an absolute betrayal of their oaths and called for the removal of August as Grandmaster. He wasn't followed on that but many were displeased, considering that he had squandered the trust they had given him. In a way, he couldn't really blame them. He had done his best to make the reform inevitable and knew that too much consultations would have resulted in the failure of his plans. On the second days, cooler heads prevailed after Demetrius Kamphaus relented his opposition. Things went forward. They had almost agreed on a compromise to establish a constitutional monarchy under a duke or a prince, at Kamphaus' proposal. Yet, the proposal failed because it would have meant agreeing on a foreign noble which were not popular since Wingfried's rebellion, crowning a knight or a local noble. They failed to agree on a name and so, the idea of a Republic prevailed. Funnily enough, just like Cloudbury had become the bastion of republicanism, the Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury would become a Republic too.\n\nAnd now, there he was. Drafting and signing the knightly decree recognizing a Republic of Hellquill and relinquishing executive power to a provisional government and the future Republic. After he had applied his seal of Grandmaster on his very last decree and his resignation letter, August smiled. He stood up and went to the window. He pondered for a moment. What would the people decide now?"
hellquill.12.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

hellquill.13.t:0 "The First Election"
hellquill.13.d:0 "Today was the very first election of the new Republic of Hellquill. In the end, the increased security planned by Grandmaster August and his provisional government were not needed. No attacks had occurred despite some threats from KpH operatives and Black Cloak remnants or wannabes. Democracy and enthusiasm prevailed for this day at least. Despite the sudden proclamation of the Republic, four political forces had quickly organized.\n\nThe first, the Konservative Volkspartei or KVP, formed by August von Ortelsberg upon stepping down as Grandmaster offered a simple campaign promise: to continue and expand upon the reforms of August. With his massive popularity, he stands a good chance of securing a majority or a coalition.\n\nOpposing him is The Ost-Griffonische Bund or OGB, Carl von Soldau's faction turned political after he had stepped down from the Order too. Embracing democracy, he nevertheless offered a tempting message for the Hellquillians: a little bit of stability. Von Soldau hopes to convince the Griffon majority to form a block strong enough to make himself unavoidable as president.\n\nThe most surprising contender was of course Reiner Guttenfried and his Sozialliberale Partei bid for power. The prominent merchant had become the face of a new successful business class in Hellquill and he had used his newfound wealth to offer the country a taste of his business savvy. His greatest strength is probably his status as a famous outsider.\n\nFinally, and probably most dramatically, is River Breeze and his Pony-named Zmānenawinan Peraīninsnas Wīrija. River Breeze is advocating the creation of a strong welfare state. He can count on the broad support of Pony communities. Yet, he will need to convince almost all of them and hope for division in the Griffon electorate to be able to force an an alliance with August or Reiner's forces with him at its head.\n\nWith little time for campaign, nocreature in Hellquill is sure of the result but what is certain is that Hellquill will be in for interesting times!"
hellquill.13.a:0 "The KVP wins the election!"
hellquill.13.b:0 "The ZPW wins the election!"
hellquill.13.c:0 "The SLP wins the election!"
hellquill.13.e:0 "The OGB wins the election!"

hellquill.14.t:0 "Officers Resign"
hellquill.14.d:0 "Following the establishment of our new leadership, a group of officers has departed and resigned from their posts. We don't know their true motives behind this move, which they have made sure to keep quiet about, but it is sad to see parts of the old guard of our forces go like this."
hellquill.14.a:0 "We're sorry to see them go."

hellquill.15.t:0 "Dealing with Longsword"
hellquill.15.d:0 "Our nation has changed a lot during these past couple of months. From an ancient knightly order, we have reformed ourselves into something greater, a place where two races can cooperate and coexist with one another. Our neighbours, friends and old allies of Longsword to the south, however, have not seen reason just yet. It is time we approached them, as friends, and invited them to join us. Only through unification can we guarantee that no further blood is shed between Griffons and ponies."
hellquill.15.a:0 "Let us talk to our friends."
hellquill.15.b:0 "Sadly, blood must be shed for unification."

hellquill.16.t:0 "An Offer From Hellquill"
hellquill.16.d:0 "Our neighbours and ancient allies to the north, Hellquill, have sent us a telegram today. It attempts to charm us and portrays our alliance and friendship in great detail, but the main point of it is Unification. The Hellquillians ask for us to surrender our nation to them for peaceful unification under their banner. All our griffons (and ponies) would receive immediate citizenship and protection from Hellquill. What should our response be? Do we unite with our friends? Or is this the time to finally break ties with them?"
hellquill.16.a:0 "We shall join them in harmony."
hellquill.16.b:0 "We politely refuse."

hellquill.17.t:0 "Longsword Accepts"
hellquill.17.d:0 "Huzzah! Our friends and allies in Longsword have seen reason in our polite request and have given in to our request for unification. Henceforth, Hellquillians and Longswordians shall stand as one, together!"
hellquill.17.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.18.t:0 "Longsword Declines"
hellquill.18.d:0 "It appears that despite our best efforts and kindest words, Longsword has declined our request for unification. This is most unfortunate, and poses a dangerous question to us: Do we accept their decision? Or do we ensure lasting peace between ponies and Griffons by taking them by force?"
hellquill.18.a:0 "An unfortunate decision."
hellquill.18.b:0 "Forceful unification it is, then."

hellquill.19.t:0 "Urlach Becomes the New Grandmaster"
hellquill.19.d:0 "After several raucous meetings, the Inner Circle ultimately designated Urlach ap Cyrod as the new Grandmaster of the Order of Hellquill. Ultimately, the most senior knights sided with him one by one after getting increasingly worried by Wingfried von Katerinburg's barely veiled threats.\n\nIn his speech, Urlach praised the Inner Circle for seeing the light and standing firm in the face of doubt and unreasonable promises. He pledged to continue in the pawsteps of his predecessor, Siegfried von Trappenfeld, so that Hellquill would forevermore stand as a bastion of justice and faith.\n\nDespite his victory, Ulrach grew concerned after the vote. It had been much closer than he had anticipated and there had been so little enthusiasm in the upholding of tradition. And while he could understand that it took courage to stand by your ideals, perhaps, just perhaps there was indeed a need to listen and pay attention to what brought those modernists and extremists to stray away from the righteous path."
hellquill.19.a:0 "Time to get to work."

hellquill.20.t:0 "The Fight Against Illiteracy"
hellquill.20.d:0 "It is time to take up arms against the ever-growing Illiteracy within Hellquill. No longer shall our chicks gasp in sorrow, unable to read even the most basic of texts. Schools, reading clubs and more, this is what we need, and this is what we shall have!"
hellquill.20.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.21.t:0 "The End of Illiteracy"
hellquill.21.d:0 "We have done it! Illiteracy is finally a thing of the past, and our griffons have become skilled at writing, reading and basic mathematics. This is a great day, indeed!"
hellquill.21.a:0 "Finally!"

hellquill.22.t:0 "The Shield of Griffonkind"
hellquill.22.d:0 "A small group of Knights from Hellquill has made their way into Griffenheim this afternoon, wanting to speak with the Imperial Regent. At their head was the Grandmaster of Hellquill, Urlach. He made an inspiring speech about our old values of honour and tradition, and then kneeled down before the regent and the rest of the imperial council, pledging renewed allegiance and servitude to the Empire. We will make sure that this act of honour is not so easily forgotten. The Knightly Order returns to protect all Griffons in the Empire!"
hellquill.22.a:0 "Welcome back!"

hellquill.23.t:0 "The Knights Demand Submission"
hellquill.23.d:0 "It seems our longtime friends in Hellquill have sent us a "request" today, or rather an ultimatum. They say that, in order to ensure continued prosperity and safety for the Empire and all Griffons, we must accept unification under their banner. We would no doubt bring shame over ourselves and our ancestors if we gave up our sovereignty just like that! And yet... we don't stand a chance against Hellquill and the Empire combined. Perhaps we should just avoid a pointless bloodshed?"
hellquill.23.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
hellquill.23.b:0 "Never! Longsword will be free!"

hellquill.24.t:0 "Longsword Refuses"
hellquill.24.d:0 "Those fools down in Longsword have unfortunately failed to see the reason in our most reasonable request for unification. Oh well. It was their choice, after all. If it is war they seek, then war they shall get!"
hellquill.24.a:0 "To war!"

hellquill.25.t:0 "Wingfried Takes Control"
hellquill.25.d:0 "The Inner Circle has discussed the future of Hellquill in depth, and one singular Griffon has come out on top of everyone else, it seems. Wingfried von Katerinburg, founder and leader of the controversial 'Reformisten' movement, has been elected to lead Hellquill henceforth.\n\nThe new Grandmaster, not known for being subtle, laid out his ambitions in front of the council. He vowed to act in the interest of Hellquill and its Griffons alone, deliberately ignoring and leaving out that Hellquill is still home to many Pony minorities. Wingfried and his violent ideology are renowned for their views on Griffon supremacy and the concept that ponies are an evil that must be eliminated for the good of Griffonkind. His speech marked a drastic shift from his predecessors. Wingfried made no reference to the mission given to them by the emperor Grover II, the place of the free Diamond Dogs within the Order or even their duties towards the Empire. He also failed to address the controversial bloodbath carried out by his ideological brethrens in Longsword, focusing instead on the purity of his mission and their prestige even outside of Hellquill.\n\nOne way or another, Wingfried aims to elevate Hellquill to something beyond an ordinary Order of Knights, and shape it into something greater, something that will last for a thousand years."
hellquill.25.a:0 "For glory!"

hellquill.26.t:0 "The Old Guard Complains"
hellquill.26.d:0 "While the Reformisten party has gained more than its fair share of supporters within the Order, not all knights have been convinced by our ideology. As our supporters began to take their rightful place within the administration, many traditionalist and moderate members of the Order started to voice their complaints about Wingfried's leadership. Among their grievances are the intrusion of civilian political operatives within the knightly government, the lack of respect for tradition, the alleged moral lapses of many members and the chaos caused by the Reformisten agenda in Longsword.\n\nWingfried von Katerinburg openly condemned those who would sabotage his immense task of bringing the Order into a new age and mused about the complainers being guilty of treason towards their Order, causing only further complaints and controversy.\n\nIf nothing is done, the Old Guard may prove to be a problem for our rule."
hellquill.26.a:0 "We don't appreciate dissenters."

hellquill.27.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
hellquill.27.d:0 "Last night, ten minutes after midnight, it commenced.\n\nThe streets were suddenly lit up with the light of torches burning bright. Rows and mobs of Griffons marched through the streets of the capital, shouting chants along the way as they made their way to the Pony ghetto at the outskirts of the city. A group of police officers, uniformed to look just like soldiers, broke open the gate to the ghetto, which had been previously locked to disallow the ponies from leaving their 'containment zone'.\nIt was a slaughter. After just three minutes, houses had been set ablaze, gunshots were being fired, and there were brawls between the angry mob and desperate, yet brave ponies. But it was no use. At the end of the night, just less than an hour after it all began, the Pony ghetto fell silent once more. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but start of something much greater. All across Hellquill, Griffons are encouraged to rise up into violent mobs and attack any ponies in their area. The government has made their position more than clear: Hellquill is a home for Griffons, ONLY Griffons."
hellquill.27.a:0 "We'll get rid of the rats eventually."

hellquill.28.t:0 "Refugees in Deponya"
hellquill.28.d:0 "Today, just after dawn, large groups of exhausted and visibly scarred ponies crossed the border between Hellquill and Deponya. They seek refuge from 'the terrors of Hellquill.' Generous and helpful families have decided to allow these ponies safe refuge within their homes until the government has a place to permanently house them in, or until this situation is otherwise resolved. The question remains however: What exactly did happen in Hellquill? What are they running from? And... should we be scared, too?"
hellquill.28.a:0 "This is an ill omen."

hellquill.29.t:0 "Education Effort"
hellquill.29.d:0 "The Order of Hellquill had failed in the previous decades to achieve a real literacy and educational policy. They instead relied on traditional apprenticeship organized by the guilds and local temples' charitable teachings, making the new generations woefully unprepared in an age of industry and increasing complexity. Worse, the civil unrest caused by frontier conflicts, raiding and partisan activities has caused illiteracy to worsen in many rural areas.\n\nFortunately, our Order has resources and many literate members. They shall all be put to the task of finally educating Hellquill and to teach the young chicks of our nation of the Reformisten ideological tenets. It is time for them to learn the name of Wingfried von Katerinburg and of their duties toward the state!"
hellquill.29.a:0 "We can resolve this issue."

hellquill.30.t:0 "Education Efforts Finished"
hellquill.30.d:0 "After months of work, we have finally reached even the smallest settlements in Hellquill. With the help of our civilian sympathizers, we have taught young griffs far and wide the basics of how to read, write, count and also of their duties towards the state and Führer. There is still a great deal of work to be done but the worst is behind us. Already, we are receiving encouraging reports from the various industrialists in the nation that we will amplify to let the world know of the greatness of Hellquill!"
hellquill.30.a:0 "Good to hear."

hellquill.31.t:0 "The Führer Speaks"
hellquill.31.d:0 "As he was walking towards the Hellquill's castle balcony, Wingfried von Katerinburg was pondering on everything that he had achieved. It had been a long and difficult journey after all. Many had tried to trick him, to rob Hellquill of its glorious future. Others had even tried to kill him but now, he had prevailed. The time had come for him to achieve his destiny.\n\nHe arrived to the balcony where he was welcomed by his staff. Edler von Wingenberg and Demetrius Kamphaus saluted him. He had chosen them both, these two most loyal servants, to stand by his side during his speech. He stopped to smile and embrace Edler who had helped him to find the right words. The griff, known to dislike touch, seemed taken aback but Wingfried didn't care. It was his moment. He stepped outside and looked upon the crowds outside. He approached the microphones that would transmit his speech to the nation and took a deep breath.\n\n"My people... Griffons of Hellquill. How long have we been all left to rot in this frontier? Since the day that Grover II sent us on this mission that had been ours for so long, how neglected we have been? Cast aside like the scum of Griffonia. Paid in paltry "honours" and left to struggle for our lives against the wretched dogs and ponies of the East... Haven't we suffered enough?\n\nYears ago, I asked myself these questions. And it is to answer them that I have sought to take the reins of this nation. I have seen what our good people were capable of, the greatness lying untapped in our hearts of frontiergriffs. And it is armed with such national spirit that I have taken the task of giving you all back your potential, your pride, your power! Some have sought to stop me! To keep you all in the chains of bondage of the West to be beaten by the East! Scum like Wilhelm Stackelberg."\n\nHe paused to let the people hear the boos of his supporters. Then, he went on with a fury in his voice.\n\n"But now! We have become a true realm, a new kingdom, carved by our own might. On this day, we stand united as one. On this day, those driven to keep us from what is ours will witness our might! On this day, we shall act as one, and we shall be ignored NO MORE! Defenders of the Nation of Hellquill, NOW IS OUR TIME!"\n\nWingfried, shivering, paused to see soldiers and civilians cheer and applaud him."

hellquill.32.t:0 "The Sturmgreife's New Role"
hellquill.32.d:0 "The Sturmgreife's integration into our armed forces has proved to be a point of contention. Many in the Wehrmacht and among the old knights saw them as nothing more than fanatical political rabble and upstarts. Numerous conflicts and petty squabbles erupted between the two rival armed forces, notably on the matter of the SG's private ventures. Not helping the matter was that the Sturmgreife had never been truly integrated into the Hellquillian military doctrine, which only fueled concerns about them simply being the loyal branch of the military.\n\nNow, there has been wide talks about formally merging the Sturmgreife and the Wehrmacht into a single unified entity. However, the question of what precise role should the Sturmgreife play into the unified Wehrmacht, namely an aggressive and direct role at the frontline by giving them their own regiments within the army, or a more supportive role by stationing their soldiers behind the Frontline and in recon battalions to more effectively use their irregular tactics. Both suggestions sound reasonable, but only one is possible. Which one will it be?"
hellquill.32.a:0 "Give them their own regiments."
hellquill.32.b:0 "Give them a support role."

hellquill.33.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"

Our advisors are split on the matter, though Hellquill argues that their safety is in the best interest of [Root.GetNameDef], as well. On the other claw, protecting Hellquill means we might get dragged into a war with the entire River Coalition. How shall we proceed?"

hellquill.36.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.36.d:0 "The griffons of Hellquill have approached us within the capital today, not to declare war (for once) but to commence diplomatic talks. It appears that they have had a huge change of heart over these last few months, resulting in a much less aggressive stance overall and the creation of a new society where ponies and griffons in Hellquill can live together in peace. Now, they seek us out for formal support and a guarantee of independence. Is this a good idea?"

hellquill.42.t:0 "The Purple Plague"
hellquill.42.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck us all! Thousands of ponies lie dead in the streets of our cities, and smaller villages have turned into ghost towns, inhabited only by the deceased corpses of the ponies who once prospered there.\n\nThe vile regime of Hellquill, lead by the disgusting and racist Wingfried von Katerinburg, has treated ponies like dirt before, even cutting defenceless families down with sabers in an effort to destroy the pony population of Hellquill. Now, these acts have grown too big to ignore, and too vile to tolerate.\n\nPonies in Hellquill were apprehended and experimented upon by griffon scientists. It appears that there, the scientists infected the ponies with a terrifying and deadly virus, the purple plague as it is called. Then, they sent hundreds, if not over a thousand of these infected individuals east, into our lands. Anypony that got close to them was almost doomed to die, and this disease has already killed entire countrysides and half the population of certain cities in the River Federation, with the death toll steadily increasing.\n\nWe must take action against these thugs and racists in Hellquill. We can no longer tolerate their actions, nor do we have the choice to look the other way. The Governments of the River Federation have agreed in absolute unison:\n\nWe are going to war. The Griffons will pay!"

After we've got the griffon to calm down and explain his issue, he has revealed that the [From.GetName] is under grave threat, and require immediate assistance lest the Empire's eastern borders become threatened. While we regard the eastern lands as our rightful territory, we might not be able to properly cover the front, given the current situation in the rest of Griffonia. How do we respond to the envoy?"

hellquill.45.t:0 "The Empire Rejects Our Plea"
hellquill.45.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Empire has declined to bring us aid in our darkest hour. The envoy brought the bad news while barely suppressing his tears. We are left on our own against the invader..."

hellquill.46.t:0 "The Empire Demands Submission!"
hellquill.46.d:0 "A letter has arrived today, bearing the Emperor's seal. What could prompt the Empire to turn their attention to us? A cursory reading reveals that the Empire demands their rightful vassal, the Knightly Order of Hellquill, to place themselves under the Empire's aegis, for the Riverponies have risen up in vast numbers to destroy the griffon way of life. While we've remained neutral thus far in the conflict, there's no telling when the ponies will turn their attention on ourselves. How shall respond to the Emperor?"
hellquill.46.a:0 "The ponies are a great threat, we must submit."
hellquill.46.b:0 "We can handle the ponies on our own!"

hellquill.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] Submits"
hellquill.47.d:0 "The leader of [From.GetName], [From.GetLeader] has arrived today in [Root.Capital.GetName] to swear oaths of fealty to the Emperor. Predictably, they have bowed before our might."
hellquill.47.a:0 "We welcome our new vassal."

hellquill.48.t:0 "A Diplomatic Insult!"
hellquill.48.d:0 "Outrage! [From.GetLeader], the leader of [From.GetName] has rejected our rightful demand, claiming they don't need our protection against the Riverpony extremists! They need to be taught a lesson in manners, and know to bow before their betters!"
hellquill.48.a:0 "Their lands are forfeit to us!"

hellquill.49.t:0 "A Mysterious Disapearance"
hellquill.49.d:0 "The nomination of Wingfried von Katerinburg at the head of the Order of Hellquill has been a contentious affair. Chief among his opponents had been Urlach ap Cyrod, the Rumarean knight. Deeply traditionalist, he proved himself to also be a sore loser and openly complained about the decision of the Inner Circle. Many sensed that a confrontation would soon erupt between him and the new grandmaster. Until a fateful day.\n\nAt [GetDateText], Urlach left his quarters for his monthly trip to an inn on the banks of the Griffking River. The knight enjoyed to fish and relax there. However, he never came back from his trip. The owner and staff of the inn were questioned and confirmed that he did indeed visit but that they never saw him leave and his car was still there. Upon inspection of the area, no traces of him were found, nor any sign of a struggle. The knight had simply vanished.\n\nAn investigation was opened into the matter but the current lead is that partisans or criminals griffnapped him."
hellquill.49.a:0 "How mysterious!"

hellquill.50.t:0 "The Beakstadt Conference"
hellquill.50.d:0 "With the dissolution of the Order of Hellquill the question has arisen regarding what path the new, stronger Hellquill shall take. Wingfried has decided to discuss this matter in Beakstadt, calling not only the Generals of the Wehrmacht, but also Edler von Wingenberg as well as several of his cronies. This division has not stopped merely at the organisational level either, and instead the Sturmgreife and Wehrmacht have argued for two different ways to approach our future challenges.\n\nThe Wehrmacht, and especially General Kamphaus, has argued that whatever the long-term goals may be, the plans must be laid realistically. For example, "ill-conceived fancies" such as this crusade against ponies must be reevaluated. The goal isn't some insane "extermination", it is building the glory of Hellquill, opening up new lands for settlers and ensuring a stable and organized society.\n\nWhile Wingfried slowly nodded along with Kamphaus' words, Edler von Wingenberg has scoffed at these notions, meeting the calm, dry deliberations with fire and brimstone and dismissing the Wehrmacht's plan as "pony-like mewling". The ponies infesting these lands are a cancer he says, shown not the least by their violence in Longsword, and they must be exterminated so that in the ashes something greater can be built. The strength Hellquill has gained by discarding the old is undeniable, and they should continue down this glorious path, making Hellquill into a great new realm unlike any seen before, where strength and glory truly is supreme. The future is awaiting those willing to grasp it in their claws, and Hellquill is poised to seize it!\n\nKamphaus' contempt-filled sneer did not go unnoticed, but neither did Wingfried's obvious fascination with Edler's words. While the discussions continued, it seemed clear that the leader had made his choice." 
hellquill.50.a:0 "Perhaps a more moderate approach would be appropriate..."
hellquill.50.b:0 "Edler is right! The pony menace must be exterminated!"

hellquill.51.t:0 "Might Makes Right"
hellquill.51.d:0 "Disappointment was a bitter pill to swallow, and as Edler stared at the back of Wingfried's head he silently stewed in it. Pathetic, weak, useless! And to think that he had believed that this weakling could have led them to glory. Edler found himself trembling with rage and disgust. It was unacceptable, utterly unacceptable, and he silently thought that at least he had gotten this inadequate fool to see the truth, even though it would be his undoing.\n\n"It has been a long time coming," Wingfried said as he looked out of the window, Edler almost snickering at how ironic that statement was. "But finally we are getting there. Hellquill is being reborn, and your part in it will not be forgotten."\n\n"Oh I am certain it won't," Edler said, pulling out his pistol as he walked up behind Wingfried and struck him over the head as hard as he could. Wingfried collapsed to the ground with a choked grunt, slowly trying to push himself up as Edler pushed him down against the floor again. "You think you could have led our glorious crusade, you infantile weakling?! You, the griff who could not even keep his own generals in line!?"\n\n"You... you absolute maniac, you think you'll... get away with this?" Wingfried asked unsteadily, trying to push him off. Edler only cackled.\n\n"There it is... you never truly realized what true justice was after all. Might makes right, and the strong eat the weak!" With that, he fired two shots into the back of Wingfried's head, killing him instantly. When the door opened he had stepped off Wingfried's corpse, standing behind his desk as Eisen Silberkrone came in along with two Sturmgreife.\n\n"Is the castle secured," he asked his second-in-command, who smirked.\n\n"It is, my Führer. Hellquill is yours. One people, one realm, one leader.""
hellquill.51.a:0 "Ein Volk! Ein Reich! Ein Führer!"

hellquill.52.t:0 "The Night Of The Sharp Claws"
hellquill.52.d:0 "Demetrius Kamphaus looked down on the document he had been given as he walked through the hallways, surprised but not too dismayed by it. It was drastic, certainly, but not that surprising. Ever since Wingfried had taken the Wehrmacht's side, the Sturmgreife's leader had been more and more unhinged, claiming Wingfried was in the thrall of pony-loving race-traitors, and while Kamphaus would gladly have arrested and humiliated him, this was something quite special.\n\nComing out of the building, he greeted the officers who were waiting for him and chose to keep it snappy. This was going to be a long night.\n\n"The Führer has decided the Sturmgreife have gotten too uppity, and he's purging their upper echelons." He spoke briskly, yet calmly, with the voice of a griff who was planning a dinner party, or an office meeting. "Stahlflügel, you take fifth company and deal with Eisen Silberkrone and his subordinates, they'll be at the opera tonight. Bring plenty of ammunition and turn him into a sieve to be on the safe side. Steeltalon: you and your griffons will deal with these people," he told the griff as he handed him a list of names and pointed to one of them. "Especially this one. Kill his family too, they're too devoted to him to be left alone afterwards. Don't be melodramatic about it however. Von Soldau, I'll leave the rest on this list up to you. Use your discretion as long as it gets done. I will personally see to von Wingenberg. If we keep this brisk, we should all be back in town around breakfast."\n\nEdler and his pack of lunatics had tainted the nation for too long, but thankfully, blood was a mighty fine soap to wash nations clean with."
hellquill.52.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with."

hellquill.53.t:0 "The Stackelberg Affair"
hellquill.53.d:0 "It was a calm morning when Wilhelm Stackelberg walked in the Order's castle in Hellquill. It was nothing out of the ordinary except for Stackelberg wearing his full traditional knightly regalia and followed by six knights equally dressed. He didn't speak to anyone and simply walked in the halls. The group slowly raised a stir. Some knights, visibly aware of their visit, were walking out of their quarters similarly dressed. Others tried to interfere only to be stopped by the knights. With each step of the solemn procession, the castle slowly descended into chaos with knights and Reformisten officers fighting. Sturmgreife members began to open fires in some halls, causing rapid response from the knights.\n\nDespite the chaos, the procession carried on with Stackelberg leading it. His face was unfettered and solemn, like a statue of Boreas. He walked as if he was imbued with a divine mission.\n\nWhen the procession arrived in front of Wingfried's office, they were welcomed by machine-gun wielding guards who raised their weapons. Three of Wilhelm's followers went ahead to attack them but he stopped them with a gesture of his arm. The guards kept their cool and simply pointed their guns at the crowd as if they were unsure whether to fire or not. Stackelberg walked towards them, his sword in his claw but not menacingly.\n\n"Guards", he said calmly, "You have sworn an oath to the gods. To serve the Order. To carry on the mission given to us by our late emperor Grover the Second. We are sworn to fight the pony menace, to stay loyal forevermore, and to bring justice against any who would prevent us to do so. Behind those doors is such a griff. You know it. I can see it in your eyes. So I ask you this, loyal knights of Hellquill. Stand aside and let me do my duty.""

Their corpses will be burned and their ashes dispersed in a secret location. No ceremony shall be allowed to honour their name. Their nobility title in Hellquill shall be stripped from their entire house. Their properties shall be seized and purged of any references to their wretched history. All members of their House shall be banished forever of our realm, should they have not been found guilty of other crimes as well."

hellquill.55.d:0 "When Wilhelm Stackelberg rendered justice unto the traitorous pair, the whole Order shivered. Stackelberg, ever the flegmatic knight, had made little waves about his planned coup and never boasted about his intentions beforeclaw. This caused many of his followers to trust in his good judgment but to the Order at large, those who didn't know him, it meant the unknown.\n\nMany outposts were answering much more loosely since the coup due to fear what was about to happen and were waiting to see what would happen. The Sturmgreife and many reformisten officers thought that a purge was coming and several readied themselves to defend their lives or flee the country by force.\n\nHowever, the wave that would have wreaked havoc among the ranks of the Order never came. Instead, Stackelberg extended a forgiving claw to the supporters of his predecessor. Blaming everything on Edler and Wingfried, he welcomed all who would serve the Order. As for those who wouldn't accept a magnanimous pardon, woe to them..."

hellquill.56.d:0 "History hinges on small things. A delayed train. A rain wetting gunpowder on the battlefield. An unhappy gardener... For years, Ernst Fischer had been a lucky griffon, constantly evading capture despite the overwhelming power of the Order. But his good fortune had just run out.\n\nAnd so enters Lucius Hilliges, an elderly gardener who had until our march on the Hellquill castle been working at the family estate of a close collaborator of Edler von Wingenberg. His employer's family arrested, he had been forced to look for a new job and went to work for an old merchant living in Beakstadt. His pay was small and the new garden he had been tasked to tend to unimpressive. But one day, working late in the afternoon, he stopped to wipe the sweat from his forehead. That is when he saw him. A young but tired-looking griffon who had cracked open a small window to smoke a cigarette. He recognized him from a wanted drawing he had seen at his previous master's estate.\n\nOur knights did not go gentle on the traitorous griff. The safehouse was stormed with brutal force. The owner and Fischer's bodyguards were killed in the raid and Fischer himself was wounded in the attack after he had foolishly tried to fight back against our knights. The leader of the KpH was brought in for questioning and after he had talked, was hanged outside of the Hellquill castle."

hellquill.57.t:0 "Decimatio"
hellquill.57.d:0 "Stackelberg pondered for a long time about what to do about the insurgency. As for all things, he concluded that a return to tradition was the preferable course of action. Indeed, the problem that kept occuring was that the rebellious population and particularly the ponies and socialists were no more than immature fillies and chicks. They had failed to learn the great truths of the world and what place was theirs in it. He would have to imbue in them a sense of responsibility, of shared responsibilities.\n\nStackelberg and his closest knights drafted a list of settlements and city neighbourhoods that had been home to socialist insurgency under either the KpH and IIA or simply rebellion. They also drafted a list of military units within the Wehrmacht suspected of harbouring KpH sympathizing soldiers or denounced during Fischer's interrogation. The lists were assigned to loyal military officers. Some had been unsettled by the order but in the end, none dared to oppose or criticize their mission.\n\nAll creatures group listed were gathered in a public place and given a simple order. They would be asked to identify all those among them who had had participated in subversive activities and collectively executive them by any means appropriate for the place. Should they fail or refuse, a lottery would select a tenth of them to be executed collectively in the same fashion.\n\nFew chose the lottery."

hellquill.58.t:0 "The New Fiefs"
hellquill.58.d:0 "The Turnip family slowly walked across the forest alongside many other ponies under close Sturmgreife supervision. They had been awoken late during the night. Purple Top had tried to put on a happy face and promise their fillies that they would get to play today. She didn't have the heart to tell them what she was certain to happen next. She knew what it meant to leave the camps and to go for a group walk in the forest.... As they were walking, her eyes were beginning to tear up at the idea of her last action on earth to maybe have been lying to those she loved and cherished. Yet, she kept walking and did her best not to look at the griffon's machineguns. At midday, the Sturmgreife ordered them to stop near a small grove. Purple Top grabbed her fillies to hug them. It was time. But nothing happened. They were given some time to rest and given some food, a bowl of bland watery stew but food nonetheless. And then, they continued the forced march.\n\nThey arrived near Zinten in the late afternoon, near an old castle that was undergoing repairs. There, they were assembled in an abandoned village center. Some griffons were waiting on a stage. There, their camp officer ordered them to keep quiet while they were introduced to a senior officer who seemed to be overjoyed. It was explained to them that under order of the Order, their sentence to forced labour had been lifted and that the Grandmaster Wilhelm Stackelberg, in his infinite wisdom, had elevated them all to serfdom. They would work the land, obey their feudal lord - the obnoxiously smiling officer - and enjoy the "bliss of an obedient and humble life".\n\nThe ponies were all completely dumbfounded. None of them had expected anything like this, but Purple Top was overjoyed and cried tears of joy. Her fillies would live!\n\n"You should cry. We're going live and die as slaves. The little ones too," another pony quipped at them in an angry tone.\n\n"Don't talk like that. It's still something! You know what they were planning back in the camp!"\n\n"Oh sure. It's something. Until they change their mind, that is.""

hellquill.59.t:0 "Kamphaus' Scheme"
hellquill.59.d:0 "Demetrius Kamphaus had never been an overly sentimental griffon; preferring order and clarity to zealotry and fancies. That was why he had not joined Stackelberg's naive attempt to stop Wingfried, but it was also why he could not condone the path that this insane fool Edler was dragging Hellquill down. He had hoped that Wingfried would see some modicum of sense, but it seemed he was too addicted to Edler's poison. Thusly, if Hellquill was not going to turn into a parody of itself, Kamphaus had realized he had to something drastic. To Tartarus with fanciful last stands, this was about cutting out a cancer before it spread further.\n\nThankfully, the fact that the Sturmgreife were so enamored with their tools - like children carving their names on their favorite toys - provided a clean option. Wingfried's power was already unsteady, with many in high command seeing how he eagerly suckled at Edler's teat, seemingly heedless of what he was being fed. A knife in the night, one with the Sturmgreife symbols on, and an assassin shot dead by one of his sharpshooters, would cause it all to collapse. Wingfried would have been killed by the zealots that he had harbored, his name would be mud and the Sturmgreife would be ripped to pieces as the "truth" came out.\n\nHe wasn't a sentimental griffon. He was a patriot and a soldier, and he would be damned before he let these jesters drag Hellquill's name in the mud."

"The remaining Sturmgreife have spread through the nation, and are agitating against us. Hellquill's creditors are reluctant to say the least to honour their obligations to us. In brief, we are teetering on the brink of collapse, and we will have to act swiftly."\n\n"Our problems stem from a lack of legitimacy," Kamphaus concluded. "The solution is to gain some, and we can only gain it through a recognized authority."\n\n"Are we meant to submit directly to the Empire? I doubt they would be willing to accept us after recent events."\n\n"Not the Empire," Kamphaus smirked. "Lushi. Our nation has longstanding bonds with that realm, and the Whitecrests are as close to a possible claimant as we can hope for. They are respected, they are close, and they are available. What more, the current prince is young, but he is a vigorous figure. I have already sent a message to the south. telling the prince not that we will become part of Lushi, but that we are willing to offer him the crown of Hellquill as well. He will shore up our legitimacy, and we will be right next to the new prince, who will owe us. You are free to have reservations about it, but as was just stated we are on the brink.

Gerar responded as he took the sword and drew it. "And as Grand Prince of Hellquill, I want you all to know that I will not offer you sedate peace to quietly waste away in. No, the path that I have for you will involve sweat, toil and blood, but also strength and pride! Our lands are considered petty backwaters worthy of little consideration, but I offer you a chance to show the world that we are more than they think, and that we will reforge these lands into a force to be reckoned with. You stand as the descendants of the knights of Hellquill, and I hope time has not made you soft, for the path before us all will hold glory without compare for those willing to take it! Soldiers of Hellquill! Are you with me?!" he asked, raising his sword high to the sky and provoking a deafening response from the crowd."

They could seek for another claimant westards or negociate some more with the Lushians but would they have time for it?\n\nHe stood up and walked towards the window overlooking the city. Even from the distance, he could feel it. The anger. The disappointment. The exasperation. The reports were mounting about officers getting attacked in the streets. Partisans attack were starting all over, just like those from the Longswordian reports. The industrial reports were dire with sabotages and strikes. Even within the ranks of the Heer itself, there were desertions. Something that would have been laughable just a few years ago! They had sent troops in the streets to maintain order. They were arresting creatures left and right and shut down the borders. But for what? Were they to kill every creature in Hellquill for it to find peace at last? Wingfried and his lackeys had tried with only parts of it and look at where it had gotten them...\n\nThey had failed. Wingfried. Edler. Urlach. Wilhelm. Grover. And now him. They were all dead and he was next. He could feel it. It was just a matter of time.\n\nEverything was coming apart and he had no answers. Not anymore.

Did they care for even one moment that perhaps Hellquillians - be them Ponies, Griffons or even Dogs or others - wished for something else than endless struggle and toil? Perhaps, they did. We all have a conscience after all but in the end, all of their power, their splendour rested upon the shoulders of the masses and for us to not revolt, we were required to kill and maim each other, to uphold a promise made to a Griffon who still died at the spear of a single Pony.\n\nWe, creatures of the KpH, comrades of struggle and toil, have rejected all of this. We have watched as the last scrapes we had were stolen from us in the name of Von Katerinburg's murderous ideology. We watched as Longsword was burned down. We were forced into service or massacred in his name but we prepared all as they began to murder each other in futile attempt. And finally, it took one last general, one last attempt at selling our lands and lives to the whims of a foreign crown, to wake up the people.\n\nBut now, as the soldiers of the Revolution emerge from the ruins of our nation, they will know that Hellquill is not theirs to give away anymore!"

Most of the conservatives who longed for a return to tradition balked at the bad news and started to bicker over what to do next. All the while every others felt betrayed at the idea of inviting foreign rulers to fix the reformisten's mess. It was clear that the national junta's bid for legitimacy had failed. In just a few days, riots and protest began to take place, military communications broke down down and KpH posters started to appear on the streets."

A member of the civil service has been heard to comment that it seems easier to point where the laws are actually in similar than where they aren't.\n\nYet, after, a long and arduous review, they have managed to formulate not a full code of law, but rather a general framework around which each principality will be allowed to build its new laws. With this, we hope that some of the more notable issues, such as many of the tax exemptions that have existed in Draksland, will not be ripped away in an instant, but rather slowly made untenable over time as the local parliaments will have some freedom - but not too much - in defining their laws.

The Hellquillian high command - who in effect are the nobility of Hellquill at the moment - has chosen to respond to the complaints by openly offering to help whichever noble feels too offended to let it stand with a judicial duel. The issue is that they insist to have Sir Hermann Steeltalon - the Butcher of Zinten - stand as their champion so that the matter will be settled for good. From what the records say, said knight has has never stopped a duel at first blood.\n\nTo deal with this headache before it grows, [HLQ.getleader] has ordered a grand assembly to address the matter and to define the rights and duties of the nobility for good. Beginning the assembly by summarily awarding noble titles to the former members of the Hellquillian Junta - notably making Demetrius Kamphaus the Count of Beakstadt - the prince has proceeded to partially recognize the more meritocratic structure of Hellquill's army as a valid path to nobility. While the higher ranks of nobility will be off-limits to commoners, they may still receive (but not pass down) knighthoods, and in the wake of the assembly Hellquill is now a nation of nobles just like Lushi, whose nobility has been given reassurances that their titles will not be threatened as the griffons they worry so are nobles of Hellquill, not Lushi."

The de Kissau dynasty as well as the PLA spent too much time tearing the nation apart, and for the sake of the people of Brodfeld, this must come to an end for good.\n\nHe has pledged to not treat Brodfeld as a conquered state, but rather that it will be made part of the dual principality as a third equal member, and together they will now form a trinity of crowns and nations, with the Brodfeldian Crown being added the Sceptre of Lushi and the Sword of Hellquill. Brodfeld's people, so exhausted by wars and tyranny, can only hesitate before this change.

Sadly, the designation of Wingfried von Katerinburg as Grandmaster of the Order of Hellquill meant difficult times for the KpH. Many revolutionaries and sympathizers were either arrested or killed. In the end, chairgriff Ernst Fischer had to focus on saving his own comrades from the Black Cloaks and the IIA had to mostly fend for itself during the Longswordian Civil War. The strained relationship continued long after Hellquill established control over Longsword. The IIA partisans, still reeling from what they felt was them being abandoned during the war, felt that Fischer couldn't be trusted and shifted their focus from revolutionary uprising to rescue and smuggling of Pony refugees.\n\nNow, we have began to mend our relationship. Several contacts have been made. Of note has been the contact between the IIA Ludwig von Pliater and the KpH Eckhardt Essen. As both had been friend during their knighthood days, they had an easier time establishing trust. In the end, even the Black Cloaks couldn't truly break a friendship."

He had heard about the rumours from Zinten where vicious fighting had occurred during the camp's liberation. As they grew closer, the scent of the forest made way for a stench that Eckart would never forget. The more they advanced, the more overpowering it got. Next to Eckart was Amber Shine, an IIA fighter. She looked somber. Out of habit, he asked what was wrong. She simply said: "I hoped never to smell this again after Longsword." Then, an ashy smell broke through the stench and Amber Shine froze: "We need to hurry". They began to fly and run.\n\nAs they arrived to the work camp, they saw a fenced tent camp in a muddy field. Overlooking it were several austere building burning but there was otherwise little activity visible from the distance. They were met with the scouts who said that they had seen soldiers fleeing. Eckart's unease dissipated and he gave his orders. Amber Shine and a group of griffs and pegasi would pursue the soldiers. The rest of the group would split between those trying to put out the fire while the others would enter the camp. Eckart himself joined the latter group.\n\nThey broke through the gate with haste, guns blazing but they were met with only silence. The cowards had fled and Eckart feared for the worst but as they marched in, faces began to come out of their hiding. Eckart could never forget them. Scrawny and visibly beyond exhausted, the Ponies had barely the energy to come and meet them, even if he could see the fear dissipate. Eckart immediately called for the medic group to rush in. When he turned back, a small colt approached him. Eckart kneeled and asked him for his name. "Golden Ball", he answered. "Hi, I'm Eckart.", he answered before noticing how much the colt was shivering. He took his blanket from his backpack and put it over Golden Ball's shoulders. Eckart smiled and said: "it's going to be alright now. I promise." The colt simply nodded.\n\nAt sundown, they had set up a relief camp and were waiting for trucks to bring the liberated prisoners to Wingenberg's hospitals. They had managed to put out the fire but most of the documents had burned. It would make rendering justice difficult but as he was listening to the report of his soldiers, Eckart looked over in the camp and noticed the prisoners eating and speaking. He turned back to his group to notice their worries. He took a long breath and smiled to them."

Fischer never had the opportunity to meet the now legendary leader of the IIA and pondered about what the mare would be like in reality.\n\nFinally, she arrived, flanked by three partisans. Two ponies and a griffon. She was wearing her usual uniform, worn but impeccable. Her face expressed nothing but a stern resolve and exhaustion. She was smoking, Lushian brand surprisingly enough.\n"I've read your book", she said matter-of-factly.\nHe smiled: "Oh? What did you think about it?"\n"You're no Caramel Marks", she answered on the same tone.\nFischer smirked at the slight. He sure hoped he wasn't but telling her would have been a pointless. Instead, he offered to seat at the table. She nodded and went to sit. Fischer went on to explain his view of the current situation and expressed his wish of seeing the IIA join their forces with the KpH in a united front. Starry Night calmy listen to him, not interrupting him.\n"Well then, what are your thoughts?"\n"I want equal representation of IIA and KpH members in all revolutionary committees. The recognition of all armed partisans as revolutionary combattants, same as KpH members. Total equality between creatures in all rule. After we are done with the remnants, a Congress for our members to freely elect the new chaircreature of the united party federation.

In order for a just Hellquill to rise and thrive, we will need to punish those crimes and enshrine the memory of the reformisten's victims.\n\nChairgriff Ernst Fischer has ordered the creation of committees that will be tasked with investigating the crimes of all those who participated in the administration of the previous years in both Hellquill and Longsword. These committees shall be composed of three members of the KpH, three members of the IIA, one member of the Pony ZPW party and four representatives of mass civilian organizations. They will rule on each case to either go forward to trial, implement a summary administrative punishment or pardon altogether. The trials will be organized by revolutionary tribunals in which the population will be invited to participate as jurors.\n\nFischer addressed the nation on the radio to prepare the future jurors for what was to come: "The trials that will follow are bound to be a harrowing process for us all but they are needed for us to heal and march forward.

Yet, there was a group that had gone above and beyond anything that had been ordered to them. The Sturmgreife, the heinous paramilitary wing of Von Katerinburg's movement, had committed more atrocities than any other groups of the Wehrmacht, all the while enriching themselves through various schemes and looting. Unfortunately for the revolution, Kamphaus' coup had robbed them of rendering justice unto their leaders and founders. But many of the dreaded SG had survived and they would answer for their crimes.\n\nThe trials were held in Beakstadt, a city that had been home to many of the SG's activities and personnel. The trials were thorough as evidence was plentiful. The quick collapse of the regime had allowed for many documents to be seized and KpH's sympathizers within the Wehrmacht had carefully taken notes of the SG's crimes. Their notoriously elitist demeanour towards the regular knights and soldiers didn't help them either. Many prisoners had been more than happy to help and testify even if a lot of them were simply trying to gain leanier treatment.\n\nThe trials found all of the accused guilty and most of them were condemned to either death or hard labour. Those who were executed were hanged publicly in Beakstadt's old jousting field. Tens of thousands of civilians showed up to watch the execution."

hellquill.77.d:0 "When the revolution came, many had thought that Demetrius Kamphaus would lead a desperate last stand or flee to organize a ruthless resistance. Such was his legacy. For years, he had been one of the true forces of Von Katerinburg's regime and none expected him to simply flee. Yet, he did none of these things. Kamphaus had been found drinking in his office at Hellquill's castle and didn't resist arrest.\n\nConsidering how much of the knights' and reformisten's leadership had died over the course of the last few years, Kamphaus was effectively the most senior officer capable of answering for the crimes of the old regime. The chairgriff Fischer made arrangements for his trial to be a major affair with daily updates on the proceedings to be broadcasted to the nation. Presiding over the proceedings was the judge Lothar Witteknecht, a defector from the early days of the reformisten regime. Many witnesses were called and the trial served as a healing moment for the nation. Light was shed on many atrocities committed by the knights. Sadly, some would never see the light of day as some knights had taken to try and burn down the archives of the Order, something in which they were not entirely successful.\n\nFinally, time came to interview Kamphaus himself. The scarred veteran stood up upon being asked and after being asked questions by the prosecutors, he finally spoke with both gravity and resignation in his eyes.\n\n"The court has little interest in my answers unless they are the ones you wish me to give you. Who are you all? What have you ever done for Hellquill? I have done what was necessary! I have made more sacrifices than any of you here will ever do! I regret nothing. I apologize for nothing. I don't recognize this court so go ahead and kill me."\n\nKamphaus's statement caused a stir but the trial continued its course. In the end, the jury ruled the knight guilty of all charges.

However, we endured and one after the other, the cities fell to the people's cry and their garrison either surrendered, fled or fell themselves.\n\nIn a desperate attempt at regrouping, several reactionary officers and members of the Sturmgreife attempted to smuggle away the weapons and equipment to remote locations and old fortresses in the mountains and forests. Fortunately, our soldiers managed to stop several convoys in their tracks but still, a great deal of equipment was looted.\n\nBut all of it didn't matter. We knew that the old regime wouldn't fall with chants alone and from the first day, the soldiers of the KpH had been ready for such a battle. With the heroic courage that was expected of them, the vanguard of our revolution took the fight to those that would see it fail. And so, under the chant of both griffs and cannons, our comrades destroyed the last holdouts of the oppressors. With them gone and the tools of war retrieved, we inch ever closer to victory."

In the struggle against the worst that both capitalist and reactionary thought had to offer, they would need a vanguard of soldiers, not workers, to carry the torch. And so, he began to plan and gather his forces.\n\nAmong those which Fischer recognized as promising figures was Eckhardt Essen, a former knight who had seen the Order for what it was. Essen had worked tirelessly behind the scenes to prepare the insurrection itself, mapping armouries, establishing sleeping revolutionary cells and creating weapons caches. Without him, the revolution may very well have been smothered at birth.\n\nBut no plan can survive contact with reality. When things start happening, you need heroes to step up. And Antonin Schoff was one of those. Born in Zinten, Schoff had fought in the uprising there. After the leader of the local section had died in a street fight against the local garrison, Schoff prevented his comrades from scattering away and successfully lead the storming of the local commandery, transforming a potential disaster into one of the greatest victory of the revolution.\n\nNow, both Schoff and Essen have been appointed as generals of the new Hellquillian Revolutionary Guard."

First on the agenda was the first legal congress of the Unified Kommunistische Partei Hellquill.\n\nThe congress was a festive affair with many congratulations being given to all those who had fought so hard to free Hellquill and Longsword. But in the end, one question was looming over the congress: the race for leadership. The stakes were high due to the position of chairgriff being up for grabs for the first time since he took over as a condition of the unification of the KpH and IIA. Two candidates would speak and present their vision of the future: Starry Night and Ernst Fischer.\n\nErnst Fischer spoke first. Full of enthusiasm, the young leader was riding the wave of victory. His speech was full of ambition. He called to a rapid buildup of Hellquillian industry and military to finally shed the old age. He considered that Hellquill needed to flex its muscles to secure the Revolution forever. In this reactionary world, there was no place for complacency or entertaining any compromise with those who would seek to harm them and what they had achieved. They were indeed a vanguard of socialism in a continent that fought such ideas with tooth and claw. The end of oppression would be achieved through iron, blood and sweat, just like they achieved freedom from the knights and Black Cloaks.\n\nStarry Night's speech couldn't have been more different. The Longswordian mare appeared as always a bit tired and gloomy and spoke softly. She started her speech by thanking her comrades in arms and reminded to all of the horrors that had happened first under Count Pallas and then under Wingfried von Katerinburg. Then, she called for rebuilding a more caring country under a form of socialism based on sisterhood and unity. After all, she said, they would still be a region that would be fought over and the time during which Hellquillians and Longswordians were indeed independent should be dedicated to fight for better lives, equality and the right of all creatures of being free from harm and need. And should the reactionary come and threaten them, then, they would do what they do best: resist and bite.\n\nIn the end, both speeches met great approval from the party members and with no vote order being given, the race proved to be a toss-up."

But now, the red flag somehow flies over their land and ponies and griffons stand united rather than killing one another and their tyrans lay dead. Though some veterans of the Frontier revolutionaries who fought with us told us that some among the Hellquillians are difficult to work with if things don't go their way.\n\nTheir envoy made a surprising case. The Hellquillians have made a strong case for uniting Lushi within their republic. They have promised us a federal status, a vote and a voice at the federal table and economic aid. Of course, it would mean the loss of much of our hard-fought sovereignty and watering down our ideals of peasant self-rule.

His followers argued that the offer of integration had been in itself a massive concession. But now, it was clear what was supposed to happen.

He paused when he noticed who he had been talking to.\n\n"My lord Grandmaster? May I help you?"\n\n"I believe you may. Sit down. I won't trouble you or your throat for long."\n\nAugust proceeded, a subtle frown of surprise on his face. Urlach continued.\n\n"Brother. I have pondered for a time about your speeches to the Inner Circle. They were interesting, if a bit naive for my taste and your age."\n\nAugust coughed again. The sore throat for sure.\n\n"May I ask what made take such strong. Considering the marginality of your views and the hostility of your opposition. Those are dangerous times."\n\nAugust pondered for a moment before looking up to Urlach and answering.\n\n"Would you rather have me lie about my beliefs, my lord Grandmaster? I have sworn an oath to serve the Order and I believe in giving genuine and sincere advice to my brothers and sisters. It is then up to them to consider them and acquiesce or refute. I believe there is strength in truth. Especially in dangerous times."\n\n"A rare view. When so many enjoy flattering and poor advices, of which there is aplenty. I have but to look towards the other bank of the Griffking River to see what happens then.""

hellquill.86.d:0 "Urlach was waiting in his office for the arrival of the Ponies best representative as August had put it. He was curious as he had never thought much of the Ponies. Finally, his aide de camp told him that River Breeze was there. Urlach remained seated as the pony entered. He noticed a worried August waiting in the hall. Truly a ringing endorsement from his head archivist but no matter. He looked upon River Breeze. He wasn't very impressive but he was impeccably dressed in the Griffonian fashion and conducted himself as best as one could in the presence of their liege. Encouraging.\n\n"Greetings, goodpone. Sit down. We have much to discuss."\n\n"Greetings, my lord Grandmaster. I am honoured to meet you."\n\nPolite and yet not overly formal. Good. Urlach had always have little patience for the pleasantries and flatteries of courtiers.\n\n"You have been described to me as a representative of the ponies of Hellquill. Yet, I expected some form of elder and you are quite young. Why you of all creatures?"\n\n"I may not speak for those who have recommended me to you, my lord Grandmaster. However, you have undeniably put the claw on a matter most important to my community. We are not represented within the institutions of this land and we have little means to organize ourselves as travel and communications between our communities are heavily restricted. I, on the other hoof, am a lawyer and as such, I have the privilege to travel unharmed and meet with my brethrens. And so, by trade and opportunity, I do what I may to defend them in Hellquillian courts and plead for our rights."\n\n"Commendable. Now forgive me for being forward but what would those rights be? I imagine you have your ideas."\n\n"I do indeed, my lord Grandmaster, and we simply request the right to live our lives freely, justly and happily. However, it is a vast topic and there is one simple revendication of ours that you could fulfill by making what you are doing here permanent. Hear us. Allow us to speak among ourselves and to you. Should you do so, you will learn that us Hellquillian ponies are much more reasonable than some may say.""

hellquill.87.t:0 "Meeting The Posniaks"
hellquill.87.d:0 "The service had been long but admirably done considering the poor state of the temple, Urlach thought. Though calling the place a temple was generous as it was a glorified warehouse decorated in a humble fashion. But still, he had seen a level of piety and devotion from those Ponies that he often failed to see at Hellquill's great temples.\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, Urlach was escorted to a back room to meet with the local priests. There, he met with an elderly female griffon in priestly clothes and a young stallion who had presided over the service. They both greeted him with deference.\n\n"I have to thank you, young Pony. It was a lovely sermon that you gave. I was quite impressed by your choir."\n\nHe thanked him but immediately turned to the griffon who he said trained them. The matriarch then spoke.\n\n"What they lack in fortune, they make up for faith. To many of them, it is one of the sole godly leisure they can find in this ghetto."\n\n"Yet, they have shown a dedication that I can't help but admire. Are there many Ponies in this parish?"\n\n"Several thousands. May my lord grandmaster forgive me for being imprecise. I am too old to care much for accounting."\n\nUrlach didn't answer immediately. It was quite an impressive number, especially considering that many temples in the city could barely account for a single thousand of active members.\n\n"So many? In such a small place? Forgive me but isn't there a mistake here?"\n\n"I understand your surprise, my lord Grandmaster, but this is the sole temple that is open to them. Any griffon in Hellquill has several to choose from and many of those places dedicated themselves to only one of our gods. But Posniaks? Despite having been taught the truth of Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr as colts and fillies, they are barred from worshipping them as is proper. I was quite surprised to learn that when I was but an acolyte myself. And this is why I have dedicated myself to this place. It is what the gods would have want. Take my young protégé here. A priest, he is, but because of his birth, he is barred from the very place he should serve here in Hellquill."\n\nUrlach pondered for a moment. He never really had to think about what life meant to the Ponies in Hellquill. There they were, being taught how to praise but denied the means to do it right. And there they were, thinking that they were impious creatures. Strange."

hellquill.88.t:0 "A Policy Of Pragmatism"
hellquill.88.d:0 "After several meetings, thoughtful prayer and careful consideration, Urlach ap Cyrod had finally made his mind on the matter of the Ponies and August's advice. There was indeed much that could be conceded without harm and he realized now that the ponies could not possibly prove themselves to be loyal and industrious without being given enough leeway to act legally.\n\nFrom that day onwards, the Grandmaster decreed that inspections in Posniak communities would be limited to emergencies only and autonomy for rural officers on maintaining order would be constrained by stronger rules of engagement. Restrictions on travel, communications and access to public spaces would be lifted.\n\nHe also signed on the agreement with River Breeze's organization to create a Posniak Council that would meet with officials from the Order of Hellquill to coordinate and exchange on matters relating to the Ponies and which he would himself attend every months."

hellquill.89.d:0 "Urlach ap Cyrod was sitting at the back of his car with Carl von Soldau on their way back from a visit to the western garrison. Deep in his thoughts, he kept looking towards Carl who was leisurely going through some documents while sipping a flask of Soldau schnapps. The two had never talked much. Urlach preferred the training grounds and the temples to the places where Carl could drink, bet and dance with friends and gallant company. The stern Rumarean cared little for that kind of leisure but he had been impressed by how popular Carl seemed to be.\n\nIn the countryside, they had been stopped several times by local farmers who recognized him. Each time, they talked as if they had been long friends but Carl rarely knew them closely. At the time, it irritated Urlach who felt it was a disruption of military affairs and an unbecoming attitude for a knight. And yet, now, he was thinking. That was out west, where the griffon farmers were at best apathetic towards the Order and their duties and cared little for the necessities of war. And yet, there Carl was, being welcomed like family and peer. Even that the schnapps in that flask was a gift he got out there.\n\n"You are quite popular, brother Carl", he finally said.\n\nCarl looked up from his document and smiled. "Perhaps? I have never really thought about it. I've lived there all of my civilian life. They're familiar faces. I am simply myself there."\n\n"And yet, I have met few knights who get such a warm welcome."\n\n"Well, it is not the military frontier. They don't feel so unsafe that they are desperate for our help and they don't see many Ponies either. To them, we are simply a nuisance more than anything else. Tanks in the fields, manoeuvers that locks down the roads and taxes. They don't need us and feel like we don't listen to them."\n\n"And you feel we should listen to them more?"\n\n"Would it hurt? I could help."\n\nHe smiled and Urlach couldn't help but reply in kind."

hellquill.90.t:0 "The Ost-Griffonische Bund"
hellquill.90.d:0 "Urlach walked among the crowd, enjoying a small glass of local cider. Quite a lot of people had made the trip to the opening of Carl's little idea. It wasn't exactly the type of things that Urlach had expected to attend as Grandmaster but he took it in strides. Griffons in attendance clearly enjoyed the idea of a family day and there was something about the general good mood that got to him. Urlach was suddenly interrupted in his thought by a couple of laughing young chicks. They bumped into him, causing him to spill his cider on his uniform. He angrily shouted in their direction.\n\n"Why you little... Come back here!"\n\nAnd they were gone. Chicks these days! No respect for their elders or anyone. No wonders the youth was demanding a say in things. They weren't being raised right! At least, in Rumare, they were still taught how to praise the gods and their parents.\n\nUrlach's internal intergenerational rant was interrupted by his aide de camp who came to tell him that Carl von Soldau was about to give his speech. The Grandmaster grudgingly acquiesced while wiping the stains on his uniform. It was time to listen to the charmer's nonsense.\n\nCarl von Soldau got up to the stage, visibly giddy, and was welcomed by an impressive round of applause. Clearly in his element, Carl approached the microphone and spoke. Unfortunately, the sound was off and he wasn't heard, causing some chuckles in the crowd. He jokingly tapped it until it worked a few seconds later. He then began his speech.\n\n"Thank you everyone and welcome to this first family day of The Ost-Griffonische Bund. It's wonderful to be here among you." New round of applause "But before we get to all the important things we adults are supposed to be doing, I'd like to take a moment to thank lord Urlach ap Cyrod, Grandmaster of the Order of Hellquill, who has blessed us with his presence and without whom we wouldn't be here today." A new round of warm applause followed, causing Urlach to smile and wave awkwardly. "And to give him the best Soldau welcome, my two nieces here have a little song that they'd love to sing you all."\n\nCue the little brats who stained his uniform getting a decidedly warmer applause than him."

hellquill.91.t:0 "A Chat With Stackelberg"
hellquill.91.d:0 "Urlach met with Wilhelm Stackelberg after service in the Temple of Boreas. Wilhelm had been polite but had seemed surprised to see him. It is true that his friend and him hadn't been on the best of terms since Wilhelm had joined the reformisten. He almost supported Wingfried for Grandmaster, something that had pained Urlach. Despite it all, they walked together as friends upon the rampart. Finally, Urlach stopped and looked at the city under them. Wilhelm joined him in contemplation for a moment before the Grandmaster broke the silence.\n\n"My friend, I am concerned. Wingfried von Katerinburg has proven to be not only disloyal but also dishonourable."\n\n"I have noticed as much. A knight deserving of such title ought to have accepted your legitimate challenge."\n\n"Yet, you are lending him your reputation and virtue. Why is that?"\n\n"Certain causes are just. Many of us feel that we have lost our purpose in mindlessly guarding this border, taking no action beyond skirmishing with Dogs and Ponies. And so many of those who call themselves reformisten do so with a true belief in our mission, not out of pride in the character of some who happen to speak justly."\n\n"Even if it means standing with the likes of Edler and his heretics?"\n\n"The Sturmgreife are a different lot than those young knights that I call my friends. And I have no love for that griff. I have told brother Wingfried of his lies but he has not taken action. I hope some are taken someday."\n\n"I am glad to hear that and I agree. On this heretic and on more. This is why I wanted to talk to you. Because I too admire those young souls and their zeal. And I dread that Edler or Wingfried shall simply lead them to commit irreparable mistakes. I shall give them purpose as knights but I feel they need someone to look up to. Someone to inspire them and act towards them as brother Siegfried was to us both."\n\n"Who would that be? The Katerinian attracts leaders of poor character as much as he inspires young griffs to great things.""

hellquill.92.t:0 "The Death Of A Heretic"
hellquill.92.d:0 "The night was cold and the wind was howling over Castle Hellquill's walls. A fitting scene, Urlach thought. This was not a moment for pleasantries. He had intended for Edler von Wingenberg's trial and execution to be an example for all. He looked at the crowd gather in front of the stakes. All of the Inner Circle was there, with the sole exception of Wingfried von Katerinburg who was still hiding himself from him. Urlach knew that several of the knights gathered there had toyed with the idea of joining the reformisten or their more extreme fractions. And it was time for them all to understand what happens for those who crossed the line.\n\n"My brothers and sisters. It is not secret than even in a just world, there are among us some who would seek to lead us astray, far from the realm of what's reasonable or even forgivable. Edler von Wingenberg is such a griff. For having been given the means and opportunity to serve and even lead, he has chosen to lie, corrupt and betray. And if allowed to continue, he would have lead our brothers, sisters and chicks to their doom. And this we cannot tolerate."\n\nHe paused for a moment, looking at Edler, gagged and tied to his post. The leader of the Sturmgreife looked at him with anger and seemed to want to speak. Urlach ignored him and continued.\n\n"I ask you this, chicks of Hellquill. Have we ventured so far east that it is acceptable to stray from the path of the gods? Are we to do Maar's bidding while listening to nonsense about evil ponies being more powerful than the divine? Is this what his Imperial Majesty Grover the Second brought us here to do? To renege on our gods in the name of slaughter? No. Not as long as I stand as Grandmaster. And for this, I am sentencing him to burn."\n\nUrlach took the torch from a nearby knight and threw it at Edler's paws. He then walked down towards his brothers and sisters and looked as the fire grew bright in the cold night."

hellquill.93.t:0 "To Go Quietly Into The Night"
hellquill.93.d:0 "After much planning, it was finally decided that the Sturmgreife would be curtailed harshly and without delay by means of a vast night raid. Some had argued that it would be wise to cut of the head of the movement in advance but Urlach ultimately ruled against it. All claws were on the deck for the operation. Wilhelm Stackelberg had proven invaluable in selecting targets among the SG and convincing reformisten-leaning officers to take a step back. Carl von Soldau was tasked with overseeing several mobile forces capable of reinforcing rapidly any place in which the SG avoided arrest. Demetrius Kamphaus was chosen to oversee the overall raid, a task for which Urlach trusted him absolutely. The veteran had always been ruthlessly efficient. And on his advice, the Grandmaster would stay put.\n\nThe night was long for Urlach. He didn't enjoy the wait far removed from the action but that was sometime needed. They weren't at war. They were dealing with treason and trickery. And so he waited in his office, pondering on his choices. Finally, late into the night, Kamphaus came back and entered his office.\n\n"So? Is it done?"\n\n"It is. Fledglings and civilians playing soldiers were hardly a match for us. A few have managed to flee but reports from von Soldau's groups show that most have been arrested trying to cross the border west already.", Demetrius answered matter-of-factly.\n\n"What about their leaders?"\n\n"Edler has been apprehended alongside several of his "mystic" friends. Eisen Silberkrone has been confirmed to be shot but has managed to flee. Alfred Aschenkampff has been killed after attempting to resist. Alina Hochmeister tried to flee but surrendered. As for their civilian allies, none has tried to resist arrest.""

hellquill.94.d:0 "From the window of his office at Castle Hellquill, Urlach looked upon his city. It was calm, much more than it used to be and far more than Swordsson, just south of the great river. He was trying not to think about it too much, about what was happening there and what he had prevented here through bloodshed and compromises. And still, was it what he had to do as a knight? Did Trappenfeld feel the same when he broke his oath to the emperor? He was still pondering on that when his aide de camp announced him that Wingfried von Katerinburg was there, brought back from his "vacation" in Soldau. Urlach turned and ordered the Katerinian to sit.\n\n"Brother Wingfried. You have caused quite a lot of trouble, even by remaining far from the capital. We know from your comrades' interrogations that you had made plans for an insurrection. I am happy to inform you that you have failed. The traitors lie dead, in shackles or in ash. Do you have something to say for yourself?"\n\nWingfried finally looked up and tried to plead: "But my lord Grandmaster, that is simply slander from cowards! I am innocent. It was Edler von Wingenberg's doing. He has corrupted my movement. He lied and manipulated me and my entourage who wished only to save our nation from harm!"\n\n"That is quite enough, brother Wingfried. Consider yourself lucky that you have been spared the heretic's sentence. Instead, you shall be demoted from the Inner Circle and any commanding duties. You will take a post in Ortelsberg, in which you will serve silently and give up politics, lest you will be punished further."\n\n"That is unfair, my lord Grandmaster! I have done nothing but to serve this country!"\n\n"Fair? You have been treated as nothing but fair for years now! Despite your poor record of service, you have been allowed to play politics only thanks to your house's name. You have thrown Longsword into chaos and yet, you have been left free to continue, an opportunity to claim his title and even the opportunity to strike me down in personal duel. You have been given everything and yet you failed everything and everyone. Your country, your name, your cause and even yourself."\n\nWingfried looked down and answered nothing. He knew his cause lost and did not dare to defy him. Urlach cared not for more and dismissed him."

hellquill.95.d:0 "The opening of the Zinten Memorial had been a cornerstone of August von Ortelsberg effort to reconcile the various groups of Hellquill. He had chosen Zinten as it had been famously the location of several anti-ponies massacre during the previous century. To inaugurate the great monument, he had invited a large delegation among which were River Breeze, the head of the Bund der Freien Hunde, the three senior prelates of Hellquill as well as Pony traditional religious leaders and a group of survivors chosen by Pony groups. August and River agreed to walk into the memorial holding claw and hoof to show their united desire to mourn and reconcile.\n\nThe memorial had been designed by a team of artists of all regions of Hellquill and of all species. They settled on creating a vast complex, located within a lush park. From the distance, nothing but a green patch of grass could be seen but in the center of the park was a great circular pit into which visitors would descend on small staircases. The complex was composed of concentric rows of ever deeper slabs of white marble - all topped with a layer of dirt and grass - on which were carved all the names of creatures killed during the wars and conflicts in Hellquill since the great crusade of Grover II. August von Ortelsberg had personally worked on researching the Order's archives for all recorded names but he also had help from various groups in Helquill such as the Bund der Freien Hunde and the Pony groups who had laid down their weapons.\n\nAugust could sense emotions rising as they kept descending into rows and rows of memorial stones until the sky seemed distant. Finally, they arrived in the center of the complex where the marble walls were covered in the names of those who had died in Zinten. And at the center of it wall was a great slab of black granite without any name on it, showing all those who died and disappeared without any records. River Breeze and August stopped in front of it to mourn as visitors came to lay flowers at the base of the slab. They spent a long moment there, hearing cries throughout, until they left and emerged back into the park, the memorial almost invisible behind them, like the scars left by past mistakes."

hellquill.96.t:0 "An Overdue Meeting"
hellquill.96.d:0 "There had been attempts in the past to establish relations with ponies but August's predecessors had always tackle them poorly. He had read compulsively all the reports of previous meetings. All of them had taken place at Hellquill Castle and almost all of them had consisted of more talking than listening. The Grandmaster of old seemed to have thought that they could simply command the Ponies into peaceful submission. How they could have been so arrogantly naive was beyond him. For this meeting, August von Ortelsberg had taken great pains to show that this time would be different. He dressed in civilian clothes and took a small escort of policegriffs instead of armored knights. He would not require them to come to him either but would travel himself to the Pony ghetto in Hellquill.\n\nIn his car, August was nervously fiddling with his claws. He had thought about everything, didn't he? And yet, he was worried. So much rested upon this meeting to go well... Finally they arrived in front of the house. August stepped outside to be greeted by a small committee lead by River Breeze. He had never met the pony but he had heard much about him being a pain in the tail for the Order. A lawyer by trade, he had used all legal venues to fight for his brethren's rights in Hellquillian courts, mostly in vain but not always. He was as he thought he would be. Stern, looking tired but sharply dressed, he looked as if he hadn't been able to spare time for a laugh in many years. August went forward and greeted him warmly.\n\n"Mister Breeze, it is an honour to finally meet you. I have heard much about you."\n\n"Likewise, my lord Grandmaster. Shall we go inside?"\n\nAugust acquiesced and stopped his escort to follow him inside, only taking his assistant with him. The house was humble but had been tidied up for the occasion as best as it could have been. They sat down in the dining room where several elderly Ponies were awaiting them. River Breeze broke the silence.\n\n"My lord Grandmaster. Thank you for coming here. We have much to discuss.""

She gathered her strength and went back on her way but no more galloping. Halfway home, the sun finally set and she was plunged in the darkness. Finally, the stress of the day got to her and she sat on the ground, wanting to cry. Then, all of a sudden, a light was casted in the distance. She gulped, and looked on. It didn't look like a fire. Worried, she got up and walked towards the light.\n\nTen minutes later, she was at the village. There was no fire, nor were there any screams or cries except of excitement. The whole village had been adorned with public lights and electrified. The villagers were gathering outside to marvel at the sight, some still wearing their sleeping cap. They had never seen electricity in the pony towns, the Order had always forbad it. And so she walked back home in the light.

And while the Grandmaster maintains a majority support within the Inner Circle of the Order, opposition to his policies is growing steadily and some within the administration are resisting his policies. Some knights have retired or left the Order on political ground too.\n\nRecently, Carl von Soldau, despite being in good personal terms with August, has emerged as the unlikely leader of this diverse faction of disgruntled knights. In more worrying news, friends and family members of von Soldau have formed a civilian organization called the "Ost-Griffonien Bund" to try and help coordinate opposition to August by making use of his liberalizing reforms. However, they officially claim to only be a charitable organization aimed at helping farmers and settlers.\n\nSome in the Grandmaster's circle fear that with such support, the knight may decide to attempt a coup.

The end of many discriminatory regulations have significantly helped businesses to thrive thanks to the help of craftponies and the expansion of the consumer market. Many merchants have also taken up on August's promises of peace and invested in trading operations in the Riverlands. This move has also been fueled by the involuntary cut in the staple rights paid by merchants to pass through the Frontier section to the Griffking River. Who would have guessed that abolishing trading regulations with Ponies would mean more trade with Pony-majority nations?\n\nReiner Guttenfried, of the wealthy Guttenfried dynasty, has gambled on the promises of August early on and has made significant investment on river and land trade. Now, his trucks are the lifeline of many of the booming Pony towns and his river boats are starting many commercial ventures into the Riverlands. He has also used the liberalisation of the press to fund a newspaper and even a radio station. Not without help from his media, Guttenfried has come to embody the new era of success for Hellquill. Some even say that he has political ambitions and might run for the civilian elections that August has been promising."

However, the interview proved to be so controversial that it made its way to the national papers.\n\nIn it, Trappenfeld openly complained about the direction Hellquill was taking. Angered by rumours of his ill-health, he accused August's supporters of spreading lies and smearing his reputation to further his agenda. He compared August's reforms to those attempted by Republicans in the east though he stopped just short of calling August a traitor. He endorsed the Bund's creation, calling it one of the most important historical event in recent history and lamented that Carl von Soldau hadn't been made Grandmaster.\n\nMany were shocked at the critic between living grandmasters, something that had almost never happened in Hellquill's history but August brushed it off, considering that his predecessor was entitled to his opinion and that he would welcome any advice going forward.

When Carl von Soldau founded his Ost-Griffonien Bund, many thought that he was simply testing ground in Urlach's name. As time went by, many began to realize that maybe Urlach would not answer their call.\n\nYesterday, Carl von Soldau formally asked the Rumarean knight to join their movement to which he openly refused.

hellquill.104.d:0 "River Breeze and his party have managed in securing a plurality of the vote in the new parliament. Early results show that he was able to maintain a united front in the Pony communities but that he also convinced some voters in Griffon communities. Despite failing to gain a majority on his own, the Griffon vote was heavily split between the SLP, the KVP and the OGB.\n\nThe results were welcomed by a celebration in Hellquill's Pony district that continued well into the night. River Breeze himself only made a short apparition before leaving to negotiate with other leaders.\n\nWithout any party gaining a majority, intense negotiations were held throughout the night at the old Scribe's Guild Hall which hosted the provisional government's seat. Both Carl von Soldau and Reiner Guttenfried attempted to form a coalition to prevent the ZWP from gaining power. Their efforts were mute due to a mutual dislike between the two parties and the failure of both of them to make a compelling case to August's representatives. In the early morning, August and River met and agreed on a coalition deal with a heavy focus on welfare and fixing Hellquill's heavy inequalities, albeit a less radical one that some in ZWP advocated for.\n\nRiver Breeze has addressed the nation with a long speech on the radio. He thanked his supporters but emphasized that he would not rule as a Pony but would seek to represent all Hellquillians, regardless of class and species."

hellquill.105.d:0 "Reiner Guttenfried and his SLP have made a strong showing by winning a plurality of the vote in all major towns as well as border towns and villages. Unfortunately, he had failed to secure a majority.\n\nDespite this, his victory was celebrated by a city-wide party in Soldau funded by the magnate's fortune. He attended himself and even paraded around the city in his luxury car, saluting the masses and giving out free candies, beverages and various knick-knacks.\n\nSpeculations were made about Reiner's decision to celebrate rather than negociate considering that he still wasn't guaranteed to rule. However, as leaders of the other party met in the old Scribe's Guild Hall which hosted the provisional government's seat, negotiations broke down. Despite some willingness to form a coalition government between August's KVP and River Breeze's ZWP, the results ended up giving them a minority of the seats because of Carl's OGB strong showing in the countryside and settler's communities. However, Carl himself was equally unable to secure a majority in parliament by allying himself with the KVP and his supporters had little desire to ally themselves with the ZWP, even if it was able to have a coalition government. Meanwhile, the private press and radios endlessly praised Reiner's victory and denounced the other parties for not inviting him into the negotiations.\n\nAfter three days of discussion, Reiner Guttenfried finally made the trip to Hellquill and at the end of the day, he announced on his private radio stations that he would form a minority government after representatives from other parties had agreed to not oppose him. Reiner's speech was short and simply promised a bright future for Hellquill. It was followed by performances given by several famous singers and musicians from all around the continent."

Early results showed that he had won over settlers communities and Griffon-majority cities but ultimately failed to gain a full majority in the parliament.\n\nCelebrations were held in settlers' community throughout the country but there were clashes in the streets of Soldau where Reiner's and Carl's supporters fought late during the night. Reiner had decided to celebrate his party's result in the city in what was interpreted as a slight towards the victor of the election. Carl himself didn't show up in his city of birth, prefering to celebrate with his close supporters and fellow knights at the Goldener Flügel Beer Hall in Hellquill.\n\nAugust von Ortelsberg and River Breeze met during the night at the old Scribe's Guild Hall which hosted the provisional government's seat to try and form a coalition. Their coalition was mathematically unable to gain power however and they failed to secure support from Reiner's SLP. The next day, Carl von Soldau was hosted at Hellquill's castle by the new Grandmaster to hold his negotiations for government. He quickly met with the three other leaders. Despite some speculations that he would ally with the KVP, he ended up cutting a deal with the SLP that would be given government positions and a promise of tax cuts.\n\nCarl von Soldau gave a short speech on the radio promising the country peace and stability."

However, upon disembarking in Pridea and walking the streets, he caused a fight to erupt on the docks and was arrested by the local police. According to the reports, he picked a fight with Pony dockers after insulting them, only to find himself beaten up by the said dockers and their Griffon colleagues. Upon arriving to the local police station, he was interrogated by the local commissioner who, as chance would have it, was a Pony himself. Von Katerinburg went on to antagonize the commissioner, mistaking him for a common police officer, demanding to speak to his commanding officer and insulting him in the process. Apparently, he wasn't aware that Aquileia is home to a large Pony minority and that relations between Ponies and Griffons are not an issue down there.\n\nHe has since been prosecuted for disturbance of the peace, hate speech and contempt of law enforcement and sent to prison."

After long discussions with the civilian government and with the help of former Grandmaster August von Ortelsberg, the Inner Circle of the Order has agreed to reform.\n\nThe Order's new charter makes the Order pledge itself to always serve and protect the constitution, population and democratic government of Hellquill. In a dramatic change, it now recognizes all species as equal and free to apply for knighthood. It has removed any reference to the Grand Crusade, relinquishes the right of raiding on eastern lands and only recognizes Grover II as the figure who has given them the territories of Hellquill. The Inner Circle has also officially accepted the integration of all remaining military orders in both Hellquill and Longsword and is now the sole armed knightly order of the land.\n\nIn celebration of the new charter, a new group has been knighted. The first to pledge the new vow of knighthood is a former soldier of the Wehrmacht who served with distinction, a mare named Iron Reed. She was recorded as the first ever pony knight of Hellquill and vowed to serve the Republic and the Order until her last breath."

However, it also includes newer charities operated by Ponies, notably a group of lawyers founded by River Breeze and dedicated to uphold the rights of Ponies in court."

hellquill.110.t:0 "A New Social Structure"
hellquill.110.d:0 "Today, president Carl von Soldau unveiled his proposed constitutional reform to address the divisions between species within our country. In his opening speech to parliament and the radio, he called for unity and understanding that Hellquill is a complex country but that it won't solve its issues by simple solutions. He called to each citizens on the need to make compromises on matter that concern all and to learn to abstain themselves on matters that do not. The proposal - which Carl dubbed "regionaldemokratismus" - is a complicated one. Under it, the central government relinquishes several matters to two new layers of institutions.\n\nThe first one are the provinces which are geographical areas. Each provinces will have its own democratic assembly and government and will be tasked with overseeing various economic matters and regulations such as infrastructure works. Any citizen leaving in the province will be allowed to vote in it.\n\nIn addition, the reform will create two cultural communities which will also have their own democratic assembly and government. These communities - the pony one and the griffon one - will be tasked with all matters related to culture, use of language and education. Contrary to the provinces, the communities do not have a set territory. Instead, each town and city will apply to be part of either of the two communities and the communities can also establish schools and cultural organizations in towns and cities belonging to the other community. Finally, any member of any of the two communities can use the services of the other on the condition that they respect all regulations and satisfy all requirements.\n\nThe reform has puzzled many due to its byzantine nature and some have accused it of preserving griffon privileges in Hellquill. Despite this, the reform has passed thanks to Carl's popularity and the support of several members of the Druwi movement."

hellquill.111.t:0 "Healing the Wounds"
hellquill.111.d:0 "River Breeze sighed as he laid back in his car. He had spent most of the day at parliament, trying to broker some coalition to support his new legislation. It had been a trying affair with the OBD representatives trying to undercut him at every turn. It looked like they were succeeding but, had he been a gambling Pony, he wouldn't have taken any bet on it. Hellquillian parliament was fickle... He opened his eyes and decided that he needed a break. He ordered his driver to bring him to the Pony district. He hadn't visited in a while and he was missing it. A few moments later, they were there. River Breeze put on his coat and ordered his bodyguard to remain discrete. He didn't want to raise any attention as he strolled.\n\nAs he walked those familiar streets, River Breeze began to relax. It was so good to hear the native language and to listen to the simple hustle and bustle of the crowd. Despite a few open insults and yell here and there, it was so much more melodious than the neverending filibuster in parliament. But as he walked, the Pony began to notice changes. The streets were cleaner. The stores were better stocked and many had renovated their storefront. New businesses had opened, selling more upscale goods from the West or the Riverlands. Paying more attention, he noticed that his compatriots were better dressed and that the usual stress and gloomy attitude he had known all his life seemed to have dissipated somewhat from the Ponies' faces. He stopped and smiled. Was he even really in Hellquill?\n\nThen, what had to happen happened. A stroller recognized him and approached him to pester him about the recent reform he had read about in one of Guttenfried's rags. Yes, he was still in Hellquill, albeit a better one than he had thought possible."

The atmosphere was cheerful as many knew Guttenfried personally and had even helped his electoral campaign. They had trusted him and he had delivered on his promises.\n\nPresident Guttenfried delivered a speech on the latest economic results. Despite the chaos of the world, Hellquill was prospering. Historical growth in the region, soaring industrial output, an emerging stock market. And all of it was thanks to his reforms and the Hellquillian's efforts. But after a moment of explaining dry numbers, Reiner felt inspired to take his speech in a more poetic direction.\n\n"All of this, my friends, could really have only happened here. In this Frontier of ours. We've been dealt a harsh claw after all. His imperial majesty Grover II sent us here to fight, not to build or prosper. And that's what we did because what little we had, powers in the East were trying to rob us from. Yet, this is where we have learned how to make do with nothing. This is where we have obtained our Frontier Spirit. We know that if we don't pull ourselves up and get to work, nothing will get done. Out here, there is no legacy to uphold, no natural resources to exploit, no historical harbour to take toll from, none of that. There is only what us frontiercreatures can build with our own strength. That is our Frontier Spirit and with it, we'll show the world that we are more than a simple border region!""

He also reminded his commitment to upholding the democratic reforms of his predecessors and condemned acts of violence against ponies committed during the previous months. The speech that hadn't been planned and didn't take place at any particularly symbolic date puzzled many in the nation.\n\nThe next day, the newspaper Der Morgen published a shocking investigation. Several of their reporters had infiltrated the internal events of The Ost-Griffonische Bund and took copious notes. The articles revealed that many vocal members had had ties with Von Katerinburg's dissolved reformisten movement and that the events were rife with talks and slogans justifying black cloak terrorist attacks, the massacres of Count Pallas of Longsword and harshly criticizing the democratic reforms. Some members were quoted to advocate for an anti-democratic coup.\n\nIn the following week, president von Soldau announced that he had ordered the Bund to expel the members of his movement who had engaged in terrorism apologism and that he had instructed the police to launch an investigation into Black Cloak activity. Despite this, many in the public thought that he had been tipped off in advance and was only trying to shield himself."

hellquill.114.d:0 "Today, president Carl von Soldau has made a visit to the Pony district in Hellquill. Local officials among which were some Pony advisors to the city mayor welcomed him and walked him through the streets of the district, explaining the history of the neighbourhood and the daily life there.\n\nSome time into the visit however, Carl began to complain that he wasn't seeing any of the locals and noticed that the neighbourhood seemed to have been freshly renovated and cleaned up. In a particularly egregious example, a visit to a local bakery turned sour after Carl's coat was stained with fresh paint upon entering. In a break of the protocole, Carl simply stormed out of the bakery and began to look around while the city officials were trying to calm him down. He then noticed an elderly Pony looking at the noise from her window and waved her to open it. After she did, he asked her if city officials had bothered her before the visit. The elderly pony plainly said that she they did and that she had been forced to put her porch bench back in because it was too dirty. The old mare's son rushed out of the house to apologize for her mother but Carl simply laughed and instructed the officials to put the bench back out. Afterwards, Carl sat down with the old mare and chatted with her upon which she invited him to stay for dinner. Despite some attempts of Carl's entourage to put an end to the show, Carl accepted and spent the evening dining with the Pony family.\n\nThe story quickly made its way to the press and was widely relayed with many praising Carl's simplicity."

hellquill.115.d:0 "Despite the undeniable growth of the Hellquillian economy since Guttenfried took over the republic, there have been many voices criticizing his lack of social policies and his rigid adherence to ideals of personal responsibilities.\n\nChief among Guttenfried's critics is the leader of the ZPW, River Breeze. He has held several speeches and conferences on the matter of reparation and enduring inequalities in Hellquill. According to him, the inequalities in Hellquillian society are the direct results of the old Order's oppression and that they won't be solved without direct involvement from the state through social policies, investments in Pony communities or monetary reparations. The president has come under fire for once reacting to River Breeze's policies by claiming that he was only seeking handouts, implying that Ponies are simply being lazy. Several protests erupted in cities with strong Pony minorities since. More surprisingly, many poor Griffons have marched with the Ponies, considering that they too have been forgotten by the old Order.\n\nSome more worrying reports do show that although armed resistance is still off the table, many Ponies and even Griffons are beginning to once again flirt with communism. Many workers in factories are trying to organize themselves into unions. However, we have no intelligence showing that either the longswordian IIA or the Hellquillian KpH are able to seize on this momentum."

hellquill.116.t:0 "Support Dogs"
hellquill.116.d:0 "Over the last weeks, president Guttenfried has held numerous meetings with members of the Diamond Dog community in Hellquill. These meetings proved to be productive as several new legislations and amendments were introduced to parliament to better protect the Diamond Dog community. Dog association such as the Bund der Freien Hunde have either received subsidies from the state or seen their existing ones increased. Guttenfried has also unveiled several plans to better support investments and trade to and from Bronzehill as to increase economic cooperation between Hellquill and the Griffonian dog communities. Finally, he has decorated knight Trudy Oettinger and hinted that the veteran may be up for a promotion to the highest ranks of the Wehrmacht.\n\nDespite these actions receiving wide support, many have suspected or implied that Guttenfried acted in less than good faith. To these critics, Guttenfried is attempting to use his pro-Diamond Dogs gestures as a way to protect himself from accusation of speciesism and to change the subjects after calls being made from within the Pony community for reparations and the left in general for a stronger social safety net. Needless to say that Diamond Dogs advocates have been put in a less than comfortable position."

hellquill.117.d:0 "Almost immediately after August's nomination as Grandmaster of the Order of Hellquill, a backlash was felt throughout the country among those supporting Wingfried von Katerinburg and his reformisten. While the griff himself hasn't taken any action, there are those among his supporters who have began to use even more inflammatory rhetoric. It appears that they had good hope that Trappenfeld's succession would turn their way and that a path towards harmony prevailing was a disaster scenario to them.\n\nEdler von Wingenberg, the leader of the infamous Sturmgreife, has frequently insulted the new Grandmaster as a weak, Pony-loving and ineffective leader and called for his removal. More worryingly, he has been heard making plans to use his paramilitary fanatics to wreak havoc into the country. Something that Von Katerinburg has failed to condemn or even acknowledge as taking place.\n\nFortunately, our military staff has mostly reassured us that they stood behind the Grandmaster. Demetrius Kamphaus, a veteran, also argued that the Sturmgreife weren't powerful enough to stage an uprising on their own. We can only hope that he is right."

Instead, he has called for their movement to "shed the weak blood among them" and to unite behind him. While in hiding, he has spread the word, calling for insurrection.\n\nFar from uniting the movement, it seems to have caused a split of sort. Most of the Sturmgreife are standing behind their leader while others have decided to continue supporting the cause of Wingfried. Reports abound about the two groups coming to blows and killing each other. Others have decided to jump ship altogether and reneged on their support for Wingfried. Among them is Wilhelm Stackelberg, a knight of the Inner Circle who had been known for his sympathies for the reformisten's ideals. The knight has joined claws with his friend Urlach ap Cyrod in helping to root out the knights who would betray their oaths of service."

The last Sturmgreife compound was located in an old fortress in the small town of Isentadt, western Sondersune.\n\nYesterday, operation Totenkopf was launched under the command of Demetrius Kamphaus. After being surrounded, Von Wingenberg and his griff were offered a last chance to surrender by radio transmission. In response, the griff went into a tirade about how "they would never surrender their last chance to ascend back to Ogledd. The tirade was cut short by Kamphaus's orders to bomb the castle. After a thorough artillery barrage, he send his team of knights and shock troops to storm the ruins. There were few survivors and Edler himself was found burnt to a crisp."

According to the local mayor, what happened is that most arable lands in Giraite were owned by the Guttenfried family. They rent the land for generations to local posniaks farmers. However, the last wave of Griffonian settlers caused the Guttenfried to sell the land for a good price. Unfortunately, the settlers wished to work the land themselves and evicted the posniaks. The Ponies, feeling that there was no venue for dialogue, tried to make a point by organising a large protest.

Apparently, Wingfried attempted to set up a prison gang of sorts. He seemed successful at first. However, when he tried to make a show of force against the Ponies of the prison, he was abandoned in the heat of the moment by some of his supporters and by Sturmgreife inmates.

In front of him stood only officials, priests and a few onlookers. Little to no Ponies.\n\nHe looked at his speech notes but the words felt empty. So, he decided to improvise and speak from the heart.\n\n"My fellow Hellquillians, I stand here today not proudly but full of shame. Ashamed that it took us so long to finally realize our faults and failures. This monument has been built by the best artisans in Hellquill but it won't ever make up for the blood that has been spilled. It is not enough. We need to understand that we are to express remorse not for the consequences we feel today but for the motives of our past actions. This is why I announce to you all that I will begin a dialogue with the Ponies of our nation and finally lift many of the unjust laws which oppresses them.

hellquill.123.d:0 "During the last months, a strange controversy has begun to mount in the pony communities over religious matters.\n\nSince the establishment of Hellquill, the Griffon settlers have made numerous attempts at converting the Pony communities. These efforts were often combined with policies suppressing the Pony beliefs that have made the conversion largely unpopular. Despite this, two centuries of griffonization managed to convert a significant part of the population. This state of affair has come to be seen as a wrong to right for many members of the Druwi movement. While some are simply advocating for a return to their old customs, some radicals believe that any Pony believer in the Griffonian Trinity are either misguided or actively helping to oppress their brethrens.\n\nThe controversy has hit River Breeze particularly hard, having been educated as a Trinitarian and still a devout Eyrite to this day. The matter has not been helped by the intervention in the press of the Hellquillian prelate of Boreas who has harshly criticized the Druwi activists and declared that he prayed that River Breeze would stand firm. The president has pushed back against the accusations and called all citizens to uphold the right of any citizen to believe in whatever religion they deem worthy."

hellquill.160.d:0 "Despite Urlach's nomination to Grandmaster, the rift between him and Wingfried didn't heal. Even as he swore his oath and began his duties, the Katerinian continued to smear him and put the Inner Circle's decision into question. And while he had not acted in rebellion, rumours spoke of some in his entourage such as the Sturmgreife leaders Edler von Wingenberg and Eisen Silberkrone who did. And such a situation couldn't be tolerated. Urlach pondered on the matter and ultimately decided to settle the matter as a knight.\n\nThe Grandmaster found his rival at the Goldener Flügel Beer Hall, a favorite meeting place for knights, officers and more recently, the reformisten leaders. Wingfried was there, seated among friends of his. With many eyes looking towards him, Urlach walked up to the Katerinian who only greeted him with the least regard for protocole.\n\n"Wingfried von Katerinburg. For your repeated insults toward my person, I seek retribution and challenge you to a personal duel", upon which Urlach threw his gauntlet at Wingfried's paws.\n\nHe seemed taken aback and took a moment to respond as silence quickly fell on the Beer Hall.\n\n"My Grandmaster! I... It's dishonourable of you! You're trying to use brute force to silence me! Everyone knows that unlike you, I do not practice sword fighting anymore! Do you challenge squires too?"\n\n"I am willing to leave you the choice of arms, despite being the offended party. Surely, force is not needed to yield a pistol."\n\nOnce again, Wingfried tried to weasel his way out, asking for champions to be chosen. To which Urlach simply turned to the assistance and called up Hermann Steeltalon. The giant griff stood up and approached, smiling at Wingfried who did not return in kind. He stuttered before Urlach interrupted him.\n\n"You look unwell, brother Wingfried. And it would indeed be dishonourable of me to challenge an ill griff. Perhaps you should go on a vacation? You have my permission. I hear Soldau is lovely this time of year."\n\n"I... have heard the same... Thank you. Grandmaster."

Griffons from all corners of the city as well as knights were in attendance for this ceremony of the Entschlossenheitnacht. They would pray for a whole night before attending a community breakfast while the warriors among them would spar with traditional swords and lances. Urlach had decided to attend tonight. As was his friend, Wilhelm Stackelberg, stern as always but the Grandmaster knew that there was more behind it. Stackelberg had made himself rare at Castle Hellquill and Urlach knew not what to make of it. After breakfast, Urlach went to Wilhelm and offered him to spar. To which the knight agreed, though more politely than warmly. They took their swords and positioned themselves.\n\n"You have been avoiding me, brother Wilhelm."\n\nSwords met before Stackelberg answered.\n\n"You have been quite busy yourself, brother Urlach. And I surmised that you enjoyed other presences than mine."\n\nUrlach frowned. Again, swords met and Wilhelm approached, pressing against Urlach's sword. The Grandmaster could see the knight's anger coming out: "You meet with rabble. You let brother August fill your head with lies and fall for brother Carl's lecherous ways. Worse, you meet with ponies and assorted enemies. His Imperial Majesty would weep if he saw what his warden of the east is doing!"\n\nUrlach pushed back against Wilhelm and began to strike him as he snapped back: "So what? Am I to mimic the heretics that had your ears? To drench the land in blood, just as Count Pallas did in Longsword? My oath is to protect, not to slaughter!"\n\n"Such is the talk of weakness", Wilhelm yelled as he launched himself towards him. Urlach parried the attack, pivoted on himself and put his blade on Stackelberg's throat, stopping just short of cutting it.\n\n"Such is the duty of a knight. To spare life as much as possible and to destroy whatever and whoever threatens it. And I will carry out my duty to the utter end. Do we understand each other, brother Wilhelm?"\n\nWilhelm threw his sword to the ground."

While there are some positive notes since the end of lord Trappenfeld's rule, the situation remains largely unchanged.\n\nThe few economists working in the Order's administration point out several weaknesses that still affect the Hellquillian economy. The agricultural sector remains woefully archaic and in dire need of mechanization. Factories in the cities remain outdated and any improvement in the rural areas would first require investments to electrify the region. Credit remains difficult to obtain as many of the old families of the region are not optimistic enough to invest. As for trade, the chaos in the Empire and the cold relations with the Riverlands prevent any sort of improvement of our situation.\n\nThis year's report is somewhat innovating as it reports for the first time in decades about the economical impact of the Posniaks' situation. Written by a newly-emigrated expert from Yale, the document points out that the effective segregation between Ponies and Griffons is one of the greatest burden on the Hellquillian economies. It does praise the lift of some restriction on travel and communication for Ponies across the nation as it has allowed an increase in activity. The expert's conclusion is that both larger investments and deeper pacification of the country are needed if we are to rekindle prosperity."

hellquill.163.d:0 "In the last weeks, we have seen an increasing numbers of refugees from the west entering our borders. Mostly originating from the core of the empire and the Principality of Katerin, they tell worrying tales of unrest and atrocities being committed there since his imperial Majesty's demise. These are often no random peasants but rather craftgriffs, scholars, merchants and others well-off citizens. It was surprising to many border guards as those griffons usually looked down on the Frontier. But to them, Hellquill had proven to be exceptionally stable and a place where tradition held firm. And to them who had lived through civil wars, revolutions and uprisings, it may mean that Hellquill could be a place to call home."
hellquill.163.a:0 "Let us welcome them."

hellquill.164.t:0 "The New Jousts"
hellquill.164.d:0 "For centuries, Hellquill has been proud to host many jousts and tournaments where knights and swordgriffs of all Griffonia came to compete. Infrastructure was build to host such events. Sadly, as the age of gunpowder came about, the jousting fields became less and less popular.\n\nThat was until a group of knights and civilian lead by Julian Feininger designed a modernized jousting rulebook inspired by modern team games and some Aquileian events. Use of standards weapons and armors are replaced by teams using equipment from a specific time period. All weapons are to be blunt and dangerous techniques such as thrusting or attacks to vulnerable body parts are banned.\n\nThe variety of historical weaponry and safety has attracted many artisans and scholars as well as civilians who would have been banned from the knightly events. The first few matches have been met with some success among the population and many cities are setting up teams. An unlikely star has even emerged: Iron Reed, a Pony from Zinten. A firefighter by day, she has yet to lose a fight and the local mayor has openly called on her to become a professional paid by the city."

hellquill.165.d:0 "Purple Top and her father made her way towards the village inn in front of which there was a long queue already. It looked like the word had spread. She was only half surprised. After all, the announcement had been quite a shock to everypony in the community but a good one. They had been used to hear about the folks back at Hellquill to send them soldiers and investigators to "search for partisans". So when they heard that for once, it was money coming their way, well, there was little hesitation.\n\nThe pair waited their turn until they were finally able to go inside. They met with a griff and a pony seated together. The griff introduced himself as an employee of the Guttenfried Investment Bank while the Pony presented himself as a lawyer working with somepony named River Breeze. The Bank employee went on and on with the lawyer only sometimes interjecting to put some nuance in his speech.\n\n"The contract is quite simple really. Our bank loans you a sum of money that is to be used to buy modern agricultural equipment such as tractors or fertilizer."\n\n"All interests are subsidized by the Order of Hellquill so you will only have to pay back the amount that you have borrowed."\n\n"Our bank will accept either cash or shares on each crops until the debt is paid in full. That is reasonable, no?"\n\nHer father interjected:\n\n"What happens if we get a bad harvest?"\n\n"Well, we have a program that offers to buy your land and lease it back to you should you prove to be insolvent. You will keep the farmhouse and your job but you will get a wage instead. But nothing of the sort could ever happen"\n\nThe pony lawyer sighed and explained that it was only one option and that the town would provide alternatives and guarantees if it ever come to that."

hellquill.166.d:0 "Under the guidance of Grandmaster Urlach ap Cyrod, power is being devolved to new local entities, though some areas will remain under the direct rule of the knights. Those newly empowered regions are the free cities, the griffon civilian regions and the pony civilian regions. They will be given a role in local administrative affairs and some degree of financial autonomy. However, these councils will remain under the tutelage of the Order of Hellquill.\n\nFor the time being, those councils will be ruled by provisional governors appointed by the Grandmaster, although with input from advisors such as August van Ortelsberg, Carl von Soldau and River Breeze. In due time, elections will be held under the principles of plural voting. Citizens will have between zero or several votes if they hold a school degree, pay a certain amount of taxes, own lands, serve in the temples or the Wehrmacht or are parents. In doing so, Hellquill will ensure that those who contribute to society shall have a greater say than the licentious idles. Political parties are banned and candidates shall only be able to run on the quality of their reputation."

hellquill.167.t:0 "The Regional Councils Elections"
hellquill.167.d:0 "Today were held the first regional elections in the history of Hellquill. Overall, the event went well even if the plural voting system caused some headaches and some KpH activists tried, mostly without success, to disturb voting booths in several cities.\n\nThe councils have now elected representatives. Some familiar faces have been elected such as River Breeze in the pony council of the capital district or Reiner Guttenfried in Soldau. Representatives associated with the temples or The Ost-Griffonische Bund have performed particularely well in griffon district. Very few creatures sympathetic to radical views such as the now moribund reformisten or the communist KpH have gained seats though some of the new representatives in Zinten have views favorable towards labour union.\n\nOverall, it seems that the risk was worth it and that Hellquill will not see the kind of chaos that comes with elections in so many so-called democracies these days."

However, this threat has failed to materialize. Recent reports show that attempts have been made at securing support among the posniak communities or among the working class. They were fortunately not successful.\n\nDespite this lack of success in sparking an uprising, the KpH still tries to agitate around factories, commits petty acts of vandalism here and there and hold meetings in damp basements in the major cities.\n\nThis month, an attempt at distributing pamphlets picturing the KpH as a "sleeping giant" waiting for his time somewhat backfired as it became a joke to say that the giant isn't good at much more than snoring.

Unfortunately, the Ponies and Griffons all had to wait until every trainee had finish their exercise. And one in particular seemed to have it especially hard.\n\n"Come on soldier! You call that a pushup? My grandma does better one in the morning and she's been dead for ten years!"\n\nThe recruits turned their eyes towards their sergeant's yelling only to see a blue griffon desperately trying to find the strength to do their fifty pushups. The sergeant was having none of it and continued his tirade.\n\n"Come on Wingfried! I ain't no bigot! I dislike every worthless creatures the gods have put in this world equally but I'll be damned if you aren't the most worthless one of them all!

hellquill.170.d:0 "Urlach sat back at his office, fiddling with his claws. He sighed, feeling a bit tired. These last few years had been exhausting. It had been all meeting after meeting. Whether it was with some peasants from the Bund, the blabbering ponies and griffons from the regional councils or that stubborn fool of Stackelberg, he could never find a moment of peace. Sometimes, he regretted it all and wondered what would have happened if he had left Hellquill and all its insane complexities to just go back home to Rumare. How he missed seeing the green shores of the lake...\n\nHe sighed once more and rubbed his eyes before turning towards his aide de camp.\n\n"What is on the agenda today?"\n\nHis aide flipped through some pages.\n\n"Nothing, my lord Grandmaster."\n\n"That is not possible. Check the date. You must have taken next year's agenda."\n\n"I assure you, my lord Grandmaster, that there is nothing. Sir August von Ortelsberg cancelled last week due to a conference in Zinten and sir Wilhelm Stackelberg's aide came to tell me that he was ah... Indisposed. As for sir Carl von Soldau, he has been forced to extend his leave. A budgeting issue at the OBD general assembly. The rest of your day is completely free, my lord Grandmaster."\n\nUrlach pondered for a moment. He felt strange. Things had been so hectic for so long that he had not found himself with a full day of genuine free time in quite a while. He wasn't exactly sure what to do. He looked towards the window. The sun was quite beautiful today. Perhaps he should go fishing. That spot on the Griffking River was always free. Unlike him. He stood up, grabbed his coat and left the room."

hellquill.171.t:0 "The Sturmgreife Affair"
hellquill.171.d:0 "It didn't take much for Urlach ap Cyrod to convince the Inner Circle that the violent Sturmgreife posed a threat to Hellquill's stability. Few had missed their devastating influence in the Longswordian bloodbath or their inflammatory rhetoric, just shy of calls to open revolt. And with Stackelberg's help in reassuring the reformisten-leaning knights, steps were taken to secure armories, outposts and sensitive targets from any attempted uprising. Officially, it was all routine but either through unsuspected intelligence or insanity, the SG grew uneasy. After Wingfried von Katerinburg's shameful departure from the capital, Edler von Wingenberg, head of the SG, attempted to cement control of the reformisten movement at large with increasingly treacherous insinuations.\n\nAnd then, a match was struck in the powderkeg. What set it all in motion was Von Wingenberg's arrest under charge of heresy and treason. After he was burned at the stakes, Wilhem Stackelberg organized a meeting of old reformisten supporters at the Goldener Flügel Beer Hall to appease them. He was however attacked on the way and had to flee his car. Meanwhile, Eisen Silberkrone and other Sturmgreife members stormed the Beer Hall. He called upon the attendees to rise up in revolt against the "injustice" they were facing. Some applauded but others balked as he claimed that the "traitor Stackelberg" had been killed. Fights erupted.\n\nEventually, the local garrison and police force gathered around the place. Silberkrone desperately tried to rally his lackeys to fight them off and a skirmish erupted. Outnumbered and outgunned, the traitors were killed or captured, their would-be uprising utterly failed. Silberkrone and several others Sturmgreife leaders were executed for treason."

hellquill.200.d:0 "News have arrived in the last month about the great tour of his Imperial Majesty Grover V by train to inaugurate the Imperial Railway System. Those news, a great display of Griffonian engineering capabilities, had a much more bitter taste in Hellquill which was not to be visited by the Emperor.\n\nFor years, Hellquill had petitioned for being integrated within the plans of the Imperial Railway System but the imperial planners had failed to include Hellquill in the initial plans. Of course, they hid themselves behind arguments about lack of security for workers in Hellquill or even a lack of participation from the knights into the project, however the reason was clear. Despite relations between Hellquill and the Empire warming up under Grover V's rule, the imperial court had remained angry about Trappenfeld's decision to not renew the oaths of direct loyalty to the crown. The Imperial Railway System was just a convenient way to punish the Frontier for it.\n\nThis enraged the Hellquillian traders and knights who saw that even the destitute Barony of Angriver and Principality of Katerin had been included in the railway plans despite rampant banditry. To add insult to injury, construction had started for impressive railway stations in both Hellquill and Soldau and while Soldau's eventually gained some minor connections to the Empire, Hellquill's remains unconnected and unfinished."

However, he became dissatisfied with the Order's policies and goals, considering them outdated and futile. He finally deserted and subsequently left the country.\n\nNot much is known about his time as an exile but his name frequently came up during interrogations of communist agitators and seized subversive documents. At some point, the young griff gained power over the fledgling Hellquillian Communist Party or KPH and lead it from afar. His ideology, beyond the usual communist dribble, is apparently based on the idea that soldiers rather than workers or peasants will form a revolutionary vanguard to impose communism by violently destroying so-called reactionary movements.\n\nWe will need to keep an eye out on them."

This practice has been an ancient one and has been considered a mark of prestige among the Griffonian nobility. Traditionally, the Order organizes them into trust and rents them to locals.\n\nSince the Revolution of 978 and the imperial collapse, much of those estates have been seized by local authorities, illegally sold or destroyed, causing many headaches for the Order. Since then, the number of bequeathings has dwindled and with it a source of revenue for the Order. The von Clawdeck bequeathing is actually the first one of the eleventh century. A grand ceremony has been planned in von Clawdeck's name in the temple of Boreas in Hellquill."

One such group has been the rabidly fanatic and paramilitary group of the Sturmgreife lead by Edler von Wingenberg who enjoys "patrolling" and harassing pony citizens.\n\nFree from the rules of conduct of the knights, they have sought many ways to gather funds for their activities. This week, members of the Sturmgreife have launched a new company producing cigarettes. They already claim that their cigarettes will be the finest tobacco in all of Hellquill and that the revenues will entirely go to funding the "greatest endeavour in Hellquill's history".\n\nRumours on the street is that their members have already begun to harass store owners to make room for their new product and limit foreign or competitor tobacco."

Their entire goal is to help slaves from Diamond Mountain escape and brought, should they want it, to Bronzehill.\n\nThe Bund has long had a difficult relationship with the Order of Hellquill where discrimination towards non-griffons is a frequent issue despite several dogs serving in the army. As a result, the Bund hasn't ever really developed a working relationship with the Order, instead operating on its own thanks to funds provided by Bronzehillian elite and small donors. The difficult relationship has become a point of contention for many in the Order, mostly from the radical Reformisten ideologues but also from less political knights such as Wilhelm Stackelberg or Urlach ap Cyrod. Despite this, the current Grandmaster Siegfried Trappenfeld has so far shielded them from any harm and there are voices like that of knight archivist August von Ortelsberg calling for enshrining the Bund's role in Hellquill."

Wilhelm looked around. There was nogriff in there. He approached the windows. Maybe the coward had flown away? But no, they were shut tight and there was no sign of a hasty escape. Wilhelm frowned. Then he heard a whimper. The knight slowly turned to his side from where the noise came from. There was a large closet behind his desk. Could it be possible? Could the Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury have fallen so low that their grandmaster was hiding in a closet to hide from attackers? He rushed to the closet and violently opened it. Inside was Wingfried holding on tight to his gun pointing at Stackelberg. "I order you to stand back, traitor.", he snapped. Wilhelm didn't blink and went for an attack. Wingfried fired but his bullet only managed to graze Stackelberg's shoulder before the knight's sword disarmed him.

He asked for a report. The coup was still happening as few griffs had learned of Stackelberg's demise yet. The situation could still spiral out of control, even with their leader dead.\n\nWingfried grabbed the intercom to broadcast a message in the palace. The newly installed device didn't work at first and cracked at first.

Edler von Wingenberg had also been the target of an assassination attempt but fortunately survived as he was in his private bathroom when Stackelberg's followers were fighting his personal guards outside his office.

The traditionally literate knights had been committed to crafting well-designed law codes and procedures even if jurists from Yale were dismayed at some of the archaisms remaining in it like the legal duel system.\n\nThe Reformisten had numerous issues with that system. They saw it as being infested with civilians who had little regard or understanding for the necessities of the military order and considered some of the rules and procedures as nothing more than tying the knights' claws behind their back. After his arrival in power, Wingfried von Katerinburg oversaw a vast rework of the judicial system, nominating reformisten-aligned candidates in the judiciary and removing several procedural protections for ponies, diamond dogs and "ideological agitators".\n\nA judge named Lothar Witteknecht openly defied the reforms and the hierarchy by ordering the liberation of a journalist who had published articles critical of the election of von Katerinburg. However, the journalist had already been executed and there was much confusion about whether he had been executed despite the court's order or due to a mistake. As a reaction, the judge formally resigned and left a letter in his home, stating his opinion that the Order was no longer legitimate and his decision to join the KpH.\n\nThe head archivist of the Order, August von Ortelsberg, while disagreeing with the decision to join criminal organizations like the communists criticized the reforms of the justice system as being rushed and called for some restraints.

Wingfried had never shown much interest in the day to day life of the archives or even the need for historical records. When he entered, Wingfried smiled at him and stood up to come and embrace him.\n\n"Mein freund! I'm so pleased to see you. I hope you've had a good day."\n\nAugust was taken aback by the sudden familiarity of the Grandmaster and it took him a moment to try and answer in kind but he was interrupted nonetheless.\n\n"I have been so touched by your decision to retire. You have served us for so long and so well. It is for sure a great loss for our Order to lose a griff such as yourself, almost like one loses a memory."\n\nAugust froze and stared, wide-eyed.\n\n"But... My Grandmaster, I'm afraid you have been ill-informed... I'm not retiring."\n\n"Are you saying I have made a mistake, August? It pains me but no matter. Old age makes anygriff forget things. Perhaps this may refresh your memory?"\n\nThe Grandmaster went to his desk and picked up a letter. He showed it to him and there it was: a letter of resignation signed by him. Forged of course but that was that. He understood the implication and meekly thanked the Grandmaster as Wingfried explained to him that he would be given a "guard" assigned to his residence so that "what happened to our dear brother Urlach never happens again".\n\nLater during the evening, August was desperately looking in his law books to find some kind of imperial recourse. Suddenly, he heard pawsteps from the corridor and jumped from his seat. He decided to hide but as the door of the archives was opening, his wing caused a book to fall. Panicking, he let out a small whimper and froze in direction of the door. It was Carl von Soldau. The soldier approached, not menacingly but with an expression of concern on his face. He extended his claw to give him a sealed letter.\n\n"You're going to the Temple of Eyr in Soldau. The prelate is a friend of mine and will protect you as best as he can. It's all I can do. Please go and don't make a fuss. For your own sake."\n\nAugust took the letter and sighed: "Thank you, Carl...""
hellquill.215.a:0 "He'll go, quiet or not."

hellquill.216.t:0 "August Found Dead"
hellquill.216.d:0 "Today, August von Ortelsberg has been found dead in his room at the temple of Eyr where he was living in seclusion. No trace of struggle were found and the autopsy mandated directly by the Führer found that he had committed suicide. Some seditious documents were found in his belongings. They were reported and archived but were kept out of the public eye. Should any knight protest, they could still be held under charge of contact with a known traitor, something easily "proven" with those documents.\n\nDespite his known popularity in the Order, no request for a ceremony in his honour was introduced in any of the temples in Hellquill."
hellquill.216.a:0 "Now, he'll finally keep his beak shut."

hellquill.217.t:0 "The Bequeathing Scandal"
hellquill.217.d:0 "Today, a scandal erupted after it became known that several estates around Griffonia that had been bequeathed to the Order of Hellquill have been used as luxury vacation houses by members of the Reformisten leadership under the guise of "training missions". Gossip abound about copious amounts of alcohol being consumed and several locations being degraded by unruly parties.\n\nMembers - among them Alfred Aschenkampf - implicated have been sanctioned for their infractions but the damage is done. Not only have we lost significant revenue in this case of corruption, but our prestige is being hurt. On the longer term, noblegriffs may think twice before entrusting us with their properties."
hellquill.217.a:0 "Damn them!"

hellquill.218.t:0 "Of Burned Farms"
hellquill.218.d:0 "Carl von Soldau tightened his coat. Mornings in the Hellquillian forests could be quite cold and misty and this one was no exception. He took a swig from his canteen as he looked upon the distant hill. The compound was large and lively with Ponies beginning to go about their day. Definitely more a community than a farm and quite realistically able to support a partisan cell. From the looks of it, they had failed to notice that they were surrounded by knights and Sturmgreife or simply had no sentries. Carl took another swig, thinking. They would have to confirm intel with the headquarters. It looked all very quiet for a partisan base.\n\nCarl was about to leave for the radio truck when he suddenly heard gunfire. He quickly grabbed his binoculars and looked on. He saw some shots being fired, coming from within the forest and panic spreading in the compound. What could be the meaning of this? He yelled out to his officers, asking for reports. Everygriff seemed as dumbfounded as he was. After a few seconds, Alfred Aschenkampff, one of the new Sturmgreife officers, walked up to von Soldau and quietly asked:\n\n"Sir! I require artillery support."\n\nCarl von Soldau blew up. "Artillery support? What support?! By the gods, what is going on over there? We were waiting for confirmation!"\n\n"I have ordered an attack."\n\n"What?! Under whose orders? I haven't authorized any offensive!"\n\n"Mine, under instruction from the headquarters. I am not under your orders. As you'll recall, we Sturmgreife operate independently and I have ruled that this compound is a terrorist base that needs to be purged. Now, I request artillery support from your unit."\n\n"You are not getting it!"\n\n"Fine, I will report this back home," he scoffed and turned back.\n\nBeyond angry, Carl threw his canteen in Alfred's general direction and angrily snapped back that he would report this too, but to no avail. He looked back at the hill. The compound was already catching fire. It was done."
hellquill.218.a:0 "Guess this is how we do things now."

hellquill.219.t:0 "Bankrupcy Of The Luxenwing"
hellquill.219.d:0 "To the shock of many in Hellquill, the Luxenwing Bank has been forced into bankruptcy today. With its demise, a whole chapter of Hellquillian history is ending.\n\nFounded in 904, the Luxenwing Bank was a conglomerate formed by several charities and small civilian knightly orders under the patronage of western griffonian nobles sympathetic to the old cause given to Hellquill by the late emperor Grover II. Their goal was to negotiate, fund and organize the payment of ransoms for knights captured by eastern enemies. The Bank also funded and ran several charities dedicated to veterans health and elderly care.\n\nOver time, the Luxenwing Bank had become a major intermediary between griffon interests and the Riverland powers as well as a major source of pride in both Hellquill and Longsword.\n\nThe collapse of the Griffonian Empire and the Revolution was a major blow to the Bank. Many of their patrons were either killed or ruined in the chaos and the bank saw a dip in their donations and revenues. Faced with increasingly tight budget and more and more reliant on their own shrinking profits, the bank had to cut a lot of its charitable activities. In recent years, many of its members drifted towards the Reformisten ideology and some began to allegedly embezzle the bank and funnel money to the party both within and outside of the Order of Hellquill. Failing to address this mismanagement was the final nail in the coffin."

hellquill.220.t:0 "The Almanach Controversy"
hellquill.220.d:0 "A strange controversy has erupted within the Order's leadership this week. The release of a new book being printed out has been halted. The book, called "The Almanach of the heroes of the Order of Hellquill", lists most of our military and political leadership with pictures, birthday dates and a brief biography of their lives. The goal of the book was to popularize the transformed Order and make our leadership more popular among the general population. The author even argued that patriotic griffons could use the Almanach to send birthday presents to their heroes, strengthening the bond between the Order and the country.\n\nOne detail caused the ire of Edler von Wingenberg though. His biography mentioned an anecdote about his past friendship with foals and fillies when he was a chick. Edler exploded at the idea and called the book's allegation some of the most vile slander he had ever heard. Refusing to calm down, he called for the removal of the book and implied that the author may be a political agitator. At that point, Demetrius Kamphaus openly defied Edler due to the author being an old friend whose loyalty to the state was beyond question. The fight went on with speculations and rumours spreading about both griffons in the mess hall of the castle.\n\nIn the end, the matter was brought in front of Wingfried von Katerinburg. He ordered them to cease their bickering and allowed the release of the book with censorship of the anecdote."

hellquill.221.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
hellquill.221.d:0 "For several weeks now, the attacks carried on by the communist underground had been increasing with several members of our leadership being specifically targeted, despite many of them not being public figures. Some had speculated that the KpH had obtained moles within our ranks but the capture of a pony partisan safehouse today shed some light on what had happened.\n\nA copy of the "The Almanach of the heroes of the Order of Hellquill" had been found with scribbled notes. The partisans had taken the book that was supposed to honour our soldiers and civil servants and used it as a hit list. The matter was not helped by the biographies containing special details that may have been of use in assassination attempts.\n\nThe book was quickly removed from the bookstores but the damage was already done."
hellquill.221.a:0 "Burn all remaining copies!"

hellquill.222.t:0 "The Goldener Flügel Beer Hall Attack"
hellquill.222.d:0 "Today, the Goldener Flügel Beer Hall - an establishment patronized by both knights and members of the Sturmgreife and reformisten movement - has been the target of a terrorist attack. A bomb had been installed in the recently repaired lighting system and seemed to have been timed for a birthday celebration of a prominent member of the reformisten party. Early leads seem to indicate that the KpH and pony partisans are behind the attack.\n\nWhile there has been several dead and injured officers, all senior officers have been left unharmed. The stroke of luck can be attributed to a strategic meeting going for longer than expected due to several disagreements and arguments between officers."
hellquill.222.a:0 "Truly, luck is on our side!"

hellquill.223.t:0 "Sturm Zigaretten Blow"
hellquill.223.d:0 "The SZ cigarettes, the brand produced by allies of the Sturmgreife, have failed to make a hit in the market. Hellquillian smokers have found the brand to be unappealing and of low quality.\n\nRumours and jokes abound about SG members smoking other brands in secrets or store owners deliberately helping partisans to steal or destroy shipments of the brand, just so they can justify selling others.\n\nDespite all this, they remain a mainstay in tobacco stores thanks to political pressure and bullying from the members of the Sturmgreife."
hellquill.223.a:0 "Perhaps this will get some to stop smoking?"

hellquill.224.t:0 "Sturm Zigaretten Fraud"
hellquill.224.d:0 "The SZ cigarette brand has been back in the conversation in Hellquill lately. Several clerks in our administration had begun to complain about the opacity of the company's accounts and alleged tax evasion. It has become clear that many members of the Sturmgreife have been misusing the company's royalties for their own personal gain. Members of the SG have grumbled about the rumours and several fights have erupted. Yet, they seem to be remaining loyal to their leadership.\n\nSeveral members of the Council and knights have called for regulations to put an end to this circus show. However, Edler von Wingenberg has blocked all attempts at reforms by leveraging his formidable influence in the Order. So far, the Grandmaster has refused to challenge him on this and has delegated the matter to others in the hierarchy."

hellquill.225.t:0 "Sturm Zigaretten Bankruptcy"
hellquill.225.d:0 "Today, the Sturm Zigaretten company has filed for bankruptcy, bringing a final blow to civilian allies of the Sturmgreife. Few were surprised at the announcement. The SZ cigarettes were known to be a poor product and without the constant bullying and pressure from the members of the Sturmgreife, many stores were quick to ditch them in favor of more popular brands.\n\nBeyond the value of the product itself, the fall of many members and shareholders of the company had caused chaos in the organization of the company. The disappearance of Edler von Wingenberg who had pushed the product was the final blow to the company."
hellquill.225.a:0 "The farce is over."

hellquill.226.t:0 "The Zeltstadtquell"
hellquill.226.d:0 "During the weeks that followed the integration of Longsword, Edler von Wingenberg acquired several patches of lands in the region of Panacea. Some thought that he planned to add them to his family's estates if not for the strange coming and going of drilling equipments. Eventually, he had legislation drafted to allow for the privatization of spring water.\n\nToday, he has announced that he was launching a new private company - a mineral water company - inspired by the "success" of the Sturm Zigaretten company in bringing "healthy and quality products to the griffons of Hellquill". his supporters are already claiming that the "Zelstadtquell" has medicinal properties, making it capable of curing many ailments through regular consumption. Some believe that he aims to eventually create a monopoly on mineral water in Hellquill."
hellquill.226.a:0 "First cigarettes, now mineral water... What's next?"

hellquill.227.t:0 "The Katerinian Idiot"
hellquill.227.d:0 "Both the Beakstadt Conference and Stackleberg's coup attempt have caused tensions among the Hellquillian leadership to rise to a new high. Edler von Wingenberg has not forgiven his knightly and Wehrmacht counterparts for undermining his and the Sturmgreife's position on the Grand Crusade. More so, he has felt slighted and while some had hoped for his anger to blow over, it did anything but that.\n\nEarlier this week however, Edler has gone a step further. He wrote an opinion piece on the Sturmgreife's internal publication. In it, he ranted about the cowardice of Hellquillian generals that he felt were being influenced by foreign influence or traitors. He declared that his SG would not tolerate the Hellquillian Destiny going to sleep or being betrayed at the half-way stage by non-combatants. "Whether it suits them or not, we will continue our fight. With them, if they finally grasp what it is all about. Without them, if they don't want it. And against them, if need be."\n\nFaced with the prospect of the numerous and powerful Sturmgreife rebelling, the Führer Wingfried von Katerinburg, Demetrius Kamphaus, Eisen Silberkrone and Edler von Wingenberg met to ease tensions. An agreement was found that another strategic conference would be held and that the SG would be furthered integrated into the Wehrmacht with the understanding that SG soldiers would be put under non-SG command.\n\nDespite this, there are now rumours circulating at Hellquill Castle that Edler boasted about having no intentions of keeping the agreement, began to refer to the Führer as "the Katerinian Idiot" and no different from his deranged cousin."
hellquill.227.a:0 "Come again?"

hellquill.228.t:0 "The Longsword Settlement Scandal"
hellquill.228.d:0 "After Longsword had been integrated into our nation, a committee was setup to oversee the use, sale or settlement of plundered or seized land in the county. Most of the land would be settled by settlers and veterans and the money of the sold land would be dedicated to helping them, a demand mostly put forward by Carl von Soldau and Demetrius Kamphaus.\n\nUnfortunately, reports about the committee are stacking up and painting a bleak picture of its work. Several members, mostly Sturmgreife members, have used the committee to sell or give away lands on the cheap to friends and allies with money being funneled towards the SG's private coffers. It has also been noticed that several industrialists and wealthy families such as the Guttenfried have bribed the committee to gain access to several strategic lands. Overall, it seems that the other members of the committee decided against reporting the corruption and embezzlement and rather began a bidding war against the other members.\n\nNone of those reports have been seen by lower ranking officers or civilians so far but there are already rumours circulating about it. The underground KpH has already begun using it for propaganda."

hellquill.229.t:0 "The Conspiracy of Fools"
hellquill.229.d:0 "In the aftermath of Edler von Wingenberg's demise, the institution that was the Ogledd Society found itself without its main and arguably sole benefactor. Few were willing to take up the mantle left by Edler as the society had become an increasing embarrassment to many in the reformisten movement. The Society's teachings were charmingly ridiculous at best and pathetic at worst. Not only that but it alienated support for Wingfried von Katerinburg's rule within the clergy, the surviving old guard and the scientific community. The nail in the coffin was of course the fact that not only the Society had been useless, Edler's ravings were costly and had caused a whole coterie of cranks and charlatans to flock to Hellquill's seat of power.\n\nNow, the Society's libraries could be put to the torch to the delight of many who had been forced to attend Edler's "seances" and this whole nonsense put behind them. Hopefully, its memory would only live on in the minds of the kind of lesser fools."

hellquill.230.d:0 "It has emerged from our interrogations that treacherous ponies in Hellquill have been received a new and worrying help: the dogs of the Bund der Freien Hunde.\n\nIt was clear since the nomination of Wingfried von Katerinburg as new Grandmaster that the members of the Bund have had little love for the new direction that the Order had undertaken. However, few had anticipated such a radical transformation.\n\nOur intel shows that several members have used the Bund's resources to help ponies and partisans to flee Hellquill and get to the Riverlands. Interrogated members have denied any active participation of the Bund but it is clear that they have had at least a tacit support from the Bund's board.\n\nAs such, it has been decided that the Bund as a legal organization in Hellquill was to be disbanded immediately and any affiliate be put under investigation and preventive arrest. Unfortunately, reports have shown that some of the members had already bolted to the underground and joined forces with Fischer's underground KpH."

The group who had for so long helped slaves flee our kingdom has recently turned to helping ponies to flee Hellquill and Longsword to the Riverlands. This change in their activities was the final drop in the bucket for the Order.\n\nWhile we could hardly gloat about it without angering our pony neighbours, it certainly means much less problems for us in the years to come."

hellquill.232.t:0 "The Bund Der Freien Hunde Is Disbanded"
hellquill.232.d:0 "A most tragic news has arrived from Hellquill. The Freihehunde Bund has been forced to disband their branches in the frontier. The Reformisten government in Hellquill is claiming that the organization had been helping ponies - terrorist elements among them - to flee the country. Our contacts in the Bund do not deny that such elements have been occurring but have called their action a moral duty in the face of genocide. They could not stand idle while creatures were being slaughtered just for existing, they argued.\n\nSeveral of our countrydogs have fled Hellquill but many more have been apprehended by the Black Cloaks. Should we even be able to convince Hellquill to stop with this nonsense, it will be years before we can restore one of the only venues of freedom for the slaves in Diamond Mountain."

hellquill.233.d:0 "Today, we have seen several new groups of refugees arriving from Hellquill. However, for once, they did not come alone but instead were lead by Diamond Dogs. They surrendered themselves peacefully to our border patrol. They explained that they belonged to the Bund der Freien Hunde, a Bronzehillian organization active in Hellquill. The organization used to help slaves escape the terrible conditions in Diamond Mountain. However, after the radical change in government in Hellquill and their genocidal plans, the group began to help ponies cross the borders to the Riverlands where they would be safe.\n\nWhile there would surely have been debates about how to deal with such an organization, the Order of Hellquill has answered it for us by disbanding it on their soil. It will be the last group of pony refugees lead by those righteous dogs."

In addition to subversive activities from ponies, the KpH and the grumbling old guard, we have uncovered proof of the birth of a new criminal organisation. The group is composed of members of the Order of Hellquill or the Wehrmacht who have been forced out or have deserted. They call themselves the "Kreditor", considering that Hellquill is indebted to them and that they, as creditors, will take what is theirs by force.\n\nOur security forces have already attributed several assassinations, sabotage, attacks and thefts to them. With military-grade equipment and their experience, they will most likely be a menace."

hellquill.235.d:0 "Terrible news has come from Soldau! The Kreditor gang has struck once again and this time, they made it count. They have attacked the allgemeine Wechselbank and emptied its vault. The ease with which they have orchestrated the heist shows that they've had help from the inside. Despite our garrison showing up in armored vehicles, they have managed to escape and kill many of our guards. The local garrison commander has already handed his resignation in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe bank, an old institution in Hellquill, serves as the main financial institution for merchants trading between Hellquill, the Principality of Katerin and the Griffonian Empire but it is also one of the major financial pillar of our Order. It is through it that the Order pays all its military procurement in the West."

It seems now that several of Stackelberg's traditionalist allies were helping the Kreditor gang from the inside.\n\nOver time, the Geheimdienst began to better understand the gang's modus operandi and had successfully thwarted their plans in several occasions. Several members were captured and through rough interrogations, blackmail and infiltration, the gang's headquarters was finally found. Located in an abandoned and overgrown fortress in the forest of the Lone Domain, it was perfectly located to strike in the river cities and fall back.\n\n[HLQ.GetLeader] personally ordered a major strike on the compound, authorizing use of all of our most modern equipment. The attack opened with a nightly artillery strike that went until dawn when the infantry was ordered to storm what remained of the fortress.

As such, they have offered a deal. They would cease their criminal activities and give up their weapons in exchange for a pardon, reintegration into the Order for those who had been expelled from it and a pension for their members who had been robbed of it by the Katerinian.\n\nWilhelm Stackelberg who had not been informed before he took power and several other members of the Inner Circle were angered by the news and many are calling the offer dishonourable and inacceptable."

hellquill.238.d:0 "Administrative work under the rule of Edler von Wingenberg has proven to be a difficult matter. Before the change of leadership, most of the work had been directed by members of the knights of Hellquill sympathetic to Wingfried's ideology and by able figures like Demetrius Kamphaus. However, Edler has seen fit to surround himself with loyalists and members of his occultist social circles who mostly try to vie for his favour. Meanwhile, the Führer himself has proven himself to be even more erratic than his predecessor.\n\nNow, members of the administration and lower level officials have done their best to prevent most delicate matters from reaching his desk and to pursue policies that are likely to sooth the Führer's mind and ego. Considering that many around Edler are more than willing to issue blame to their underlings should something provoke the Führer's ire, there is an even greater incentive to prevent any incident. Worse, even in lower level of the administration, many were quick to make contingency plans to shift blame should they ever get at risk, causing widespread distrust, sabotage or even outright paranoia. As a result, many of our public servants have been under a great deal of stress."

hellquill.239.t:0 "The Ogledd Society"
hellquill.239.d:0 "The Sturmgreife have since their inception been a curious bunch even among the reformisten. Their members, often misfits and fringe ideologues, cultivated many stranger ideas that, while influencing those of prominent figures like Wingfried von Katerinburg, remained on the fringe. Edler von Wingenberg, leader of the Sturmgreife, is no stranger to these eccentricities. To those who knew him, it was no surprise that when he integrated the Inner Circle of the Order of Hellquill, he sought to spread his ideas and invite several members to meetings of one of his societies: the Ogledd Society.\n\nThe Ogledd Society's belief is that Griffons were not always resident of this world but instead used to live in a utopic plane of existence named Ogledd. Griffons lived among the gods and had magic abilities, far greater than any of those known in this world. However, Ponies and especially unicorns and alicorns infiltrated this world, taking advantage of the Griffons' generosity and in time expelled them from it. Some theories posit that Celestia and Luna, the two princesses of Equestria personally participated in that crime. Robbed of their world, their magic and even their memories of that perfect time, Griffons were forced down to this world where they are oppressed and, once again, robbed by lesser creatures. Members of the Ogledd Society believe that only through the complete and utter destruction of Ponies worldwide, they will be able to ascend back to the world of Ogledd to reclaim their birthright.\n\nThe Ogledd Society still remains a marginal group within the Sturmgreife and the reformisten movement at large. However, since the ideal of "ascending back to Ogledd" isn't really antithetic to Wingfried von Katerinburg's desire for a greater living space for the Griffons, most leave Edler and his esoteric followers be."

hellquill.240.d:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg, Demetrius Kamphaus, Carl von Soldau, Wilhelm Stackelberg and a few others made their way down the dark staircase until they finally emerged in a large room decorated with strange decoration. It was mixture of old Rumarean runes, Old Believer iconography and, oddly enough, decoration that Demetrius remembered to have seen in a book about the Riverlands. At the center of it was Edler von Wingenberg dressed in peculiar red and white robes. He welcomed them with an air of solemnity and invited them to sit on the floor. Demetrius and Carl exchanged concerned looks while Wilhelm glared at the Riverlander imagery.\n\n"Welcome my friends. Welcome to this place of rest and reflection. Treat it as a home for your minds and a place of healing for your bodies. This chamber has been built using only the purest tektite stones. As such, we are isolated from the evils of magic and may recollect in the glory of the griffon mind, virgin as it was in the lost times of Ogledd. Sister Hildegarde? Please begin your song for our guests."\n\nVisibly happy, Edler ceded the center of the room to a female griff and went to sit next to Grandmaster Wingfried. The Griff began to chant in a strangely repetitive fashion to which Edler nodded in rhythm, followed after a moment by Wingfried.\n\nDemetrius sighed deeply and turned to Carl, who he noticed was sipping discreetly from a flask. He stopped when he saw that Demetrius had noticed. The veteran grabbed the flask and took a sip himself. He tried to pass it to Wilhelm but the knight didn't pay attention to him. He was staring at the chantress in an expression that Demetrius could best describe as somewhere between agony and eating a rotten lemon. He took a deep breath and drank another sip before handing back the flask to Carl. it was going to be a long evening."

Doctor Wilhelm Grafschaft welcomed him with the utmost respect. He had been recommended to him by Eisen Silberkrone who had assured him that the good doctor was one of the most promising members of the Ogledd Society. So Edler decided to trust him and hear Grafschaft out.\n\n"You see, the tektite used in the Chamber of the Stone and Mind was indeed a great discovery but it is limited by the bounds of nature. As a scientist, I believe in pushing such boundaries and harvest the quintessential powers that lies in the physical realm. And I believe to have made a breakthrough. By refining the chemical elements of the tektite and shaping them into this egg-form chamber, all forms of pony magic can be suppressed. To provide an additional layer of isolation, I have added a water solution to nearly fully submerge the user. Hence the bathing suit. But enough theory, you must try it for yourself. Please!"\n\nGrafschaft invited Edler to enter the egg-shaped chamber. Edler was skeptical but still, he descended in the water and lied on his back and wings as the good doctor closed the egg over him. Suddenly, absolute silence. The only things Edler could hear was the gentle ripple of the water and himself. He closed his eyes.\n\nThe doctor sat with the SG officials for around twenty minutes. Grafschaft looked nervous but finally, a knock came from inside the egg. He rushed to open the connexion chamber from which jumped a shivering Edler. He grabbed him, wetting his lab coat.\n\n"Doctor!

He only gave a quick explanation that he had built on his connexion chamber and urged his leader to enter the box where a chair had been placed. Trusting the good doctor, Edler indulged him. As he entered, he noticed that layers of what seemed to be sheets of metal and other materials had been added inside the wooden box. He sat as Grafschaft closed the box, plunging him in the dark. Edler felt a bit strange and confused. He didn't really understand what improvement there was to the connexion chamber, except perhaps for no longer needing to put on a bathing suit.\n\n"I don't feel anything."\n\nGrafschaft suddenly shouted out of enthusiasm: "Precisely! You are now free of Pony Magic! And out of that nothingness, everything may emerge! As you begin to free yourself from the polluted world, you shall begin to feel a happiness. It is from that harvested happiness, that gift of Eyr that you will begin to manifest new abilities, aided by the resonance of this accumulator! In truth, the power was lying within us this whole time! It only needed some help!"\n\nGrafschaft opened the door of the box, letting Edler emerge. He felt happy like never before, like a whole new world had been revealed to him. Truly, the good doctor would have a place to his side in the history books!\n\n"It is of course, Still in its infancy. My humble research can only begin to draw a path to recovering the energy that was once ours. It is no surprise after millenia of such capacities being stunted by magic. But I shouldn't use such a vile term."\n\n"What do you call this, then?" asked Edler."
hellquill.242.a:0 "Eyronic energy!"

hellquill.243.t:0 "Creation Of The Ahnenerbe"
hellquill.243.d:0 "A new decree has been signed today ordering the creation of the Ahnenerbe. This new archaeological institution has been personally designed by Führer Edler von Wingenberg and his closest followers. Its goal is to search for, acquire and study archaeological artefacts around the world in order to prove the existence of Ogledd to skeptics, the true achievements of the Griffon species and demonstrate its inherent superiority. A particular aspect of the institute's role is to debunk all theories regarding Pony achievements such as the princesses' power over the Sun and Moon or the innate magic of unicorns. It will also be tasked with exposing alterations made on historical sites by other species and regimes and rectify them to restore the stolen history of the Griffons.\n\nTo better incentivise historians and archaeologists into joining the institution, funding for the department of history and archaeology at the university of Hellquill has been reduced."
hellquill.243.a:0 "We shall uncover many historical treasures!"

hellquill.244.t:0 "The Yellow Room Meeting"
hellquill.244.d:0 "Wingfried had gathered his military staff and closest advisors in Castle Hellquill's most prestigious room: the yellow room, named after its golden leaf ceiling. Yet the choice of room didn't prove auspicious. Demetrius Kamphaus was rounding up his review of the military and the old veteran had distinguished himself by his defeatism.\n\n"In conclusion, if we take into account the state of our military forces and equipment, our military industrial production and conscriptable population and compare it to our enemies, we are incapable of carrying out a successful military campaign eastwards. By my estimates, even a successful offensive would be decisively stopped at Buckthorn at best."\n\nThe accusations immediately flared. Eisen Silberkrone and Alina Hochmeister immediately labelled Kamphaus a traitor for implying defeat and a Pony-lover. Carl von Soldau took Kamphaus' defence with less than flattering language, which in turn angered Wilhelm Stackelberg who complained of such disorderly conduct. Wingfried didn't intervene. Competition was never a bad thing and he would let them sort this out until he could identify a convincing winner.\n\nKamphaus eventually knocked on the table, stating that "I simply cannot revolutionize mathematics to make the River Coalition's population and guns to be lower than ours."\n\n"You simply lack imagination."\n\nAll eyes turned to Edler von Wingenberg who leaned towards the table.\n\n"The Ponies can do much but they can't fight the fact that they are creatures of flesh and bones that are different than ours. And in the past, their lands had been hit by a disease so deadly that ponykind nearly went extinct in Griffonia while our kind fared as well as nature commanded it. The Purple Plague, they called it."\n\nCarl von Soldau laughed and angrily snapped at Edler: "So that is your great plan? That we just wait for them to sneeze hard enough that they all die?"\n\nEdler glared at him before answering: "Who said anything about waiting?"\n\nSilence fell on the room. Wingfried finally leaned on the table."
hellquill.244.a:0 "Elaborate, my dear Edler."

hellquill.245.t:0 "August's Pension Settlement"
hellquill.245.d:0 "Today, after much negotiation, August von Ortelsberg was finally allowed to leave the Temple of Eyr in Soldau. The fact is that his "retirement" and placement under "protection of the state" during von Katerinburg's tenure had been a way to remove him from the Order without causing the same fuss as what had happened with Urlach ap Cyrod. Thanks to Carl von Soldau's intervention, he had been allowed to live in seclusion in the temple of Eyr in Soldau.\n\nWith Wingfried gone, the government had little interest in suppressing August the way he did. However, some were worried that August's inclination towards reform and democratic ideals could be rekindled and in these trying times, there was little room for the old archivist to find himself a second youth by becoming an agitator. So, it was decided that a negotiation would take place. In exchange for his freedom and a lofty knight's pension, von Ortelsberg would swear off any political activities and sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nAugust, for all his ideals and principles, relented and signed. Carl von Soldau, who oversaw the negotiation reported that the archivist had been exhausted by the experience and there was little chance he would betray the agreement."
hellquill.245.a:0 "Another headache dealt with!"

hellquill.246.t:0 "Solace Of The Bottle"
hellquill.246.d:0 "Demetrius Kamphaus has always been known to enjoy his beer like many knights. However lately, he has been seen much more frequently at beer halls or mess halls drinking alcohol. Accounts from Hellquill's Castle's kitchen also show that he has requested alcohol to his personal office much more frequently and in greater amounts.\n\nWhile his military service remain impeccable, his personal conduct has degraded and several of his known friends have distanced themselves from him. Some who have known him for a long time think that the experience of the reformisten years and the national junta have taken a toll on him. Some more deplorable rumours even posit that he regrets having helped his Majesty [HLQ.GetLeader] ascend to the throne in Hellquill. For the time being, his affliction remains a secret from the public and additional aide-de-camp have been assigned to him to make sure no incident happens."
hellquill.246.a:0 "Most regrettable."

hellquill.247.t:0 "Desertions In The Ranks"
hellquill.247.d:0 "August von Ortelsberg's reforms have proven their success and he had managed to calm down many within the Order of Hellquill whose views didn't align with their more forward-thinking Grandmaster. Indeed, they did accept the idea of a democratic process and even the proclamation of the Republic but to see a Pony rule over Griffons? That for some was too much. Perhaps they did accept the democratic system but only if it had been rigged in their favor.\n\nIn a coordinated move, Urlach ap Cyrod, Wilhelm Stackelberg and several other knights resigned from their post and left the castle of Hellquill after ripping off their military insignia. They were not stopped and quickly embarked on a river boat to leave for the Herzland. According to some rumor, their decision came after they had failed to convince either the new Grandmaster of the Order of Hellquill, Carl von Soldau or August von Ortelsberg to join in on a plot to remove River Breeze from power though this was denied by the Order. Soon after the news, several soldiers deserted from their posts too though many were apprehended before crossing the border or vanishing.\n\nRiver Breeze, with his usual sang-froid, simply commented on the matter that he took note of the knights' resignation and departure and called upon the martial court to exercise its duties towards any deserter."
hellquill.247.a:0 "If we can't trust them in peace, could we have trusted them in war?"

hellquill.248.t:0 "The Knights Protest"
hellquill.248.d:0 "It has emerged that there the fortresses of the Order of Hellquill have been abuzz with all the reforms concerning them. Many knights seem to have felt insulted by the reforms and some seem to fear that their Order will be disbanded and will simply dilutes itself within the Wehrmacht. To these critics, August von Ortelsberg is personally responsible and to some, is even a traitor to his knightly oath. Regulars of the Goldener Flügel Beer Hall, a favorite meeting place of the Order's knights and officers, have testified that they had heard insults towards the president.\n\nIn more troubling news, a graffiti was drawn on the Zinten's memorial saying that "the Black Cloaks still live", causing many to worry about a possible return of the Black Cloak terrorist attacks. The government reacted by increasing security at the memorial and in towns with major Pony presence.\n\nAugust von Ortelsberg has reacted to the news by thanking the knights for their services and promising that the reforms concerning them were now over. He then went on a tour to visit his old fellow knights in all of Hellquill's major fortresses to listen and appease."
hellquill.248.a:0 "They'll calm down."

hellquill.249.t:0 "A New Großkomtur"
hellquill.249.d:0 "With Siegfried Trappenfeld's retirement, the Order of Hellquill now finds itself without a head of military forces. Tradition commands that the Grandmaster takes on such a role. Unfortunately, despite being a knight August von Ortelsberg has little experience of command and his career has been mostly an administrative and scholarly one. This leaves us with no other choice but to appoint Großkomtur to take command. Four names have been selected.\n\nThe first, Urlach ap Cyrod is seen by many as the spiritual son of former Grandmaster Trappenfeld and a paragon of knightly values. As such, he would be a good fit for the role but he was also August's rival in the nomination for leading the Order. He might prove to be fickle but most knights in the Inner Circle see him as deserving a consolation prize.\n\nThe second, Demetrius Kamphaus is a well-respected veteran with a strong record. Few could openly question his nomination. He is a safe choice though he has shown only tepid support for our reforms.\n\nThe third, Carl von Soldau is perhaps an unorthodox choice as he is still quite young and doesn't have the same record as either Demetrius or Urlach. However, he is very popular, especially among communities of settlers who have many concerns about our reforms.\n\nLastly, Trudy Oettinger. This Bronzehillian-born officer is the only choice who hasn't been knighted and many griffons would chafe at the idea of serving under a Diamond Dog. However, it would go a long to show the minorities of Hellquill that we intend things to change."
hellquill.249.a:0 "Urlach ap Cyrod is the rightful choice."
hellquill.249.b:0 "Demetrius Kamphaus is the griff for the job."
hellquill.249.c:0 "Carl von Soldau will make things interesting!"

hellquill.250.t:0 "Change Of Leadership"
hellquill.250.d:0 "Due to the recent political changes, the Wehrmacht now finds itself deprived of appropriate leadership. This is unfortunately the cost of upsetting the norms of Hellquill without bloodshed.\n\nAfter some consultations with the Inner Circle of the Order of Hellquill, it appears that freedom of choice has been taken from us. Since August von Ortelsberg nomination as Grandmaster, most of the military staff has coalesced around Demetrius Kamphaus. The griff, a veteran of the Diamond War, has long prefered to distance himself from politics, a fact which has made him increasingly popular among officers. With their choice clear, we have no option but to give command to Kamphaus."
hellquill.250.a:0 "Let's hope he is as apolitical as is said."

hellquill.251.d:0 "Taredan was awoken in the middle of the night by frantic aides.\n\n"Quick! Hellquill has crossed the border! They are moving against us!"\n\nTaredan couldn't help but think that it was some kind of prank. The negotiations with Hellquill had ended on a perfectly diplomatic note. What was that all about?\n\nBut it was no joke. Hellquill had went to war over a diplomatic dispute and there was little to do now but to go and fight. Yet, Taredan was not desperate. They had fought off the tyrans of old who claimed to care about the peasantry and the Hellquillians were no different. They were just wearing a red attire while doing it."

hellquill.252.d:0 "As he walked with his unit in the occupied city of Talvona, Ludwig von Pliater watched the familiar streets. He came there often during his younger days. The place had changed of course. Many shops and buildings had changed but most of it was still as he remembered it. Only with less bullet holes.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a window opening and somegriff screaming.\n\n"Down with the Blood Knight!"\n\nHe was hit in the face by something. His comrades immediately opened fire on the building. They readied themselves for an ambush but nothing came. The projectile had only been a tomato. Ludwig was not hurt but he remained frozen, contemplating the scene. He couldn't stop but thinking. What was he doing there? He was home, crushing rebellious peasants as a knight. So much for the revolutionary hero."
hellquill.252.a:0 "What have I done?"

hellquill.253.d:0 "Starry Night hailed Ernst Fischer in the hallways of Castle Hellquill. That griff wasn't going. He turned and smirked, always ever the charmer but she wasn't in the mood. At all.\n\n"Good day comrade Night! How mighty fine you look today!"\n\n"You went around me. And others. For what?"\n\n"Are you talking about the bandits? "\n\n"I'm talking about the southern partisans, yes."\n\nFischer tried to dismiss her concerns and clawhaved it.\n\n"Taredan was more of an opportunistic bandit than a real socialist leader and you know it. He would have weakened the federation and jeopardized our place in the world. It was for the best. In time, you and the Lushians will learn to understand why it mattered to oust him."\n\nStarry Night took a long drag from her cigarette before looking at Ernst.\n\n"You're so very Hellquillian, aren't you?""

During his service, Siegfried has seen many battles in his lifetime, and is respected by all for his unwavering dedication, boldness and being the model of a gallant knight. He distinguished himself by bravely leading the sack of Diamond Mountain in 973. For this, he was nominated as Grandmaster of his Order in 976.\n\nUnfortunately, he was robbed of the opportunity of leading the knights in a golden age. Faced with the collapse of the Griffonian Empire and revolution in 978, he chose not to renew the oath binding the Order to the Imperial Power. While he vowed to forever protect the West from the threat of the Riverlands menace, he would forever be remembered as a turncoat.\n\nHe did achieve success in maintaining the Griffonian Frontier intact but was unsuccessful in building a modern nation. Despite this poor state of affairs and the growing extremist movements in Hellquill and neighbouring Longsword, Siegfried Trappenfeld remains a living proof that the knightly ways will endure and so will Hellquill as a bulwark to protect the griffon way of life.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
griffon_hitler_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of December 961 in Katerinburg\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite being a member of a minor branch of the Von Katerinburg house, Wingfried was born and raised in great wealth. Fascinated by knightly tales of old, he wished from a young age to become a knight himself. However, he was unwelcome in the order of the Argentumdämmerung due to dynastic rivalries and uninterested in the more civilian minded Silberkralle. So, he journeyed to the east, to the Frontier where heroism was welcomed and boldness more favored than in the rigid Katerin. Or so the official story says. Rumours from Katerin tell a different story, that of a troubled griff, weak willed and cursed with erratic behaviour not unlike princess Diellza. An embarrassment to his family, he was sent away to the Frontier not for glory but for damage control.\n\nIn Hellquill, Wingfried was given special privileges due to his noble birth and spent more time in the knightly seats of power than in the field. However, what he didn't achieve in military honour, he made up with influence. Nogriff quite knows what lead him to develop his burning hatred of Ponies but he became an ardent member of the pro-war faction of the knights. Frustrated with the inertia and pushback regarding his increasingly extreme ideas, he began to form a new political movement, akin to a political party as they exist in the West. Thus was born the Reformisten, dedicated to nothing but absolute victory over the dreaded ponies. He found great success in neighbouring Longsword where he caught the attention of Count Pallas Dusktalon. And now that Wingfried has convinced the Inner Circle, he stands ready to rejuvenate Hellquill, bring war to the East and to achieve victory, whatever the cost.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Duke Von Kessel"

As a young fledgling, he showed a certain attraction towards intellectual pursuit but was still encouraged to follow the knight's life rather an academic career.\n\nAs a member of the Order, August served dutifully but never showed any interest in command. Instead, his impeccable bookkeeping and detailed reports lead him to join the administrative side of the Order. Finally in 992, after the death of the Knight Archivist, August petitioned the Grandmaster for the position which admittedly, few knights cared for and many saw as an undignified position. The Grandmaster agreed, causing August to becoming the youngest knight to ever occupy the position and also the youngest knight to be elevated by right to the Inner Circle of the Order.\n\nAs head archivist, August von Ortelsberg had spent many hours documenting and researching the Order's history. He has repeatedly reached the conclusion that the conflict between ponies and griffons is immensely destructive and has achieved nothing positive for anygriff or pony. His continuous pleas to the Grandmaster fell on deaf ears, and when the latter stepped down, August's exasperation only grew, comprehending that his attempts to foster peace would never be realised.\n\nIn the end, August prevailed over the traditionalist Urlach and the extremist Wingfried and is now poised to reconcile the Order of Hellquill with modernity and extend a claw towards the ponies.

However, many in his entourage advised him to go and seek his fortune in the Griffonian Frontier where more opportunities were available. After briefly considering joining the Order of Opinicus, he finally settled for the Knightly Order of Hellquill.\n\nAs a squire in Hellquill, Urlach was taken under the wing of Grandmaster Siegfried von Trappenfeld who found in young Urlach a kindred spirit. Under his service, Urlach served well and quickly rose through the rank until finally joining the Inner Circle of the knights in 998.\n\nA paragon of traditional values, Urlach has watched with unease as Hellquill was polluted by foreign ideologies and the political upheaval that came with modernity. He came to blows with the rising reformisten, especially upon witnessing their nefarious influence in Longsword and finding his friend Wilhelm Stackelberg swayed by their lies.

Instead, they've adopted large parts of the griffon culture, with River Breeze's father becoming a priest of Arcturius.\n\nAs a privileged posniak, River Breeze was lucky enough to have opportunities for better education which he pursued, becoming a lawyer. However, despite his faith and acceptance of the new order, the pony became sensible to the woes of his brethrens throughout the land. Believing in the power of law and incremental changes, he sued the Order and civilian administration of Hellquill multiple times to uphold what few rights his fellow ponies enjoyed. Through his civil rights actions, he became a fixture of the Hellquillian pony community, posniak or native.\n\nSome say that despite his respectability, the pony still maintains ties with more radical or unsavory organizations such as the partisans in Longsword or pony mobsters in Hellquill proper. Yet, River Breeze has eventually convinced the conservative voters of Hellquill to trust him in bringing peace and stability to the troubled Frontier.

Not content with this, he build a media empire, though one dedicated to his own glory according to his slandering critics.\n\nEventually, Reiner prevailed in the election and is well-determined to bring change to Hellquill, though one of economic liberalism and decisive executive action rather than the more parliamentary or welfare-minded ideas of his adversaries.

And yet, here came Carl.\n\nCarl's road to power was a difficult one, one that saw the unification of the old partisans of knightly rule and the settlers community who for so long had been excluded from power in a state virtually made for their benefit. Though, he does not rule supreme and his coalition in parliament will prevent him from simply ruling by decree.\n\nThough for all his charisma and reassuring speeches, Carl's victory has spread fear in Hellquill. Fear that democracy may end up being a passing fad or that the ghost of reformisten ideology may not be entirely gone, even with the disappearance of its leader. Will Carl save the Republic or doom it? The only griffon with the answer is the one smiling.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vexili"
general_soldau_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of September 969 in Soldau\n\n§YRank§!:Generalmajor\n\n§YBiography§!: Carl von Soldau was born in one of the settlers communities around Soldau. However, the life of a farmer was not one for him and he eventually decided to join the army. His family was able to gain him a place at the officer school in Hellquill from which Carl graduated with honors though not without gaining the reputation of a philanderer.\n\nHe joined the artillery corps of the Order's regular army and eventually met with Demetrius Kamphaus who he would become good friends with despite their vast differences in character. Despite his morally dubious private life, he served with distinctions and never openly transgressed the rules of conduct, something some attributed to his budding friendship with the professional Kamphaus. This allowed him to rise through the ranks rather quickly.\n\nFinally, in 1006, he was promoted to the Inner Circle though some more senior knights believe his promotion to be more political in nature, as a way of disproving those who complained that the Order's Inner Circle was too beholden to the Griffonian nobility.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vexili"
griffon_himmler_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of December 974 in Wingenberg\n\n§YRank§!:Oberleiter\n\n§YBiography§!: Edler von Wingenberg's early life was a sheltered one among the Wingenberg nobility and little is known about him. Rumours abound, though rarely in his presence. As a young adult, he tried to enter the Order of Hellquill but his eccentric behaviour and somewhat poor health made the recruiting officers rebuff him. Thanks to his father's help, he was eventually placed in a knightly cohort. He served from 992 to 995, mostly on the northeastern border. Despite writing boisterous letters, he was allegedly a disastrously bad soldier. Reckless and accusing his own officers of cowardice, he frequently endangered his unit on routine operations against the Diamond Dogs and Firtree Ponies. He also got into fights with Bronzehillian operatives and volunteers. Eventually, he was sent home.\n\nAs a civilian, Edler became a harsh critic of Grandmaster Trappenfeld and the knights and joined private circles such as the Ogledd Society. He enjoyed an idle life until he met Wingfried von Katerinburg during a ball at Hellquill. He was impressed by the Katerinian's ideas and quickly joined his emerging reformisten movement. An advocate of aggressive action, he was a founding member of the paramilitary Sturmgreife which he eventually lead.\n\nAs the head of the Sturmgreife, Edler organized several actions against the Posniaks both openly and secretly. He also made several trip to Longsword, helping Count Pallas Dusktalon to shape his own "Black Cloaks". Now a member of the armed forces once again, Edler is determined to bring eternal glory and salvation to his besieged homeland.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Vexili"

Only traitors and fools would call it a coup or treason. Under the wavering leadership of Wingfried von Katerinburg - of notable Katerinian degeneracy - Hellquill could have done naught but fail and collapse. And who better than Edler to prevent it? Was he not the griffon who had given the reformisten movement strength by founding and leading the proud Sturmgreife?\n\nBy taking power, Edler has proven a simple truth of the universe. Despite ever present challenges and obstacles, griffon superiority shall find its way to succeed and claim what is theirs by right.

fat_junta_boi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: "Late October" 958 in the Strawberry Duchy\n\n§YBiography§!: Demetrius Kamphaus's parentage is considered shrouded in mystery, as is his actual birthdate. This is not due to some grand conspiracy, but rather due to the fact he was born to a maid working in the estate of a high-ranking noble, a noble that shared a lot of features with the newly born Demetrius. Naturally, such an upstanding gentlegriff wouldn't possibly paw the servants, and Demetrius grew up with only his mother. It was deemed for the best that the boy be sent away after his mother's death, and the Order of Hellquill received a sizeable donation for taking him on and asking no questions. Demetrius could tell that he was not wanted back home and has ever since treated the order as the only family he has.\n\nWhile not the order's most brilliant strategist or inspiring commander, he has built a rock solid reputation for himself rational, driven and stable (with many a comedic savant remarking on his corpulence whenever the last term comes up). Even during his youth, when he was part of the raid on Diamond Mountain, he held his ground even as the dogs attempted to use fire to drive back the knights. This gave him both his distinctive scars and his knighthood. Ever since, his grim determination along with his disinterest in factionalism or scheming is what has made him rise as high as he has. Kamphaus prides himself on getting things done, reasoning that others can have the glory because he will settle for success and a good meal at his favorite restaurant.\n\nYet, even the most measured soul can be driven to drastic action, and as the Sturmgreifen's influence reached the point where they may well usurp the entire order, Kamphaus did the unthinkable; assassinating Wingfried and framing the Sturmgreifen for it. He may be a traitor, history will tell, but Kamphaus gets things done, and he refused to let his home be taken over by lunatics."

The Prince knows that Lushi has the potential to modernise in the shortest terms and catch up to the rest of Griffonia. He has elected to pursue peaceful foreign policy and to focus primarily on improving the quality of life of the citizens. Many believe that Prince Elias is the leader Lushi needed long ago.\n\nFortunes would lead to Elias accepting the Kamphaus Junta's offer to accept the integration of Hellquill in a dual monarchy. He feels confident that the makeshift confederacy can find a golden mean and bring back peace to the wartorn lands of the frontier."

Inspired by the writings of notorious Wingbardian fascist Beakolini, he aims to create a corporate nationalist state, rooted in religion and military. He dreams of getting rid of the monarchy and proclaiming himself the Leader of the nation.\n\nGerar was quick to seize the offer to adding Hellquill to his crown, crushing any idea of a popular uprising once the Reformisten extremists were dealt with. With the combined resources and army of Hellquill-Lushi, Gerar seeks to expand his ambitions tenfold."

He was by all account a poor student, pestering his parents to let him join the army early on. Eventually, at 16, they relented and he became a private serving the knightly order of Hellquill.\n\nFor all his motivation to fight, Ernst Fischer proved to be an undisciplined soldier, frequently getting involved in brawls, kirsch-soaked nights and other petty mischief. Yet, he was a master at arms and gained a bit of a reputation for his tactical ingeniosity. What changed was meeting a soldier who had left the Empire to live in the Frontier and revealed to him that he was a communist, loyal to the Skynavian party. The griffon was found out and shot rather quickly but Ernst had been sold. He would be a communist. He sought out, joined and took over the Communist Party of Hellquill, barely a small cell of idealistic students back then. Eventually, he defected in 1004 and travelled the world, visiting Skynavia, Stalliongrad and even the Riverlands. His travels allowed him to establish contacts which have him an authority and support that other Hellquillian revolutionaries could only dream off.\n\nFinally, in 1007, alarmed by the news of the slaughter in Longsword, he finally put an end to his journey and came back running to his beloved KpH in Hellquill. When he arrived, meeting his comrades in a cellar of the capital, he told me "I am here for one and only one thing, comrades: revolution". The rest is the inevitable march of history.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
bat_tito_returns_desc:0 "Foal of a locksmith and a farmer, Starry Night had led a rather monotonous life before assuming the leadership of the Partisans. But when Count Dusktalon's descent into madness started affecting her friends and family, she knew that the only right thing to do is to oppose his cruelty. Years of guerrilla warfare in Visaginas' forests have turned the once plain mare into a fearless leader of ponies and griffons, who promises a bright and free of fear future to anyone who follows. This future is set to become a reality in the new Longsword.\n\nUnfortunately, the dream of a liberated Longsword did not last long. The Reformisten were quick to crush what they perceived as an illegitimate state, leading to Starry and her comrades laying low. But they returned the favour once the Reformisten disintegrated themselves, seizing control of a leaderless state. Starry Night now leads the united communist parties of Hellquill and Longsword as chairpony, where ponies and griffons can live together in harmony."
HLQ_eisen_desc:0 "§gOriginating from Brodfeld, Eisen was born into a peasant family in 971 ALB, on the border near the Gryphian Host. He and his brother, Sycle Coroanargint, would at a young age witness a Cossack raid while on an errand near the countryside. His brother was amazed by the cossacks, and would begin to dedicate most of his free time learning about the military, art of war and politics. What Sycle didn't realise however, was that he had accidentally neglected his younger brother, who became bitter over the lack of attention from his older brother, who he had considered a role model of sorts.\n\n To earns his brother's attention again, he joined the cossacks as a volunteer when he reached the age of 18. Over time he grew attached to the group he was travelling with, and considered them friends he never had before. But in 992 ALB, a raid on Lake City went completely wrong. The Cossacks all died during the attack, and Eisen was scared from a pony sword, his beak cracked from the impact. Suprisingly, the ponies had though him dead while he lay unconscious, and he miraculously survived. The impact of losing the ones he held most dear broke him emotionally, and in this mentally unstable state, he begun the blame the ponies for this misfortune.\n\n Broken and angry, he returned to Brodfeld, only hear that a pony named Applethorn, a communist from Farbook, was helping the revolution in Brodfeld, his own country. Enraged, Eisen headed to inform his brother of what the ponies had done to him and his country, and that they must be punished. Sycle, understanding that the fault lied on the claws of the griffons, not the ponies, ignored his brother's ramblings, once again neglecting his already unstable younger brother. Eisen, betrayed by his own brother, became broken, without a purpose. This changed when he heard of the reformisten in Hellquill, and he begun to march north in search of them. Hearing Wingfried's speeches about "the pony menace" radicalises Eisen, and he would soon join the reformisten, changing his surname to Silberkrone. With this newfound purpose, he became a fanatic for the cause, eventually rising up the ranks of the party, finally to the second of the command of the Sturmgreife.§!"

She enjoyed an above-average upbringing thanks to the good relations between her parents and the local griffon elites and was raised as an Arcturian.\n\nUpon reaching adulthood, she didn't continue the family business, leaving it to her brothers and sisters and instead enrolled as a firefighter, the only public service available to Ponies at the time. Over the years, she tried several time to join the military or the police force but only managed to serve for a few years as a local peacekeeper. Despite her popularity among the local force and her excellent service, she was barred from any promotion and had to go back to firefighting several times due to regulation changes ordered by the Hellquill command.\n\nUnder Grandmaster August's rule, she was one of the very first Ponies to join the Wehrmacht. Her first months as a soldier allowed her to quickly distinguish herself during the Black Cloaks uprising. She quickly rose through the ranks thanks to a combination of good word being put by her former commanding officers from Zinten and special attention to promising Pony recruits order by the Grandmaster. Eventually, she was given a special promotion to serve as a knight and as a commanding officer after the Order of Hellquill's charter reform.

After having followed a religious upbringing, Wilhelm served as a dutiful squire for many years until he was finally knighted in 986.\n\nAs a knight, Stackelberg served dutifully on the eastern frontier and earned his commanding title after brutally exterminating a Riverlander scout party out in the Frontier. He also befriended the Rumarean Urlach ap Cyrod and often acted in tows with him. Both him and Urlach were elevated together to the Inner Circle in 998.\n\nDuring the years following the turn of the millenium, Wilhelm Stackelberg gradually grew tired of the conduct of the Ordensstaat, believing that Trappenfeld's reforms and isolation were a betrayal of their oath to the emperors of the Griffonian Empire. He wished for closer ties with the Empire and to resume their conquest eastwards. And so, he became a regular attendees of meetings of knights organized by Wingfried von Katerinburg.

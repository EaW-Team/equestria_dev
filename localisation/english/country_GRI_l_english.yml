 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the Emperor has decided to embark on a trip across Herzland via train, in order to showcase the new Imperial railway system and, more importantly, to convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the Emperor's doctors let him go.\n\nNobles and commoners alike gathered at Griffenheim's brand new railway station to witness the Emperor's departure. A shining steam locomotive had been prepared, with a dozen ornate cars attached to it, all built by the finest metalworkers and carpenters money could hire. The trip was supposed to be long and last several weeks, so there was enough space and supplies for His Majesty's entire entourage. When Grover V finally arrived on his personal automobile later than expected, the nobles raced to welcome him and showering him with praise about the railway project and how all would now witness the coming of modernity to the Empire. The Emperor nodded wearily, as he always did when receiving empty platitudes from greedy sycophants, and coughed. He slowly walked to the station escorted by heavily armoured Imperial Knights, and was next beset by the commoners who either lauded his project or begged for reforms to give them land and bread instead of expensive trains. When he finally got inside his private railroad car, he asked to not be disturbed, sat down, sighed and took a nap.\n\nThe train whistled, signalling that its journey had begun."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "Back Home"
 imperial.2.d:0 "The railroad trip was a rousing success. The Emperor and his escort had first gone from Griffenheim to Bronzekreuz, where loyal Diamond Dog nobles welcomed him extremely warmly and gave him many gifts. He then travelled to Readewetter where he spoke with Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, his dear cousin and friend, and then across the Griffking river to nearby De Vleugels where he enjoyed a quiet dinner with Duke Gerlach IV of Feathisia. Next his journey took him to Oldwingburg where the local Peasant Council welcomed him, its members offering their own fresh farm produce to show their gratitude for the railroads.\n\nSoon the Emperor arrived in the Free City of Romau, where Archon Erion XII wished to discuss politics with him in private but was refused by the tired Emperor who was not particularly fond of the infamous zealot. A day later he was in Greenback, where local engineers who had worked on the railway project were anxious to know if he had enjoyed the ride so far. When it came time to head to Angriver, the Emperor asked if they could just go home instead, but his servants insisted that they had to complete the whole journey so he would not, gods forbid, insult Baron Leer the Vicious and Princess Diellza the Insane. Grumbling, he slept until the train arrived in Griffing, but struggled to wake up. It was all in vain, it turned out, as the Baron had no interest in meeting him. The visit to Katerinburg was equally swift, so they would all avoid catching a curse or two. Then finally, after many weeks, the trip had ended and the exhausted Emperor returned home.\n\nBut on the following day, he barely got out of bed and complained of pain. Doctors promised to check him as soon as he had held urgent meetings with aristocrats. And so the Emperor met noble after noble, hearing their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until he collapsed without warning. Archon Eros VII who was advising the Emperor quickly came to his aid and accused the nobles of poisoning him. When he realized His Majesty had lost consciousness, the ninety-year old griffon tried to carry him on his own and shouted for aid. The Emperor was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts. The Archon spends day and night sleeplessly praying to the gods."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, ranging from latest scientific medicine to holy anointments by priests, Zebra potions and other exotic magical mystery cures, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the age of 47. His caretakers said his last words were "Boreas, did I do good?"\n\nHis unstable and controversial reign has finally come to an end and all of Herzland is in mourning, with black flags hoisted from Rottendedam to Strathburg and from Yale to Var-Silfur. His funeral procession in Griffenheim was attended by hundreds of thousands of griffons. His closest friend Gabriela Eagleclaw was the only vassal who arrived in time to participate, and was seen wearing a beautiful yet mournful black gown. Archon Eros VII held a fiery sermon where he declared that an age had come to an end, but calmed down and almost broke into tears. Five minutes of silence were observed in the city as Grover V was laid to rest in the Grand Temple of Boreas.\n\nSome would say that Grover V was a pathetic ruler, others would call him kind. Many citizens secretly despised him yet a few pitied him instead. His father Grover IV had intended to personally groom his heir and make him into a mighty warrior, cunning diplomat and expert statesman, but died unexpectedly of a stroke when his only child was only ten years old. So instead Grover V would become a neglected puppet while the nobles ruled the Empire as they pleased, accruing more and more wealth and privileges. The young and sickly Emperor was denied his throne when he turned eighteen and lacked the willpower to demand it, but it later turned out he did not need to do so. The Revolution of 978 brought a bloody end to the regency and the Emperor only survived thanks to Archon Eros' efforts. A counter-revolution led by Duchess Gabriela gave him his rightful powers, but at that point he ruled over a tiny remnant of the once vast Empire, surrounded by vassals who demanded autonomy in return for their contribution to the counter-revolution. The Emperor spent the following tumultuous years trying to learn how to rule, which meant that many of his well-intended projects failed miserably. His last gift to his people and possibly his only accomplishment in life was the brand new Imperial Railway system that connected much of Herzland. He could be called incompetent, or simply most unfortunate.\n\nNow history repeats itself: Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of nobles, merchant princes and temple officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found. We can only pray it doesn't end like the previous regency."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "The Archon Takes the Stand"
 imperial.4.d:0 ""I was such a fool when I let the nobles ruin Grover V's reign. In the name of Boreas, I shall not let it happen again with his son while I still live."\n\nArchon Eros VII's furious steps echoed in the ornate halls of the Imperial palace. Even now, the nobility of the Regency Council was once again gathering in the chambers to pointlessly argue for hours. But this time would be different. Yes, Eros was filled with raw determination. He would not let history repeat itself. As he walked, memories of the past flashed in his mind, images of Griffenheim aflame, of terror in young Grover V's eyes as he led him to safety via a secret passage in the Palace. He closed his eyes and shook his head. "Never again," he muttered.\n\nThe old Archon slammed the door of the Council's Chambers open with impressive force. The nobles and merchants in the room went silent and turned to gaze at him in surprise. Having already gained their attention with his entrance, Eros began to speak, passion and fury in his voice. "Fellow councilgriffs! I think we have wasted enough time bickering and arguing pointlessly. It is time for decisive action! Indolence, greed and indecisiveness brought the Empire closer to ruin than ever. Is it not clear that the concept of a regency council is flawed to the core? In these dire times the Empire needs a strong leader, and because the Emperor is not fit for such a position, someone else must take his place. And I do not propose it to be some noble who only cares for themselves! I say the regent must be a commoner, a person with a powerful enough will to restore stability and order in the Heartlands. This person should also be close to the Gods, so Boreas may grant us prosperity, so Eyr may grant us peace, and so Arcturius may grant us strength to smite our foes and destroy those who oppose the will of the Emperor."\n\nThe Archon looked at each councilgriff with a piercing glare, and locked eyes with Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw of Strawberry, who responded with an equally fierce gaze. "I think we all know who is fit for such a position. Those who disagree may soon discover that the Gods themselves have abandoned them."\n\nThe room remained in staggered silence for a while before the merchants and priests of the council stood up and hailed the Archon. "We are with the Archon, and the Gods are with us!", shouted the Prelate of Kronburg. Soon others joined him and repeated the chant, drowning out any dissent from the nobles such as Gabriela.\n\nEros faintly smiled. The time for justice had finally come."
 imperial.4.a:0 "For the Empire and the Gods!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "The Duchess Takes the Stand"
 imperial.5.d:0 ""Poor Grover. He was too young, too fragile for this cruel world. But with change, comes an opportunity."\n\nThese were Duchess Gabriela's thoughts as she walked down the venerable halls of the Imperial Palace. As much as she personally considered the late Emperor her friend, she knew that he was no proper ruler. The conniving nobles, have abused Grover for too long and she was ashamed to share the same room with them. But that could be dealt with later on. She had a grand vision for the Empire. One that would make Boreas proud of griffons again, and more importantly, give the young heir a proper territory to rule once he is old enough. But first... She must deal with Eros and his thugs. Religious officials are such a nuisance.\n\nWith that, she stepped into the Council's Chambers. The Archon was already there, giving his "sermon" to the gathered nobles.\n\nWhat a bother. She took a seat next to the Count of Bronzehill, tuning out the speech, and discussed the situation in hushed whispers. Gabriela ignored Eros' grandstanding, until he finally decided to remove his old hide from the central podium. With that, she took her chance, strolled down to the centre and addressed the room.\n\n"My fellow nobles and other griffons worthy of respect. The esteemed Archon speaks well of the situation. We must have stability, and we must reassert our authority. But how can we trust the Archonate to provide for our nation?", she ignored the scowls Eros and his lackeys were sending her way, "They talk of war, but do they care for the little griffon? How can we get anywhere before we modernise our beloved Herzland, before we help our people? I implore you all to consider the right choice."\n\nCheers and applause followed... with a loud minority of jeers and claw pointing. It didn't matter. The council will back her claim for regency, and Eros will be marginalised, consigned to the altar where he belongs."
 imperial.5.a:0 "For the Empire and its noble peers!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in Griffenheim following the initial power struggle. Unfortunately we were proven wrong, as today during a council meeting Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, Grand Duke Gerlach and other allies of hers simply left the room, followed by numerous notable nobles from all across Herzland. Hours later, the Duchess announced the formal secession of the Strawberry Duchy and the Grand Duchy of Feathisia from the Empire.\n\nNews are also arriving of Greifenmarschen declaring independence, their Peasant Council outrageously refusing to recognize Archon Eros as the rightful regent of the Empire."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every single one of them!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.14.c:0 "We've got the situation under control."
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.15.d_yale:0 "Now that the Council of Three is firmly established, they have decided to move forward with their plans to unify the Heartlands under the Imperial banner. [Root.GetLeader] has anticipated this and has been lobbying excessively with his superiors to keep [Root.GetNameDef] an independent part of the Empire. Now the moment of truth has arrived, what do we do?"
 imperial.15.a:0 "We will give up our independence."
 imperial.15.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.15.c:0 "We will serve the Empire best as a vassal."
 imperial.16.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.16.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.16.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.16.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.17.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.17.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that [From.GetLeader] and the burghers of Romau have decided to defy us, wishing to retain their status as an autonomous Imperial Free City. They even had the gall to demand this autonomy to be expanded even further! Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic."
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them."
 imperial.19.t:0 "[YAL.GetName] Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] and the scholars of Yaledom, with their heads always in the clouds, have decided to deny our little request. All they wish is to be left alone to pursue their studies in peace. It seems, then, that Yale must re-join the Empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance!"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yale is of no importance to our future plans."
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiant"
 imperial.20.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] and their legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the Empire and restore order and civilization in their backwards marshes."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need that cursed land anyways."
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, [From.GetLeader] and his followers have decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all!"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let them rot in their forest for all I care!"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent griffon breakaway states were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all griffons are united under the Imperial banner once more."
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the eastern vassals and the three Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today, that is.\n\nDuring a regular meeting of the Council, Archons Eros and Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, and later left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Senator of Romau, Rector Magnificus of Yaledom and the Baron of Angriver. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from the Empire. Soon news arrived from Oldwingburg as well, about the local Peasant Council refusing to recognize a noble as the Regent and formally declaring independence. Meanwhile Katerin remains ominously silent, and no one knows what is taking place in those dark marshes..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons and traitors!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the Empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire."
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people!"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying her position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's remaining vassals. She is determined to restore the Empire and her ambitious plans have no place for autonomous self-governing regions. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer, no matter how much we plead with her. The fate of our nation and its independence stands on a knife's edge. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "If you so desire, dear Gabriela."
 imperial.32.b:0 "She has betrayed Feathisia. She has betrayed me."
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that [From.GetLeader] has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. [From.GetLeader] has managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "[From.GetLeader] and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now."
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war."
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back."
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears [From.GetLeader] has gone mad, with not only refusing our request for integration but also insisting on no longer being our vassal. This backstabbing is baffling as the dogs have always been the most loyal servants of the Emperor and his closest allies. Their unusual act of betrayal must have some sinister motive behind it. It seems we can no longer trust the Emperor's best friends."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go..."
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous land to reclaim."
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenmarschen's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The peasants of Greifenmarschen have decided to openly defy us and reasserted their independence after we called for the integration of Imperial vassals. It seems they wish to remain in their blissful, backwards and impoverished anarchy. Surely they are aware of the consequences of this decision?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach these fools a lesson!"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways."
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent breakaway states were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Imperial Literacy Campaigns Begin"
 imperial.40.d:0 "While Grover V did much to improve literacy rates within the Empire, his work was left unfinished by his unfortunate and untimely death. Now that order has been established and a determined regent leads the nation, we can continue where he left off. Literacy campaigns have been initiated and education reformed extensively, with many new teachers hired especially from Yale. Schools are being built across the country and will be available for every griffon regardless of class. While all this is a drain on the coffers, it will ultimately be worth it as an educated populace is a productive populace."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start."
 imperial.41.t:0 "Populace Civilized!"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Now that education has been made compulsory for young griffons, literacy rates are increasing rapidly. Every young citizen has the duty of memorizing the Imperial alphabet and learning to read many classics as well as the holy books. Teachers receive higher wages and their job is becoming increasingly respected, motivating many to study pedagogy. Every city, town and village within the Empire now has a fully staffed school building. All our work and investment is starting to finally bear fruit as a recent survey demonstrates that even the poorest of the poor can read relatively well and write basic sentences. We are on our way to becoming a truly modern nation."
 imperial.41.a:0 "At last."
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an all-time low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over!"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffonian Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor in Griffonstone, the traditional coronation city of the Grovers. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros, the now former Regent, gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner's head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech: "Friends. Brothers and sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffonian Empire from the darkness of this generation. And even still, our foes oppose us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny!""
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in Griffonstone, the traditional coronation city of the Grovers. Following a short speech by the now former Regent Duchess Gabriela where she condemned the nobles of the past who had refused to crown Grover V, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire's future prospects: "Friends... My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!""
 imperial.45.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.55.t:0 "Griffonia Demands Servitude"
 imperial.55.d:0 "The Imperial Regent, perhaps feeling emboldened by his more recent successes has decided to issue us an ultimatum... Serve the Empire or be destroyed. Needless to say this ominous message has caused quite a stir within our entire country, but the question remains: What shall we do?"
 imperial.55.a:0 "Let them come!"
 imperial.55.b:0 "We can't hope to stand against them..."
 imperial.56.t:0 "Skyfall Does not Bend"
 imperial.56.d:0 "Perhaps somewhat predictably the misguided government of Skyfall has decided to not bow down before us. How shall we respond to this act of defiance?"
 imperial.56.a:0 "How amusing, they think they have a choice."
 imperial.56.b:0 "But, I like their whiskey..."
 imperial.57.t:0 "Skyfall Submits"
 imperial.57.d:0 "Unexpectedly the government of Skyfall has decided to submit to our demands, bringing the second largest city in Griffonia back under our control with not a drop of blood spilled."
 imperial.57.a:0 "Install a friendly government, and watch the money pile up."
 imperial.60.t:0 "Of Things That Never Happened"
 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, 'Of Things That Never Happened' by Barys Solartail. It follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate the Wingbardian King, Gumberto. His attempt fails, however, which changes the course of history: The Empire never falls apart, and the Revolution of 978 never takes place. As Griffonia prospers, Ropshin begins to question his republican values and eventually becomes a loyal supporter of the Empire.\n\nWhile the premise of the story is rather simple, the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, and some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."
 imperial.60.a:0 "Ropshin you say? Where have I heard that name before?"
 imperial.61.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.61.d:0 "For a long time now, politicians and military staff within [Root.GetName] have eyed the renewed rise of the Griffonian Empire across the sea with a great deal of dread. Today, their fears have been confirmed, at last. A formal request was sent to [Root.GetLeader] by the Empire, in which is stated that our land was once part of the Imperial realm, and that it still belonged to the Empire nowadays. They demand our immediate submission to the Imperial Crown, and that we return our status back to that of a colony of the Empire. This would effectively undo all our efforts of making ourselves a strong, independent country. However, it is without a doubt that the Empire is a force to be reckoned with, once more. What is our reply?"
 imperial.61.a:0 "No! Never again!"
 imperial.61.b:0 "An Emperor does not bow to another Emperor!"
 imperial.61.c:0 "It's our only option..."
 imperial.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] does not bend!"
 imperial.62.d:0 "The fiendish fools over in [From.GetName] have had the audacity to refuse our rightful reclamation of Colonial soil. Very well. If they do not bend the knee voluntarily, we shall make them bleed until they do."
 imperial.62.a:0 "Have at them!"
 imperial.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] bends!"
 imperial.63.d:0 "Those spineless cowards over in [From.GetName] have finally seen reason, and have agreed to our demand. [From.GetLeader] has already requested an audience with the Regency Council, willing to resubmit to the Empire. Our old colonial possessions finally return to the fold."
 imperial.63.a:0 "A wise Choice!"
 imperial.64.t:0 "Perfect time to strike"
 imperial.64.d:0 "While we and [WNG.GetName] are at war with [GRW.GetName], it is the optimal time for us to declare war on [WNG.GetName] and reclaim the southern coast of Griffonia."
 imperial.64.a:0 "Forwards!"
 imperial.64.b:0 "Yes."
 imperial.64.c:0 "Not now."
 imperial.65.t:0 "The Republican Dream"
 imperial.65.d:0 "A few days ago, one of the most famous modern day authors in the Griffonian Empire, Friedrich Winger, released his newest Book called 'The Republican Dream'. In the book, Winger looks back at the Republican Revolution inside the Griffonian Empire. He makes an effort to not only teach history, but also attempts to show that some of the Republican thoughts were quite progressive for the time, and they could still be a valid and necessary addition to imperial society today. After harsh backlash from public, Winger once again clarified that he supports the Crown, and that he does not affiliate himself with the Republic in any way. The book has so far been a moderate success in the Empire itself, but saw even greater success in other countries such as Aquileia."
 imperial.65.a:0 "A surprisingly interesting read."
 imperial.65.b:0 "A load of potentially dangerous nonsense."
 imperial.66.t:0 "The Imperial Banquet"
 imperial.66.d:0 "The Imperial Banquet is an ancient Griffonian tradition that dates back to the glory days of the Empire. Every ten years, nobles from all corners of the Empire would assemble at the capital of Griffenheim to spend one - sometimes even two - joyful evenings together. This helped strengthen our ties with the many dukes and princes of the Empire, and allowed the Emperor to improve relations with them.\n\nThe next Banquet is scheduled in just a few weeks, but our court is unsure about the exact procedures. Considering our weakened hold over the continent, it is unsure whether we should invite only those nobles still loyal to the Empire, or whether we should extend a claw to all who once were under our banner as a sign of good will."
 imperial.66.a:0 "We don't dine with traitors!"
 imperial.66.b:0 "A grand feast for all!"
 imperial.67.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.67.d:0 "The night went along smoothly. Carriage after carriage arrived in front of the Imperial Palace, the most important of which were greeted by the regent, [Root.GetLeader], and even young Grover VI himself. This banquet was quite clearly one of the smaller ones, and the mood seemed to be sour at first. Soon, however, the memories of old returned to our guests, and the celebrations began. Games were played, words were exchanged, jokes were made. At the start of the Great Feast, the Duchess made a great speech. She spoke of ages long passed, and how it was the Empire's duty to carry on and reclaim its legacy and destiny. In the end, three cheers were had for our young Emperor."

 imperial.68.d:0 "A messenger from [From.GetNameDef] has just reached the court of [Root.GetLeader], delivering a formal invitation from [From.GetLeader]. It appears that despite our rivalry with the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has been invited to the Imperial Banquet over in Griffenheim, an ancient griffon tradition that dates back over one hundred years. Many a dozen nobles have been invited, and we could use this opportunity to - just for one night - forget our differences and grudges with the Imperials."
 imperial.68.a:0 "It's all in good spirit, I suppose..."

 imperial.69.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.69.d_vassals_only:0 "Once a grand assembly of Griffonian nobility, the Banquet was a rather awkward experience for all. Only the few loyal nobles arrived to join us and celebrate, and the grand Imperial Palace has never seemed this empty. The Regent and young Grover VI also attended the Banquet, and tried to improve relations with the few nobles that showed up, but it was a quiet, uneventful and awkward night, nonetheless. The once Grand Feast at the end of the Banquet was nothing more but a reminder of how large and powerful the Empire once was, as the vast majority of the room remained unfilled."
 imperial.69.a:0 "At least we kept the traitors out..."
 imperial.69.d_few:0 "The last night made for a rather disappointing and poor sight. Of the many nobles that were invited, only a small fraction decided to accept.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] [Root.GetLeader] and young Grover VI attended as well, and attempted to lighten the mood in the rather empty-looking halls of the Imperial Palace. The Grand Feast marked the end of the celebrations, and yet many places on the table remained empty. The Regent thanked everygriff that showed up, and cursed all of those that remained home under their breath."
 imperial.69.b:0 "Shouldn't have invited them, after all."
 imperial.69.d_most:0 "The last night was a night of pomp and old glory. Many of the invited nobles made up their minds and accepted our good will.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The great halls of the Imperial Palace were filled with nobility, truly reminding many of the old days of the Empire, and even bringing back nostalgia to some. The mood was light and joyful, and after some time even the deepest of grudges were forgotten about. The Grand Feast marked the end of the Banquet, and [Root.GetLeader] held a brilliant speech in which they thanked all visitors for their attendance and cooperation. During all the political rivalry and turmoil on the continent, the Banquet showed us that there can be peace between all of us, yet."
 imperial.69.c:0 "A spark of old glory!"
 imperial.69.d_all:0 "The Nobility on this continent appears to have seen reason and our good will, and all of them went ahead and accepted our invitation. Carriage after carriage they arrived at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, being greeted by the young Grover VI and [Root.GetLeader]. Among those nobles were loyalist as well as 'traitors', and even old rivals.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The mood was a bit shaky at the start, but the ice was soon broken, and old time grudges were forgotten in favour of light-hearted jokes and conversations. It seems that between all of the Griffonian politics, everygriff used this night to simply enjoy the company of each other. Even better, during the Grand Feast at the end of the celebrations, young Grover, with the support of the Regent, held a speech in front all of our guests, announcing his deep thanks to all of them, and stating that this night, if anything, is a sign that peace in Griffonia, between all of us, is possible, after all. We are griffons, in the end. The guests raised their mugs and cheered, and the Feast began."
 imperial.69.e:0 "What a great night!"
 imperial.70.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Demands Their Land"
 imperial.70.d:0 "The Griffonian Empire is a re-emerging force in the world, and securing an alliance with them was no doubt a good idea. But, as is common with empires, they do have a tendency to claim a lot of territories they have no direct control over. The Empire has formally requested that we transfer control of territories they deem to be theirs over to them. While the loss of this territory is not the most optimal situation, the risk of angering the Empire might outweigh the loss, what will our response be?"
 imperial.70.a:0 "Transfer the lands over to the Empire, we can ill afford to anger them."
 imperial.70.b:0 "We cannot bow to such a ridiculous demand."
 imperial.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts Our Demands"
 imperial.71.d:0 "Fantastic news! Our wise [From.GetAdjective] allies have seen that our claims to the lands they hold are truly just, and as such have agreed to transfer control of them over to us. This is a great day for all griffons, as the Empire takes one more step towards unification."
 imperial.71.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.72.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 imperial.72.d:0 "Our "allies" in [From.GetName] have proven themselves unwilling to recognize our rightful dominion over the lands they hold, and have denied our request of a territorial transfer. Is it truly right to call them our allies if they deny us this request?"

 imperial.73.t:0 "The Barrack Revolt"
 imperial.73.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw sat in his office, located in one of the innumerable military bases that dotted the capital of the Griffonian Empire. Ferdinand considered himself a patriot, and in a sense that was true. He did love the Empire in his own, strange, way. And it was precisely because of that love that he had to rebel. In his mind, the Empire simply couldn't survive without a radical change in the status quo. Could an already weakened Empire survive with a mere child in charge, with the nobles circling around him like vultures?\n\nNo, something had to be done. Ferdinand knew that his chances of success were slim, and that he would most likely just go down in history as another nameless traitor to the Empire, a fool whose futile rebellion was quickly crushed. Reports started to trickle in, his forces were converging on the Imperial palace, and soon they would face the palace guard in direct combat. Ferdinand could do nothing but wait, and hope that his soldiers could match the ferocity of the hardened defenders that they now faced. The next few minutes would decide the fate of the entire Empire and by extension the course of history itself."
 imperial.73.a:0 "The revolt is crushed!"
 imperial.73.b:0 "The soldiers storm the Palace!"
 imperial.74.t:0 "The Storming Of The Palace"
 imperial.74.d:0 "Against all odds, the few units that Ferdinand commanded triumphed over the palace guard, at the cost of heavy casualties. Ferdinand himself soon followed his soldiers into the palace, accompanied by his personal guard. What followed was brutal room to room combat, the defenders of the palace determined to protect the Emperor to the last. But Ferdinand's units eventually overwhelmed them, as the palace defenders fell one by one to a storm of steel and fire. And when the final guards fell, after hours of fighting, Ferdinand achieved complete control of the Imperial palace.\n\nHis soldiers soon set to fortifying the perimeter around the palace, preparing to defend it against any counter attacks. With Ferdinand now controlling the heart of the Empire, it was time for the next phase of his plan to unfold. In a radio address to the entire Reichspakt, he declared himself Lord Protector of the Empire and announced that a new government would take control of the state, until the rot that had infested it could be cleared out. Ferdinand now had to execute the part of his plan that he had been dreading the most, but that didn't make it any less necessary."
 imperial.74.a:0 "Long live the Lord Protector!"
 imperial.75.t:0 "Securing Our Power"
 imperial.75.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw stood before the entrance of the Child-Emperor's room, the bullet-ridden corpses of the fanatically loyal Diamond Dog guards still sat where they fell. He knew what he had to do, the terrible act that he would commit to secure his power. The Emperor had no real authority, he was merely a figurehead, a pawn to be used by the various political factions that infested the rotting corpse of the once-great Empire. The child had to be removed from the picture if the Empire was to survive. And yet, he found himself unable to open the door, something deep in the back of his mind prevented him from doing so. Would this unforgivable act really be worth it?\n\nCommitting such an act would surely anger the entire Empire. Even the gods themselves would despise him for his actions. Was saving the Empire truly worth it? Would it be worth the weight of such an evil act? He struggled with himself for minutes, and with each second that passed by, he felt as if a noose was tightening around his neck. Finally, after what seemed like hours to the self-declared ruler of the Empire, he made up his mind. As he opened the door, a small part of him silently prayed for forgiveness. A larger part salivated at the thought of the power he would soon possess.\n\nThe act was relatively quick, and Ferdinand soon emerged from the Emperor's room. The part of the \"Lord Protector\" that had sought forgiveness was gone and only the all-consuming desire for more power remained."
 imperial.75.a:0 "This world is too cruel to children..."
 imperial.76.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 imperial.76.d:0 "When the coup was initiated, its leaders had known that the wider Empire would most likely not react favourably. Such a massive shakeup in the status quo would most likely anger the various nobles that governed much of the Empire's Heartlands, and they would no doubt make demands for increased autonomy and other privileges. But Ferdinand Dawnclaw himself had predicted that the vassals of the Empire would fall in line one after another, as surely their loyalty to the Spirit of the Empire was greater than their loyalty to some puppet Emperor. Ferdinand would simply meet with the various nobles and archons that held true power within Griffonia, and work out a deal that would benefit both parties. That had been the plan, but it seems that the leaders of the coup had been somewhat... optimistic about the state of the Griffonian Empire. Quickly after the coup was finished, and the Emperor dead, something unexpected happened to the Empire.\n\nNamely the fact that it stopped existing. As it turns out, the second that the news of the Emperor's death reached the various vassal states, they all decided that they could not recognize the Lord Protector's authority over themselves, and thus had no choice but to declare their independence. All in all, the only territory of the Empire that the Lord Protector "controlled" was the Imperial City and the surrounding countryside. And judging by the mobs forming in the streets, that control might not last long.\n\nMay the gods save us."
 imperial.76.a:0 "Quite suboptimal."
 imperial.77.t:0 "Panic In The War Room"
 imperial.77.d:0 "The headquarters of the newly established Regierung der Nationalen Rettung could, at the very best, be described as unorganized. Located inside one of the buildings of the former Imperial palace, the headquarters were hastily established by the new government after it became clear that the rest of the Empire was less than accepting of their aims. Within the building, an old storage room now served as an ad-hoc war room, with the entirety of the high command loyal to the new government located there.\n\nThe room itself was, to put it bluntly, a chaotic mess. Discarded documents and notes littered the floor, the walls were covered with war plans that had been drafted, re-drafted, adjusted, drawn over, and discarded multiple times over the course of the coup. Ferdinand himself was pacing around the room, with the various generals still loyal to him drafting up more plans and communicating with the other loyalist forces dotted around the city. The coup had been executed several days ago, and none of them had received any amount of sleep that could be called reasonable. Nevertheless, either through sheer desperation or a flash of brilliance they came up with a plan, and Ferdinand had every intention of acting upon it."
 imperial.77.a:0 "At least we have a plan now..."
 imperial.78.t:0 "Rifles At the Ready"
 imperial.78.d:0 "With the city growing more chaotic by the day, many thought that the days of the military junta were numbered. It seemed as if the mobs demanding the head of Ferdinand on a pike grew larger every day. And with the knightly orders and the remnants of the emperor's personal guard still lurking in the city, Griffenheim more resembled a powderkeg next to a lit torch than a city. The few infantry units loyal to Ferdinand and his government left in Griffenheim now face a daunting task, managing the mobs with the meager supplies they have left until reinforcements from the countryside arrived to relive them.\n\nEvery single bullet and bayonet was rationed, with some patrols being forced to leave without ammunition in their guns, relying on intimidation to do all the fighting for them. The odds of survival seemed slim for Ferdinand and his young junta, and only a stroke of luck would allow him to survive the coming storm."
 imperial.78.a:0 "Just have to keep calm..."
 imperial.79.t:0 "The Battle For Griffenheim"
 imperial.79.d:0 "Ever since the coup was executed and the Emperor well... executed, the capital of Griffenheim has been engulfed in utter anarchy. Roving bands of rioters, supported by the remains of the royal guard, patrolled the streets of the city. Soldiers loyal to the new government frequently clashed with these bands, and it was not unusual for several patrols to disappear over the course of a day, their broken bodies eventually found in some dark alleyway, stripped of all weapons and equipment.\n\nThe days went on, and the soldiers of the coup were gradually whittled down to a shadow of their former force. The streets eventually became too dangerous for patrols and ever since, the remaining loyalists have been sitting in their fortified headquarters, waiting for other units loyal to Ferdinand to make their way to the capital. As rations and ammo slowly ran out for the defenders, many took to desertion, hoping to save their skin, but they soon found out that the mobs outside were in a less than forgiving mood.\n\nBut after 67 days had passed, the promised help finally arrived. Rows of trucks and tanks entered the city, and the roving mobs discovered that force of will tended to dissipate against concentrated automatic gunfire. With the streets finally under their control, the new government could finally start cementing their rule over Griffenheim."
 imperial.79.a:0 "Now back to business!"
 imperial.80.t:0 "Panzers On The Streets"
 imperial.80.d:0 "While the majority of the rebels in the capital had been suppressed when the reinforcements had arrived, the people of the city were still far from accepting the authority of the government. This was only worsened due to the incredible rise in crime across the city, with many gangs seeing the coup as the perfect opportunity to rob and kill as they pleased. The gangs gradually split the capital between themselves, with many fortifying buildings and streets of the city to serve as headquarters for their operations.\n\nTo worsen this, protesters carrying images of the old emperor were still common amongst the city. With some openly weeping and declaring their undying hatred of Ferdinand himself. It was clear that something had to be done, and luckily this situation presented the perfect opportunity to investigate how capable tanks were at suppressing urban populations.\n\nThe petty strongholds of the gangs were simply blown up by the cannons of the tanks, with the survivors being crushed underneath their treads. The protesters were commanded to stop, and when they proved unwilling to do so, the machine guns of the tanks proved very capable at persuading them to change their minds. At the end of the week, the city was completely under the control of the government, and the captured traitors could only wait for their eventual punishment."
 imperial.80.a:0 "That's going to be a pain to clean up..."
 imperial.81.t:0 "The Day Of The Rope"
 imperial.81.d:0 "As reinforcements from the countryside pour into Griffenheim, whatever thoughts of rebellion remain within the minds of its citizens are crushed. Ferdinand's forces simply outnumber and outgun the few griffons still willing to resist the Lord Protector's rule over the city, and for the first time in months, the streets of Griffenheim lie silent. One might think that Ferdinand would be pleased with this outcome, with the people finally accepting his rightful rule over the city. \n\nSuch thoughts could not be farther from the truth, as in his mind this calm is merely an illusion of safety, one that would shatter as soon as his iron-fisted grip on the citizens loosened. Far from putting his mind at ease, this course of events only served to stoke the fires of paranoia within his mind.. He knew now that the citizens of the Empire would never accept his rule without coercion, and he knew exactly what methods would be most effective in this situation.\n\nThe very next day, the difference between martial law and regular law within the Empire ceased to exist. The military would oversee every part of the legal and judicial system. It would act as judge, jury, and executioner, and would deal out any punishment it deemed necessary regardless of the scope of the crime. Needless to say, the number of hangings increased drastically that same day, the citizens of Griffenheim receiving a grim reminder of the ultimate fate that awaited all traitors."
 imperial.81.a:0 "I rather fancy Griffenheim's new decorations..."
 imperial.82.t:0 "The Knights"
 imperial.82.d:0 "The Knights of Griffonkind were truly figures from myth given flesh, each one showed exemplary dedication to the higher ideals of chivalry and honour, and each one would fight with a shocking ferocity once confronted on the battlefield. Sadly, their sense of honour and chivalry proved their undoing, as the new government proved to be incompatible with these ideals. They had repeatedly made their problems with the new government clear, and in doing so had earned the label of traitors.\n\nThe Knights knew that they stood no chance and that they would most likely die useless deaths, and yet they still resolved to fight with all their power. At dawn, they marched against the headquarters of the new government, with the aim of capturing and killing Ferdinand Dawnclaw. The group which marched that day numbered almost a thousand, with many more across the nation waiting to strike. None would survive to the day's end.\n\nIn the end, they charged the defences of the headquarters, facing automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, and were cut down to the last. The time of chivalry and honour was over, only the grim reality of modern war remained."
 imperial.82.a:0 "Where is your God now?"
 imperial.83.t:0 "The Attempt"
 imperial.83.d:0 "Archon Eros the seventh is one of the leading religious figures in the entire Empire, and as such holds great sway over the hearts and minds of every griffon in it. He was also a dear friend to Grover the fifth, and with the death of his son at the claws of Ferdinand Dawnclaw, he has made it his mission in life to unite the Empire against him. He has been the public face of the campaign resisting the new government, lending an incredible amount of legitimacy and support to the movement. And when a griffon becomes a thorn in the side of Ferdinand, his lifespan decreases drastically.\n\nThe plan was to goad Eros into making a public speech in support of the movement, one that the government would grudgingly allow. A sniper on a rooftop would then execute him with a single shot, then declaring himself to be a republican sent from the Griffonian Republic before being arrested and executed for his crimes. The plan would unite the opposition with the government through the desire for revenge against the Republic, solving multiple problems with one dead griffon. Everything proceeded to plan, Eros announced his speech ahead of time, and the sniper had been perfectly positioned to take the shot. It was truly a flawless plan.\n\nWere it not for the sniper, who missed with all 12 shots. He was then captured, where Ferdinand made sure to personally execute him seconds later."
 imperial.83.a:0 "Damn it! We'll get him next time!"
 imperial.84.t:0 "The Army Purge"
 imperial.84.d:0 "With the army now firmly under the control of the Regierung der Nationalen Rettung, the time had come to separate the wheat from the chaff as they say. The process itself was fairly simple, each soldier was asked of his opinion of the new government, those who answered disapprovingly, or had family members or close friends who did the same, were quickly singled out. They were then walked out to the firing line and shot, their bodies pushed into a mass grave, and said grave filled with cement.\n\nWhile some may suggest that our methods were crude and inefficient, the simplicity and effectiveness of a bullet to the head cannot be denied when it comes to dealing with traitors. This action was, however, considered very barbaric amongst the officer core, with Elias Bronzetail leading said officers. They had to be dealt with in short order."
 imperial.84.a:0 "They got only what they deserved."
 imperial.85.t:0 "The Death of Elias Bronzetail"
 imperial.85.d:0 "While dealing with the dissent of the common soldier is a simple, if brutal task, the treatment of officers is a far more sensitive matter. A large number of officers, led by Elias Bronzetail, have declared their open disgust at the conduct of the government and demanded better treatment. The rebelling officers demanded that their treatment be fitting to their status and that we accept their rights to hold whatever private opinions on the government that they wanted to hold.\n\nThis, of course, was treachery of the highest order, and the only punishment befitting such a crime was death by the noose. The offending officers were all rounded up, and over the course of an hour hanged within view of each other. One of the last ones to die was Elias Bronzetail, with his death being personally overseen by Ferdinand."
 imperial.85.a:0 "Thus unto traitors."
 imperial.86.t:0 "No More Nobles"
 imperial.86.d:0 "The nobility of the Empire had always been allowed more freedom of expression than the common folk, with the incredible amount of power they wielded necessitating such concessions from previous governments. Once the new government took over, they simply assumed that they would be able to get away with it as they always had. They constantly petitioned Ferdinand himself with requests of old rights and petty disputes, and some even demanded the creation of a noble council to 'advise' the new government on the proper ways of controlling a state.\n\nUnfortunately for the nobles, Ferdinand was not a griffon know for leniency to those who annoy him. So, he announced the creation of the noble council and asked every prominent noble within his territory to come to one of the towers of the imperial palace to discuss the powers of this council. However, when they arrived at the tower, the only thing they found a bullet to the back of the head, and a quick descent downwards from the window of the tower.\n\nNeedless to say, the nobles will not be a problem anymore."
 imperial.86.a:0 "They didn't fly so good."
 imperial.87.t:0 "Archon No More"
 imperial.87.d:0 "With Eros surviving the previous attempt on his life, his popularity and influence only increased. The government made several new plans to deal with him, each one more complex and detailed than the last. Poisoned food, explosives, yet another sniper. Pretty much every possible option was considered, and while these plans were discussed, Eros continued to spread his message. The problem had progressed to the point that a revolution by his supporters seemed inevitable, and the eighth delay of the assassination proved to be the last straw for Ferdinand.\n\nHe grabbed his revolver and a squadron of his personal guard and drove off in his car. He arrived at the Archon's house and proceeded to kick the door in. Then he and his soldiers meticulously killed every single occupant of the house, until Eros himself was located. Ferdinand was the one who took the final shot, and it is said that it was one of the few moments in his life where he had smiled.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Archon was dealt with, and Ferdinand learned that direct methods often surpassed complex ones, provided they were executed with finesse and skill."

 imperial.88.t:0 "The End Of The Anarchy"
 imperial.88.d:0 "With the last of his internal enemies dead at his feet, Ferdinand Dawnclaw has seemingly accomplished the impossible and survived the anarchy that consumed the Empire ever since his coup. Griffenheim now lies firmly under his control, and the surrounding countryside has been occupied by his forces. The Griffonian Empire may be an empire in name only, but it is an empire that Ferdinand now fully controls.\n\nBut Ferdinand was by no means satisfied by the meager parcel of territory he currently controlled, and he had every intention of restoring the Empire to its former glory, and perhaps even beyond. Every single pathetic traitor, every rebellious lord would be defeated and executed for their crimes, no less would do to satisfy the Empire's new ruler. The Empire's military now prepare for a military campaign that aims to recapture the entire continent and ensure that the Imperial flag once more flies across all of Griffonia once and for all."

 imperial.89.t:0 "The War Against Illiteracy Begins"
 imperial.89.d:0 "An illiterate soldier is a useless soldier. It remains a sad fact that many griffons within the Empire, especially among the lower classes where most recruits come from, are barely educated beyond the most basic schooling imaginable. If the Empire is to reclaim its glory, and more importantly its territory, then this issue must be rectified at once. A comprehensive course aimed at getting every able-bodied griffon up to basic literacy in the shortest amount of time possible has already been drafted, and teachers across the nation are being rounded up to enforce this new curriculum. Attendance is strongly encouraged, and refusal to attend the classes without a very good reason is rarely met with a great amount of understanding from the police. "

This came as a rather large surprise, as the Griffonian Empire has never shown any inclination towards such an action before. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent change in leadership within the Empire. But who are we to refuse such a boon? \n\nPlans regarding the use of the new slaves are already being drafted, though the weaklings amongst them must first be weeded out, a straightforward task.

 imperial.94.d:0 "As the remnants of the Griffonian republic are shattered under the mighty armies of the Lord Protector, it was almost inevitable that one of the most infamous griffons on the continent would be captured. President-Marshal Kemerskai and his most loyal units, many of which had fought in the initial revolution all those years ago, were finally tracked down to a small fortress deep in the mountains. What followed was a protracted battle that lasted for several days, as elite special forces from the Lord Protector's armies assaulted the redoubt, gradually wearing down the defenders, until the only ones that remained were Kemerskai and his personal bodyguards.\n\nAfter a final confrontation in which Kemerskai himself killed several of his assailants, he and his bodyguards were finally captured. The President-Marshal was shoved into an armored truck, which then made its way to Griffenheim, alongside a convoy of armored escorts. Despite being ambushed several times by republican guerillas as they made their way through former Republican territory, the convoy eventually managed to safely arrive at Griffenheim. \n\nA few days later, the former President-Marshal, the griffon who had brought a centuries-old empire to its knees, stood before the gallows in Griffenheim with his wings restrained and a rope around his neck. Lord Protector Ferdinand stood at a podium only a few feet away, giving a speech to the residents of Griffenheim, announcing that the evils of republicanism would finally be banished from the empire. Moments later, the floor beneath Kemerskai gave away, and the dream of a republican Griffonia was finished off for good."

The birthplace of griffonkind had truly seen better days before its reconquest by the Empire, as years of neglect had reduced the venerable city to nothing more than a glorified town in the midst of collapsing. When [Root.GetLeader] saw the sorry state of the city with their own eyes, they declared that the birthplace of griffonkind could not stay in such a state if the Empire was to control it, and mere days later work had started on restoring the city to its former glory.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] gave a rousing speech at the ceremony, decreeing that Griffonstone was a model of the many benefits that Imperial rule brought to the people of Griffonia, and declared that as long as they lived the city would not fall to such a low state ever again. The residents of the city were particularly appreciative of the efforts taken by the Empire, and hundreds of the city's residents volunteered to join the Imperial army once the festivities were over.\n\nNow some officials have brought up the idea of moving our capital to the ancient home of the Imperial dynasty, which is in a more central position than Griffenheim. However, the latter remains more prosperous and developed, and moving the governmental bodies would cost a fortune."

There was only one punishment worthy of such evils, and he was sentenced to be hung from the gallows at dawn.\n\nThe griffon offered no defense for himself, staying silent through the entire court case, seemingly having accepted his fate. The execution itself was a subdued event, with a scant few military officials and curious onlookers showing up. Of the few griffons present at the event, Elias Bronzetail was the most senior in rank, showing up out of the little respect that he had for the foolish general. There were no grand speeches or denunciations at the execution, Ferdinand was simply lead up to the gallows, and minutes later he hung dead in the air.\n\nIn the end, Ferdinand Dawnclaw died a mundane death, one which was observed by few. He would be a footnote in history, another mad general driven by a lust for power, an insignificant traitor whose pitiful rebellion was put down before it could even start in earnest.\n\nIt was a fitting end."

 imperial.100.t:0 "The Archon of Eyr Speaks"
 imperial.100.d:0 "Having been invited into the Regency Council by Eros, Erion XII went to Griffenheim from Romau as quickly as he could, travelling on Grover's brand new railroad. Several hours had passed from his arrival when he was already holding a speech in the center of the city. The market square was busy at that time, so soon the amount of griffons listening to him grew and a huge crowd formed around him as he kept on rambling and raving.\n\nHis speech was full of fury, so much so that he seemed more like an Archon of Arcturius. He condemned the nobility and called them decadent, lazy, corrupt, selfish, greedy, Maarite and several dozen other negative epithets. He blamed them for the Empire's decay, for Emperor Grover V's death, for the revolution of 978 and for every unfortunate event in the Empire's history. It was clear, he said, that the Empire needed to be purified and remade anew, the power of the aristocrats shattered and their plentiful land redistributed to Eyr's devout followers, for she was a Goddess of the Earth and Fertility and thus her bounty belonged to them. He asked the crowd how many of them worshipped Eyr and paid tithe to his Archonate, and most remained silent. Yet a few faithful ones raised their claws or flew upwards, and to them Erion promised vast tracts of land. Soon others in the crowd joined them and claimed to be followers of Eyr as well, vowing to donate as much as they could to Erion's Temple.\n\nErion grinned and said he would do everything he could to purge the unclean. He looked toward the Imperial Palace nearby, at Eros who was spectating the event from the balcony, and prayed he had liked his most powerful speech."
 imperial.100.a:0 "Praise Eyr! End to the nobility!"
 imperial.101.t:0 "Aiding the Commoners"
 imperial.101.d:0 "The long-prepared plan of Eros, Erion and Proteus was finally nearing completion. The clergy of the Three Temples had obeyed their orders and during the last few weeks the poorer districts of Griffenheim had been filled with new soup kitchens for the poor and hospices for the ill. All free of charge of course, funded by the Archons themselves. The commoners were grateful and many had their first warm meals in a long time. They praised the Archons and word quickly spread of their piety and generosity.\n\nThose nobles on the regency council who complained of this "senseless waste of money" and "blatant bribery of the needy" soon found themselves replaced with commoners claw-picked by the Archons, as did the ones who whined about the replacements and said the regency council was reserved for privileged individuals only. One by one nobles were removed until only a few blueblooded griffons remained, among them Gabriela Eagleclaw. Her support was too great, Eros thought, and removing her could only end poorly. At least for now, he was willing to let her stay while they gathered popular support. Gabriela however had already realized what was happening, and already letters were being sent across Herzland..."
 imperial.101.a:0 "We'll deal with her in time."
 imperial.102.t:0 "The Knight-Archon's Speech"
 imperial.102.d:0 "When Archon Proteus III finally arrived in Griffenheim, he did not receive a warm welcome from fellow priests and Archon Eros, who chided him for being late and once again caring little for his sacred duty. As always, he shrugged off such criticism and left the Palace to speak to the people he loved and cared about. Word of Proteus' arrival had spread quickly and a huge crowd gathered to listen to their hero's speech as peddlers tried to profit off the situation by selling Proteus-related merchandise.\n\nAs soon as the muscular Knight-Archon appeared on the balcony of the Imperial Palace, the griffons erupted into cheers and chanted his name. Many soldiers had gathered there too and hailed their living idol. Proteus smiled in return and basked in admiration for a long while, even winking to female griffons in the crowd who swooned from his attention. Behind him Eros rolled his eyes and angrily told him to get started already.\n\nProteus asked for the people to calm down and they obeyed him immediately. He then began to speak, of the present uncertainty and restlessness in Herzland, how many had doubts about the future and feared another revolution. Everyone was especially anxious about the lack of leadership. Proteus then told that in such times one had to be brave and look to Arcturius, and have confidence in Him and His divine protection. If they remained strong and faithful to their gods, no matter what would happen they would not only prevail but prosper. He urged the people to not simply sit idly and wait for what would happen, but make preparations for the worst and never give in to fear. Their greatest strength came from unity, and unity came from sharing a single, noble cause. And that cause was ensuring peace, stability and integrity within the Empire no matter the cost, so all griffons could live a good life. He ended his speech with "Praise Arcturius!" and saluted the crowd, who in turn cheered and praised not only the God of War but him as well. As he turned around to go back inside, he looked at Eros and grinned. Despite the audience's response, Eros seemed unimpressed."
 imperial.102.a:0 "You have to admit, that was a good speech..."
 imperial.103.t:0 "Support Within the Reichsarmee"
 imperial.103.d:0 "While Eros had assigned Proteus the duty of preparing extensive administrative reforms for the Imperial Army, he had procrastinated on the duty and instead spent time with the soldiers themselves. When Eros was ready to once again rant to Proteus about his negligence and incompetence, he was surprised to see just how fond the army had become of him. Over the weeks he had practiced with low-ranking soldiers, discussed strategy with the officers and dueled with them. He had even organized a large sermon where they all prayed to Arcturius and he blessed the entire army in His name. As a result of all this, Proteus was now seen as the heroic figurehead of the Imperial Army and inspired countless thousands of soldiers.\n\nInstead of chiding Proteus, Eros decided to take advantage of his success. Printing presses began to churn out posters depicting Proteus as a knight clad in enchanted armour pointing at the viewer, with "ARCHON PROTEUS WANTS YOU TO JOIN THE IMPERIAL ARMY" written below in large, coloured letters. Tens of thousands of posters were plastered on lampposts, walls, fences, windows and trams. They proved to be very effective, with a constant stream of young griffons filling the recruiting offices and enlisting in the army."

 imperial.104.t:0 "Gerlach's Support"
 imperial.104.d:0 "Time is of the essence, thought Duchess Gabriela. Her little speech gathered support for her cause, but it was still inconclusive whom will the Council elect for the regency. The next matter to be discussed was the admittance of common-born griffons of some repute to the council... And that simply cannot be allowed. Eros' blatant populism would spell doom for the Empire if the actual commoners found out about it, and nogriff needs another 978. Fortunately, the opportunity presented itself.\n\nThe Grand Duke of Feathisia arrived in Griffenheim today, his coming unnoticed by most, as he was fond of travelling incognito. He was set to deliver his speech in the Council Chambers tomorrow, and while he is a pure-blooded noble, Gabriela suspected that the Archons' lackeys could persuade him to support an inferior cause. He can be irritatingly pragmatic sometimes. But the Duchess had her own plan in mind: she will invite him to dine at her Griffenheim estate and take advantage of his fondness for her in order to secure an alliance.\n\nThus, the evening came, the two noble griffons seated in front of each other at the Duchess' opulent dining room. Pleasant chatter was exchanged over a traditional Feathisian feast, with dishes such as snert and maatjesharing. Thankfully, he refrained from devouring the fish in primitive ways. It was certainly... unbecoming to be seen doing such. As Gabriela was about to make a comment on the latest gossip, she was suddenly interrupted by the normally tight-beaked Grand Duke:\n"Lady Eagleclaw, I do not wish to disrespect your hospitality, but I am keenly aware of your invitation's purpose." This came as no surprise to her, as she made a strong effort to flatter his sensibilities. In fact, he gave her an opening to cut straight to the matter at claw. "Forgive me, Grand Duke. But I believe it is within our mutual interest to stand together against the Archons and their wicked schemes. They can't be trusted to rule our legacy." As Gerlach silently considered his options, she pressed further: "Think, what would Grover want?" This got his attention, his eyes gleaming at the memory of the late Emperor... "So it is, Duchess. So it is."\n\nTomorrow, at the Council's meeting, Gabriela could only smugly listen to Gerlach's speech, lambasting the Archons for their irresponsible actions. This will certainly draw some of the indecisive nobles to vote for her regency. As his speech drew to a close, she thought about setting up another dinner. The Grand Duke is certainly easy on the eyes."
 imperial.104.a:0 "Your devotion will not be forgotten, Gerlach."
 imperial.105.t:0 "The Imperial Industrialists"
 imperial.105.d:0 "As Duchess Gabriela walked through the busy halls of Krähe-Stahl Offices, her thoughts were on legacy. The Empire may last for centuries or not even a decade, but its culture and achievements will never be forgotten. But where the state comes and goes, its inhabitants are eternal. And more importantly, the money. Great wealth is concentrated within the many companies dotting the business district of Griffenheim, and she knew that having their support could change it all. Thus, today she would dedicate her morning to one known as Ceron Greytalon, the most notable captain of industry in the city. He accepted her invitation for a meeting without hesitation, and before she knew it, she was sitting across the business magnate in his opulent office.\n\n"My dear Gabriela. What brings you to my humble workplace?", Ceron started with no hint of irony, chomping on his favourite Golden Griffon cigar, exclusive from Skyfall. "I'll need that favour you promised me, Ceron. I'll need your support, and your colleagues' assistance, against the Archons. You know we can't let them take over the state." Greytalon leaned forward, exhaling a whiff of smoke. The Duchess didn't seem to be hazed by it. "Your favours don't come cheap, Gabriela. What's in it for me, and for the Krähe-Stahl? I must work for my bread like every other griffon, you know."\n\nThe ever predictable Ceron and his greed. You'd think he had made enough in his lifetime, but some were never content. "Tax breaks. Subsidies. Exclusive government contracts. And we won't nationalise your factories, like the Archons would. They'd probably give it all to the peasants, too." Gabriela could practically hear the sound of Idols clinking in Ceron's head. Her offer would clearly improve his next quarterly report. "Then I believe we have an outstanding deal, my dear. The industrialists of the Empire will stand by your side." Claws were shaken, pleasantries were exchanged, and a proposal for the expansion of a middling business was drawn up. Primarily for the purpose of putting a good impression on the less fortunate, of course. The Duchess returned to her Griffenheim manor, and another piece of her plan put in motion. It wouldn't be long until she had everything she needed."
 imperial.105.a:0 "Ceron is a decent griffon once you get to know him."
 imperial.106.t:0 "Friends in the Eyrite Archonate"
 imperial.106.d:0 "Reputation can make or break a griffon, the Duchess knew this well. Many nobles were left disgraced once the attention of unflattering comments landed on them, regardless of whether there was any substance of truth in them. Sometimes, a noblegriff simply crossed the wrong peer... Such were the rules of the courtly intrigue, and Gabriela was keenly aware of them.\n\nWhich was why she decided to use these same tactics against the Archons. Although Eros and Proteus were unfortunately too beloved and incorruptible, the same could not be said for their weakest link, Erion. It was an open secret that he conducted himself in a manner considered shameful by even the Priesthood of Eyr's standards. Gabriela knew just how to exploit this situation: she was a friend of a local priest named Hephaestus, whose advancement was snubbed by Erion plenty of times. She was certain that he will be open to the suggestions of revenge, in exchange for an open seat in the Archonate, once the true order took control. With that, she began writing a letter, which would arrive tomorrow in Romau.\n\nThe following week saw plenty of controversy in Romau and beyond, as multiple accusations emerged targetting various high ranking religious officials. The common griffons were outraged to hear that their alms ended up funding extravagant parties, and worse yet, the tales of abuse committed upon young initiates. While many of these stories had few facts behind them, and while Archons still had their claws full on trying to minimise the extent of the damage, the public opinion swung back in the nobles' favour. Everything is according to Gabriela's plan."
 imperial.106.a:0 "Act as you preach, Erion."
 imperial.107.t:0 "Convincing The Niederer Adel"
 imperial.107.d:0 "The proper conduct of nobility is something every peer understood and upheld, at least that's what the Duchess believed. An exquisite upbringing, which would translate into a decent member of the high society, somegriff to look up towards. And yet to her eternal embarrassment, most nobles were content to engage in crass displays of debauchery, the kind that would make a priestess of Eyr blush in shame. Still, they were smart enough to keep it behind curtains, unlike certain lesser aristocrats. These landless lords would continuously make fools of themselves, clinging to their empty titles and dressing in fashion that went out of style decades ago. Despite being genuine wastes of Boreas-given air, Duchess Gabriela found a possible use for them.\n\nDespite holding functionally vacuous titles, of the lands that haven't been under Imperial control for decades, they were still peers, recognised by the Imperial Court. As such, should a sufficient number present their cause to the Regency Council, there would be no choice but to be accepted. Gabriela only needed a few more claws on her side to claim the regency for herself, and despite the distaste for their mockery of the peerage, went forth to persuade a sufficient number. It would be a busy day, but at least she knew where most of them spent their days. It would be a simple matter what to say and promise, and no guarantee for following on them later on.\n\nThe following day at the session of the Regency Council had an unusual commotion, as a dozen foppish nobles interrupted the session and demanded that "their privileges to be given and respected". The guards were close to kicking them out on the streets, but the Duchess interrupted, saying that their titles are legitimate. Thus they joined their colleagues, and when the vote came, they all voted unanimously for Gabriela Eagleclaw. The Archons were furious at being foiled yet again!"

 imperial.108.t:0 "End Of The Republican Dream"
 imperial.108.d:0 "President-Marshal Kemerskai was executed by hanging in the Imperial square in Griffenheim today. The people had anticipated this day ever since his capture at the claws of an elite griffon special forces unit during the fall of the bandit state known as the Griffonian Republic, and the crowd at the execution itself was truly massive. There was no trial given to Kemerskai, with the government stating that his crimes were so blatant and irrefutable that dignifying them with a trial would be akin to spitting on the very concept of justice. Any griffon who disagreed with this statement quickly changed his mind or was arrested as a Republican sympathizer.\n\nKemerskai was marched to the gallows and offered a cigarette, which he refused. The execution itself occurred mere seconds later and was closely observed by the Imperial Regent [Root.GetLeader] who was quite pleased to put an end to the disgrace the Empire has suffered for over 30 years, and the young Emperor himself, who flinched when the hanging took place but nevertheless was happy to see his father's humiliation finally avenged. The Griffonian republican movement is unlikely to recover after this event."

Almost everyone in the attaché attended and took part in the simulated combat experience which lasted several days and allowed officers to put their tactics to the test in practice.\n\nThe newly trained griffon tank companies performed admirably and seemed to have learned their lessons from us. Meanwhile the changelings of our attaché adopted griffon tactics of defensive frontlines and managed to fend off several assaults.\n\nIn the end, both sides were tied and a draw was declared. While this was disappointing to some, in the end a celebration was held nevertheless. Thranx especially seemed to enjoy griffon cuisine and drink greatly. Perhaps worryingly so."

[From.GetLeader] wishes for this to change, and says we should create a joint department where changeling and griffon researchers work together and share their documents and data openly. Of course, this would mean sharing top-secret military breakthroughs with them in return for their own breakthroughs, so we must consider carefully if we want to accept this proposal."

 imperial.123.d:0 "The Emperor recently came of age, and is ready to rule his reunited Empire. But it is clear he must immediately get to work. Young students of a new generation, more well-educated and conscious than their parents, are calling for peace and freedom across the Empire. Throughout their life, they have known nothing but war, with mass-conscription and strict military production quotas. Now they are tired of it, and dream of a peace that is maintained, and a society that is demilitarized. While the old guard considers them republican sympathisers, the truth is that most of them see the benefits of Imperial rule, and simply want reform. And they want it NOW.\n\nToday thousands of griffons, if not tens of thousands of them, gathered in Griffenheim from all across the Empire. Most of them were students, but there were government personnel among them as well. They began something that had not been seen in the Imperial City since 978: A mass protest. However, it was not a riot, but a peaceful demonstration, with protesters calmly holding signs with slogans and calling for liberty, regional autonomy and reform of the state and the temples. Yet some among them were more radical, and tried to sway others to their side with fiery speeches. Several clashes with local police could not be avoided, but in general it was entirely peaceful. News have spread like wildfire, and smaller protests have already sprung up in support of the Griffenheim one in many Imperial Cities, in Griffonstone, Skyfall, Aquila, Karthin, Cloudbury and others.\n\nIt is clear that His Majesty Grover VI cannot ignore this movement. Above all, the students demand an end to the "dictatorship" which was maintained under the rule of the Imperial Regent. If Grover VI simply continues to act like a despot of old, it is not out of the question that the horrors of 978 are repeated. Either way, he will have to make appeasements; the question is, how far should he go? This time the decision is entirely his to make, and he cannot delegate it to a regent. The fate of the Empire is in his claws."

Tensions were high between the students and the riot police, especially when some protesters saw this as proof of the Emperor's tyranny. This is why they were very surprised when an official Imperial decree ordered the police to stand down and to leave the protesters alone.\n\nIn Grover's eyes, the protests were almost entirely peaceful and non-violent, so he did not see them as a threat, unlike some of his advisors. Violence would only beget violence, so leaving them alone would ensure they remained calm. He even made a statement promising to listen to the demonstrators' demands, as long as they remained reasonable, and said force would not be used against them unless they were to use it first. This proved to be effective, as the rare violent incidents and clashes became even rarer."

They were on high alert, ready to intervene if necessary to prevent a revolution, and the roaring tanks patrolling the streets made many protesters both afraid and furious. So when the tanks and marching columns of soldiers returned to their barracks, the students rejoiced.\n\nWhile some advisors expressed their concern that now the Empire was vulnerable to an organized revolution, the Emperor called them paranoid and reassured them that it would be fine. Indeed, the protests remained calm on the following days, with no sign of escalation of violence or preparation for a coup."

Instead, it was an official invitation to meet the Emperor himself at the Imperial Palace in [GRI.Capital.GetName]. While a few suspected a trap and a plot to arrest them, most of them trusted the young Grover and travelled to the capital. For some, it was a very lengthy journey, but they were determined to go nonetheless.\n\nThere, His Majesty treated them like honoured guests, welcoming them to his home and offering them a bountiful dinner. Six leaders in total had arrived: Cécile Gaudreau from Aquileia, Giovanni De Gaspwingi from Wingbardy, Borad Grifnitsky from Gryphia, Heinrich Kingfeather from Cloudbury, Winston Copperhill from Bronzekreuz and Alexis de Sicameon. While their values varied, they all agreed that the Empire needed democratic reform, and acknowledged Grover VI as their rightful monarch.\n\nAfter the dinner the Emperor talked to them all in private, where they elaborated upon the goals of the student movements and their demands, while Grover reassured them that no harm would come to them if they did not resort to violence. They all agreed that it was out of the question, and that another bloody revolution would bring nothing but death. Peaceful reform was the way, and they convinced the Emperor that this would satisfy them and the protesters. While some of their demands were too extreme for Grover, he was convinced of the more moderate and reasonable requests. At the end of the meeting, he swore in the name of his father to implement these reforms and do what Grover V could not: Save the Empire from revolutionary chaos, turmoil and war. All six leaders left the palace satisfied, dreaming of a blissful future for the Empire and its people."

In the Bürger, a lengthy editorial contemplated if the Empire would accept the students' demands or spiral into chaos and revolution, some articles highlighted the wrongdoings by the police and military before they had been ordered to stand down, and a satirical caricature depicted Grover as a confused crying child in a burning house.\n\nRegional newspapers had different views on the matter. Le Petit Griffon saw this as a chance to secure autonomy for Aquileia, which the Aquileian Kingdom had had before its secession from the Empire. Campi Di Taloncana claimed that a parliamentary monarchy was inevitable, and that the Empire would introduce local democratic governments similar to the ones Equestria had. Flügel der Wahrheit, a newspaper that had once been the most popular one in Griffonia before being surpassed by the Bürger after the Empire's reunification, even had a scandalous headline claiming the Emperor would soon abdicate and be succeeded by a republican government. However, some newspapers espoused support for the Emperor: The Prywhenian Campu-Painii Liber, always a staunch supporter of the de Kissau dynasty, was confident His Majesty would soon crush the resistance, having lulled the protesters into a false sense of security by withdrawing the army and police.\n\nWhile the coverage has been largely negative, Emperor Grover believes the journalists deserve to have their opinions heard. Already heated debate has begun across the Empire about its fate, and without realizing it the subjects of the Empire are happily embracing the freedom of speech."

Many of the peers protested this act, given that the council has performed with admirable dedication and little-to-no scandals, but the Emperor cared little. But when they threatened to tell the old Duchess that her nephew was slandering the noblegriffs who worked so hard to raise Grover to the throne, he responded that the nobles serve the Empire, and not the other way.\n\nOther smaller reforms included legalizing protests of all kinds, prohibiting censorship, forbidding religious officials from participating in government, allowing all religions and sects (except for Maarites who remained banned) and recognizing every single regional language spoken within the Empire."

Most notably, he dismissed advisors who had previously opposed his conciliatory stance with the protesters and greatly reduced the power of the Three Archonates to the point there was very little they could do to influence governance and legislation. While some conservatives and religious figures protested this move, the Emperor cared little. But when someone said that he was spitting on the grave of Archon Eros, he was outraged and told him this is what Eros had wanted him to ultimately do.\n\nOther smaller reforms included legalizing protests of all kinds, prohibiting censorship, forbidding religious officials from participating in government, allowing all religions and sects (except for Maarites who remained banned) and recognizing every single regional language spoken within the Empire."

 imperial.129.a:0 "To a better future!"
 imperial.130.t:0 "A Meeting With Van Cleef"
 imperial.130.d:0 "So far, Edwin Van Cleef, the leader of the underground Volksfront and a stonemason by trade, has been distrustful of Grover VI. He had been invited to a meeting with the Emperor like other prominent protest leaders, but refused it, thinking it was a plot to imprison him for his old attempts at terrorism. When His Majesty officially pardoned him alongside other Volksfront members, he was positively surprised and decided to trust the Emperor for now.\n\nThis is why he cautiously accepted a second invitation to meet the Emperor in person, this time without anyone else. Even when it was just the two of them inside Grover's office, he still glanced behind his back, fearing guards to burst inside to arrest him. But the Emperor reassured him with calming words and promises of peace. Indeed, Edwin let his guard down and talked with the Emperor for hours about the future of the Empire. While Grover refused any requests for abdication and full transition to democracy, he was willing to form a parliament like van Cleef proposed, and to implement local democratic rule in the regions of the Empire. When the meeting ended, it was past midnight with both parties satisfied and looking forward to future cooperation."
 imperial.130.a:0 "What a pleasant fellow."
 imperial.131.t:0 "The Separation Of Temples And The State"
 imperial.131.d:0 "His Majesty has decided to continue his reforms which limited the power of the Three Temples. Now he has taken it one step further by passing laws that completely separated the temples from the state, stripping Archons, Prelates and priests of any political power whatsoever in the Empire. This meant reverting most reforms Eros had done, but Grover was determined that this is what he would've wanted.\n\nThe Emperor also integrated the Knights of Arcturius into the Imperial Army, meaning he was now their leader and not the Archon of Arcturius. This removed any military power remaining in the claws of the Archonates and guaranteed that they could not hope to oppose his reforms."
 imperial.131.a:0 "It needed to be done."
 imperial.132.t:0 "The Separation Of Temples And The State"
 imperial.132.d:0 "His Majesty has decided to continue his reforms which limited the power of the Three Temples. However, he has taken a more cautious approach to the matter. The influence of the priesthood has already been diminished due to the actions of former regent Gabriela Eagleclaw, who had a personal grudge with the late Archon of Boreas, Eros VII. Thus it meant that the triarchy's political power was nonexistent, and the many knightly orders who were pledged to archons have been integrated in the Reichsarmee.\n\nNot everygriff was satisfied with this situation, particularly the gods-fearing griffons, and the Emperor has decided to allow the temples to hold limited, if ineffectual power within their area. However, it was made particularly clear that the once influential griffons of faith would never hold considerable any sway within the state's apparatus."
 imperial.132.a:0 "It needed to be done."
 imperial.133.t:0 "Checks And Balances"
 imperial.133.d:0 "To better define the Kaiser's authority and create clear limits for it, His Majesty has formalized a separation of powers in the government. Three separate bodies shall exist: The Emperor himself, the Imperial Parliament, and the courts of law in [GRI.Capital.GetName]. Each branch would have separate responsibilities and powers, and would be capable of keeping the power of the other two in check. No longer could the Emperor pass legislation without approval from a Parliament and the judiciary; neither could the other two do the same if the Emperor were to veto their decision. Thus, balance would be achieved in governance.\n\nGrover VI had given up his near-absolute power, but had also prevented of having the fate of his unfortunate father befall either himself or any of his descendants. The regency council would rule on the Emperor's behalf, but now it would not be able to do anything without getting approval from the Parliament and the courts. Never again would a small number of individuals be able to cause such widespread damage -- which included the Emperor himself."
 imperial.133.a:0 "The Kaiser is not always right."
 imperial.134.t:0 "Freedom For All"
 imperial.134.d:0 "Yesterday across the Empire, crowds formed near the numerous prisons and internment camps which held political prisoners. The crowds primarily consisted of relatives, friends and allies of the prisoners, but also news reporters, curious onlookers and armed guards. They had gathered there to witness the liberation of thousands of political prisoners who had been imprisoned during the reunification wars -- though some had been in prison since the revolution of 978.\n\nWhen the gates opened and flocks of former prisoners finally came pouring out, their loved ones rushed to meet them, and cameras of the reporters flashed constantly, capturing the emotional moments. One example of such a moment was a sixty-year-old veteran NRP member embracing his grandchildren, having been in prison ever since the revolution. Some of the prisoners were, of course, dangerous terrorists, but the guards made sure they would cause no trouble.\n\nThis morning, the frontpages of all newspapers displayed the pictures, most of them praising the Emperor for his mercy and kindess. However, some newspapers such as Campu-Painii Liber of Prywhen criticized the act, especially as the prisons in Prywhen had now released thousands of communist PCP members. They predicted a sharp rise in terrorism and acts of sabotage.\n\nHis Majesty however was confident that his kindness would only be repaid with kindness, and not with violence. No griffon deserved to be imprisoned for their political beliefs or their brave resistance against a despotic regime. If he offered the prisoners what they desired, reforms and freedom, then why would they resist him?"
 imperial.134.a:0 "Hopefully this won't cause any issues."
 imperial.135.t:0 "Liberty For All"
 imperial.135.d:0 "During the regency, the regent had banned all regionalist and nationalist organizations and forced them into hiding in order to curtail organized resistance in occupied regions. Their members were persecuted and suspected of being traitors and rebels who wished to liberate their homelands once more from the Empire.\n\nA while has passed since the reunification was achieved, yet these underground resistance cells continue to exist. Instead of vainly wasting more griffonpower and resources to hunt them down, Grover VI has instead decided to lift the ban and pardon the members of the organizations. Indeed, they will now be allowed to form proper political parties to advocate for regional autonomy, though independence will remain out of the question.\n\nMost members of these parties have happily welcomed the news, but some most fanatic nationalists, such as Léonard Rodier of Aquileia and Giulio Beakolini of Wingbardy, either remained sceptical or continued to demand full independence. His Majesty believes they too will calm down in time once he passes further reforms."
 imperial.135.a:0 "Don't get too rowdy now..."
 imperial.136.t:0 "The Election"
 imperial.136.d:0 "Holding elections for the first time in a country that is used to monarchism and rule by nobility is not easy. Doubly so when the country in question spans half a continent.\n\nIt was a massive operation, with tens of thousands of government officials getting to work, preparing polling booths across the Empire in every single city, town and village. The Emperor had hired several republicans, many of them former prisoners and some even former members of NRP, to offer him and his government advice on how to accomplish the task. Thankfully, the republicans already had plans for a pan-Griffonian election, for it had been their dream for decades. They therefore eagerly helped and soon enough the plans were proceeding on schedule.\n\nWhile the elections were being prepared, candidates began to campaign, trying to attract voters to their cause. This election would decide the make-up of the Imperial Parliament as well as regional assemblies, meaning the campainging was nation-wide. Soon enough, it was clear two parties would dominate the vote: the conservative Kaiserpartei led by Eckhard Wiesner and the liberal Volksfront party of Edwin van Cleef. The former did not want radical change and thought that patience was needed, and also advocated for a powerful Emperor who would keep the parliament and the courts of law in check. They had many religious members among their ranks too and hoped to preserve the power of the clergy to some extent. Primarily, they attracted rural voters who were opposed to radical change but were still loyal to His Majesty. The latter had been an outlawed organization before being legalized by Grover VI, who advocated democratic rule, both nationally and regionally, and wished to further limit the powers of the Emperor, eventually turning it into a ceremonial position. However, they no longer desired a proper republic without a monarch like in the past, either as a gesture of friendship to the Emperor, or because they didn't want to be outlawed again. Young urbanites and workers were their most loyal voters.\n\nNow the day of election has finally arrived, and crowds are filling polling booths, eager to take part in the historical landmark event. The gargantuan task of counting tens of millions of votes began after the booths were closed. But eventually, the results would be revealed."
 imperial.136.a:0 "The Kaiserpartei secures a majority!"
 imperial.136.b:0 "The Volksfront secures a majority!"
 imperial.137.t:0 "The Death Of A Titan"
 imperial.137.d:0 "Soon after Grover's coronation, it seemed like Eros' old age finally caught up to him. When before he had been diligent and determined, now he withered before everyone's eyes, as if he had lost the blessing of Boreas which had kept him alive so long. For a time he acted as Grover's closest advisor, before he eventually suffered another stroke. It was clear to everyone he did not have much longer to live.\nOne day His Majesty decided to pay a visit to his dear mentor and former regent. When Eros, lying in bed, saw him enter, he asked "Grover? Why are you here? You have more important things to do than to visit me, I am sure."\nGrover chuckled and sat beside his bed. "My schedule is actually free, mister Eros. I wanted to see how you're doing, and maybe chat for a while."\n"If you insist," the old griff said and sighed. The two talked for a while, with Grover telling of his reign, and Eros nodding in approval. "You will be remembered fondly by future generations, I am sure," he said. "Unlike me."\nGrover raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean? You're a conqueror who rivals Grover I! It was you who saved the Empire from certain doom, and did everything you could to restore its greatness."\n"I was a zealous tyrant who destroyed nations and reunited Griffonia with iron and blood. I fear what judgement Boreas will pass on me. But remember this, your majesty. All the terrible things I did, I did so you wouldn't have to."\nIt dawned on Grover how Eros had sacrificed everything for the Empire, and for him. He never had a wife, he never had much wealth, and he had given all his vast power to him. Now, the mightiest griffon on Griffonia was but a sickly shadow of his former self. He pouted and clasped the old priest's claw.\n"Eros, if I may be honest... it would pain me if history were to remember you as a terrible person. I know the truth about who you are. You're not a tyrant. You... you're the father I never had. I may not influence the gods, but at the very least I can change the minds of the people. They should look up to you, not hate you."\nEros smiled wearily, and with the little strength he had, grasped Grover's claw. "I appreciate it. But really, don't waste your time on me. I never cared much for earthly reputation. Simply seeing you grow up was all I ever needed in life. And now, my duty is fulfilled. I want nothing else."\nGrover smiled as well. "Fine. How about I just commission a statue of you? I'm sure you'll love it."\nEros let out a chuckle. "If you insist."\nThen Grover embraced him, which caught him by surprise, but he weakly hugged back nevertheless. "I'll come visit again as soon as I am able," Grover promised.\nBut when he came on the following day, the bed was empty. The Archon had joined his father in the heavenly mountains, among fountains of gold."
 imperial.137.a:0 "Rest in peace, old friend..."
 imperial.138.t:0 "The Griffenheim Protests"
 imperial.138.d:0 "As Grover VI looked out upon the rabble of protestors and dissidents before him from his vantage point at the Imperial palace, he felt as if the ghosts of 978 were coming to haunt the Empire once again, this time with the intent of bringing it down for good. Grover knew that some reforms were necessary, it is impossible to resist against the flow of time, but as he saw the seeds of a revolution being planted before his very eyes, he knew that tolerating these radicals would be the first step on a long road that would lead to his death. The radicals would bleed the Empire dry through compromise, and once they inevitably grew dissatisfied no matter how much was conceded, they would pounce upon his weakened nation, plunging the continent into another war.\n\nShould the events of 978 repeat themselves, hundreds of thousands of lives would be sacrificed at the altar of republicanism, as the Griffonian Republic had done all those years ago, achieving naught but death and wanton destruction in the end. The sheer intensity and scale of modern warfare had scarred Griffonia over the past few years, perhaps permanently. And Grover could not tolerate the possibility of subjecting his citizens to decades of warfare once more due to his inaction, however slim said chances might be.\n\nThe army would clear out the protesters while he consulted his closest advisors with what reforms would be necessary to keep the empire together. The lives of the few radicals who refused to stand down would be a small price to pay for averting another decade of strife."
 imperial.138.a:0 "We'll see how brave they truly are."
 imperial.139.t:0 "The Crackdowns"
 imperial.139.d:0 "The Reichsarmee moved into Griffenheim with the speed and efficiency expected of a force that had fought its way across half of Griffonia. Perfectly coordinating with the other units of the army occupying similar sites of protest across the empire. The elements of the army chosen for this operation had been specifically selected for their discipline and restraint, as the Kaiser himself had given strict orders that no griffon was to be harmed unless they violently resisted attempts to stop the protests. Griffonia already had enough republican martyrs, and he had no desire to create any more.\n\nWhen the army informed the protesters that their gathering had been declared illegal, the majority of them decided that living to fight another day was far preferable to facing the hardened soldiers of the Reichsarmee that now flooded into the city. Working in conjunction with riot police, the streets of every city in Griffonia where protests had been active were cleaned out, and in a remarkably peaceful manner. A few deaths had been unavoidable, as radical elements of the protestors refused to stand down, but all in all, it was a clean and efficient operation. But such methods cannot sustain an empire forever, and the entire continent waited to see what the Emperor's next action would be."
 imperial.139.a:0 "A fitting lesson if there ever was one."
 imperial.140.t:0 "The Arrests"
 imperial.140.d:0 "After a few days of uneasy peace across the empire since the armed forces forcibly put an end to the protests, the army made its next move. The protests themselves had been primarily organized and led by various student groups across the empire, and over the past few days, the army and police had been tirelessly working to identify the most dangerous groups and individuals amongst them. Once said threats had been identified, the army moved swiftly to arrest and detain them.\n\nUnits of the army surged across the Empire as soon as the order was given, breaking into secret meeting places and houses to round up the leaders of the movement as quickly and efficiently as possible. If even a few were to escape the army, their sway over the protestors would most likely allow them to use the arrests as kindling for the flames of revolution and cause far more trouble than the protests had ever done. But no such future came to pass, as the army managed to arrest every griffon of importance within the movement, leaving the rest of the protestors without any clear leadership to coordinate between the disparate groups that had united for the protests."
 imperial.140.a:0 "A few days in prison will cool their heads."
 imperial.141.t:0 "Muzzling The Press"
 imperial.141.d:0 "The government's reaction to the recent protests had not only created a great deal of unrest within the more liberally minded griffons of the Empire but had also whipped the media into a frenzy. The newspapers and even some radio stations were scrambling to get statements from army personnel and to secure interviews with protesters. As the media's attention became more and more focused on the protests, the message of the protesters was amplified and allowed to spread to millions of griffons outside of the major cities of the Empire, causing a new wave of discontent.\n\nAlthough the Emperor had a degree of tolerance for criticism of himself and the government from the media, the situation had deteriorated to the point where allowing the media to spread whatever falsehoods they liked was inviting disaster. As such, a new Imperial decree has temporarily suspended the freedom of the press, and the state now has final approval of anything put into the newspapers or broadcasts across the airways. The Emperor hoped that, with the spread of subversive information stopped, the message of the protestors would soon be forgotten."
 imperial.141.a:0 "That's one headache dealt with."
 imperial.142.t:0 "The Reforms of Grover VI"
 imperial.142.d:0 "Although the Emperor had no desire to give in to the demands of the protestors, from the very start of the crisis it was clear to him that the Empire would not survive without reform. Continuing from where the previous regent Gabriella left off, his majesty Grover VI announced the dissolution of the council of nobles. Although this was not as large a blow to the power of the nobility as it appeared, with the council being replaced by an advisory body that was, although more inclusive of different social classes than the previous body, still primarily composed of nobles. Despite this, the new council provides the common griffon with much more political representation that the previous arrangement and the news seem to have mostly calmed down the former protesters."
 imperial.142.a:0 "To a safer Empire!"
 imperial.143.t:0 "The Reforms of Grover VI"
 imperial.143.d:0 "Continuing the legacy of the previous regent, Grover VI has passed several reforms broadening the power of the common griffon within the Empire. In conjunction with the Archons, the Emperor has announced that the Archonates would be stepping back from direct governance to allow the representatives of the common griffon more say in the rule of the empire. Citing the impressive progress in moral character and piety the nation has made under the rule of Eros, the future role of the Archonate will be a more advisory one, though if push came to shove they could still have a great deal of influence on legislation, as they have both great sway within the halls of government, and the power to send proposed legislation for review by the emperor himself if they feel it endangers the moral character of the Empire.\n\nAdditionally, a smattering of token reforms put some barriers between the Temples and the government, granted limited recognition to regional dialects of the official language of the empire, as well as allowing some of the less distasteful religions to practice their beliefs openly."
 imperial.143.a:0 "To a safer Empire!"
 imperial.144.t:0 "The New Kaiserpartei"
 imperial.144.d:0 "The Kaiserpartei has been the nominal controlling party within the Reichstag of the Empire ever since it was established. Despite this, the party itself serves as little more than a rubber-stamping group for legislation pushed by the nobility and the Emperor. Initially formed as an attempt at creating a popular party that would convey the benefits of the Emperors autocratic rule to the citizens of the Empire during the rule of Grover V, the party quickly fell in public opinion, maintaining its majority through a combination of biased voting laws and a few electoral "nudges" from the nobility. But the changing demographics of the Griffonian Empire have rendered the current status quo intolerable, and if if the Kaiser is unable to present a strong democratic front supporting his rule, his position would grow very tenuous with time.\n\nThusly, the Kaiser himself has sent a letter to the leaders of the Kaiserpartei, thanking them for their service, and asking them to step aside and allow the Emperor's preferred candidates to take over the party. The Kaiserpartei itself will refocus on the clear and demonstrable benefits the Kaiser's rule has brought to the Empire, as well as providing intelligent and well-researched counter-arguments to the most common republican screeds that can be found shouted on the streets. With any luck, the Kaiserpartei might be able to make Grover VI the most popular Kaiser the Empire has ever seen, or at the very least make the idea of an armed revolution unpalatable to the republicans."
 imperial.144.a:0 "Reform is coming!"
 imperial.145.t:0 "The Kaiser's Speech"
 imperial.145.d:0 "His Majesty Kaiser Grover VI took to the airwaves for the first time during his reign today, responding to the various criticisms recently laid at his government by the student protestors. The Kaiser expressed his sincere desire to be more connected to his subjects, and to take their desires into account while ruling the Empire, but also stressed the importance of preventing a repeat of the great tragedy that befell the Empire during the revolution. Indeed, the only thing that the republicans had accomplished in the end was spilling the blood of the griffons they claimed to represent, sending a generation to die at the barricades for their refusal to accept the Kaiser's god-given right to rule over all of Griffonia.\n\nThe Kaiser claimed that he would not rule with an iron fist, and promised that further reforms were being worked on, warning his subjects to beware any radicals promising a great deal of change through violent revolution. The Empire would change as it moved into a new era of modernity, but that was no excuse to simply charge forward with reckless abandon. The Kaiser ended his speech by urging his subjects to have patience as the Empire adapted to the challenges it faced in this new era, and by reminding them that progress must always be tempered by restraint, lest the whole Empire unraveled into chaos once more."
 imperial.145.a:0 "Hurrah for the Empire!"
 imperial.146.t:0 "The Reichskanzler"
 imperial.146.d:0 "Eckhard Wiesner, the leader of the Kaiserpartei, has officially assumed the title of Reichskanzler today at the behest of the Emperor. After a long ceremony in which he promised to uphold the laws and principles of the Empire to the highest degree and a personal oath of loyalty to the Emperor himself. Although it was not done through an election as many would have liked, many griffons are nevertheless happy that the Emperor has chosen to delegate some of his powers to a representative of an ostensibly democratic party. Though Eckhard is unlikely to challenge the Emperor on any of his commandments, he would do his very best to advise the Emperor on how to better accommodate the wishes of his subjects, and how to use his great power to the greatest benefit of the Empire.\n\nEckhard was not one to waste time, however, and immediately after his appointment ceremony had finished, he set out to accomplish the program of limited reform that the Kaiserparty espoused. To achieve a balance between the newly made democratic institutions of the Empire and the absolute authority of the Kaiser."
 imperial.146.a:0 "We are certain he will do a great job."
 imperial.147.t:0 "Controlled Opposition"
 imperial.147.d:0 "As the Kaiserpartei now possesses a majority within the Reichstag, and with the position of Reichskanzler firmly in the claws of their leader, there is little that the other parties could do to challenge their power. But despite the Emperor's preference for autocratic rule, he knew that the illusion of a democratic opposition to his rule had to be maintained at the very least, and there is no better opposition than one you control. A few choice bribes here, a few grants of land there, and suddenly the leaders of the opposing parties within the Reichstag were very accepting of his suggestions. Not to say that he completely dominated their agendas, that would be pointless, but the more radical elements of their programs would be scaled back. Slowly moving the idea of a fully republican Empire from a serious idea to be discussed, to a radically unthinkable proposal that no griffon in their right mind would espouse.\n\nManaging the Empire would certainly be easier if his opponents wasted their time debating with the Kaiserpartei within the Reichstag instead of organizing against him. Sometimes, he would even let them propose legislation that the Kaiserpartei would work into a more reasonable form to be implemented. Allowing the opposition a few irrelevant victories would be a fine way of dispersing their anger."
 imperial.147.a:0 "Useful tools."
 imperial.148.t:0 "Freedom For Most"
 imperial.148.d:0 "As the Griffonian Empire expanded, it was inevitable that vast amounts of soldiers and political dissidents would be imprisoned due to the extreme ideological differences between the Empire and the wider continent. Many had expected that these prisoners would languish in imprisonment for years before being released, and their status was especially controversial in the areas the Empire had most recently reconquered. But in a rather surprising announcement, the Emperor himself declared that the time had come for Empire to heal the wounds that had driven it apart for so many years, and that he would be granting those guilty of lesser crimes against the Empire a pardon for their actions. A few days later, the largest release of prisoners in the entire history of the Empire, and perhaps the world, occurred. The worst offenders would be kept incarcerated, of course, there was no need to endanger the populace by letting too many communists out after all.\n\nAlthough this limited release might have disappointed some of the more hardline progressives within the Empire, for most it was a chance to reunite with loved ones that had been missing in the Imperial prison system for years, or even decades. The day of the release was marked with celebrations across the Empire, and the Emperor himself delivered a speech on the radio, reminding the newly released criminals that his kindness was not infinite and that he would not be so generous to any who abused his kindness to return to a life of sedition and crime."

 grover.1.t:0 "Meeting the Emperor"
 grover.1.d:0 ""Grover, my child, could you please come out from your room?", the newly minted regent of the Empire, Gabriela Eagleclaw pleaded once again to the closed door. It was a grand success of politics to have come this far, for sure, and the look on Eros' face was priceless, but Gabriela now had a more personal conundrum to deal with. The young Emperor must be protected from things he could not truly understand yet.\n\n"Where is d-daddy? I want my daddy back!", the young Grover sobbed in his chambers. Gabriela could have easily gotten the door opened, but she didn't want to force the poor chick. She had to be motherly. "Grover, I will explain everything if you allow me to come inside. I promise it will be better.", she spoke calmly and slowly.\n\nThe little scheme was a success, and the doorway slowly opened. Gabriela did not have a moment to observe the insides before she was pounced on by her weeping nephew. Quickly, she embraced Grover and placed a claw on his head, comforting as best as she knew. "Mo- A-auntie Gaby? Why can't daddy come back? He was okay some time ago..."\n\nNogriff relished the experience of death, Gabriela thought inwardly. "My dear nephew... Your father was strong, and wise, but... he is in a better place now. Which means you are the Emperor now. And I will be your regent."\n"Re-ject? What is that?"\n"It means I will be handling your more difficult duties until you grow up, and become a proper adult. Your father would have wanted this. He was a very dear friend to me, too."\n"Okay... but I still miss daddy."\n"We all do, but we cannot spend all day crying. There is much work left to be done. Would you like to come with me to the throne room?"\nThe little Emperor's eyes brightened at the mention of the throne room. Gabriela knew he was very fond of the rich decorations.\n"A-alright. I think I am ready to go now."\n"Very good, my child. Make yourself presentable and we'll get going.""

 grover.2.t:0 "The Emperor's Education"
 grover.2.d:0 "Gabriela patiently stood in the hallway in front of the dressing room, waiting for her nephew and future Emperor to emerge. Already the time has come for young Grover to begin his studies. He was slightly forlorn about losing his free time, but accepted with surprising maturity the responsibilities he would be subjected towards. Gabriela felt very attached to Grover, and felt disappointed in herself that she did not yet have children of her own. If they were precocious and adorable like her nephew, she'd find a husband immediately! Unfortunately, very few could meet her expectations. Before she could continue her train of thought, the door opened and Grover stepped out.\n\n"Ah, your majesty. You look quite satisfactory in your uniform.", Gabriela complimented, hoping to reduce the nervousness she knew Grover felt.\n"It's rather uncomfortable, auntie. Do I have to wear it?", Grover pleaded and stretched the collar of his shirt.\n"Clothes make the griffon, dear nephew. I assure you that in good time, you'll get used to them very much. Now, have you taken all the materials I told you to prepare?"\n"Yes, auntie. I am ready.", he retorted meekly.\n"Very good, my child. Now then, you should know that I have brought the finest tutors from Readewetter to teach you everything you'll need to know, such as history, arts, etiquette, rulership, economics, faith and more. Of course, you'll be given a proper pace so you don't feel burdened, but make no mistake, your studies are very important.", Gabriela finished her speech.\n"I know, aunt Gaby. But... won't you teach me too?", the young Emperor implored.\n\nThose small words struck Gabriela's heart more than she wanted to admit. If it were possible, she would educate her nephew by herself, but lately all sorts of distractions and responsibilities cut into the already small amount of time she could spare for Grover. He was, of course, quite capable being on his own, but no child should bear the weight of absent parents.\n"I... When my schedule is free, I will make time for you, my child. I promise." She spoke earnestly, hugging her nephew. He didn't respond after that, taking his time to appreciate Gabriela's motherly embrace.\n"Alright, dear nephew. We don't want you to be late for your first class, yes?"\n"No, auntie. I will go now.", and with that, the future Emperor departed in the opposite direction. Gabriela continued standing for a while, smiling at the increasingly smaller figure of her nephew. He shall make us all proud, she knew this."

 grover.3.d:0 "Gabriela was delighted to have a private dinner with her dear nephew. Responsibilities and stress have only piled up, and she was aching for these little moments of respite. Had she known that ruling a vast state, much larger than her fiefdom, entailed this much paperwork, perhaps she'd consider giving Eros a chance. Of course, none of that would happen, and the peers' rights will be secured. Taking a careful bite of the Macawian watermelon slice, she turned her attention to the young Emperor, who seemed a little distraught.\n"My child, how are your studies? Are you progressing well?"\n"Uhh, yes, auntie. Everything is fine.", Grover responded rather unconvincingly, fiddling with his dessert. Gabriela might not have children of her own, but she could tell when someone was being evasive. Still, he was young and could be excused, but such habits must be excised before they would become troublesome.\n"Your grace, you remember our talk we had about falsehoods?"\n"I, I... yes, auntie. I remember. It's just that... I don't want to disappoint you.", he spoke in a low, embarrassed tone. "M-Mister Longbeak has caught me sleeping at his class. I can explain."\n\nGabriela did not expect such a thing. At worst, she'd consider that her nephew was pulling pranks, but this seemed rather innocuous. "Nephew dearest, are you having troubles sleeping? I hope you're not having nightmares again."\n"No, auntie. Last week, when I was at the Palace Library, I borrowed a copy of "Bygone Griffons of Greatness". It was so interesting, I could read it all night!", he cowered a little when he saw his aunt's disapproving gaze, "Not that I did that or anything... but the lives of the past Emperors are so fascinating, I wondered how could I be as great like my ancestors. And to be honest, mister Longbeak's class is rather boring.", Grover finished quietly while swallowing the last piece of his Aquileian chocolate éclair.\n\nGabriela pondered for a while on this knowledge. While sleeping during class was certainly a bad habit, the fact that the young Emperor showed such interest in history suggested a certain cleverness that his friends didn't share. Thus she made her decision.\n"Grover, you will not be disciplined. However, you will make up for what you missed, on your new class." He stared in confusion. "I think that you're ready to begin studying history. Mister Longbeak's services will not be required anymore for the time being, but I don't want to hear again that you're being tardy, alright?"\n"I-Yes, auntie! I won't let you down!""

 grover.4.d:0 "Grover had a keen feeling something was amiss today. There was nogriff to greet him after he exited his chambers, and the guards were missing, as well. He checked neighbouring rooms for any occupants, to no avail. For a moment he thought that when he wished for everygriff to disappear, it came true, but ultimately dismissed it as ridiculous. Passing next to the deserted Imperial Throne room, Grover went for the banquet hall. Surely, there would be at least something to eat if nogriff is around? Pushing the wide double doors outward, he did not expect what happened afterward.\n\n"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GROVER!"\n\nThe young Emperor went slack jawed at the spectacle. There was auntie Gabriela, many of his teachers, and even the palace servants! Many of them held wrapped presents in the claws, with smiles on their faces. He couldn't remember the last time he received so many congratulations! Rushing to hug his aunt, he beamed at her: "Aunt Gaby! What is this all about?", he asked in astonishment.\n"It is your tenth birthday, my dear nephew.", she retorted, stepping aside to show a mouthwatering chocolate cake with many strawberries from Strawberry Duchy, and ten candles waiting to be extinguished. "We've all gathered here to wish you the very best, and celebrate in style this momentous occasion. Now, go ahead and make a wish.", nudging him towards the table.\nOf course! How could Grover forget about his birthday? Thus he went forward, and blew the candles out. His wish would have to wait, for a more opportune time. Afterward, he spent many hours mingling with other griffons, who waited in a line just to give the Emperor a token gift and best wishes. The row of griffons seemingly never ended, as more and more arrived with each hour, important figures in the Empire, as well as his friends.\nFinally, once everygriff has left the banquet hall, Grover could have a seat and enjoy a slice of the exquisite cake with his only close family member.\n"I didn't think there would be so many guests, auntie. Am I really that important?"\n"Of course you are, my child. As the future Emperor of us all, many will seek to court your favour. It is up to you to determine whose pledges are genuine, and whom are merely plotting to use you for their ends. You'll learn in time, however."\nGrover knew that being an Emperor wouldn't be simple, but there was still so much to master. Still, he felt confident that he could make it. He was given everything he needed, and his aunt made sure nogriff could harm him.\n"I will be the best Emperor there was, auntie. I won't let you down.""

 grover.5.t:0 "Spoils of War"
 grover.5.d:0 "Gabriela was pleased to hear of the newest Imperial conquest. Another upstart, insolent pretender crushed, another territory returned to the rightful Imperial rule. Now the bureaucrats would move in to administer the region as the garrison kept order, but the matter remained of knights who were taken as prisoners of war. Traditionally, their fate would be determined by the Emperor, but with the current circumstances, young Grover would simply read a previously written decision. Everything would be simple and proper.\n\nThe Imperial Throne Room saw a bustle of activity, as the prisoners were brought in before the Emperor, awaiting their fate. Gabriela had to admit, her nephew may have only begun growing up, but already he seemed like a true ideal of a ruler. The captives didn't seem to be too enthusiastic as Grover recited a speech written by his aunt, and looked desperate enough to try to escape, if it weren't for the numerous guards. Soon, their sentences would be rendered, and Maar would decide their punishment in the afterlife.\n\n"...by the powers of Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius, I, the august Emperor Grover, declare you to be conscripted for Our service, and should your loyalties stand true, your holdings shall be returned and preserved for ages to come."\n\nGabriela blinked in confusion, as her train of thoughts derailed. This wasn't how she instructed her nephew! Even the knights seemed rather surprised as they issued their pledges, soon after taken away by the Palace Guards. She had to speak with Grover, but carefully. Surely, he had a good reason for acting on his own, as Gabriela approached the throne.\n"Your grace, why have you commanded them to your service? You know their fidelity is suspect, and could rebel as soon as they are left to their own machinations." The young Emperor set aside the heavy crown before responding: "We cannot always be heavy clawed on our subjects, auntie. They have done wrong, yes, but I believe they can be redeemed. We'll keep an eye on them, but if we show that we can be merciful, perhaps others will see fit to submit instead of fighting. Nogriffon has to die."\n\nGabriela was astounded by this mature outlook. Certainly, she wasn't happy sending soldiers to their deaths, nor introducing rationing among the citizens, but they had a duty to help restore the Empire proper. Just as she remembered in her young days.\n"Your wisdom is notable, my dear nephew. I can only hope that we can avoid unnecessary bloodshed.""

 grover.6.d:0 "Gabriela felt that with the recent ongoings, her precious time with nephew dearest was becoming sparsely thin. Sometimes she bemoaned her claws-on approach, but the state was her primary concern. Once Grover was old enough, and that day was rapidly approaching, he would have a stable nation, and there won't be a repeat of 978. Only then could Gabriela enjoy her well earned retirement. After ascertaining his location from a passing servant, she made her way to the Palace Gardens, where a most unexpected occasion was taking place.\n\nThere stood the young Emperor, holding claws with a griffoness. Gabriela narrowed her eyes at this... intruder. Certainly, her bearing and outfit suggested a noble upbringing, but the way she looked at her nephew suggested a more ignoble goal. This had to be broken up before anything official occurred. Making her way past the carefully trimmed hedges, she was quickly noticed by the pair.\n"Auntie Gaby! You have to meet my companion, she is the daughter of the baron of..."\nBut the Duchess gave little heed to what Grover was saying. She gave this little trollop, with her insincere smile and grabbing claws, her most scornful gaze, the one she was fond of using on uppity aristocrats who were getting a bit too self-indulgent. It didn't take long for the would-be Empress to make quick excuses and depart. Gabriela did not enjoy her victory for long before her nephew demanded answers.\n"Auntie, why did you do that? She wasn't harming me, we were just talking!", Grover complained with anger behind his words.\n"Grover, my child, you know I care for you more than anything else. I've lived long enough, and saw more than you can imagine. She was just using you for her own goals, no doubt on the instructions of her family. Many would sell their firstborn just so they could be related to the ruling family, and my intention was only to protect you."\n"I wasn't going to let myself be used, auntie! I'm not a child anymore!"\n"I have no doubts of your intelligence, nephew. But you must be aware that in these circles, even a suggestion of courtship could be taken the wrong way. You'll find a fine partner some day, no doubt, but now you are still vulnerable.", she moved in to place a claw on his shoulder.\n\nGrover pondered on these words for a while. "I understand, auntie. I just miss my friends, and the loneliness gets overwhelming at times."\n"It's never easy being at the top, Grover. This is something you'll have to handle on your own.""

Soon enough he would take up the rein and chain of commanding, and she would watch from afar, in peaceful retirement, as Grover would rule justly and secure a bright future for all griffons, even for the ones who had some seditious thoughts. But before that day would come, Gabriela still had some lessons to share.\n\n"Auntie, I regularly attend the temple services, I already know about the Triarchy."\n"I am not claiming you are ignorant, my dear child, but some things should be learned from an... unbiased perspective." Gabriela briefly pondered on her old nemesis, Eros. It gave her such satisfaction to have replaced him with a much less temperamental griffon. "I know many priests and they're fine and upstanding griffons, but they can get rather blindsided when it comes to piety. Now, tell me what you know about the Triarchy."\n\nGrover seemed bored as he recited: "Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius created the griffons and blessed them with intelligence, strength, wisdom and physical forms. Maar, the eternal deceiver, attempted to corrupt the griffons, but was cast down before he could accomplish his fiendish task. Afterward, the gods remained in the heavens ever after, and their word is spread by the priesthood. The priests are led by prelates, which are in turn led by archons. Archons are chosen by a secret ritual known only to the few."\n"You've been very meticulous, my nephew, but some things have been obscured from you. For example, many griffons pay fealty to local deities, such as Eviliana and Sycaecia. Others gather in heretical cults that spread violence and nonsense, like the followers of Maar. But there is a grain of truth in their proselytising. Minor deities are just as worth celebrating, and Maar had a crucial role in creating griffons that most overlook. Of course, one can never be sure what is true about the mythical."\n\nGrover listened with rapt attention to Gabriela's words. He didn't think often about questioning his betters on their knowledge, but it seems that the larger picture is often obscured. "It was most intriguing, auntie."\n"When you formally ascend to the throne, dear Grover, you'll have much to pay attention to. Always be vigilant.""

Grover remained silent.\n"Do you know what a regent is, child?" Eros asked with the warm voice of a wise grandpa. Grover shook his head in response.\n"You see, you're the Emperor, a big boss who gets to tell everyone what to do. But you are too young yet. While you grow up, study and play, I will be ordering others around and taking care of unexciting paperwork. How does that sound?"\nGrover frowned. "My daddy was Emperor. Where is daddy, old bird?"\nEros' smile faded away. How would he explain death to a four-year-old?\n"Your father... he's with Boreas now.

Perhaps one day they would be ready to die by his side.\n\n"Your majesty, come here," Eros beckoned.

He turned on the electric light and took out a book and a bar of Grover IV's famed chocolate from his bag. He then sat down, put on his glasses, and opened the thick book. It was called "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", but out of all the great conquerors and kings, he found his ancestor, Grover I, to be by far the most interesting. He seemed almost divine in his perfection and glory.\n\nThe door opened with a creak. Startled, Grover looked up and saw the janitor starting at him. "Y-your majesty?" she asked in confustion. "Aren't you supposed to be sparring with Archon Proteus?"\n"I can explain! Just don't tell anyone!" Grover pleaded.\n\nHalf an hour later he was in the sparring room, his head hung low from shame and tears in his eyes. Proteus shook his head in disappointment. The other Archons finally entered and Proteus greeted them. "I am glad you could come. Grover here was skipping from my sparring class! I do not know what to do with him."\nErion sneered. "I knew it.

"Tell me, child, why did you do this?"\n"I-I don't like sparring," he explained. "I'm bad at it and I never get better at it, no matter how hard Proteus tries. Same with fencing. W-what's the point, even? Everyone uses guns nowadays."\nEros sighed. "The point of this exercise isn't to make you a good fighter, it's to keep you physically fit and healthy, so you don't end up like your father. Why didn't you tell Proteus you don't like it?"\n"B-because I have to get good at everything. So I can be like Grover I."\nEros chuckled. "Your majesty, no Grover was ever perfect. Not even Grover I. If you're hopeless at close combat, you can train something else. Say, how does archery sound?"\nGrover lifted his gaze. "Archery? That... sounds good. I can try that."\n"Very well.

And even then, I would never deny your divine right to rule."\n"What of the other Archons?"\n"I swear to you, if any of them stand in your way, by Boreas I will rise from the dead and strangle them personally."\nGrover remained silent for a moment. "I know I can trust you, mister Eros. I suppose I just have to be patient."\n"Indeed. Now go to sleep. It's getting late and your studies will continue tomorrow. You still have much growing up to do.""

 grover.12.d:0 "Emperor Grover waved to the enthusiastic crowd from the top of his armoured car as it slowly rolled down the streets of Griffenheim, leading a long column of marching soldiers and vehicles. The older he got, the more often he appeared in public, but security measures remained strict. Every building along the way had been emptied and was guarded by Imperial Knights. But Grover did not feel anxious. Only a little shy, but also happy about his subjects and their adoration of him. Though in the back of his mind, he suspected they only loved him because of the spoils of war that were being presented in the parade. He glanced behind him, at trucks carrying hundreds of prisoners of war, foreigners from distant lands. Unlike the crowd, they were silent and downcast. He also thought how after the parade, the citizens would get back to work overtime in military factories, churning out weapons for his army.\n\nGrover returned to his home at the Palace with no incidences. Eros was there to greet him, almost proud that Grover had led a parade without him. While he smiled, Grover frowned, and wished to ask a question. The Archon was happy to answer.\n"Mister Eros, I know you are leading the army to many wars to reunite my father's Empire. But... is it worth all the suffering it causes?"\nEros' smile faded and he pondered silently for a moment. "A good and mature question. All this warmongering is indeed difficult to understand if you are young. But an old griffon like me remembers the good old days, before the Idol of Boreas was lost and everything fell apart. Back then, there was stability and prosperity among all of griffonkind."\n"So you want to relive the glory days of the Empire?"\nEros shook his head and placed his claw on Grover's shoulder. "No. I'll be dead before I can do that. I want you and your subjects to experience such a golden age."\nGrover smiled faintly for a moment. "Still... is it really worthwhile?"\n"Is the pain and toil of life worthwhile? Yes, as long as you are righteous and believe in the Gods, for they will reward you with paradise. So too will the reunification of the Empire be worth everything, as long as we believe in it."\nThe young Emperor nodded slowly, and wondered what life had been like when Eros was twelve like him. Surely it must have been amazing, for why else would the Archon be so zealous about restoring the Empire?"

He had just entered the Imperial Palace, a young griffoness with him, after a long day out in the city. His bodyguards followed him but kept their distance as His Majesty had requested. The chick looked around the courtyard in amazement, her eyes wide. "Wow, this place is even fancier from the inside! Such wonderful statues and fountains and gardens. Almost looks as good as you do," she said with a giggle.\nGrover smiled warmly and held her claw. "Maybe one day you'll get to live here too. I'm willing to give anything to you."\n"Anything? Even like... a fabulous new car? And a dress decorated with diamonds?"\n"Anything," Grover swore with determination.\n\nHe opened the door and entered inside, but stopped when he saw Eros, leaning on a walking cane, waiting for him and frowning. "E-Eros? I thought you'd be asleep by now!"\n"Grover, we need to talk. In private," he said, and turned to look scornfully at the griffoness, who hid behind the Emperor. "Begone, harlot! You do not belong here."\nAfter the initial shock, Grover boldly stepped forth. "Don't talk to her like that!" he shouted. Eros remained silent and glared at the chick.\n"Sweetie, I should leave. See you tomorrow," she said meekly, gave him a quick peck and left. Before Grover could say anything, Eros began to drag him along to his room, with surprising strength in his old arms.\n\n"Why did you do that?" Grover exclaimed, his high-pitched voice cracking. "Now she'll be too afraid to ever come here!"\n"You do not need her. She doesn't truly love you. You're too young to realize it, but she's after your wealth and prestige, nothing else."\n"Well I am old enough to decide who I spend my time with!"\n"Listen here, Grover. Do not give in to your desires. Your forefathers specifically avoided having more than one child to prevent succession wars. Because of this, the Empire has never been torn asunder by dynastic bickering."\n"It fell apart all the same," he mumbled.\n"No, the Empire still stands, and I am making sure it will remain so. Trust me, Grover, Eyr will ensure that one day you will find a partner who truly loves you. Someone who will stand by your side no matter what. Look in your heart and you will know that she is not that griffon."\nGrover remained humbly silent and gazed at the floor. "I... I suppose you're right. But she's so beautiful.

Out of curiosity, he peeked inside. There, the old griffon was sitting at his desk like always, hard at work with his papers. Grover smiled and admired how diligent he still was, despite being a frail bird who was over a hundred years old at this point. He turned to leave, worried that he'd be late from class.\n\nA loud thump came from the office. A chill went down Grover's spine and he stopped for a moment, before dropping his books on the floor and rushing inside. Eros had fallen on the floor from his chair. He seemed unconscious. Without hesitation, he immediately called for aid and went to revive the poor old griffon. His heart was still beating, but his claws were cold and he did not wake up, despite Grover's best attempts.\n\nThe courtly doctors examined Eros and concluded that he had suffered a mild stroke and fallen into a coma. They were unsure if he would wake up, and predicted he'd most likely die within days. The Imperial court soon erupted into chaos, with no one being entirely sure who was in charge now, and the other two Archons did their best to restore order. Grover did not let grief and worry overcome him and boldly stepped forth, saying he would rule in Eros' stead before he'd wake up. Despite him being under-aged, the Archons agreed to let him help them at the very least.\n\nWhile the expectations were low, Grover impressed everyone when he confidently began to fulfill Eros' duties, such as performing religious rituals, filling paperwork, issuing commands to the chief of staff, holding speeches, drafting legislation and meeting foreign dignitaries. He was shy and avoided confrontation, his vast knowledge made up for it.\n\nA week later a miracle occurred and Eros woke up from his coma. He almost jumped out of bed, fearing that the Empire had collapsed in his absence, only to discover that Grover had made him proud. Now he knew for sure that the Emperor was ready to rule."

Now Gabriela's time as the regent has come to an end. Undoubtedly there would be a sinecure given later on, but her thoughts were primarily concerned about returning to her estate in Readewetter and finally be free of endless responsibilities and sycophantic nobles. Perhaps she would write a book about her experiences for future emperors to consult. But first, she would meet Grover in his room. It would be impolite to keep your betters waiting, family or not, as Gabriela opened the ornate doors to the Emperor's room.\n\n"Auntie! It is so good to see you again!", her nephew exclaimed happily. He had gone a long way from a meek chick with his beak in the books. Even with her failing sight, Gabriela could see how he had grown up and succeeded.\n"Indeed it is the same for you, my dear child. I wanted to see you one more time before I depart from Griffenheim."\n"It is a shame you won't stay around. Is there anything that would convince you to stay?"\n"I think I've had enough of this city for a lifetime, nephew. My greying feathers could attest to that, at least."\n"It's just that I could still use your advice, auntie. The responsibility is much more... taxing than I imagined. I have to be aware of the ongoings in every part of Griffonia and beyond, and decide on matters that will impact thousands of griffons."\n\nGabriela suppressed the urge to roll her eyes, and led her nephew to the balcony. "Look at your city, my child. The people adore you, and respect you. They trust you to rule wisely and bring forth a new age of peace and prosperity. No more wars. No more strife. Everything we have done this far was for you... and it was very much worthwhile."\nThe Emperor leaned on the railing and pondered for a moment. "So it is, auntie. I will ensure everygriff can live together regardless of their cultural origins. Nogriff should fight his kin, and we shall all enjoy the culmination of our efforts."\nThe former regent said nothing as she stood behind her nephew, the pair watching together the setting sun descending behind the peaks of Brantbeak."

The two teams have shared what many would call an unfriendly rivalry ever since they first encountered each other on the hoofball fields 21 years ago. Ever since that climactic day, where the score ended up being a 6-6 tie the two teams have vowed to defeat the other.\n\nThe roster for both teams was considered phenomenal today, with many promising newcomers on both sides. Many expected that today's game would finally bring an end to the streak of stalemates that have plagued the two teams, as each team has yet to beat the other.\n\nAlas, it seems that today was not the day, with the match result ultimately being declared null and void by the referee. The problems started just 8 minutes in when the Yellowjackets managed to score an early goal against the Fowls. This early setback caused the Fowls to panic, and a few minutes later one of their star players, Herman Mudbeak, was disqualified after it was declared that picking up the ball and flying it into the other team's goal was not a legitimate move.\n\nThis string of setbacks continued to plague the fowls for the rest of the game, and finally came to a head just a scant 7 minutes from the end of the game, 4-2 in the Yellowjackets favor. It was then that the unconscious bodies of several prominent members of the Fowls were discovered. This lead to the unmasking of 3 changelings which had apparently infiltrated the Fowls in an attempt to sabotage their efforts. The stadium then erupted into a brawl between the supporters of the two teams, while the Yellowjackets and Fowls quickly left the scene.\n\nWhile this might be the most controversial match between the two teams yet, it is far from the last as a rematch has already been scheduled, with many eager fans pre-ordering their tickets as soon as the announcement came, although the Yellowjackets will be sporting an all-new team after the previous members were shot by their guards upon returning to their hotels."

The tide of gifts for the young ruler has been almost overflowing, with many nobles using this event as a chance to curry favor with the Emperor.\n\nBut it seems that among the flood of gifts, the Emperor's favorite comes directly from the embassy of the changeling lands. While this would normally not be a problem, as establishing strong ties with foreign allies is an important part of being Emperor, the gift itself was highly... unusual.\n\nWhile an exotic pet or expensive treasures might have been anticipated as gifts, what was not expected was a fully functioning Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger, decorated in the imperial colors. While this unorthodox gift was not a problem in itself, it seems that somebody forgot to secure the keys to the tank. The Emperor soon showed up, dragging the top tank aces of the Empire with him, and demanded that he be put into the driver's seat.\n\nWhat followed was an impromptu crash course on tank command, as the Emperor set out into the countryside along with his crew, only returning after a massive griffonhunt had been started. On a positive note, it seems that the young Emperor showed skill as a tank commander, and has displayed interest in increasing funding to the Imperial Committee for Armored Research and Development, demanding another tank for his next birthday."

But today was proving to be particularly difficult. As he sat in his office questioning a new hire about the recent debacle in the capital.\n\nApparently, the problems had started earlier that morning when gunfire could be audibly heard from one of the many abandoned buildings in the outskirts of the capital. After a team was sent to investigate the site was discovered empty, save for hundreds of bullet casings. Strangely enough, it seemed that both sides had used guns of the same make. It was not long after that an undercover officer reported in, stating that during his infiltration into one of the many banking cabals that control the capital he had been part of the events that morning.\n\nIt seems that during a meeting with the other members, they encountered changeling spies, who had apparently decided to utilize the same building as a meeting spot. What followed was a short gunfight before the two sides realized that, as per their weapons, they worked for the same employer, and promptly stopped shooting at each other.\n\nSaid employer was in actuality a front set up by the ministry of internal security and was apparently supposed to provide insight into the criminal world of Griffenheim.\n\nThis had come as a surprise to the director, as he had no records of ever supplying any changelings through that particular front. He ultimately chalked it up to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the capital, but it seemed that somehow he was responsible. In the end, only one decision was made.

Mistakenly many assumed that the treacherous communists had staged an uprising, or that a Wingbardian commando group had been sent to assassinate the Emperor.\n\nAs the Pony ran through the streets, they eventually reached the imperial palace, where they claimed to have information on a grave security threat. After eventually screaming their way in, they forced themselves into the imperial meeting room to speak to, or more likely scream at, the regent.\n\nBut as they opened the doors to the meeting room, the pony fainted out of shock and left the regent and changeling ambassador, which the regent had been meeting with, quite shocked. After recovering, the pony claimed that they had spotted changelings readying to attack and that they could be disguised as anyone, of course, this all happened in front of the changeling ambassador.\n\nThe pony was shortly escorted out and told to be more tolerant and friendly to other races."

Furthermore, tens of thousands of simple citizens travelled to Bronzekreuz to see the emperor.\n\nWhen the emperor arrived in his train, he was greeted by crowds around the train tracks for miles, organized in small groups of enthusiastic citizens or in stands. The Emperor Grover II Station was covered in banners and floral decorations and Count Ignatius personally welcomed him when he came out of his train. The Count was shocked to see his beloved emperor looking frail and tired but nevertheless, he warmly greeted him before kneeling. Grover smiled and personally helped him stand up before embracing him. Those near the two could hear the emperor say "Thank you, my friend". The ceremony continued with a small recital on the station's plaza with a chorus of puppies singing the Oath of Loyalty. Then, the emperor retired himself to his private residence at Houndsor Palace where he rested before attending a private feast in his honor.\n\nThe next day saw several changes in the planned events as the Emperor preferred to preserve his energy for the long journey ahead and therefore did not attend hunts and balls. The announcement caused some disappointment among the nobility and population but many praised the emperor for being so thoughtful towards his subjects at large. The emperor did, however, host several private audiences to personally receive the many delegations bringing gifts to him, warmly thanking each and every one of them.\n\nWhen time came for Grover to leave, he stopped before embarking on his train and turned towards Ignatius.

He was off to see the Duchess.\n\nGrover was announced by a chamberlain in lace cuffs. 'His Imperial Majesty the Emperor Grover the Fifth'. He entered the large room pierced in its south side by great windows looking over the gardens; it was magnificent, as he remembered it. Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw stood up and looked at him, beautiful as she ever was. "I take it you have come here to apologize", she said with a stern voice. "Whatever for?" He answered as she came facing him, closer and closer. "For not coming here sooner". They stared intensely into each other's eyes in a long and difficult silence, until they both burst out laughing.

"You know I don't think... I don't... Maybe this is... The last." He said, clutching his brandy in his claws, looking down into the glass. The fireplace was crackling quietly in front of their comfortable chairs. She looked at him with a face of deep understanding and regret, yet still smiling tenderly. "Don't mention these things.

Grover V looked exhausted and a bit pale, but it seemed the quiet of the manor did him well. The Grand Duke had a simple meal prepared, which would normally be considered a faux-pas.\n\nBefore the food arrived Gerlach started to talk. "Your Majesty," the Grand Duke said, his voice betraying the warm affection he felt for his friend, "how is your son, has he grown since I last saw him?"\n\n"Yes, Gerlach, he will be taller than me, Gods willing!"

As they grew closer, houses and homesteads began to be visible from the train car's window. Some of them very small and simple while others were bigger, perhaps housing several families and domestic animals. Eventually, the city came into view and the train started to slow down as they were nearing the new railway station built at the edge of the city.\n\nWhen the train arrived at the station, they were welcomed by a crowd of cheering griffons. The station behind them stood out almost as an anomaly, its modern style clashing with the city that looked as if it could have existed at the time of the first Grover. It was decorated with standards and ornaments bearing imperial colours. Within the station, a great clock imported from Yale was adorned with the imperial flag on top of the flag of Greifenmarschen.\n\nUpon exiting the car, his majesty was welcomed with another loud cheer from his subjects. The crowd was composed of citizens of all 'marches'. [Root.GetLeader], leader of the peasant council, then officially welcomed Grover V. After that, peasants dressed in traditional regional garbs offered his majesty products of their hard work, freshly baked bread from local grain along with salt, fruit and vegetables nicely arranged into a basket, and local sausage meat for him to taste. It may not have been luxurious but they were all the hallmarks of the peasant Republic which helped feed the empire.\n\nAround noon, council members showed his majesty the city. The sun had decided to show up and dispersed the fog, making the day much more pleasant. His majesty seemed a bit tired at times and needed to take short breaks along the way. Members of his entourage suggested skipping the rest of the tour. However, his majesty assured them it was fine. The tour ended in the local Temple of Boreas which dominated the city. Architecturally, it may not have been as splendid as the temples of Griffenheim but his majesty took time to pray there with his subjects nonetheless.\n\nThe day ended at city square where locals prepared a festival in his majesty's name, performing local songs, dances and tales. However, the emperor declined to dance and excused himself early in the evening. The following day, the population came in large crowds to see his majesty leaving and as the train began moving again, his majesty waved back to his subjects before a fit of coughing forced him to disappear inside the train."

But for now, it was back to what lay ahead.\n\nAs he looked out of the windows on the train, he looked down into the new Empire. Romau was unlike many of the other places in the Empire. Factories that were still a marvel in his younger days were now all around the ancient cities, their chimneys blowing out smoke. As they grew near, passing through some industrial areas, he could sense tension in the air. The industrial quarters offered little to the eye but squalor and the rickety trees planted around the train tracks added to the misery instead of hiding it. He saw angry crowds and at one point, a bottle came smashing into the train, causing the emperor to jump from his seat. Grover shook it off, however, as the train left the industrial area and began to pull into the station.\n\nAt the station, a mixed reception awaited the Emperor as he disembarked; Archon Erion XII with his entourage stood alongside senators led by the old Ravioli, who were flanked by citizen delegations from the whole city.\n\n"Welcome your Majesty! I trust the trip went well?" The Archon asked, seemingly eager to meet the Emperor.\n\nGrover only nodded, shivering from the cold, the hardship of the trip tearing at his body and mind. Grover turned, his attention caught by distant yells, unmistakably from protesters.\n\n"Pay no attention to the rabble! They have proven to be the complaining type lately. I half-expect them to blame us for the snow!" The Archon said awkwardly.\n\nGrover remained still and simply acquiesced. It was no time to embarrass the Romauans further. Duty called, after all, even if the duty was irritatingly smug. The Archon kept droning on, not noticing the Emperor dozing off before him. At least, he would only be there for a day...\n\n"-But you simply must come with me, your Majesty. I am sure that you will find Romau quite interesting.""

He asked the question on everygriffon's mind, "Your Majesty, how was your trip so far?"\n\nTo the surprise of all, Grover smiled and answered, "Your team did an excellent job. You managed to cut through some of the harshest terrain in the Heartlands and some of the views were astonishing." The crowd exploded into cheers and even Mikusian managed to relax for a minute to listen to Grover speak.

Inside the car, the Princess was faced with a pale and worn Grover, who sat heavily in his seat and invited her to sit down. Diellza, who had worshipped the Emperor ever since he reclaimed the throne and in her mind punished the revolutionaries, sat quietly down in front of him. They shared a brief semi-conversation, Diellza being too busy listening in silence to Grover as he spoke to make for much of a conversationalist, and after a few minutes Grover told her he had to depart due to his health, but that he wished her well.\n\nAfter merely five minutes, the Emperor's state visit was over, and Diellza was left standing at the station staring in silence after the departing train, too stunned to do much of anything, even as the staff quietly dispersed the crowd before she could explode in rage at anyone."

Were they too late?! He began to sniff the air, feeling Grover's scent clearly. No, it was too fresh, he had to be here. Slowly moving through the room, he carefully avoided stepping on the toys that lay scattered around it and soon reached the large bed. His scent was the strongest here, but where...?\n\nHe bent down, looking in under the bed and coming eye to eye with a terrified little boy who lay curled up deep under the bed, clutching one of his stuffed toys. In a few seconds his heart shattered, bleeding sorrow and anger into his soul, and he could only reach one paw in under the bed towards him.\n\n"My emperor," he whispered. "Don't be afraid. We're here, your faithful dogs are here. Those who wanted to use you are gone, you're safe now." He spoke as softly as he could as he tried to cajole the little boy out from under the bed, even as he felt himself growing more and more enraged. Was this the mettle of the griffons? Their own emperor, abandoned to huddle under his bed?! Every griffon in this cursed city should have filled the halls to fight to death to protect him! Unworthy curs, all of them!\n\nIt was first when Grover, who had seemed as though he was about to reach out to him, recoiled away with a whimper that Loudbark realized he had bared his teeth in rage. Slapping one paw over his mouth, he felt the rage turn to embarrassment and shame. "No, I didn't mean to scare you, I'm sorry, I'm not angry with you," he hastily assured Grover." Lying down properly, he kept his paw reached out and minded his teeth. In the end, when Grover came out, Loudbark gently sat him down on his bed and took his claws, smiling. "You're safe, my emperor. Nobody will ever hurt you again. This is Bronzehill's oath to you, now and forever.""

He placed his paw on it, his breath hitching as he felt the reverie fill him. What higher purpose could any dog ask for? What more glorious path was there?! Slowly pushing the door open, he stepped in with light steps and looked around. The room felt cavernous, like a temple to the most sacred, and in the corner, atop a large wardrobe, sat the one he had come for.\n"My emperor..." Kimball whispered, walking towards him with paws outstretched towards him.\n"S-stay back!" the Emperor ordered him and Kimball stopped at once, falling to his knees in humble supplication. "Who are you? Wh-where's..." The Emperor looked around in distress and Kimball fell to all fours.\n"I am Kimball Barking-Sun, your humble servant. Bronzehill heard your plight, and we came to defend you! Please, my Emperor, let us take you to safety!" he pleaded. When no answer was given, Kimball respectfully bowed his head and waited for a reply. His was not the role to question, but to obey, and he sat nicely in place, prepared to wait as long as the Emperor needed. Over a minute passed before Grover said anything.\n"W-what do you want?" he asked and Kimball looked up again.\n"To serve you, and to shield you from all who would hurt you." Kimball swore his oath at once. "And right now, I want to bring you out of here and to safety. That is all I wish. That is all any dog of Bronzehill wishes." After a while, the Emperor seemed calm enough to start climbing down. Yet, mid-climb, the wardrobe began to tip over from his weight. Kimball flew to his feet in an instant, catching the emperor and turning around just in time to get him out of the path of the falling wardrobe before it came crashing down on him.\n"Oh no! Are you okay?" The Emperor spoke in fright, and Kimball opened one eye to give him a small smile.\n"Perfectly fine... my emperor," he wheezed, giving him a thumbs up."

The little boy inside didn't need any more excitement right now, and he made sure to not make any hasty moves. The storming of the palace would have terrified anycreature, and he didn't dare to imagine how Grover would feel right now. It was a good thing that he didn't enter too quickly, as a female griff inside —his nanny no doubt— had reached for a fire poker when the door opened. Behind her stood the one they were here for, and Barnaby waved awkwardly at him.\n"Hello there, your Majesty. Do you remember me?" Grover peeked out from behind the nanny's skirts, his brow furrowing at first.\n"Barnaby?" he asked after a while, Barnaby nodding. Thank the gods, Grover remembered him. Sidestepping the nanny, he hunched down in front of Grover with a smile.\n"Everything has been really scary, hasn't it?" he asked Grover. "I've barely been able to sleep. Was it the same for you?" Grover nodded fervently in agreement. "Good thing you have your nanny here. Would– would you want to tell her to put that thing away?" he asked with an awkward smile and Grover pulled at the nanny's dress.\n"Don't hit him Johanna, he's nice," he said. Johanna rolled her eyes at him, though she did put the fire poker away.\n"Thank you," Barnaby told her. She'd have used it on him if needed, he had no doubt of this. "Hey, I think we should get out of here," he told Grover. "Do you want to come with me? It's a bit of a mess here, and I've got a place where you can stay for a little while until things calm down. Okay?"\n"Okay," Grover said and Barnaby, instinctively, reached out to him to pick him up and place him on his arm.\n"What, I can't have you walk on your own now, can I?" he asked Grover. He knew he should probably be more reverent, but he had been where Grover was, been a confused child, and he knew how many times he'd wanted simple affection and reliability. Decorum could come later, right now he'd make sure to be the dog he'd wanted to have when he had been in a similar position."

She felt ashamed of herself as well. When had she forgotten that a child was just a child? Grover shook his head after a while and Rosey smiled tenderly at him.

The palace that so long had projected a near divine power was pockmarked by shells and gunshots, dragging it forcefully down to the mortal world. How symbolic. He was deep in his musings as a soldier came up to salute him.\n\n"Sir, we've located the emperor," he said, Leer giving him a brief look before gazing out through the hole again.\n\n"I understand the poor child died in the fighting," he commented. "Buried under the debris... how sad." In the corner of his eye, he saw the soldier being taken aback, not answering. After a few seconds Leer looked back to him.\n\n"No sir, he is—"\n\n"I said, I understand he died in the fighting," Leer repeated heavily, staring the soldier down. The young griff withered under his harsh glare and backed down.\n\n"Ye– yes sir," he said after a while, echoing his order. "He died in the fighting."\n\n"Good." Leer turned back to the window again. "Make sure to double check this. There can be no doubt in this matter."\n\n"Yes sir..." The soldier turned around and left, Leer glancing after him. Weakling. He would need to be dealt with afterwards.\n\nThe empire had thought they could remove him, and they paid the price in full for it. Now, the glorious city was his, as was the throne, and nothing would be allowed to stand in his way from this moment on. Never again would weakness or complacency be allowed to shape the empire's fate, never again would the rot be left unaddressed.

When the republicans had stormed the city, she had tried to sneak him out, but they had been captured and thrown into this tiny room. She could only pray that they would not be as bloodthirsty as they had been thirty years ago, but who even knew with these griffs? A sound from the door made her look up and see one of them stand in the doorway, motioning for her to come to him. She wanted to refuse, but in the end stood up and stepped outside with him before he closed the door.\n"How is he?" the griffon asked and Johanna wanted to scoff.\n"Terrified and exhausted, what do you think?" she asked, snapping but keeping her voice down. "He thinks you're going to kill him."\n"Lovely." The griffon sighed. "Look, I'll make it brief. [Root.Getleader] is offering you a hundred thousand Idols to leave the boy behind. Leave him to us and don't look back. We'll let you go wherever you need, do whatever you wish and—"\n"Yo– you monster!" Johanna hissed, rage filling her. "How dare you?! I am not leaving him to you unless you're dragging me kicking and screaming away from him, and I'll claw out your eyes if you even—" She stopped suddenly as the griff took her claws and shook them.\n"Good," he nodded, even smiling at her. "Sorry but we needed to vet you. Here's the actual offer: he's not going to become emperor, he'll become a citizen like anyone else, but he needs a home. He knows you, and trusts you. We want to offer you a chance to take him with you. You'll both vanish into the night, and we'll arrange for a home and a pension for you two. Will you take him with you, will you make him your son, give him a new name and life?"\n"I, but– you...?" Johanna didn't know what to say at first, needing a few seconds to calm down.

The little boy walking among them stood out like a sore thumb, with his oversized coat and hat that drooped over his face. As they reached the train station, a sentry noticed them and waved for them.\n\n"You're with the fifth company aren't you?" he asked them before noticing something. "He ain't though," he deadpanned and pointed at the child. "Who is he?"\n\n"My brother in law's cousin's kid," one of the fighters said, the sentry blinking as he tried to follow what he had said. "My brother in law was a prick, and he moved his entire extended family here before it all went to Tartarus. Wanted to impress with his fancy new home and all. Poor kid's the only one left." He laid a protective claw over the kid's shoulder at this.\n\n"Oh." The sentry grimaced a little and nodded towards the boy. "Good luck kid. These are tough days for us all, but I hope things get better for you." The kid nodded quietly and the group got on a southward bound train. They had gotten a cabin to themselves and closed the door before anygriff said anything else.\n\n"So why are we doing this?" one of the fighters asked, looking towards the boy who now removed his hat, revealing the face of Grover VI.\n\n"Because the day I let a kid be responsible for what his dad did is the day I eat a grenade," the group leader told him and the others. "Biggest crime you can accuse this boy of is being cranky with his nanny. You okay, sport?" he asked Grover, who hesitantly nodded after a while. "Don't worry," the griff continued "When we reach our station I'll get you to my mother. You can stay there, and then we'll figure out what to do.

The boy had been terrified by the fighting, and had asked where the regent was several times, but Hera was patient.\n\n"I don't understand why I have to do this," he told her. "I don't think you're mean, I just..."\n\n"Your Majesty, who was the greatest emperor this empire has ever seen?" Hera asked gently as she sat by his side. As he answered that it was Grover I she nodded, her smile growing wider. "Exactly! And you know why? Because later emperors were limited. They had griffs around them demanding shares in the power, and who managed to worm their way into power. That's why your grandfather was so hamstrung for much of his reign, and why your father was powerless to stop the revolts against him. In the end, it was those who had stolen his power who had to put it down. After that, the emperor had to rely on them, and their power was secure. It wasn't about the emperor, it was about their own power, same as it was with you."\n\n"That's not true!" Grover exclaimed angrily, rushing to the defense of his old regent. Hera sat patiently, letting him fervently defend her predecessor, but when he was done she could only shake her head.\n\n"Then why did the Archon and the Duchess fight so over you?" she asked him. "If it was truly about their care, wouldn't they have shared caring for you? But they didn't, they only cared for power" Grover was stumped at this and, after a few seconds, stormed away from the table out onto the balcony. After a few minutes, Hera followed him, coming up behind him to place her claws on his shoulders. "I know it hurts, Your Majesty," she whispered in his ear, "but medicine tastes bitter.

"Or is it one of those 'adult things' that I'll understand when I'm older?"\n\n"Well now that you've said that, I would be a poor rector if I didn't try to explain," Mikusian chuckled. Unintentional or not, the dry wit surprised him. After a few seconds of musing he began to explain. "Think of it like this: once upon a time, a student here at the university was running late. He ran down this very road, and around the corner there, he crashed into a large stone vase that stood on a pedestal there. It fell over, crashed into the ground and broke into a thousand pieces. He couldn't repair it, some things cannot be repaired when they break. They're destroyed, and you can't un-destroy it. You have to make something new instead. Sadly, the same thing happened with the empire. It broke, and though many tried to put it together, it wasn't possible."\n\n"Okay..." Grover replied quietly. For having his reason for existence torn away, he was quite calm.\n\n"I wanted to ask you something," Mikusian continued now. "I've talked with your nanny, and she says you're a very clever boy. Can you read?" Grover nodded at this question, and Mikusian smiled. "What would you say about going to school here? Yale has some of the best schools there is, and creatures come from all over the world to study here. As Rector Magnificus of Yale, I would be honored to invite you here. You'll be able to go to school five days a week with griffons your age, make friends and learn from the best teachers we can get you. You don't need to say yes or no right now, but consider it, please."\n\n"I... okay." Grover fell quiet for a while before speaking up. "What happened to the student who broke the vase?"

"It's good to meet you, Grover, though I suspect you're not very happy with the circumstances."\n\n"Where are we going?" Grover asked him after a short while.

It sounds scary, but it'll turn out good, I promise."\n\n"You expect his majesty to stay on a farm?!" his nanny asked indignantly, "Are you planning to turn him into a commoner like the rest of you?!"\n\n"I'm planning nothing," Archibald said gently, "That will be for Grover to choose. Now... would you like to hear a story while we're travelling?" Archibald asked Grover. Grover didn't reply, though after a while he shrugged. He didn't really know, but he wasn't opposed to it.

He allowed himself a smile, and stepped forward to an even greater roar. But he also spied a few faces that seemed unhappy, and even one who was glaring at him. He wanted to sigh. The perfidious republicans and socialists were still subverting society, even all these years later. Fortunately, a quiet word to the SD would have these malcontents investigated.\n\n"Your Majesty, it is time," Hera murmured to him. "I will administer the oath of office. You must repeat and affirm when prompted." Grover nodded his assent, and she begun. "We are gathered here today for the coronation of Grover, sixth of his name, as emperor of Herzland by the grace of the Three, blessed of Boreas..."\n\nAs Hera listed off his many titles, Grover allowed his mind to wander. When she'd first explained feudalism to him, it had seemed so unfair and wrong. But now, looking out over the countless happy peasants and workers, he understood. Serfdom was not cruel; it was a kindness, a benevolent obligation. The feudal lords protected the peasants from bandits, and in return extracted a portion of their produce. The lords were loyal to him, and he would send military aid when needed. It was not unfair, for was not everything he owned his property? The loyalty and taxes were just rent being paid for using the land he owned. He had inherited it from his great-great-great-grandfather, and Hera and her Black Claw had reclaimed his birthright.\n\nAs Grover recited the oaths, Hera smiled wide. He'd made her proud, and lived up to the dream of a new feudalism. The serfs, the workers, the commoners, they had been wiped clean of cancers that would turn them against their rightful rulers. The last remnants of pathetic peasant rights movements would soon be eradicated, wiped away forever by the Black Claw.\n\nFinally, Grover solemnly vowed to lead the nation to greatness. As his vassals and clergy approached to swear fealty, Grover knew one thing beyond a doubt."
 grover.42.a:0 "This was how the world was meant to be." 
 
 grover.43.t:0 "Out With the Old"
 grover.43.d:0 "Benito knocked and entered Grover's office without waiting for a response. He was always permitted to interrupt the emperor, even in times like these. In his left paw he held a letter whilst his right, as usual, was clasped firmly to the hilt of his blade. He bowed ever-so-slightly as the monarch looked up from his work and smiled. "Your majesty, I'm afraid the time has come for me to retire."\n\nStraightforward as ever.\n\nHe placed the envelope carefully on the table, just in front of the innumerable papers on Grover's desk. He'd lived long enough to see three emperors and serve two of them, but now it was time for him to settle down and relax with the Empire in safe claws. Eighty-six was by no means ancient for a diamond dog, but he wasn't as capable a warrior or leader as he used to be and the emperor's bodyguard needed new blood. It was time for him to go.\n\n"I see. I don't suppose there's anything I can say to keep you here?" The young griffon offered, half in jest and half in earnest.\n\nThe hound smiled, pushing around the large number of grey hairs on his snout. "I'm afraid not, though I might add that I shan't be far away; if you need me."\n\nGrover smiled, a little reassured by that. Benito was no politician, or even a figure of much national import in any real sense, but the old dog meant a lot to him. He would be sorely missed."
 grover.43.a:0 "I'll come and visit, I promise."

 GRI_proteus_speaks_out_desc:0 "After a long but hasty journey across the sky, the Archon of Arcturius has come to Griffenheim. Yet he did not rest but immediately got to work to aid his fellow Archons. It is a rare sight, for the warrior-priest is known more for his fondness of combat than his work ethic. Now he is ready to hold a speech to the people and, more importantly, soldiers."

 GRI_sway_the_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army is a mere shadow of its former mighty self.

 GRI_noble_voting:0 "The Old Guard"

 GRI_contact_hephesthus:0 "A Dagger in the Dark"
 GRI_contact_hephesthus_desc:0 "When words fail, we turn to subterfuge and deceit. Archon Erion holds least popularity within the commonfolk and the Regency Council, a fact we can exploit by calling upon some old friends within Romau, to spread our words of choice."
 GRI_minor_nobles:0 "Support From the Niederer Adel"
 GRI_minor_nobles_desc:0 "The insurrection of 978 has done wonders in culling the number of peers, yet there still remains a large amount of them, who hold little more than a fancy title before their name.

 GRI_noble_council:0 "Establish the Reichsbeirat"

 GRI_noble_industrial_council_desc:0 "The creation of the 'Industrierat', or Industrial Advisory Council was proposed by Ceron Greytalon, the single most influential industrialist in the Empire.

 GRI_noble_industrial:0 "Bolster the Industrierat"

 GRI_unite_nobles_desc:0 "If the Empire is to survive in this new age, we must unite under a common banner. Our present and former subjects should share our view, or we'll have to spill unnecessary blood. There is no doubt, however, that they will be reasonable, unlike the southern subjects."
 GRI_PYT_uni:0 "The Feathisian Cadet Schools"
 GRI_PYT_uni_desc:0 "Feathisia employs a series of cadet schools to train young nobles and talents into officers and military research staff.

 GRI_oligarhcy:0 "Feathisian Oil Fields"
 GRI_oligarhcy_desc:0 "After a recent geological survey it has been found that Southern Feathisia is lying upon a massive quantity of oil. Oil that we now have the resources and griffonpower to extract on a massive scale. Good for the Empire, good for us all."
 GRI_technocrats:0 "The Riches of Strawberry"
 GRI_technocrats_desc:0 "The Duchess' home of Strawberry has always been known for two things, its insane addiction to strawberry wine and its mineral riches. With the Northern Heartlands now united under Imperial rule we can begin exploiting these riches to reinvigorate the Empire once more!"
 
 GRI_conquer_ANG:0 "Strike At Angriver"
 GRI_conquer_ANG_desc:0 "Long has Angriver suffered from tyranny and strife. The local republicans and anarchist have fermented unrest and the Baron responded with draconian measures. It is clear they need the Empire to come and restore sanity and order to their cursed land."
 GRI_conquer_KAT:0 "Purify Katerin"
 GRI_conquer_KAT_desc:0 "Ever since the revolution, Katerin was ruled by a mad Princess, Diellza the Insane. Yet the Empire did nothing and allowed her to rule autonomously. The recent regency conflict meant that our attention remained focused elsewhere while the griffons of Katerin suffered. No more! Now we shall take care of Katerin once and for all."
 GRI_conquer_YAL:0 "Checkmate The Universities"
 GRI_conquer_YAL_desc:0 "After the Duke of Yale sold his title to the local universities, the country has been ruled by rectors and professors. They call themselves a technocracy, but are they truly qualified to rule? The answer is a resounding no. We henceforth declare the acquisition of the title illegal, and officially end Yale's autonomy. With force."
 GRI_conquer_ROU:0 "End Romau's Autonomy"
 GRI_conquer_ROU_desc:0 "The last Free Imperial City of the Empire has refused to remain loyal to us. With this act of treason, they have abandoned their privileges and sovereignty. It is time for us to integrate Romau into the Empire proper, and abolish local self-rule. How could such a small country even hope to resist our might?"
 GRI_conquer_FEA:0 "March On De Vleugels"
 GRI_conquer_FEA_desc:0 "What has our dear friend Gerlach done with the autonomy we have given them? Established a democratic parliament to pander to republican scum, who his father had fought so hard to subdue. This rule by rabble has brought nothing but economic depression and disorder to Feathisia, which was once the crown jewel of Herzland. This betrayal shall be punished."
 GRI_conquer_STW:0 "Into The Land Of Strawberries And Wine"
 GRI_conquer_STW_desc:0 "The plotting and scheming in Strawberry must come to an end. [STW.GetLeader] has shown their true colors and betrayed the Empire. If they do not wish to serve us any longer, so be it. We will force them to do so."
 GRI_conquer_BRZ:0 "Bring The Dogs To Heel"
 GRI_conquer_BRZ_desc:0 "There was once a time where the diamond dogs of Bronzehill were the most loyal servants of the Empire. That seems no longer to be the case, unfortunately. Now they wish to distance themselves from us, forgetting the fact that we are their sole rightful rulers. A lesson seems to be in order, to remind them of their true master."
 GRI_conquer_PYT:0 "Subjugate The Peasants"
 GRI_conquer_PYT_desc:0 "As a reward for toppling his nemesis Duke Erebus I, His Majesty Grover I granted the peasants of Greifenmarschen full autonomy, allowing the peasants to rule themselves. However, what the peasants did with their freedom is nothing but disappointing: A sluggish direct democracy that keeps them stuck in the past. Clearly, they need someone to rule them."
 GRI_core_ANG_KAT:0 "Restore Order To The East"
 GRI_core_ANG_KAT_desc:0 "The disgraceful administration of the east will be torn down and rebuilt from the ground up. The new governors shall be loyal and just, unlike the previous rulers of Angriver and Katerin. The last remnants of resistance will be destroyed by the local garrisons and the entire backwards region will be dragged into the modern age."
 GRI_core_YAL_ROU:0 "Curtail The Universities"
 GRI_core_YAL_ROU_desc:0 "We can never again allow southern universities to wield such power as they once did. Instead of being distracted by ruling a nation, they can now focus on their studies and research, while our own governors bring fair rule to all, instead of just university members. Romau, in the meantime, will become a regular municipality, its senate being gone for good."
 GRI_core_FEA_PYT:0 "Abolish The Feathisian Constitution"
 GRI_core_FEA_PYT_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach and Thorbeak created a constitution for their country, which was the beginning of the end for Feathisia. The peasants of Greifenmarschen, too, had their own institutions in place. These will now be erased and replaced with firm but fair rule by Imperial governors. Their decision-making will be swift and efficient, unlike that of democratic institutions."
 GRI_core_STW_BRZ:0 "The Loyal North"
 GRI_core_STW_BRZ_desc:0 "It seems the northerners have learned a lesson in humility. They are slowly abandoning any notions of rebellion and resistance to our rule and instead are becoming ready to enthusiastically serve the Empire, His Majesty and His regent. We happily welcome them back into the fold, though they still have to do much to fully regain our trust."
 
 GRI_eros:0 "The Archon"
 GRI_eros_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Eros VII, the voice of Boreas and protector of the small folk, has managed to become the Imperial regent. The future of Griffonia lies in his claws. The accursed nobility will pay for their indolence!"
 GRI_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
 GRI_land_reform_desc:0 "Archon Erion claims that if we intend to save the common folk from the dirty claws of the nobility we must first make sure they actually own the land they work, even if the nobles themselves will oppose such a radical change. Eyr intended land to be shared by all griffons after all, so it is only pious to redistribute land."
 GRI_empower_archons:0 "Power to the Three"
 GRI_empower_archons_desc:0 "We shall not allow the wretched nobles to rule the Empire any longer. The power must be taken away from the Regency Council and given solely to the Archons, for only they can ensure the people's safety and well-being. No one else."
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy:0 "Deal With the Bureaucrats"
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Due to our fairly outdated and overly complicated bureaucracy, doing anything official within our borders takes weeks or even months. It's time we trim the fat and streamline the whole bloated rotten structure before it all comes crashing down upon itself. Who cares how many bureaucrats become unemployed? Most of them are leeches anyways."
 GRI_burgher_support:0 "Garner Support From the Burghers"
 GRI_burgher_support_desc:0 "Although not as powerful or influential as the merchants and traders within the Trade Federation to our west, Archon Eros thinks the burgher class are still a viable ally to have. With their support, construction of additional factories would be much easier to fund. We can promise them many lucrative privileges, such as monopolies and exclusive deals."
 GRI_holy_order:0 "The Knights of Arcturius"
 GRI_holy_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius, founded in 357, are the militant branch of the Arcturian Archonate and have served the Empire faithfully for centuries. Seeing as how many of our people think they are nothing but a legend, Archon Proteus says it may be a good idea to not only expand their ranks, but form them into a proper fighting unit, ready to serve the Empire in the frontlines."
 GRI_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward the Faithful"
 GRI_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The rulers of southern Herzland served us faithfully once, which is all good and true. Yet the new order in the Empire cannot tolerate this loose decentralisation and dissidence, for we must all work together closely for the good of the Empire. Thus, they shall receive a perfectly reasonable offer to either rejoin the Empire, or suffer the consequences of unholy treason."
 GRI_ROU_uni:0 "Fund the Southern Universities"
 GRI_ROU_uni_desc:0 "The Universities of Romau and Yale are some of the oldest universities in the entirety of the Griffonia and have been the stomping ground of many of the greatest minds in the history of our race. However, admission fees have become unbearable for most students, since the maintenance of these institutions is costly. Additional state funding would lower these fees and allow many more sharp minds to enroll."
 GRI_education_effort:0 "Start a Literacy Campaign"
 GRI_education_effort_desc:0 "Without modernisation, our Empire will crumble. However, we can't hope to modernise without granting our people more education. It will take some time, but we must start a literacy campaign now rather than later. Every temple shall offer free education to all griffons, so anyone can learn to read and, with enough dedication, write."
 GRI_greenback_stuff:0 "Expand the Greenback Aluminium Smelters"
 GRI_greenback_stuff_desc:0 "A vital resource for aircraft production, aluminium should be a high priority for us to secure. Fortunately, Greenback is already a centre of bauxite smelting, with is modern high-temperature forges. By investing funds into expanding them, we can increase production rates greatly."
 GRI_monasteries:0 "State Eleos"
 GRI_monasteries_desc:0 "Archon Erion has proposed that we restore the concept of Imperial Eleos. Eleos, in essence, is the concept of providing for others as an act of virtue, to spread prosperity to less fortunate griffons in the name of Boreas. Erion reckons that restoring it on a national level would be a great way to garner more support from our poorer populace and earn the favour of the gods."
 GRI_farms:0 "Clearing Out the Scheißwald"
 GRI_farms_desc:0 "The Scheißwald, a forest spanning most of Angriver and Katerin, has impeded griffons from developing much of the eastern Herzland for centuries now. However we now possess the means to clear out the Scheißwald once and for all! Great machines shall uproot the trees and turn them into lumber, strong pumps will drain the cursed swamps and chemical fertilizer will turn it all into rich farmland."
 GRI_invite_erion:0 "Eyr's New Chosen"
 GRI_invite_erion_desc:0 "Even from the earliest days of its founding it was obvious that the Archon of Eyr was the weakest link in the Council of Three, and now with our hold over the Imperial regency ensured we can install our own candidate for the Archon of Eyr. It's not as if Erion can do much about it anyhow..."
 GRI_end_TRD:0 "Under a Clear Sky"
 GRI_end_TRD_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Empire, the Skyfall Federation has controlled some of the most prosperous Griffonian ports and cities. But during the revolution of 978 the bastards betrayed us, slaughtered the Imperial garrison and stole our navy. If we intend to restore the Empire to its full glory, we must reclaim what is ours and destroy these traitors!"
 GRI_empire_rising:0 "The Rising Empire"
 GRI_empire_rising_desc:0 "Under the guidance of [Root.GetLeader], we have managed to reunite all of Herzland and assert dominance over former Imperial vassals. However, our path does not end here. There is still much to be done if we wish to restore the Empire to its former glory and might!"

 GRI_strike_north:0 "Reclaim the North"
 GRI_strike_north_desc:0 "The north must be reclaimed, despite its rather poor value. "President-Marshal" Kemerskai and his socialist stooges must be wiped off the map before they become a serious threat. The uncivilised mountain clans must be brought to our rule as well so some semblance of order is restored."
 GRI_go_after_vedina:0 "Grover I's Only Mistake"
 GRI_go_after_vedina_desc:0 "While Vedina was nominally an Imperial subject, in truth they were completely independent and cared little for the Empire. This is because of Emperor Grover I's grave error, the only one he ever made: He made a deal with the local King. This contract has expired and we shall ensure every single griffon, including Vedinans, is united under the Imperial banner."
 GRI_hang_the_traitor:0 "Hang the Traitor"
 GRI_hang_the_traitor_desc:0 "After so many long years, Kemerskai has finally been caught and will be brought to justice. He betrayed the Imperial Army and lead the rebel scum during the revolution of 978 which almost brought an end to the Empire. His crime of extreme high treason has gone unpunished for far too long."
 GRI_core_the_north:0 "Northern Peace And Order"
 GRI_core_the_north_desc:0 "The Imperial banner waves once more in the north. We will do our best to restore the old order and redistribute the land to loyal griffons. Anarchy will be replaced with strict order and stability, so the populace will realize how imperial rule is superior to all else and rejoice."
 GRI_strike_lakes:0 "Reclaim Central Griffonia"
 GRI_strike_lakes_desc:0 "Central Griffonia houses Griffonstone, the ancient home of the Imperial dynasty and the cradle of the Empire. Alongside it are the various splinter states that broke off in 978 or afterwards, such as the war-torn Duchy of Verenia and bandit-infested Blackhollow. Regardless of their wealth and importance, they must all be brought back to the fold."
 GRI_respect_the_locals_imperial:0 "Local Auxiliaries"
 GRI_respect_the_locals_imperial_desc:0 "Many griffons in the lands we have subjugated have expressed interest in joining the Imperial Army (mainly thanks to the good wages), but are unable to do so because they lack official citizenship. By organizing auxiliary units we can offer them a chance to serve the Empire."
 GRI_rebuild_griffinstone_imperial:0 "Rebuild Griffonstone"
 GRI_rebuild_griffinstone_imperial_desc:0 "After the tragic death of King Guto VI, Griffonstone was left without a leader and much like the Empire a bickering regency council was unable to run the country properly. As a result the former pride of griffonkind became dilapidated and poverty-stricken. To honour the memory of the King and to please the young Emperor, we must restore the city to its former glory, no matter how much it costs."
 GRI_core_center:0 "Reintegrate Central Griffonia"
 GRI_core_center_desc:0 "Having crushed local armies and suppressed nationalistic resitance movements, we are finally ready to expand our administration into the center of the continent. The locals will once more be proud and loyal citizens of the Empire!"

 GRI_strike_west_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is home to not only treacherous breakaway states and the wicked Skyfall Trade Federation, but also Aquileia.

 GRI_the_trade_cities_imperial_desc:0 "The western coast used to be one of the major economic centers of the Empire. The local cities of Skyfall, Griffton and Fezera indeed remain wealthy to this day, but had declared independence during the chaos of the revolution. Now that we have reclaimed the cities, we will restore the privileges of old to ensure business continues as usual and we get our fair share of the profits."
 GRI_the_oil_fields_imperial:0 "The Oil Fields of Greifwald"
 GRI_the_oil_fields_imperial_desc:0 "While independent, the griffons of Greifwald discovered large oil deposits under their soil. We have now sent our own experts into the region and they claim it might as well be the largest petroleum reserve in the entire world. We must tap into this massive store of black gold at once!"
 GRI_core_west:0 "Annex the West"
 GRI_core_west_desc:0 "Aquileia and its neighbouring regions have all been brought back into the fold. But this time we will not repeat the mistake of past Emperors. Aquileia deserves no autonomy after their repeated betrayals and obsession with revolutionary ideas. All of the west shall be integral territory of the Empire, directly ruled from [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 GRI_strike_south:0 "A Lesson in Humility"
 GRI_strike_south_desc:0 "The fall and division of our Empire was started by the claws of Wingbardy. And now, with most lands safely back in our realm, they will be the among the last to be subjugated. Their allies too will face our wrath, as well as other arrogant nations that defy Imperial rule.

 GRI_wingbardian_rubber_desc:0 "The tropical climate of southern Wingbardy is ideal for rubber trees, and the local griffons were well aware of this.

 GRI_reclaim_minotauria:0 "Restore the Kingdom"
 GRI_reclaim_minotauria_desc:0 "When Emperor Grover II wished to secure supply routes to the east, he sent the Imperial Navy and the Imperial Army to crush the bothersome minotaurs in unison. The cowardly King surrendered after a single battle and a puppet state was created, which was ultimately toppled by radical democratic revolutionaries. It seems we will have to teach them respect."
 GRI_core_south:0 "Shackle the South"
 GRI_core_south_desc:0 "The "Free South" will be a thing of the past. No more shall Wingbardy and their former allies be subject states. Instead, they will be reorganized into an Imperial province. Modern technology makes communication, and thus administration, easy even so far away from the capital. This should prevent the region from breaking off so easily again."
 GRI_strike_frontier:0 "Reclaim the Frontier"
 GRI_strike_frontier_desc:0 "In 747, Emperor Grover I famously crossed the Creeper Mountains, catching the eastern principalities by surprise and subjugating them with ease. Two years later the Zaphzans of Gryphia wisely agreed to become an Imperial March. But like all other subjects, they too betrayed us and declared independence or simply drifted away from Imperial rule. It is time we reassert our dominance."
 GRI_far_eastern_port:0 "The Empire's Far Eastern Port"
 GRI_far_eastern_port_desc:0 "Riaportu has grown greatly in our absence, becoming a prosperous center of trade. Our admirals propose its port could be used as a base for the Imperial Navy, allowing us to better project power in the east.

 GRI_settle_the_kosakenland:0 "Settle the Kosakenland"
 GRI_settle_the_kosakenland_desc:0 "Gryphia is a sparsely populated land, the frontier of the eastern frontier, so to say. Its soil however is as fertile as in Prywhen, the ricebasket of the south. By encouraging colonisation and resettling among the Imperial citizenry and granting free land (seized from the cossacks of course) we can integrate the region better than Grover III ever did and tame the wild Kosakenland."
 GRI_core_frontier:0 "Integrate the Frontier"
 GRI_core_frontier_desc:0 "The Empire's control over the east weakened greatly over the years until it crumbled entirely. We cannot allow this to happen again, but instead assert control and turn the frontier into an obedient and well organized model province within the Empire."
 GRI_attack_GRF:0 "Reclaim Our Colony"
 GRI_attack_GRF_desc:0 "Everything the Empire used to control on Griffonia -- and more -- has been reclaimed after much bloodshed and conflict. However, our task is not yet over. Our colony on Equus, founded by Emperor Grover I himself in 783, has become an independent nation that shows little interest in acknowledging our authority. This wayward colony will learn its place, by force if need be."
 
 GRI_industry_technology:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 GRI_industry_technology_desc:0 "Industrial modernisation has only just begun, and our country is working hard to improve its situation. We should invite foreign experts to teach us only the best and most modern industrial methods."
 GRI_agricultural_support:0 "Agricultural Aid"
 GRI_agricultural_support_desc:0 "Through the system of feudalism and serfdom, agriculture has always been the Empire's speciality. However, our outdated agricultural sector cannot hope to compete with industrialized nations. With governmental incentives we can aid our farm estates and allow them to modernize their production methods."
 GRI_industrial_farms:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
 GRI_industrial_farms_desc:0 "Who is to say industrialisation and agriculture can't aid one another? By adding machines to our agricultural sector, we can mechanise and automise a large chunk of the process, greatly improving productivity and increasing migration from the countryside to the cities as the need for workers on the farms drops."
 GRI_breadbasket_of_griffonia:0 "The Breadbasket of Griffonia"
 GRI_breadbasket_of_griffonia_desc:0 "Through our dedication to the agricultural sector, we have renewed prosperity on the countryside, and our citizens once again live without fearing hunger. There's enough food for everyone, and plenty more leftover for export."
 GRI_krahe_contract:0 "The Krähe-Stahl Contract"
 GRI_krahe_contract_desc:0 "The Krähe-Stahl company is the oldest industrial company in the Empire, being the ones who brought industrialisation to the Empire. By reaching an agreement with them, we could not only encourage their growth, but also reap the benefits of their work."
 GRI_imperial_railway:0 "Expand The Imperial Railway"
 GRI_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Grover V's effort in creating an Imperial railway was admirable, but he did not go far enough and merely created the backbone of a proper rail network. We shall now honour his memory by continuing his work and connecting even the most remote corners of the Empire with rail."
 GRI_crona_industry:0 "The Reichswaffen Contract"
 GRI_crona_industry_desc:0 "Reichswaffen is the most prominent weapons manufacturer, and was founded by a childhood friend of Grover IV. As such, the emperors have had good relations with the company ever since. We should renew this friendship and our mutual ties to ensure that the Empire is not without claws."
 GRI_tech_schools:0 "The Griffonian Standard"
 GRI_tech_schools_desc:0 "To ensure great quality of our nation's products, we shall introduce a national standard for engineering and construction. That way, we will soon be known as the best engineers in Griffonia, and our products will be famed across the world."
 GRI_electronics_department:0 "Subsidise Blautronik"
 GRI_electronics_department_desc:0 "Blautronik is a new, enterprising group of griffons who think that the future of the Empire lies in automisation and technology. It may seem far-fetched now, but who knows? They could be the pioneers of progress we need."
 GRI_humanities_department:0 "Cultural R&D Department"
 GRI_humanities_department_desc:0 "While none can deny the benefits of practical research and material science, we must not ignore our cultural heritage. A special department shall be established to preserve our history, language and culture, teach it to new generations and above all install a pan-Griffonian identity in them."
 GRI_northern_roads:0 "Connect the North"
 GRI_northern_roads_desc:0 "The north has once more rejoined the Empire's warm embrace. However, with a lack of centralized authority the infrastructure is not in an ideal condition. By constructing highways and bridges, we can greatly ease travel."
 GRI_take_northern_industry:0 "Nationalise Northern Industry"
 GRI_take_northern_industry_desc:0 "The conurbation consisting of the cities of Mirabelle, Readewetter and De Vleugels was the biggest industrial center of Strawberry and Feathisia. Now, with these lands under imperial rule once again, it is the biggest industrial center in the Heartlands. We must nationalise these newly gained industrial assets to use them to our advantage."
 GRI_oil_oil_oil:0 "Black Gold"
 GRI_oil_oil_oil_desc:0 "Oil shall be the most important resource in the new millenium. Not just for the machines of war, but also for civilian usage. It would be best to commence extracting this resource at once, so that our stockpile can grow. Additionally, we shall look into ways of creating synthetic resources, should natural yields begin to diminish."
 GRI_southern_roads:0 "Into the Scheißwald"
 GRI_southern_roads_desc:0 "The south is once more under our rule, but local infrastructure is lacking. Construction projects during Grover V's reign did not cover the area as extensively as in the north, mostly because of the vast and horrible Scheißwald forest. This time we will not let ourselves be intimidated by mere trees! We will use modern machines to carve paths through the forest."
 GRI_take_southern_industry:0 "Seize Southern Industry"
 GRI_take_southern_industry_desc:0 "Southern Herzland is comparatively less developed than the north, but it still has potential. If we nationalize the industry of the urban centers of Romau, Greenback and Griffing, we can use it to further develop the region as we please. The local burghers won't be too happy, but they will be compensated generously."
 GRI_skyfall_dockyards_focus:0 "Repair the Skyfall Handelshafen"
 GRI_skyfall_dockyards_focus_desc:0 "The Skyfall trade port is the biggest in all of Griffonia, and was once the Empire's crown jewel when it came to naval power. Now we have regained control over Skyfall and its valuable ports. It is time to renew them and show the world our maritime prowess once again!"
 GRI_skyfall_industry:0 "No More Trade Princes"
 GRI_skyfall_industry_desc:0 "The coastal provinces of Skyfall are dominated by merchants and trade princes who hold a large amount of power over local infrastructure and industry. With regained control over the area, it is time to break their oligopoly and nationalize their assets in the name of the Emperor."
 GRI_designated_industrial_zones:0 "Designated Industrial Zones"
 GRI_designated_industrial_zones_desc:0 "By designating industrial zones, we can incentivise rapid growth of industrial centers and companies all around the Empire. It will also be easier to control them, should we have a need for the economy to go in a direction we desire."
 GRI_the_economic_miracle:0 "The Imperial Economic Miracle"
 GRI_the_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Despite our critics' worst intentions, we have made it! The Empire has not only recovered from its economic depression, but it has soared high into the sky towards economic prosperity. Truly, we are restoring the Empire to its former glory in every way possible."
 
 GRI_new_navy:0 "The New Kaiserliche Marine"
 GRI_new_navy_desc:0 "With the Feathisian ports under our control, the time has arrived to formally restore the Kriegsmarine. However, the old guard from 978 can't be just admirals of their offices - what we require is a serious and dedicated commitment to the reconstruction of our fleet. It will be a costly affair, but it is the only way to show our rivals that the Empire is here to stay."
 GRI_cheap_and_quick:0 "Cheap And Quick"
 GRI_cheap_and_quick_desc:0 "To properly achieve our objectives, our fleet must be all-present and numerous. There will be no safe haven for our foes, nor a lack of barrages from our warships. But to achieve this advantage in numbers, our ship designs will have to cut on the frivolities, focusing entirely on producing as many as possible in the same time span."
 GRI_expensive_and_reliable:0 "Expensive, But Reliable"
 GRI_expensive_and_reliable_desc:0 "We must spare nothing on our armada - not only does it protect our important trade lanes, but it also tells the world of Imperial wealth and prestige. Additionally, ensuring our shipbuilders receive the latest technology and best materials will go a long way towards giving each ship a long service time, even if it costs us more in the short term."
 GRI_dockyard_expansion_scheme:0 "The Dockyard Expansion Scheme"
 GRI_dockyard_expansion_scheme_desc:0 "[GRI.GetLeader] has made it abundantly clear that the current amount of dockyards, shipwrights and other naval related industries is insufficient for the national quotas. Thus, a two year program, focused on naval expansion will be written and funded by the state."
 GRI_expand_trade_fleet:0 "Expand The Trade Fleet"
 GRI_expand_trade_fleet_desc:0 "Trade is the lifeblood of any nation, for not only does it keep us supplied in material we are lacking, but also allows us to keep our citizens content with amenities from all over the world. It would only be practical to expand our trade fleet, to open up new trade lanes, and should it be required, allow a naval assault."
 GRI_defend_trade_fleet:0 "Convoy Escorts"
 GRI_defend_trade_fleet_desc:0 "The humble destroyer is not the most hard hitting or durable of ships, but it can be easily mass produced and modified to suit any given role. From laying mines to hunting submarines, their strength shall be in numbers. They can also serve as a capable escort for our trade convoys, as well."
 GRI_restore_the_admirality:0 "Restore The Imperial Admiralty"
 GRI_restore_the_admirality_desc:0 "With our fleet operating on the high seas again, the time has come to restore the Admiralty in the same function it served. Old generations shall work together with new and upcoming young officers on conceiving the perfect strategy for our naval affairs, in every aspect of it."
 GRI_naval_aviation_experimentation:0 "The Future Of Naval Warfare"
 GRI_naval_aviation_experimentation_desc:0 "A warfleet that stretches from one end of the horizon to the other is very threatening and impressive, but it is also becoming increasingly harder to maintain. Some of our fresh officers in high command suggest that betting on carriers and their screening would be a more efficient method of waging naval warfare. The airplane has proven to be a very useful invention, after all."
 GRI_surface_fleet_f:0 "Trust In Old Naval Strategy"
 GRI_surface_fleet_f_desc:0 "Our older admirals assure us that our naval thought doesn't require drastic changes. New inventions and tactics are more than welcome to support our core of battleships, which will strike fear in the hearts of our foes once the barrage commences. It would be wise to address the submarine threat, however."
 GRI_marine_infantry_f:0 "Rebuild The Marine Infanterie"
 GRI_marine_infantry_f_desc:0 "Our roster is missing griffons trained in amphibious warfare. Such a force existed back in the day, but was disbanded after we lost control to sea access. With the Empire on the rise again, inevitably we'll find ourselves in a situation where marines would prove to be a decisive factor in victory."
 GRI_cruiser_expansion:0 "New Cruisers"
 GRI_cruiser_expansion_desc:0 "A natural progression on the destroyer, cruisers of both light and heavy variants shall serve as a stopgap before we can develop the largest ships. Cruisers, however, are both quick and hard-hitting, presenting an acceptable substitute for battleships, especially if a captain's skill is considered."
 GRI_battleship_expansion:0 "The Pride Of The Fleet"
 GRI_battleship_expansion_desc:0 "In the ages past, the most powerful and modern ships sailed along the coasts of Griffonia, showing all our wealth and splendour, as well as giving others second thoughts before deciding to make a foolish move on us. This fleet has been dispersed following the events of 978, but now we have the means to produce these floating fortresses again. Griffonia shall be safe from outside interference."
 GRI_carrier_experiments:0 "Floating Airways"
 GRI_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "As airplanes continue to perform operations that are outside of artillery's scope, naval high command has expressed an interest in expanding and modernising our carrier fleet. They argue that this new strategy would control the seas with less resources spent on upkeep, and given the results, we are inclined to agree with them."
 GRI_submarines_and_long_lance:0 "An Undersea Blockade"
 GRI_submarines_and_long_lance_desc:0 "War is fought with weapons, but it is primarily fought with resources. Whoever ends up first with shortages faces a downward spiral towards defeat. Thus to extend on this idea, our submarine fleet will undergo modernisation to ensure they always remain a threat, no matter what counter they can think of."
 GRI_further_naval_expansion:0 "Unrelenting Armada"
 GRI_further_naval_expansion_desc:0 "Having achieved excellence in naval development, combined with being at the forefront of naval strategy as well, we can now put this knowledge to use. The glory days of our fleet have returned, and there'll be plenty of warships in each and every port we control. The sun shall never set on us."
 
 GRI_army:0 "The Reichsarmee Expansion Plan"
 GRI_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has retained much of its officer core even after the events of 978, but it is considerably smaller in size than before, and has fallen behind in terms of equipment and organization. A reconquest of the breakaway nations of Griffonia will only be possible with a modern, expanded army, worthy of the Empire."
 GRI_expand_the_reserves:0 "Modernise The Reichsarmee Reserve System"
 GRI_expand_the_reserves_desc:0 "While the Imperial Army has always been a professional one at its core, its numbers were bolstered by numerous reservists, part-time soldiers who were civilians unless called to service. However, this system hasn't seen change for decades. Adopting new policies and reforming the system will provide us an expanded pool of griffonpower to draw from."
 GRI_rifle_modernisation:0 "Increased Infantry Kit Standards"
 GRI_rifle_modernisation_desc:0 "Every soldier has traditionally been supplied with everything they need, but a modern soldier needs more than a soldier of the past did. Not only that, but we should ensure the quality meets the standards. Having a rifle break in the middle of combat, a tent leak in the rain or a grenade trigger too early are all quite inconvenient to various degrees."
 GRI_artillery_modernisation:0 "Artillery Design Modernisation"
 GRI_artillery_modernisation_desc:0 "Artillery is the real killer in modern war, causing the most casualties. Heavy gun designs are always evolving and adapting, with anti-air and anti-tank guns being new innovations made necessary by combined arms warfare. Investing in developing new artillery designs is therefore vital."
 GRI_doctrinal_adaptation:0 "Doctrinal Adaptation"
 GRI_doctrinal_adaptation_desc:0 "The introduction of the tank and the airplane have radically changed the art of war. Our experience of using this technology with regular old infantry is limited, but our changeling friends across the sea are more than happy to offer their advice. We must adapt quickly, or else we will die."
 GRI_special_forces_inititaitve:0 "Create The RAfSK"
 GRI_special_forces_inititaitve_desc:0 "The Reichsarmee Abteilung für Sonderkriegsführung seeks to improve and expand our training of military specialists: Paratroopers, marines and mountaineers. The reconquest of Griffonia, or even the unification of Herzland alone, require soldiers who have been trained to fight in unusual environments and to use unorthodox tactics."
 GRI_develop_enigma_code:0 "The Secret War"
 GRI_develop_enigma_code_desc:0 "As warfare becomes more complex and communication more instant and vital, secrecy grows in importance as well. Intercepting the messages of the enemy can allow the exploitation of weaknesses and well-prepared ambushes, while encrypting our own communication guards our army from such things. While soldiers fight on the front, engineers fight the secret war behind the lines."
 GRI_officer_training:0 "Reform The Curriculum"
 GRI_officer_training_desc:0 "The towns surrounding the capital have long been home to many prestigious military academies, such as the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim and Reich Militärakademie in Vinnin. But some of the things taught to aspiring officers are hopelessly outdated, with some classes even claiming a bayonet charge is a viable tactic even in modern times. This must now change."
 GRI_further_cooperation:0 "Our Changeling Friends"
 GRI_further_cooperation_desc:0 "After the changelings failed to take over Equestria in 1002, their Queen has focused on expanding and reforming their military. Many changeling officers have been trained in the Empire, and in return they have helped us form our first true armoured battalions. Further cooperation can only be beneficial for both of us."
 GRI_joint_wargames:0 "Joint War Exercises"
 GRI_joint_wargames_desc:0 "As the changelings prepare for their invasion of Equestria, we prepare for the reconquest of Griffonia. Both require extensive planning and preparation. By holding war games where our soldiers face off against each other in a simulated combat experience, they can learn to fight in a realistic scenario while our officers can develop their tactics."
 GRI_rocket_artillery_development:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
 GRI_rocket_artillery_development_desc:0 "What were initially planned to be smoke mortars used for creating a concealing smoke screen in battle are now being developed into rocket launchers. Rockets have an advantage over regular artillery shells because of their larger capacity of high-explosive fluids. We are working closely together with the changelings in the design of these new weapons."
 GRI_joint_industrial_development:0 "Joint Industrial Exchange Program"
 GRI_joint_industrial_development_desc:0 "The managers of our arms companies have proposed a program where they set up a branch in the Changeling Lands while they do the same in ours. Thus we could learn from each other and exchange industrial production methods and economic expertise. [Root.GetLeader] has approved their proposal and is now preparing to present it to Queen Chrysalis."
 GRI_joint_military_RD_department:0 "Joint Technological R&D Department"
 GRI_joint_military_RD_department_desc:0 "Changelings and griffons have very different mindsets and varying magical capabilities. Changelings excel in development of machines which enable rapid, aggressive warfare and have mastered infiltration magic, while griffons are skilled enchanters of armour and masters of aerial warfare. If our knowledge and mastery were combined, surely nothing would be able to stop us."
 GRI_cooperate_with_industrialists:0 "Extend A Claw To The Industrialists"
 GRI_cooperate_with_industrialists_desc:0 "While we have limited the power of the capitalists with increased economic control, we can yet reconcile with them. Offering exclusive deals where we purchase their arms production at a favourable price will easily win them over to our side, ready to supply the Reichsarmee with anything it needs."
 GRI_auxiliary_engineer_corps:0 "Create The Hilfsingenieurkorps"
 GRI_auxiliary_engineer_corps_desc:0 "Auxiliary support units are as important as regular battalions. We cannot expect every soldier to be ready to deal with every situation. For this purpose, experts fill in the ranks and provide vital support when needed. By creating the Hilfsingenieurkorps, we will guarantee they receive the best training and equipment possible."
 GRI_lowstein_motorized_contract:0 "The Löwenstein Contract"
 GRI_lowstein_motorized_contract_desc:0 "Löwenstein has for many years been the primary producer of cars and trucks in the Heartlands. By signign a contract with them where they get to provide their products to the Reichsarmee, we will be able to speed up the mechanization of our army and make it increasingly mobile."
 GRI_modern_tank_designs:0 "Modern Tank Designs"
 GRI_modern_tank_designs_desc:0 "With the aid from the changelings, we can continue to develop our lightly armoured vehicles and equip them with better plating, stronger engines and bigger guns. New battalions are being prepared, ready to roll out and overwhelm our enemy with sheer speed and ferocity."
 GRI_harder_plating:0 "Increased Plating Standards"
 GRI_harder_plating_desc:0 "While light tanks are very mobile, they are not particularly resilient and are easy to pierce. Larger and heavier tanks would be slower, but still faster than even winged infantry, and far tougher to destroy. These new tanks will be the iron claws which will shred our enemies to pieces!"
 GRI_streamlined_armour_production:0 "Streamlined Tank Production"
 GRI_streamlined_armour_production_desc:0 "Tanks are complex constructions, requiring many parts made by many producers. By consolidating the production of these parts into single locations, we can increase the speed of production. Adopting the assembly line and hiring more workers will help as well, allowing us to produce more than enough tanks for the Reichsarmee."
 GRI_imperial_heavy_tanks:0 "Project: Metallkasten"
 GRI_imperial_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "Some may call it a giant metal box to hide in, but it is far more than that. Its pace will be slow yet determined. Its armour nigh-impenetrable. Its guns rivaling artillery cannons in size and might. It shall be the iron fist of the Empire, and nothing will withstand its power."
 GRI_combined_arms_warfare:0 "Combined Arms Warfare"
 GRI_combined_arms_warfare_desc:0 "With aid from the changelings, our military doctrine is reaching its maturity at last. Tanks and infantry are not meant to be separate, but combined. An armoured spearhead will break the lines, motorised infantry will secure their flanks while regular infantry holds the line. All three then work together to destroy the surrounded and utterly outmatched enemy."
 
 GRI_airforce:0 "Rebuilding The Imperial Airforce"
 GRI_airforce_desc:0 "The airplane was invented by the Schreiber brothers, an ingenious pair of griffons who weren't so brilliant when it came to business decisions. It only took a decade before their invention was developed sufficiently enough to be used in warfare, and it has changed battles forever. We were pioneers of their usage, but that scoundrel Meyer has absconded with the entire fleet back in 978. It is time to assume our position as the sky's rulers."
 GRI_strat_destruction:0 "Strategic Destruction Doctrine"
 GRI_strat_destruction_desc:0 "To properly display Imperial might and will, we must deploy an enormous wing of bombers, which will harass and bombard enemy positions and cities. With death raining from above, destroying industrial complexes and enemy morale, our foes will be unable to hold out for long."
 GRI_air_superior:0 "Battlefield Support Doctrine"
 GRI_air_superior_desc:0 "A mobile and agile wing of dive bombers is ideal for our air force, as it enables us to support our ground forces anywhere on the battlefield rapidly and precisely. With solid, precise air support, no offence or defence can stand in our way!"
 GRI_develop_fighters:0 "Modernising Our Fighters"
 GRI_develop_fighters_desc:0 "No other branch of the airforce is more glamorous than the fighter squadrons, which means there's a steady influx of recruits who yearn to fly and serve their country. With that in mind, our fighter designs will have to be improved with lighter alloys, stronger engines and heavier armaments, while still being economic to produce."
 GRI_develop_CAS:0 "Surgical Precision"
 GRI_develop_CAS_desc:0 "While the bomber's destruction capabilities are unmatched, they are impractical for anything smaller than a building. Instead, fighters can be modified to perform dive bombing raids on traits, artillery, tanks and anti-aircraft defences, allowing the next wave of aircraft to procede unmolested. All this ensures our ground forces will not be slowed down by any significant defensive positions."
 GRI_the_naval_bomber:0 "The Threat From Sea"
 GRI_the_naval_bomber_desc:0 "Both offensively and defensively, air superiority is essential for naval vessels to perform their duties. The naval high command has requested a modernisation of the specialised bombers, which will be indispensable in securing our control of the seas."
 GRI_reopen_flight_academy:0 "Reopen The Kaiserliche Flugakademie"
 GRI_reopen_flight_academy_desc:0 "When Hermann Meyer betrayed the Empire and fled to Haukland, he singleclawedly set our aerial military might back by decades. However, we cannot continue to live in fear of traitors and deprive ourselves from a professional airforce. Let us learn from the mistakes of the last century and reopen the Imperial Air Academy."
 GRI_focus_on_bombers:0 "Reaping The Whirlwind"
 GRI_focus_on_bombers_desc:0 "On land, the era of brave knights gallantly winning battles through heroic acts is over and we would be wise not to be lured by the idea of dashing flying aces. The Griffonian Airforce will rest upon massive air squadrons capable of destroying any target by overwhelming power, esprit de corps and efficient planning."
 GRI_focus_on_aces:0 "Griffonia's Finest Aces"
 GRI_focus_on_aces_desc:0 "For all his crimes, Hermann Meyer has demonstrated the success of his air power theories despite using outdated planes, little supplies and dirt poor infrastructure. If we are to prevail in the air, we should learn from what works rather than be held back by petty grudges. The future lies in a strong core of bold elite pilots able to improvise and act independently."
 GRI_encourage_experimentality:0 "The Spirit Of Experimentality"
 GRI_encourage_experimentality_desc:0 "Instead of relying on a singular, predictable strategy, our pilots should be well versed in multiple tactics for waging air warfare. Although the usage of airplanes in war is only a recent development, the few conflicts in which they played a role has suggested that there is no definite, one beats all option."
 GRI_develop_tac_bombers:0 "Adapt Changeling Bomber Models"
 GRI_develop_tac_bombers_desc:0 "Our good friends, the Changelings, have modernised their country in a remarkably quick timespan, turning what was once a backwater wasteland into an efficient, militarised regime. They have been generous enough to share their latest tactical bomber blueprints with us, and our airforce commanders believe these could very easily be adapted for griffons. Cooperation always has its benefits."
 GRI_develop_strat_bombers:0 "Death From Above"
 GRI_develop_strat_bombers_desc:0 "As knowledge of the dangers aircraft poses becomes apparent, bombing raids are becoming increasingly dangerous and uncertain to succeed. The solution lies in redesigning our aircraft to fly higher, above the range of anti-aircraft defences, where they can deliver their payload with impunity. Costs and effectiveness will have to be considered, however, but we are certain that a fleet of these bombers could wipe a city off the map in a single day."
 GRI_develop_heavy_fighters:0 "Guarding Our Bombers"
 GRI_develop_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Bombers may be capable of inflicting destruction on a large scale but they remain a vulnerable target and much like the archers of old, they cannot be left without protection. We need to invest in specialized fighters, capable of escorting them and seeing them through any opposition."
 GRI_project_eyr:0 "Project Eyr"
 GRI_project_eyr_desc:0 "For decades now, Equestrian and Severyanian scientists have toyed with the idea of using rocket-powered aircrafts to thrust themselves into the sky. Our scientists, however, have understood that these ideas are as naive as those of Celestia and Luna raising the sun and the moon. Rather than looking towards space, we can use these rockets to strike targets much further than any bomber could and without any risk involved for our pilots."
 GRI_project_arcturius:0 "Project Arcturius"
 GRI_project_arcturius_desc:0 "War in this century remains a grueling brawl. While weapons and tactics have changed, war seems to never change. Or so says common wisdom. However, our scientists are now telling us about a new class of weapons, one capable of fundamentally changing warfare. They say these bombs will be like Arcturius descended upon the mortals and make us giant among armies of infants."

 GRI_everything_is_on_fire_desc:0 "The reaction to Ferdinand's coup has been slightly more... enthusiastic than expected. That is to say, there is a crowd outside our headquarters and they seem very eager to get their claws on Ferdinand, or more specifically around his neck."
 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down:0 "Please Send Help"
 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down_desc:0 "Ferdinand has sent out a call for assistance to the few units loyal to him outside the city. The message itself calls on them to make their way to Griffenheim very fast, and to make ready for combat once they arrive. Hopefully, they will arrive soon. If they do not arrive, well then we might as well shoot ourselves now to save the firing line some bullets."
 GRI_secure_the_streets:0 "Panzers on the Streets"
 GRI_secure_the_streets_desc:0 "With our reinforcements finally having arrived and Griffenheim firmly in our claws the time has come to enforce order on the streets.

 GRI_a_bullet_for_the_priests_desc:0 "The knights of the Empire have apparently not gotten it through their skulls that we are in charge.

 GRI_a_message:0 "With a Message"
 GRI_a_message_desc:0 "A certain griffon has been a thorn in our side ever since the coup. He does possess a large amount of influence within the Empire, and moving against him will certainly be difficult. But if he cannot accept the new status quo, then he must go."
 GRI_traitors_within:0 "A Bullet For the Soldiers"
 GRI_traitors_within_desc:0 "The military has been pretty firmly split between those who support Ferdinand and those who are against him. Now, if we consider this from a legal perspective, if they refuse to accept the authority of the new leader then they refuse to accept the authority of the Empire itself. That is quite clearly treason, and the punishment for treason is quite clear as well."
 GRI_what_they_deserve:0 "And a Noose For the Commanders"
 GRI_what_they_deserve_desc:0 "Now that the common soldiers have been dealt with, the time has come for us to deal with the officers.

And what could be a more proper method of death for a traitor than the noose?"
 GRI_shoot_the_nobles:0 "Through the Windows"
 GRI_shoot_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles simply can't seem to shut up.

 GRI_kill_eros_desc:0 "Right, so the last attempt we made at the life of Eros was... less than successful. But the fact remains that we cannot tolerate his presence anymore. And when subtler methods fail, direct ones might succeed."

 GRI_the_anarchy_ends_desc:0 "Lord Protector Ferdinand and the Regierung der Nationalen Rettung have managed to destroy the treacherous elements of the Empire.

 GRI_propaganda_and_or_education_desc:0 "The Empire cannot hope to reclaim its former glory if its population, and more importantly its army, cannot read. The people will be educated in the correct manner, with an emphasis on how our glorious Lord Protector will save us from oblivion."

 GRI_a_portrait_in_every_home_desc:0 "Lord Protector Ferdinand has truly saved the Empire from destruction, and it is only fitting for such a monolithic figure to be adored by the populace.

 GRI_ministry_of_propaganda:0 "Reichsministerium für Propaganda"
 GRI_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "The press has never been an ally of the state, peddling vile rumors, and lies against the government at every turn. To ensure that the noble citizens of the Empire receive only the very best in journalism a state-sponsored ministry shall now oversee the journalists, to ensure fairness of course."
 GRI_kulturekampf:0 "Neuekultur"
 GRI_kulturekampf_desc:0 "A reborn empire needs a reborn culture, one that emphasizes the correct traits that every griffon should possess. Bravery, loyalty, and obedience shall be ingrained into the very fabric of society, lest the rot that infested the Empire return."
 GRI_the_war_economy:0 "The War Economy"
 GRI_the_war_economy_desc:0 "The economy only exists to serve the state, and the state only exists to battle its enemies through war. Thus, the economy must be tuned towards war. The factories will produce their goods to our exact specifications, and they will do so without complaint."
 GRI_convert_the_factories:0 "Convert the Factories"
 GRI_convert_the_factories_desc:0 "A large number of factories within the imperial city are dedicated to the production of pointless baubles and toys for the civilian population.

 GRI_military_industrial_council_desc:0 "Several prominent industrialists have been far more agreeable to our demands than the others, and such dedication and loyalty to the state should be rewarded.

 GRI_we_need_more_desc:0 "The citizens of the Empire will have to sacrifice much for the state, longer hours with lower pay will have to be tolerated, and unemployment will be eradicated amongst the working population. They will work as long as we command them to, anything less would be treason. "

 GRI_no_more_police_desc:0 "The police exist to ensure order on the streets and the loyalty of the populace. The military also exists to undertake these tasks. We should eliminate this institutional redundancy within the Empire by merging these two forces into one. "

 GRI_citizenship_for_service_desc:0 "The Imperial Army is a place for the very best of the best, and as such is no place for cowards.

 GRI_into_the_south_desc:0 "The former vassals of the Emperor boldly declared their independence and condemned the coup. They will soon regret their foolish loyalty to the old order!

We may be outnumbered, but the mighty Reichsarmee cannot be beaten with mere numbers!"
 GRI_core_the_universities:0 "Crush the Southerners"
 GRI_core_the_universities_desc:0 "The southerners have attempted in vain to establish their own national identities separate from the empire. We shall show them that these misguided and foolish attempts have done nothing to aid them and that they are all ultimately citizens of the Empire."

 GRI_core_the_shit_forest_desc:0 "Angriver and Katerin have been loyal constituents of the Empire for centuries, and despite whatever foolishness they might have convinced themselves to believe they still are. The Scheißwald will be reminded of its proper place, by force if necessary."

 GRI_use_it_for_propaganda_desc:0 "Romau has been the center of higher learning in the Empire for generations and is generally regarded as a safe choice to base our research and development efforts out of.

 GRI_secret_projects:0 "Wunderwaffen"
 GRI_secret_projects_desc:0 "With the more traditional areas of research now dealt with, the time has come to address some of the more... unorthodox ideas that our scientists have had.

 GRI_ban_the_feathisian_language_desc:0 "The oil fields of Feathisia could be put to much better use by the state, and as the victors, it is only right that we take what is ours. The denizens of Feathisia will deliver the oil fields to us, willingly or otherwise."

 GRI_expell_the_dogs_desc:0 "The dogs simply cannot stop talking about the late emperor, and this has grown into a problem too large to ignore. They can whine about his death all they want outside of the Empire, as they have proven that they cannot be trusted to serve as loyal citizens."

 GRI_push_into_the_north_desc:0 "To the north lie the vile traitors of the Griffonian Republic.

 GRI_the_virgin_land_desc:0 "Vedina, while never having been directly part of the Empire, is a land that has been untouched by war for a long time. The Empire was built on the corpses of lesser nations, and the time has come for Vedina to join the Griffonian Empire in a permanent fashion."
 GRI_string_up_kemerskai:0 "A Noose For the President-Marshal"
 GRI_string_up_kemerskai_desc:0 "President-Marshal Kemerskai is the original source of the weakness that has consumed the Empire for so long. The time has come for the criminal to face punishment for his actions, and there is only one sentence appropriate for the scale of his crimes."

 GRI_push_into_the_center_desc:0 "To the south lies the ultimate birthplace of the griffon race. Griffonstone is the source from which the progenitors of our species sprang forth. If the Empire is to be restored, we must secure this important region."
 GRI_respect_the_locals:0 "Nothing But Respect"
 GRI_respect_the_locals_desc:0 "The Reich will show nothing but respect to the denizens of the south, and as such we will form local auxiliaries to supplement our units. This course of action will surely aid us with the wider process of integrating the south."

 GRI_the_trade_cities_desc:0 "Skyfall, Griffton, and Fezera are some of the most prosperous trade cities on the continent. Expanding and supporting these centers of trade should be one of our first priorities, now that we've secured them."
 GRI_the_oil_fields:0 "The Greifwaldian Oil Fields"
 GRI_the_oil_fields_desc:0 "The oil fields of Greifwald have yet to be tapped to their full potential, and the machines of war consume oil at a truly frightening pace. Expanding these wells will bolster our economy, and aid in making us less reliant on foreign sources for our oil."
 GRI_integrate_the_west:0 "The West Is Ours"
 GRI_integrate_the_west_desc:0 "The fires of resistance within the west have finally been extinguished, and it is now ready for final reintegration into the Empire. The boons of securing this region are already making themselves clear, and will only grow once reintegration is complete."

 GRI_arantigos_reborn:0 "Arantigos Reborn"
 GRI_arantigos_reborn_desc:0 "The citizens of Arantiga have started to act strangely these past few weeks. It seems that they have convinced themselves that the Lord Protector is Arantigos reborn. While normally such foolishness would be stamped out, the Lord Protector has, after giving serious thought to the idea, decided to embrace it as fact. Is there anyone which can deny that his conquests do not surpass those of Arantigos?"
 GRI_falcorian_legion:0 "The Conquest of Asterion"
 GRI_falcorian_legion_desc:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion have never truly accepted the authority of the Empire, and have continued to resist our rightful rule for generations. The time has come to remind them that the Empire is the dominant force on Griffonia, and that they would be wise to accept this simple fact."
 GRI_integrate_the_south:0 "Wingbardy Delenda Est"
 GRI_integrate_the_south_desc:0 "Wingbardy was and is nothing more than an artificial construct created by the Empire. And as punishment for their treachery, Wingbardian identity shall be utterly destroyed. There will no longer be any Wingbardians, only citizens of the Empire."
 GRI_the_new_frontier:0 "Reclaim the Frontier"
 GRI_the_new_frontier_desc:0 "The old frontier represented the farthest reaches of the Empire, and the time has come to reclaim it. The principalities, knightly orders as well as the territories of the Gryphian Host all rightfully belong to the Empire after all. "
 GRI_crush_the_commies:0 "Griffonia's Far Eastern Port"
 GRI_crush_the_commies_desc:0 "Riaportu is the most economically valuable port within southern Griffonia, and developing it further would most certainly help with developing our naval forces."
 GRI_respect_the_cossacks:0 "Kosakenland"
 GRI_respect_the_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks of the Gryphian Host have proven to be strangely accepting of our authority, and such obedience is to be rewarded. We can allow them some autonomy in exchange for their service in our armies."
 GRI_integrate_the_frontier:0 "Integrate the Frontier"
 GRI_integrate_the_frontier_desc:0 "The frontier, after many months of hard work, is finally ready for its final integration into the wider Empire. When this is finished we will finally have fully reclaimed the borders of the old Empire."

 GRI_operation_grover_ii_desc:0 "The old Empire was stopped from further expansion at the borders of the frontier, with even the greatest conquerors being unable to subjugate the Riverlands and the surrounding area. If we can accomplish this herculean task, we will finally have fully surpassed the old Empire."
 GRI_crush_the_partisans:0 "Woe To the Vanquished"
 GRI_crush_the_partisans_desc:0 "With the recent capture of Prince Heavenly Snow, an opportunity to break the spirit of Lake City has presented itself. The Prince will be punished harshly for defying the Empire, and the ponies will be reminded of our strength."

 GRI_land_for_the_veterans_desc:0 "With the Riverlands finally subjugated, we have found ourselves with a large amount of land that needs to be distributed. And what reward could be more fitting for our soldiers than the rights to the very land that they conquered. "
 GRI_reichkomissariats:0 "Establish the Reichskommissariats"
 GRI_reichkomissariats_desc:0 "Managing the Riverlands is an extremely taxing endeavour, and it is proving to be more of a headache than it is worth. By allowing some measure of autonomy, we can at the very least throw this problem over at some other griffon."
 
 GRI_griffenheim_square:0 "Times Are Changing..."
 GRI_griffenheim_square_desc:0 "His Majesty has come of age, and must immediately undergo a challenging trial as the students march on the streets and demand reforms. Order must be restored, but it is up to the Emperor to decide how it will be done."
 GRI_hear_them_out:0 "Hear Them Out"
 GRI_hear_them_out_desc:0 "The protesters are right, radical reform is needed now that the Empire has been reunited. The bloated military-industrial complex and wartime quotas have no reason to exist, and the loyal subjects of the Empire deserve to have their voices heard."
 GRI_recall_the_troops:0 "Recall The Reichsarmee"
 GRI_recall_the_troops_desc:0 "Ever since the protests began the army has been on standby, preparing to step in if any signs of an imminent revolution were to appear. The patrolling soldiers and army vehicles have made our subjects rather uneasy, so now the Emperor has decided to order them to return to their barracks."
 GRI_talk_with_the_students:0 "Talk With The Leaders"
 GRI_talk_with_the_students_desc:0 "While the protests started without much organization, the students have flocked behind prominent reformists and democrats with political experience. Many of them were once our enemies, but perhaps reconciliation is in order so we can live together in peace."
 GRI_allow_independent_press:0 "Allow Coverage"
 GRI_allow_independent_press_desc:0 "So far there has been strict censorship on the news coverage of the protests, both domestically and abroad. This allows for vicious rumours to spread, some even claiming that innocent civilians are being gunned down in Griffenheim. These lies can only be stopped by revealing the truth to all."
 GRI_the_promise:0 "For A Better Tomorrow"
 GRI_the_promise_desc:0 "The protests remain calm and there is no threat of revolution. Yet nevertheless His Majesty plans to accept most of the demands of the student movement. His motive is not to end the resistance, but to reform the Empire into a more democratic nation that genuinely cares for its subjects."
 GRI_support_conservative_parties:0 "Support The Volksfront"
 GRI_support_conservative_parties_desc:0 "The Volksfront has for some years now been a banned political organization, whose members were hounded as republican sympathisers and traitors. Now His Majesty has decided to lift the ban and pardon the members of the party, because the only "crime" they committed was advocating liberty."
 GRI_seperation_of_church_and_state:0 "Separate Temples And The State"
 GRI_seperation_of_church_and_state_desc:0 "The influence of the Archonate of Boreas has always been strong in Griffenheim, but this influence kept growing until the line between the Three Temples and the Empire itself became blurry. The Emperor has decreed that this must change, so religious authorities become humble servants of the people."
 GRI_limiting_the_monarchy:0 "Defining The Kaiser's Authority"
 GRI_limiting_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Ever since Grover I, the Emperor's authority was assumed to be absolute or non-existent, depending on the Emperor. None dared to speak against Grover II in fear of violent death, while everyone conspired against poor Grover V. This fluctuation must end once and for all: Grover VI shall be neither absolute, nor a puppet."
 GRI_release_moderate_leaders:0 "Forgive And Forget"
 GRI_release_moderate_leaders_desc:0 "After the revolution of 978, thousands of political prisoners have languished in detention, and the Imperial reunification only swelled this number with countless prisoners of war and resistance members. Now His Majesty has ordered the immediate pardon and release of those who once saw him as an enemy."
 GRI_permit_regional_parties:0 "Unban Regionalist Parties"
 GRI_permit_regional_parties_desc:0 "The regent was determined from the very beginning to make the Empire far more centralized than it had been before, refusing to allow nations such as the Kingdom of Aquileia and the Kingdom of Wingbardy to even exist. But the Emperor says there is no need to be so extreme, and that regionalists aren't rebels but loyal subjects who simply desire more autonomy."
 GRI_article_of_federalisation:0 "The Article Of Federalisation"
 GRI_article_of_federalisation_desc:0 "The Empire is too vast to be a unitary, oppressive state. Power must be dispersed from the capital into the numerous regions of the Empire to a reasonable extent. This way every griffon will have their voice heard, either by a local governor or by the Emperor himself, no matter how far away from the capital they live."
 GRI_finalise_the_constitution:0 "The Imperial Constitution"
 GRI_finalise_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Emperor desires to go one step further from simply defining the limits of his powers. He wishes to draft an official constitution for the Empire, first of its kind, which will define new democratic bodies of government to rule alongside the Emperor. It will also introduce something truly groundbreaking: Universal suffrage for all citizens."
 GRI_the_election:0 "The First Election"
 GRI_the_election_desc:0 "Many in the world cannot believe it to be true: The Empire is preparing to hold its first democratic elections. Not only will a parliament be formed, but local governors will be voted for as well. The conflict between the former liberal Republic and the authoritarian Empire has come to an end, as they have now become one and the same."
 
 GRI_demilitarise_the_economy:0 "Demilitarise The Economy"
 GRI_demilitarise_the_economy_desc:0 "The reunification is over. There is no longer a constant need for thousands of rifles and millions of bullets. The largest conflicts have been fought, and the people have suffered long enough from war-time rationing and quotas. The Emperor has officially decreed that the Imperial economy must be returned under civilian control as soon as possible."
 GRI_limit_conscription_term:0 "Cap Conscription Terms"
 GRI_limit_conscription_term_desc:0 "During the reunification wars, there was no definite limit on the length of conscription for citizens. While this enabled us to have a large pool of griffonpower to draw from, it did mean that a large portion of the populace was forced to serve in the army for a long time. Now a formal limit of 5 years of service shall be universally introduced."
 GRI_abolish_conscription:0 "Abolish Conscription"
 GRI_abolish_conscription_desc:0 "To get enough griffonpower for the reunification wars, the Empire had no choice but to force its able-bodied citizens to serve in the army. Now there is no need for such oppression and coercion, and the Empire's population is so vast that volunteers alone could fill the ranks of the army. Therefore His Majesty has decided to end conscription for now."
 GRI_ensure_free_trade:0 "Ensure Free Trade"
 GRI_ensure_free_trade_desc:0 "Securing strategic resources by limiting exports and trying our best to make our enemies not prosper by refusing to trade with them was reasonable before. Now, when our enemies are few and our economy is demilitarizing, it is no longer justified. Emperor Grover VI wishes to tear down all barriers on commerce, which will further boost civilian economy."
 GRI_welfare_for_all:0 "A Caring State"
 GRI_welfare_for_all_desc:0 "The Empire has caused a tremendous amount of suffering and loss of life with the reunification wars. Now it is time to pay back our moral debt and give back to those we have taken from. With increased revenue from a revived civilian economy, we can afford to support those less fortunate in our society, and make sure all our subjects live better lives."
 GRI_the_autobahn:0 "The Kaiserliche Autobahn"
 GRI_the_autobahn_desc:0 "The only accomplishment of Grover V was a railway network connecting most of Herzland. Grover VI wishes to continue in his paw steps except on a much grander scale: a concrete motorway intended for automobiles, which are becoming increasingly common. It will connect every city and town of the vast Empire, but will be worth every Idol spent on it."
 GRI_securing_the_future:0 "Securing The Future"
 GRI_securing_the_future_desc:0 "Imperial education during the regency served two purposes: Eradication of illiteracy and indoctrination of our subjects. Neither are no longer needed. An extensive reform of the curriculum will liberalize the arts and sciences. The students, who used to protest on the streets, will be grateful as we will allow them to think for themselves."
 GRI_back_to_normal:0 "A New Empire For A New Age"
 GRI_back_to_normal_desc:0 "The Emperor has reshaped his Empire as he desired, and solved the crisis that threatened to end his reign before it had even truly begun. Now there is peace and stability in the Empire once more, and its subjects look forward to a long and prosperous life under the wise guidance of His Majesty. Götter erhalten Grover den Kaiser!"
 
 GRI_send_in_the_tanks:0 "Send In The Tanks"
 GRI_send_in_the_tanks_desc:0 "These "protesters" are nothing but a potential repeat of 978, possibly paid for by foreign influences who bemoan the resurgent state of our glorious Empire. Having legitimate concerns is acceptable, but attempting to undermine the Emperor's authority is not. It is clear that only force will disperse this rabble."
 GRI_mass_crackdowns:0 "Mass Crackdowns"
 GRI_mass_crackdowns_desc:0 "This infestation is worse than we thought. It is not just occuring in Griffenheim, but across the entire Empire! Their numbers grow by the day, and their demands are becoming increasingly radical and unacceptable. The Reichsarmee will have to be mobilised to handle this issue, as quickly as possible."
 GRI_arrest_the_students:0 "Arrest The Students"
 GRI_arrest_the_students_desc:0 "Emboldened by seditious philosophies, these students who were supposed to be our bright future, that would inherit the order we've fought so bitterly to restore, have turned their back on the Emperor. No doubt they conspire with Republican remnants, or worse. Everycreature who has been involved in this protest must be investigated thoroughly to determine their true motivations."
 GRI_muzzle_the_press:0 "Muzzle The Press"
 GRI_muzzle_the_press_desc:0 "The newspapers and radio broadcasts are spreading wild hysteria with their biased reporting, showing us as tyrannical murderers of children while the protesters are being whitewashed and absolved of their crimes. Free speech is a dangerously radical policy that could convince the gullible masses to rise up in revolt. We have no choice but to silence the rabblerousing journalists and promote those who remain loyal."
 GRI_the_emperor_of_griffonkind:0 "The Once And Future Kaiser Of Griffonkind"
 GRI_the_emperor_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "In spite of everything, tension remains palpable and unrest could very likely continue. The Emperor has decided, after long consultation with his advisers, to implement token reforms that will quell most of the moderate protesters, while ensuring that power remains centralised within the Emperor himself. The line of Grover, of the purest blood and most noble griffon qualities, shall lead us now and forever."
 GRI_reform_imperial_party:0 "Reform The Kaiserpartei"
 GRI_reform_imperial_party_desc:0 "Grover V's reign saw an attempt to establish an imperial political party dedicated to furthering the cause and idea of monarchism and autocratic rule outside of the traditional methods of court politics. The attempt fell through but we can learn from their mistakes and build a new and successful Kaiserpartei. Even in upholding tradition, one must learn to use innovative methods."
 GRI_reaffirm_emperors_role:0 "Reaffirm The Kaiser's Role"
 GRI_reaffirm_emperors_role_desc:0 "Although the Empire can be proud of its long tradition and just laws, there are some issues that remain unresolved because they were never strictly codified. One of them would be the legal definition of the Emperor's authority, which has varied depending on the ruler and circumstances. To prevent any future misunderstandings or disasters, it will have to be put to the paper."
 GRI_attract_detractors:0 "Convince The Detractors"
 GRI_attract_detractors_desc:0 "Even among those who support the Emperor, there are dissidents. Their grievances are not severe enough to merit punishment, but the Kaiserpartei must project an image of strength and unity. Favours and concessions would be enough to secure their allegiance, while rooting out any ideas of disobedience."
 GRI_appoint_a_PM:0 "The New Reichskanzler"
 GRI_appoint_a_PM_desc:0 "The storm is passing and now that we have crushed those foolish cries for democracy, it is time to appoint an official head of government. Many protesters called for such an appointment but we will do so on our own terms and the new Reichskanzler will serve only at the discretion of the Emperor."
 GRI_bribe_the_oppossition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
 GRI_bribe_the_oppossition_desc:0 "Money changes griffons, this is known. The Emperor's authority cannot be undermined, but a paid opposition, which will give the public an appearance of checks and balances, is the next step in bringing the Empire to a new age. We are certain that the "opposition" will be smart enough to read what we give them, and not attempt to propose radical ideas. Best not to bite the claw that feeds them, after all."
 GRI_local_collborators:0 "Permit Regionalism"
 GRI_local_collborators_desc:0 "Even with the modern communication technology we have, the Empire's domains are vast, which means that responses to events are not always as quick as we'd like. However, if we permit regions that are known to be pacified certain autonomies, it would make administering our realm much more straightforward. We are prepared for the protests that will inevitably spring from the troublesome provinces."
 GRI_calculated_releases:0 "Release The Prisoners"
 GRI_calculated_releases_desc:0 "Not all griffons who were imprisoned for inciting insurrection are harbouring true guilt. Some were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, or were misblamed by their opportunistic enemies. By releasing those whose crimes are non-existent or minuscule, we shall garner the public's goodwill, while the real malcontents remain imprisoned until they repent for their misdeeds."
 GRI_draft_a_constitution:0 "Draft A Constitution"
 GRI_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "Ever since Grover I acquired the Idol of Boreas and formed our Empire, the function of the state has always been organized through various custom,  limited laws, precedents and the Emperor's character. It is time to synthesise the spirit of all these old rules and formalize the Griffonian Way of ruling into a constitution. It shall rest on the pillars of Autocracy, Faith and the Griffonian National Spirit."

 GRI_bureaucracy:0 "Bloated Bureaucracy"
 GRI_bureaucracy_desc:0 "After years of neglect, failure to modernise and general corruption, the Imperial bureaucratic system has become a bloated abomination. It is not unusual to wait a full month just to get an audience with a bureaucrat. That bureaucrat then redirects you to another one so you can file several forms that in the end turn out to be unnecessary."

 ### Characters ###
 GRI_emperor_grover_v:0 "Emperor Grover V"
 archon_proteus:0 "Archon Proteus III"
 archon_proteus_desc:0 "From a young age, Konrad Krukenberg was considered to be blessed by Arcturius, the god of war. He was strong in both mind and soul, fearless in danger and always willing to sacrifice for the greater good. As a child he admired chivalrous knights and wished to join their ranks, but to do so one had to earn the title first. And so he joined the Reichsarmee as soon as he came of age. His courage and exemplary piety meant that within a few years he gained the rank of military chaplain, serving the spiritual needs of his fellow soldiers.\n\nHowever, this was the first time Konrad had to deal with administrative tasks, and he quickly began to despise them. Being a commoner, he had never learned until now, which only contributed to his distaste of paperwork. Oftentimes he delegated it to others while focusing on training. This eventually paid off, when his regiment faced a raid from the Sunstriker clan and suffered heavy casualties. Without Konrad to lead them and improve their morale, they would've lost the battle. For this act he was rewarded with Knighthood, and his dream was realized.\n\nBut the clergy of the Temple of Arcturius had other plans for him. The Prelate of Yale had died of old age and a new one was needed, so Konrad was appointed as he was the least controversial candidate. Soon he began to regret accepting the offer, being overwhelmed with administrative duties while having few if any military ones. This was when his popularity among the commoners began to rise however, and Konrad used this popular support to gain the title of Archon, so he could avoid doing any paperwork. Now he became Archon Proteus III, despite opposition from some of the clergy who accused him of neglecting his duty.\n\nNot long after, the Empire was embroiled in the revolution of 978 and Proteus was delighted to once more fight on the frontline. He lead the Reichsarmee to many victories over the revolutionaries, making his popularity soar among the military. Ever since he has been a friend of Archon Eros, who cooperated with him during the struggle. He is ready to stand by his side to the bitter end if need be."
 archon_erion:0 "Archon Erion XII"
 archon_erion_desc:0 "Youngest of the three Archons, born in 959, Erion XII has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Eyrite Temple to the very top. However, this was not achieved by exceptional piety alone, nor by hard and honest work. Erion is ever hungry for more power and is not afraid to use more questionable and violent means to gain it. Now that he has achieved supremacy in the Archonate of Eyr itself, he seeks to grow his temporal power as well.\n\nAll this has made Erion rather unpopular among the nobility and the clergy, who see him as a threat and a lunatic. The hatred is mutual, as Erion often rants about the corruption of the nobles of Griffonia and the senators of Romau, and the incompetence and lack of zealotry of the priesthood. Many commoners are swayed by his fiery and passionate speeches, especially among the lower classes. Erion's control of education contributes to this as young students are indoctrinated and turned into faithful servants of Eyr.\n\nWhile Erion is power-hungry, none can deny he is a devout Eyrite as well. His parents, poor industrial workers in Romau, were very religious and conservative, and sent all their children to a temple school. There, the eyes of their youngest child, Lorenz Whitefeather, were opened and he became a faithful servant of Eyr, the goddess of fertility and family. After becoming an Archon, Lorenz chose the archonal name of Erion. Even to this day, Erion sends money to his old parents, and preaches the importance of traditional values.\n\nErion has a tenuous relationship with his fellow Archons of the Borean and Arcturian temples. As Eros is one of the most influential griffons in Heartlands, Erion always seeks to impress him and earn his favour, so Eros would entrust him with more power. Eros sees through his act, however, but sees him as a useful if dangerous pawn. Proteus on the other claw openly distrusts and dislikes Erion, and Erion despises him in return for his lack of piety and neglect of clerical duty. The two only work together because they must."
 archon_eros:0 "Archon Eros VII"
 archon_eros_desc:0 "One of the oldest living griffons, Archon Eros VII was born when the Empire was at the height of its power. At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory. The traitors and unbelievers will pay with their blood, Boreas wills it!"

At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory.

She has always championed for the cause of her peers, but she is not blind to the plight of the common griffon and wishes to introduce limited reforms to the system, genuinely wishing for the people to have a good life, proud of their country. All she does, she does it in honour of her friend, the late Emperor, and holds in contempt the Archons, believing that they'll ruin the country with their dangerously radical ideas.

In 957 the young Elias finished his secondary education, but with no hope of ever inheriting his father's business he chose to become an army cadet at the prestigious Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nIn spite of some initial hurdles Elias quickly proved himself an adept strategist and a masterful if rather stubborn planner. While his blunt demeanour and oftentimes mirthless attitude did not exactly earn him many friends, he nevertheless managed to find a sense of camaraderie and some would say friendship with fellow cadet Erich Ebonwing: who like Elias himself would go on to earn the rank of Generalfeldmarschall.\n\nElias began to steadily climb the Reichsarmee hierarchy, which was frequently dominated by nobility. However, Elias would only truly earn a place in the eyes of the Empire at-large during the Republican Revolution of 978; the constant delays his troops caused the Republicans proved to be crucial in allowing the Loyalist forces to regroup, and his victory over General Reinhard Suntail at the Battle of Crona in 979 earned him the rank of Generaloberst. In 991 Elias finally achieved the rank of Generalfeldmarschall due to both his skill and his many years of service\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"

The young Erich spent his youth in abjact luxury - partying and drinking his days away, caring little for his studies. Thus it came as a surprise to both his friends and his family when he chose to attend the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nEbonwing would to the surprise of many prove himself a capable officer, a resourceful leader and a fierce combatant - All of these factors coupled with his natural charisma and force of personality managed to win him the respect of many of his peers, the most notable of which was the usually mirthless Elias Bronzetail.\n\nDue to his noble background Erich was able to advance his career rapidly. However, it would be during the Republican Revolution of 978 when Ebonwing truly showed his prowess as a military commander. Beating the Republicans at the Battles of Vinnin, Gamia and Osnabeak the young Oberst quickly became a media darling and a living propaganda tool, in spite of his prowess he could not stop the so called 'Rape of Crona' an event that affected him deeply. Thus, it came as no surprise that when the Republicans were finally chased out of Griffenheim in 979 that it was Ebonwing who gave chase. Chasing them from Griffenheim to Brenna, Ebonwing would have more than likely contiuned hounding the Revolutionaries all the way to Cloudbury had he and his troops not been recalled back to Griffenheim in order to assist in restoring order to the Imperial Heartlands.\n\nFor his actions during the Revolution Ebonwing would much like his friend and comrade Elias be promoted; first to the rank of Generaloberst in 981, and finally to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall in 996\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

A sickly and weak albino, whoever his parents were had simply opted to leave the young griffon in the care of the Arcturian Archonate.\n\nThis decision would not only save Ferdinand's life, but ultimately, propel him to greatness, as it was precisely due to his upbringing within the Arcturian priesthood that he was able to flourish into the formidable griffon he is today.\n\nIn spite of his sickly disposition and poor eyesight, Ferdinand's priestly caretakers quickly noticed the young griffon's sharp mind and attention to detail; talents which they quickly chose to cultivate. By 978, Ferdinand was well on his way to becoming an Arcturian priest, and he might well have become one had a simple event not occurred - The Republican Revolution.\n\nIt was the Revolution that gave Dawnclaw his first taste of war, and while he was too young to join the Reichsarmee or even assist in the fighting, he found himself so enamoured by the violence that when he finally finished his studies in 983, he chose to attend the Reich Militärakademie in Vinnin rather than be ordained as an Arcturian Priest.\n\nAfter graduating from Vinnin in 987, Ferdinand steadily rose through the ranks of the Reichsarmee, managing to attain the rank of Oberstleutnant in 1004 via a battlefield promotion in a skirmish at the Feathisian-Cloudsburian border - the murky circumstances of which many within the Imperial General Staff have found rather confusing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"

Long hours in the factory and on and on until he was to die some point. However, as time marched on, he turned out to be decidedly not that, having been involved with numerous petty crimes during his time.\n\nThis would, once the law caught up to him, be the start of his rather strange way up the ladder to a command position. Originally destined for the infantry, which seemed to be a certain death sentence, he instead became one of the first to join the Sturmtruppen or the 'Dare-to-die' Corps as it was called in military circles. He gained a probably not healthy reputation for always charging into the enemy lines as the first, earning him several battlefield promotions as his superiors either retired or died. Usually the latter. Stories about him are popular material both in the Imperial newspapers and in the military rumour mill, with at least a few being true such as him refusing sedation during surgery.\n\nNevertheless, in later years, he has been known in the Imperial Officer Corps as one of the foremost proponents of the Superior Firepower doctrine and has called for its implementation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Richmay"

Whatever he dreamt of, from architect and trader to politician and his chief interest, engineering was all shot down by his parents in their intense desire to see the family legacy continued. In other words, forced into the military at age 16, far away from the books and bridges he had enjoyed before, and even farther away from the engineering battalions.\n\nWhile slowly climbing the ranks in the Kaiserliche Armee, he turned to the bottle as a way to cope with his quashed hope and dreams for the future, and slowly sank into a depression. It would take the Revolution to wake him up, as he arranged the finer mechanics of the Second Battle of Griffenheim, getting the improvised bridges quickly up to permit the artillery bombardment of the Republican positions.\n\nHowever, this did not come without cost, as he was wounded by artillery shrapnel during the last few hours of the battle. This led to an even worse habit as he became addicted to the cocaine provided to him, along with other substances. Since then, he has mainly been idling in his office, counting the time until he can retire with a big pension to return to his first passion.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup/Sesek"

Young Cecilia was destined to live a life of luxury and wealth, but fate decided otherwise; As in 980 the famed Aquileian Revolution began. The Revolution would see both of her parents beheaded, and the then nine year old griffoness spirited away into the forested hills of Orvalillo by a group of loyal retainers.\n\nAnd so, the young Countess would live in the forest, safe from the chaos that had consumed her homeland, and although her parents were dead, her retainers nevertheless did everything in their power to ensure that Cecilia had at least some semblance of a normal childhood. She was given a basic education but also learned how to live off the land and hunt. This would continue until Marshal Berthelot's Counter-Revolution in 985, at which point Cecilia would at long last return to civilisation.\n\nWhile her title and lands were returned to her, the wealth and power that were tied to it were not as the Discret used the situation to consolidate power away from the traditional nobility. By 989 Cecilia would enroll in the prestigious Écoles des Beaux-Arts in Rila, where she would in turn briefly join the MPA which she left a month later after deciding that they were nothing but fools and upstarts. Thoroughly dissatisfied with both the Discrets and the Republicans, Cecilia concluded that Aquileia had only truly been great while it had been under the Griffonian Empire and would end up forming the Impératrice Giselda Society, which sought to restore Imperial hegemony over Aquileia.\n\nThe Impératrice Giselda Society would quickly be suppressed by the Discrets and Cecilia forced into hiding once more. After being sentenced to death (in absentia) for high treason in 1000, she would once again return to the forests of Orvalillo where she and what few compatriots she had; From there, she began a guerilla campaign against both the Discrets and the Republicans rebel groups. Although she received little to no material support from the Empire, she very quickly became an Imperial Media Darling after an article about the Impératrice Giselda Society was published in 1004, something that would earn her the at the time honourary rank of Major and a commendation from Archon Proteus. After being forced to evacuate Orvalillo and by extension Aquileia in 1005, Cecilia would at long last formally join the Reichsarmee.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"
 GRI_arnold_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of February, 953 in Soldau\n\n§YRank§!: Generalmajor\n\n§YBiography§!: The son of a Hellquilian Baker from Soldau, Scheer's family moved West into the Heartlands when he was young, so as to find better opportunity and get out of Hellquill - ultimately a good idea, if the political landscape was anything to go by.\n\nScheer grew up reasonably well off for his family's standing, and finished both his primary and secondary education, spending a short term as a teacher in his new home city of Helheim. He quickly grew listless, however, and found that he was not overly fond of small children, and so began to look for other opportunities. On the word of a friend of the family, Arnold enlisted into the Kaiser Groverakademie Officer Candidate School on a whim, able to pay his own way with a mix of personal funds and saved funds given by his family.\n\nHe quickly butted heads with his then rival, Cornello Galluzzo, who held little regard for the bookish Scheer, and the two held little love for each other through most of their Officer's training, eventually fostering a healthy respect for each other by the time they'd graduated the course. They wouldn't be legitimate friends until the year 978, however, with the advent of the Republican Revolution in the Griffon Empire. During the Civil War, Scheer put his bookish nature to great use, and made a name for himself as an excellent Logistician, able to "magic up supplies from thin air," as one officer remarked. Due to his efforts, the Monarchist army was able to remain supplied, even when it was thought next to impossible, and raised himself to local hero status when he was able to deliver supplies four miles past enemy lines to the surrounded but easily holding forces of Cornello Galluzzo- which incidentally, made the two fast friends. Galluzzo, who'd been waging an unconventional guerilla warfare style of combat in the thick Scheisswald forest, denies that he'd ever needed resupply, but more than readily thanks Scheer, even to this day.\n\nFor his fantastic logistical abilities, Scheer was elevated to General staff, and by 1006, had achieved the rank of Majorgenerall. Though he has no current field command, he instead has the unenviable task of managing the Imperial Army's logistics and supply channels.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"

The young griffon, however, found himself quite smitten with the outdoors, finding himself at home in the mountains and forests of his homeland. As he grew up, he found little to no interest in his family's business, and instead began to travel the Empire on his own, so as to find a place to fit in. This would lead him to the Capitol, Griffenheim, where he finally enlisted with the Imperial Military, having exhausted all other options.\n\nFinding himself at home amongst the armed forces, Galluzzo spent several years as an NCO until his unit commander paid for him to go through the Kaiser Groverkademie Officer's course in Griffenheim. Galluzzo passed his courses with distinction, and there met his longtime friend and part time rival, Arnold Scheer. The two initially grew to dislike each other, what with Scheer's bookish nature clashing with Galluzzo's outdoorsgriffship, but they came to respect each other during their courses.\n\nAt the time of the Republican Revolution of 978, the two had become friends, and supported each other during the civil war. There, Galluzzo's love of the outdoors bled into his style of warfare, where his active lifestyle and terrain knowledge made the then Hauptmann an excellent field officer.\n\nBy the end of the war, Galluzzo had fought in several difficult battles in difficult terrain, such as mountains and thick forests, winning stunning victories for the Monarchist forces and cementing him his rank of Oberst. Galluzzo is a dedicated proponent of extreme terrain training for the Griffon Imperial Military, and has recently begun to push high command to create a special tasks and training branch of the Imperial Army.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Fed up with dealing with his excesses, his mother and father shipped him off to the Kaiser Groverakademie Officer's Academy in Griffenheim, where he was beaten into shape by his instructors, and re-moulded into a proper military officer despite his personal failings earlier in his life.\n\nHe easily made his rank as a Junior Officer, having grown up with a decent schooling from his parents. However, his old habits began to creep back into his lifestyle having made a rank, and he was frequently in trouble with his superior officers for inviting his aristocratic friends to outlandish parties requiring the intervention of the Military Constabulary.\n\nThings changed, though, in the year 978, when the Republican Revolution broke out. Frolich, who'd been at the Military Academy celebrating a fellow Aristocrat's Graduation party, nearly panicked and ran when gunfire broke out in the city. Seeing his terrified countrygriffs - barely adults themselves changed something within him, though.\n\nTechnically the highest ranking officer at the Academy, as the instructors held no rank on the basis of being retired officers, Theodor steeled himself and took charge of the situation, snapping out orders in a manner which no one had heard from the aristocratic griffon before. With his troops rallied and the academy's out of date armaments passed out, Frolich organized as good a defense as he could manage, defending the Officer's Academy for nearly a week, until Griffenheim was declared lost to the Republicans. Refusing to just up and surrender himself and his troops, however, Teodor led his soldiers in a fighting retreat out of the Academy and through the city, until they regrouped with the Monarchist armies southeast of the city.\n\nFor his actions, he received the favor of the crown for his calm under extenuating circumstances, and for his later actions during the Republican rebellion, he continued to climb through the ranks, making the prestigious rank of Majorgenerall by 1005, a mere thirty years after his induction into the Empire's officer korps.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup/Flake"

Born in 941 in Greenback as the son of intellectuals, he distinguished himself as being able to sink into a deep concentration state, despite normally being utterly unable to keep his attention on anything else. He originally joined the military as a way to get some 'real life' experience (his parent's words) before he was going into a life of sheltered academia. \n\nWhatever the motivation of the young Silverfeather, this was certainly not to last, as he found a home in the military, often sinking his mind into solving complex problems. A few kind words from his superior later, he was fast-tracked onto the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim where he graduated with honors before being stationed in the outskirts of Griffenheim, or what someone would call 'the most boring post in the world'.\n\nThis changed when in 978, as a Oberst, the Revolution broke out in Griffenheim. Silverfeather immediately rallied to the Emperor's side, being personally responsible to break through to the Palace to evacuate the Emperor.

Although his family had long since grown rich due to their ties to the whaling industry. However, Thranx found his family's existence rather dull and as such he would soon find himself enlisting in the Changeling Army.\n\nServing as an enlisted trooper for a full service rotation, Thranx found that he rather enjoyed his time as a infantryling, and decided to remain with the service. On the suggestion of his peers, he used his family's connections to land himself a spot in the Vesapolis Officer's Academy.\n\nFrom there, he graduated near the middle of his class, and would go on to be an infantry commander during the Canterlot Invasion under the then Hivesmarschall Synovial. Although the Invasion ended in failure Thranx would nevertheless continue to steadily rise through the ranks of the Changeling Army, earning the rank of Major in 1005 ALB - coincidentally the same year the Changeling-Griffonian attaché was formed.\n\nThranx, intrigued by the prospect of getting to explore a whole new continent, would go on to become one of the very few Changelings to volunteer to join the attaché. Ultimately this decision would prove rather fruitful for the Changeling, as he found himself right at home both rubbing shoulders with the Imperial nobility, and in helping the now Oberst Synovial run the attaché. Although, it could be said that he has gotten a bit too friendly with the locals - if the tales of his late night dalliances are anything to go by.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

He was strong in both mind and soul, fearless in danger and always willing to sacrifice for the greater good. As a child he admired chivalrous knights and wished to join their ranks, but to do so one had to earn the title first. And so he joined the Reichsarmee as soon as he came of age. His courage and exemplary piety meant that within a few years he gained the rank of military chaplain, serving the spiritual needs of his fellow soldiers.\n\nHowever, this was the first time Konrad had to deal with administrative tasks, and he quickly began to despise them. Being a commoner, he had never learned until now, which only contributed to his distaste of paperwork. Oftentimes he delegated it to others while focusing on training. This eventually paid off, when his regiment faced a raid from the Sunstriker clan and suffered heavy casualties. Without Konrad to lead them and improve their morale, they would've lost the battle. For this act he was rewarded with Knighthood, and his dream was realized.\n\nBut the clergy of the Temple of Arcturius had other plans for him. The Prelate of Yale had died of old age and a new one was needed, so Konrad was appointed as he was the least controversial candidate. Soon he began to regret accepting the offer, being overwhelmed with administrative duties while having few if any military ones. This was when his popularity among the commoners began to rise however, and Konrad used this popular support to gain the title of Archon, so he could avoid doing any paperwork. Now he became Archon Proteus III, despite opposition from some of the clergy who accused him of neglecting his duty.\n\nNot long after, the Empire was embroiled in the revolution of 978 and Proteus was delighted to once more fight on the frontline. He lead the Reichsarmee to many victories over the revolutionaries, making his popularity soar among the military. Ever since he has been a friend of Archon Eros, who cooperated with him during the struggle. He is ready to stand by his side to the bitter end if need be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Niezow"

 GRI_demand_frontier:0 "Demand Frontier States"
 GRI_demand_frontier_desc:0 "The perfidious eastern ponies have invaded the eastern frontier and now unlawfully occupy lands which are rightfully ours.

 GRI_offer_peace:0 "Offer Peace"

 GRI_intergrate_bronzehill_desc:0 "While we have made our promises to Bronzehill of autonomy in return for their every loving loyalty and devotion to His Imperial Majesty, it is time to increase our control over their mountains and fully reintegrate them into the Empire."
 
 GRI_attache_decisions:0 "The Changeling-Griffonian Attaché"
 GRI_attache_decisions_desc:0 "The §YChangeling-Griffonian attaché§!, or officially the §YKaiserlicher Änderungsvertrag über Freundschaft und Zusammenarbeit§!, The "Imperial Changeling Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation", is a military cooperation agreement between the §GChangeling Lands§! and the Empire. It has served mainly to refine the doctrine of Changeling warfare after their unification under Queen Chrysalis, and to improve the technology of the Reichsarmee.\n\nHeaded in the Empire by the Changeling general §YSynovial§! and his §RPanzerkorps§! the attaché has made substantial headway both in its intended goal of military cooperation, and in creating a bond between the two nations, at least for the time being.\n\n§GThere will be a variety of opportunities for further collaboration between the two countries, but all programs must first be suggested by the Empire, and meet Changeling approval.§!"
 GRI_propose_military_exchange_program:0 "The Imperial-Changeling Army Exchange Program"
 GRI_propose_military_exchange_program_desc:0 "Up until this point, the attaché program has been limited to §YSynovial and his Officers§! advising us on our technology and us providing them with advice on their doctrines. But we believe we can take our cooperation a step further. We may propose to the Queen a further personnel exchange to further improve both our militaries.\n\n§RWe can only hope they say yes.§!"
 GRI_knight_jager_program:0 "Knecht-Jäger Officer Exchange"
 GRI_knight_jager_program_desc:0 "§GWith the blessing of the Queen we can continue with our cooperation§!.\n\nOne of the greatest advantages both our nation and the Changeling Lands have is the presence of an elite force that provides an example for our military to model itself off of. For us, it is our §GKnights§!; the protectors of the Empire and guards of its Emperor. With the Changelings, it is their §RJäger§!. Infiltrators, who while not fighting with the "honor" of a knight, are highly effective for their intended purpose. We shall formulate an officer exchange program with many of our best knights traveling to the Vesalipolis to train Changeling officers, and highly skilled Jäger working to advise our officers on their specialties as well."
 GRI_tactics_integration:0 "Mutual Doctrinal Adaptation"
 GRI_tactics_integration_desc:0 "§GWith the blessing of the Queen, we can continue with our cooperation§!.\n\nChangeling doctrine centers around efficiency. Whether it is the efficiency of supply, the efficiency of intelligence or related topics of warfare. These ideas are not often applied to our doctrines of war, and we could use them well. On the flip side, the Changelings are not used to the ideas of mass battle and heavy weaponry. In short, we have a lot to gain by §Gsharing ideas with one another§!."

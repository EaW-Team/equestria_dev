barasingha_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In a shocking twist to the landscape of the Hindian subcontinent, the warrior monks of Barasingha, known for their isolationist traditions and firm devotion to their defiant monastic rite, have emerged as the region's sole power. Their leader, Mikalla, who united the divided mountainous territory into a proper independent state, has now taken the fight to the Princes of Doelhi and the Yarils of Chital and succeeded. Spurred on by a flock of millions who revere her as a guru above all others and a transcendent hero reminiscent of the godly warriors of Hindian myth, it is unlikely that Mikalla's conquests will end at the mountains of Stagpal and Llambet."

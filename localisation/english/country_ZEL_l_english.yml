ZEL_eternal_kingdom_desc:0 "Gelon-Zornu has stood for a thousand years. Its borders have waxed and waned, and it was sometimes subjugated by foreigners, but the rule of the Zefuwa dynasty never truly ended. Even under the Mazwi, the Mai, king, was not taken hostage like in other subjugated nations, as the Manzas of Mazwi held deep respect for the Zefuwas. Gelon-Zornu weathered the storm of the southern yeti too, continuing to stand strong after the upstart Mazwi collapsed."

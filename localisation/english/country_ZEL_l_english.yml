ZEL_eternal_kingdom:0 "The Eternal Kingdom"
ZEL_eternal_kingdom_desc:0 "Gelon-Zornu has stood for a thousand years. Its borders have waxed and waned, and it was sometimes subjugated by foreigners, but the rule of the Zefuwa dynasty never truly ended. Even under the Mazwi, the Mai, king, was not taken hostage like in other subjugated nations, as the Manzas of Mazwi held deep respect for the Zefuwas. Gelon-Zornu weathered the storm of the southern yeti too, continuing to stand strong after the upstart Mazwi collapsed."
ZEL_slave_city:0 "The City Of Slaves"
ZEL_slave_city_desc:0 "Every year, thousands of slaves are traded in the bustling markets of Zornu. The city has been a center of slave trade for longer than the Zefuwa dynasty has reigned. But the winds of change are blowing, and the slaves whisper of liberation, dreaming of a world where all zebras are free."

 newyaks.1.t:0 "The Split"
 newyaks.1.d:0 "It has been several years since irreconcilable differences caused a violent divide in the yak nation. After a furious, yet inconclusive series of clashes, the situation solidified: to the west reigns Prince Rutherford, one with mind for reform, while the east is united under his younger brother Prince Bradford, who promises stability and serenity of the olden days.\n\nDespite the end of major hostilities, all the attempts at peace talks failed miserably. Worse, with the blood already spilled and the yaks on both sides remaining notoriously headstrong, a new war is coming, one which shall not end until a single victor is left standing, or until the mountains themselves turn to rubble and dust."
 newyaks.1.a:0 "We will be ready."

 newyaks.2.t:0 "The Clans"
 newyaks.2.d:0 "To prevail in the conflict to come, we must ensure the continued support from the clans still loyal to Rutherford. Our progressive coalition includes two crucial members - prince's own Mangchijid, as well as Ghenikhan, reputed to have even more radical ideas for change, - but the other families might be pushed towards our enemies by their false promises or our own less popular actions.\n\nThe level of allegiance for each clan and the possible ways to increase it can be found in the list of available decisions. If the standing with any given family falls to the lowest point, we will have a limited window of opportunity to bring it back to the middle or higher and initiate a conciliatory meeting, stopping the timer. Failing that, they will withdraw the corresponding banner armies and join the opposite side in the civil war with no possible recourse. It is imperative to remember that the reactionaries will attempt to influence some of the clans, causing their loyalty to drop sharply, and keep an eye out for any potential discontent."
 newyaks.2.a:0 "This will be a careful balancing act."

 newyaks.3.t:0 "Like Herding Yaks"
 newyaks.3.d:0 "The Khuraltai, or clan assembly, is where the elders of all yak clans gather to decide issues of national importance. In most other nations such a meeting would be filled with calm and respectful deliberations between seasoned political leaders.\n\nBut this was Yakyakistan, and this assembly was anything but calm and respectful.\n\n"Kiyatukh Clan harvesting vanilla beans in Mankhutayid Clan land!" Shouted Menggei, elder of the Mankhutayids. "This disgraceful! Kiyatukh Clan must be punished!"\nWithout waiting for Menggei to yield the floor, the Kiyatukh elder fired back. "Mankhutayid yak lies! Southern valley always belong to Kiyatukh Clan, other yaks just jealous!"\n\nMany other clan elders weren't even paying attention, too busy stomping or butting horns with each other. Thyra, the Ghenikhan Clan's representative, looked on in disgust. The seats for the Yürkid Clan elders were conspicuously empty.\n\n"Yaks be quiet!" Prince Rutherford said with a snort, "Yak called this Khuraltai to plan war against Jaki Clan traitors, not to hear clan elders bicker like calves!"\n\n"Why should yaks help Prince Rutherford?" the Kiyatukh elder sneered, "Prince yak has no respect for clan autonomy!"\n"Yak right! Prince Rutherford act more like pony than yak!"\n"At least Jaki Clan respect yak traditions!"\n\nPrince Rutherford growled. Trying to force the elders into line alone was clearly a lost cause. To survive the coming war he needed an ally, a clan willing to help that didn't have to be bribed into supporting his reforms."
 newyaks.3.a:0 "And only one clan came to mind..."

 newyaks.4.t:0 "The Prince"
 newyaks.4.d:0 ""YAKS DESTROY!" Yelled Prince Rutherford, splitting a log with his hooves.\n\nWhenever the Prince needed a break from the stress of ruling, he always made his way to the Yakistown smashing grounds. Turning wood into splinters cleared his head like nothing else. After smashing through another log with his forehead, Rutherford stopped to catch his breath. He looked around at his retainers, each one stomping through their own pile.\n\n"Yojan!" he exclaimed, "That perfect angle for optimal smashing! Excellent work."\n\nYojan smiled in surprise. "Yak honored, but still need to improve. Yak not smash as good as Prince yak."\n\n"Of course not! As Prince of All Yaks, yak best at smashing! Even when Prince was little yak, Prince always smash better than brother Bradford."\n\nSuddenly Rutherford paused, an unhappy thought intruding into his mind. "Yak and brother Bradford were close friends. When yak became Prince, yak spend less time with Bradford. Prince knew Bradford unhappy with reforms, but never imagined Bradford would go so far..."\n\nYojan looked concerned. "Maybe it not too late? Prince yak can still talk with brother-"\n\n"NO!" Rutherford yelled, his eyes filling with rage. "Brother Bradford is TRAITOR! Bradford conspire with Jaki Clan, destroy unity of Yakyakistan, shed blood of loyal yaks! As Prince, yak must destroy Bradford and Jaki Clan, no matter the cost!""
 newyaks.4.a:0 "Mother, Father, forgive me."

 newyaks.5.t:0 "The Student"
 newyaks.5.d:0 ""Look! It Yona yak!"\n"Yona, look here! Yak big fan!"\n"Yona is Yakyakistan's hero!"\n\nYona blushed, still not used to the attention she received in public. Smiling and waving politely, she continued walking towards the Yakistown market. Her siblings, walking beside her, were much more enthusiastic.\n\n"Yona is hero yak!" said her little sister, "Yona went to pony school, learned from pony princess!"\n"And Yona defeat evil pony!" added her little brother.\n\n"That not true," she replied, "Yona not save day alone, had help from friends. Yona only did what any yak would do."\n\nAfter the trio finished shopping they made their way home. They were greeted by a crowd of younger yaks waiting outside their house.\n\nOne of the youths stepped forward and said, "Yaks form volunteer battalion, train to fight war against Jaki-Clan. Yaks fight for friendship and harmony in Yakyakistan. Yaks want Yona to lead us!"\n\n"Yona accept." She replied without hesitation.\n\nThe young volunteers and Yona's brother were excited, but her sister realized the danger. "War scary. Yona not have to fight." she pleaded.\n\n"Yes Yona do. Ponies taught Yona that friendship can be hard, but friendship always worth fighting for.""
 newyaks.5.a:0 "Yona make yaks proud!"

 newyaks.6.t:0 "The Firebrand"
 newyaks.6.d:0 "In all societies throughout history, the vast majority of creatures have been peasants. Yaks, ponies and griffons alike eked out a meager existence on farms, surrendering their surplus to the ruling class. The peasant life kept creatures isolated and ignorant, making broad-based organization impossible. This was why Caramel Marks called them "a sack of potatoes."\n\nThen the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Creatures transitioned to factory work, throwing feudal class relations into chaos. And now, at long last, that change had come to Yakyakistan.\n\nAs Thyra and her comrades marched through the valley, vibrant green fields gave way to dull gray walls and plumes of black smoke. She smiled to herself. The factory wasn't exactly pretty, but it was the harbinger of a brighter future. A future that belonged to the workers toiling inside.\n\nThe dismissal bell chimed. As the yaks finished up their manager, some stooge appointed by Rutherford, made an announcement.\n"Yaks not meet quota again. Tomorrow yaks must start 1 hour early!"\n\nBoos and jeers rang out across the factory floor. When the workers filed out Thyra and her organizers slipped into the crowd.\n"This ridiculous!" huffed one yak worker, "Boss yak ask for the impossible."\n"Boss yak sit around all day," said another, "Has no idea how factory works!"\n\n"Worker yaks right." Thyra said, grinning ever wider. "Wouldn't factory be better if yak workers ran it themselves?""
 newyaks.6.a:0 "Someday, all yaks will be free."

 newyaks.7.t:0 "The Officer"
 newyaks.7.d:0 "At a training camp in the mountains outside Yakistown, new recruits were practicing at the firing range. The drill instructor, a yak named Yngvar, walked among them and harshly critiqued each one. If he didn't find fault with their aim it was the way they held the rifles, or their posture while shooting.\n\nMost of Yngvar's trainees were clanless, hailing from poor families on the margins of yak society. Unlike most commanders he actually preferred yaks of humble origins. When his recruits lacked the arrogance of the great clans it was easier to break them down and mold them into proper soldiers.\n\nYngvar noticed that one recruit had stopped firing his breech loader, a sullen expression on his face.\n\n"What problem?" Yngvar asked.\n\n"Yak not see point. Gun slow and hard to aim, never defeat charge of yak warriors."\n\nYngvar didn't respond immediately. He reached for the modern bolt action rifle on his back, brought it forward and aimed at the target, a barrel of hay. He unloaded the entire magazine into the hay, scoring a direct hit with every shot. The trainees looked on in stunned silence.\n\n"Old ways of war not work anymore. To be strong yaks must learn modern tactics, like aiming. Now back to practice, or else yak will be next target!""
 newyaks.7.a:0 "We have to be strong to reunite the nation."

 newyaks.8.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Military Aid"
 newyaks.8.d:0 "Winter Frost cast an uneasy glance at the yak in front of her. The Committee on Revolution in North Equus very rarely received petitioners, and had never heard a request like this one.\n\n"So to summarize," she said, trying to keep her tone neutral, "you want us to provide military aid to Prince Rutherford, an absolute monarch with ties to Equestria? I'm sorry, but that would require completely ignoring our strategic interests, not to mention all of communist theory."\n\nThe yak smiled back unfazed. "Not true, comrade pony! By opening up Yakyakistan to Equestrian trade Prince Rutherford began yak bourgeois democratic revolution. Yaks need this so yaks can have second, proletarian socialist revolution."\n\nWinter's jaw dropped. She had not expected the yak to be well versed in theory.\n\n"If yaks win upcoming war with Stalliongrad ponies help, communist yaks can make attempt to overthrow Rutherford. If ponies not help and Jaki-Clan win, all yak economic progress will be erased and Yakyakistan will become reactionary stronghold in North Equus. Choice is yours, can yaks count on comrade ponies?""
 newyaks.8.a:0 "For now, we'll work with the Prince."
 newyaks.8.b:0 "No compromise with monarchists."

 newyaks.9.t:0 "Red Army Advisors Arrive"
 newyaks.9.d:0 ""Yaks thank communist ponies for helping," Prince Rutherford said to the newly arrived volunteers from Stalliongrad, "But remember: Yakyakistan not communist country. Prince Rutherford still in charge. Ponies better not break Prince's rules, or else!"\n\nThe mares and stallions of the Red Army rolled their eyes at this display. Here they were, risking their necks to help the yaks win their civil war, and this reactionary monarch had the gaul to threaten them? Talk about getting off on the wrong hoof.\n\nAs Rutherford walked away Thyra took his place. Her bright smile contrasted sharply with the Prince's scowl.\n\n"Comrade ponies no worry about Prince yak. Prince all talk and no action, just like pony Princess!"\n\nThat got a laugh from all the volunteers. With the ice now broken, Thyra began explaining their assignment. They were to assist Yakyakistan's fledgling army, training new recruits to use modern weapons and tactics. If the ponies also happened to tell the yak soldiers about Marksism and the Revolution in Stalliongrad, that was good too. No one would tell the Prince."
 newyaks.9.a:0 "In snowy mountains a red flower blooms."

 newyaks.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 newyaks.10.d:0 "Stalliongrad's reply to the yak request for aid was brief: "In light of the limited resources at our disposal, and the reactionary nature of Prince Rutherford's government, we are unwilling to send military advisors to Yakyakistan at this time."\n\n"Communist ponies not help?" Prince Rutherford said with a smile, "Hah! Yaks no need their help. Yak warriors will fight Jaki-Clan traitors alone!"\n\nWhen Thyra heard the news she was dismayed, but mostly annoyed. She had always believed the ponies of Stalliongrad were sincere in their desire to spread the revolution. Refusing to help their yak comrades was quite the slap in the face."
 newyaks.10.a:0 "What's even the point?"

 newyaks.11.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Civilian Aid"
 newyaks.11.d:0 "Winter Frost shuffled some paperwork aside and turned her attention to the yak in the room. With a civil war in Yakyakistan looming, their visits were becoming a common occurrence.\n\n"Ok, let's see here. Prince Rutherford, not content with asking us for military aid, is now requesting technical experts to build up Yakyakistan's nascent industries. And I suppose you're going to quote me some theory to explain why granting this isn't completely asinine?"\n\nThe yak gave a sheepish grin. "Well, yaks mostly need industry help to win civil war, but it good for communist reasons too. As yak industry expands, will need more yak workers. These workers, called industrial proletariat, will lead future socialist revolution! And with Stalliongrad ponies help, yaks can raise class consciousness of workers very fast."\n\nWinter smirked. "Not a bad argument, but this isn't exactly an open and shut case. I'll call the committee to a vote.""
 newyaks.11.a:0 "We can spare some bureaucrats and engineers."
 newyaks.11.b:0 "Our resources are better used elsewhere."

 newyaks.12.t:0 "The Spectre of Communism"
 newyaks.12.d:0 "Thyra watched with glee as another plane came in from Stalliongrad. As it landed she busied herself directing the new arrivals to their destinations: bureaucrats to the government hut, engineers to the factories, etc.\n\nWith every passing day more ponies from Stalliongrad arrived, and every day they introduced new technologies and forms of administration to Yakyakistan. Thyra had dreamed of dragging her country into modernity for a long time, kicking and screaming if necessary. She was glad her old comrades were willing to help speed up that process.\n\nOn the far end of the dirt runway, Prince Rutherford looked on in mounting horror. Every day the communist plague spread further, infecting yaks throughout his government and military. He knew that Thyra and Stalliongrad were planning to overthrow him when the war was over. Once he thought their challenge would be easy to crush, but now he wasn't so sure."
 newyaks.12.a:0 "Give them an inch, they'll take a mile."

 newyaks.13.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 newyaks.13.d:0 "Stalliongrad's reply to the yak request for aid was brief: "In light of the limited resources at our disposal, and the reactionary nature of Prince Rutherford's government, we are unwilling to send political and technical advisors to Yakyakistan at this time."\n\n"Prince knew communist ponies cannot be trusted!" Rutherford said, grinning, "Yaks not need their help! Yaks modernize all on our own."\n\nOn the other side of the room Thyra made a face. Her comrades had really let her down this time. She wanted nothing more than to drag Yakyakistan into modernity, but her plans relied on help from a modern industrial state. Without that everything was going to be much harder."
 newyaks.13.a:0 "Why did we bother asking?"

 newyaks.14.t:0 "An Old Friend"
 newyaks.14.d:0 "Prince Rutherford removed the record from the gramophone after the last melody faded out. The device was a gift from one of Pinkie Pie's friends, Spike. The music was a brief retreat from the hectic affairs of the Khuraltai, though somepony else had arrived to brighten the Prince's mood.\n\n"Wow! You can't believe how long it took me to get here! I didn't know trotting through the Crystal Mountains would take so long and all-"\n\n"Pink pony!" Rutherford suddenly hugged Pinkie Pie, causing the earth pony to cough from the force. "Yak not see pink pony for several moons!"\n\nRutherford soon let go of the hug. "Honored to meet you, Prince! Now, I've heard you got a teensy-weensy problem with your brother and all..."\n\n"Pink pony talk of traitor brother Bradford?" he snorted.\n\n"Yeah! I mean, I have a family of my own, with my sisters Maud, Limestone, and Marble Pie," Pinkie answered with a hop. "We sometimes get arguments between each other, but it's nothing a little talk can't sort out. What I'm sayin' and all is, we can avoid a lot of yaks getting hurt."\n\nRutherford grumbled under his breath. What Pinkie Pie said was similar to what some of his fellow yaks had said. "Not possible. Bradford not see reason. Never will."\n\nPinkie sank for a moment before brightening up again, suddenly pulling out a stack of vanilla cake. "On another note... I know being a Prince is hard and all, so I brought a little something extra from back home, straight from Sugarcube Corner!" Pinkie added.\n\nThe prince's mood quickly lightened up as he briefly looked at the cake and gulped it in one bite. "Pony cake good. Yak like!" he said after swallowing the cake whole."
 newyaks.14.a:0 "Yay!"
 
 newyaks.15.t:0 "The Mountains of Madness"
 newyaks.15.d:0 ""Skull. Flower. Death. Life. Ivory. Scarlet. Never or now."\n\nDozens of voices scattered the words in the smoke of burning incense.\n\n"Skull. Flower. Death. Life. Ivory. Scarlet. Silence or vow."\n\nThe ceaseless chanting arose to a deafening roar, and then dropped to a rasping whisper, only to grow again.\n\n"Skull. Flower. Death. Life. Ivory. Scarlet. Two shall be one."\n\nA thrust of something firm came from one side, while the other was caressed by something soft, adding another piece to the suffocating mix of sensations.\n\n"Skull. Flower. Death. Life. Ivory. Scarlet. Will is undone."\n\nFinally, there was a flash of light, the last bit to overwhelm a mind and plunge it into an abyss, propel it to a higher plane, shatter it like a log and mold it as if it was fresh wet snow.\n\nA snowflake landing on the nose of the prince's envoy shook them awake. They were outside the Juyilkhai compound, alone, both physically unharmed and with supplies for the return journey, but little memory of the rite they went through or the choice they made."
 newyaks.15.a:0 "Yet, made it was under the gaze of no mortal eyes."

 newyaks.16.t:0 "Red Sleet"
 newyaks.16.d:0 "Yona grimaced at the papers she had just received. The protests in Yakistown had grown in size, with thousands of angry yaks calling for the overthrow of Prince Rutherford. It didn't take long for the protests to get violent; the mob threw chunks of stone covered in ice at the guards, and one had the misfortune of hitting a guard's head, knocking him unconscious. What followed was chaos as the guards opened fire on the mob. Yona and Rutherford were told to remain within the Khuraltai for their own safety.\n\nSuddenly, the doors of the Khuraltai were forced open by a company of yak soldiers, dressed in bright red with rifles pointed at the two. "Yona scared...what's going on?" Yona asked Rutherford, her hooves shaking in a panic. She had never been threatened like this before.\n\nAn imposing brown yak stomped his way to the front of his line of soldiers, raising a hoof to command them to lower their weapons. "Yngvar comes with simple request," Yngvar stated with a surprising coolness unexpected for his size. "Step down, or else yaks will make you target practice."\n\n"Thyra not with you?" Rutherford replied, ignoring Yngvar's threat.\n\n"Thyra's ways have failed," Yngvar snorted. "Silly of Thyra to think that reactionaries will give up power peacefully. Yakyakistan needs new yak leader. Yak who is able to make difficult decisions rather than listen to endless arguing. From now on, Yakyakistan led by the Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army!"\n\nRutherford raised his hoof in resignation. It was either that or both Yona and him in a grave. "Rutherford will abdicate. But Yngvar will bring Yakyakistan down a violent path," Rutherford grumbled beneath his breath. "Just...just do not hurt Yona.""
 newyaks.16.a:0 "Hail to Grand Marshal Yngvar! Death to reactionaries!"

 newyaks.17.t:0 "The People's Will Reigns Supreme"
 newyaks.17.d:0 "Yona and Prince Rutherford stared at the sizable group of revolutionaries that had followed Thyra into the Khuraltai. Yona had proposed a meeting to avoid an almost certain revolution from occurring. While most of the revolutionaries were unarmed, it felt more like a coup to Prince Rutherford. "What is meaning of this?" Rutherford exclaimed with a stomp of his hoof.\n\nThyra placed a scroll of paper onto the round table. "Thyra come with ultimatum. Protests not only happen in Yakistown, but across Kingdom too. Many yaks blame Rutherford for heavy bloodshed against Jaki-Clan. If Prince not abdicate..." – Thyra stared firmly at Rutherford – "the Revolution will do it for Prince."\n\nYona glanced uncomfortably at Rutherford. She felt like both of them had been backed into a corner, but if Thyra was willing to enter the Khuraltai unarmed, perhaps there was still room for negotiation. "Thyra is still good yak. If Prince abdicates, will Thyra and communists not hurt harmonists?" she asked.\n\nThyra nodded and placed the pen down in front of Rutherford. "Thyra will not persecute harmonists. But Thyra will become new President. Harmonists may get representation if they work within new republic's system," she agreed.\n\nPrince Rutherford grumbled for a moment before sighing and looking at the space where he would sign his name. He didn't have a choice. "For good of all Yakyakistan... Prince will step down. Yakyakistan needs no more violence.""
 newyaks.17.a:0 "Comrade Thyra leads the revolution!"

 newyaks.18.t:0 "The Wonders of Compromise"
 newyaks.18.d:0 "Yona and Prince Rutherford stared at the small group of revolutionaries that had followed Thyra into the Khuraltai. Rutherford had half-expected a coup, though Thyra's followers were unarmed, and there was no reason to keep them back. "What is meaning of this?" Rutherford finally asked.\n\nThyra placed a scroll of paper onto the round table. "Thyra come to negotiate. Yakistown have many protests. Many yaks do not want revolution. But..." –she pointed to the bottom of the paper– "some yaks blame Rutherford for yaks losing lives against Jaki-Clan."\n\nYona looked at Rutherford. She had an idea, though it was not one that the prince would like. She then turned to Thyra. "If Prince steps down, will Thyra will agree to fight for friendship and harmony?" she proposed. "Yona does not want more fighting between yaks."\n\nPrince Rutherford stared in surprise and slammed his hoof. "Yona think yak will accept this?"\n\n"Yona think that Prince should step down. For good of all Yakyakistan," Yona returned. "Yaks can form republic. Shouldn't all yaks have say in how to run Yakyakistan?"\n\nThyra nodded and placed her hoof to her chest. "All this time, Thyra just want worker yaks to run Yakyakistan. Republic is boor-zwah-zee idea, but if socialist yaks can join, yak do not see problem," she said. "Plus, Marks just pony, not yak. Pony words of revolution not always right."\n\nPrince Rutherford grumbled before he surprisingly calmed down. "For good of all Yakyakistan... maybe it is time for new yaks to run nation," he admitted after a long pause, taking off his crown."
 newyaks.18.a:0 "To a free, harmonist Yakyakistan!"

 newyaks.19.t:0 "Then as Farce"
 newyaks.19.d:0 "Yona and Prince Rutherford looked confusedly at each other as Thyra kneeled down in front of the Khuraltai in resignation. "What is yak doing?" Rutherford finally asked.\n\nThyra stood back and tried to smile confidently. "Yak may not have heard, but protests in Yakistown not go well," she admitted. "Few yaks show up. Yaks do not want revolution, especially after many yaks lose lives to Jaki-Clan. Protest lose momentum, and rest of yaks leave. It is obvious that many yaks support Prince."\n\nYona looked at the melancholic Thyra and walked towards the Ghenikhan revolutionary, before finally raising a hoof in reconciliation. "This does not have to be end for Thyra. Thyra can join Yona and Prince and work together to make worker yak lives better," Yona proposed with a smile. "One yak strong. But many yaks stronger together. Yona learn that from pony friends."\n\nThyra blinked at Yona and took a deep breath. She recalled the reason why she became a Marksist – it was to make the lives of common yaks free from exploitation and share the prosperity of industry. But with yaks like Prince Rutherford being receptive to reform, maybe it was possible to bring about change from the inside."
 newyaks.19.a:0 ""Thyra will be be loyal to Prince. Yaks stronger together.""

 newyaks.20.t:0 "A True Coronation"
 newyaks.20.d:0 "The ancient saying goes "if things not perfect, yaks get mad", but judging by the happiness reigning in Yakistown, everything was as close to perfection as it could possibly be. With the country slowly recovering from the conflict, a festive period had been proclaimed by the authorities, and the coronation of Prince Rutherford was set as the centerpiece of the celebrations.\n\nSome could say that the Prince already had a ceremony, or that resources devoted to it could be better spent elsewhere, but these opinions were clearly in minority. The nation, once again united under Rutherford's banner, cheered its leader on, and so the elders of loyalist clans as well as the new, more agreeable representatives of the ones recently smashed gathered in the capital to take part in the proceedings.\n\nAlthough his father carried the title of a king, Rutherford did not consider it proper to follow up on this, especially with the course towards harmony. Thus, in the ancient shrine atop a sacred mountain peak, after a long-horned shaman wiped the steel crown with fresh snow and sang the hymns of renewal, a voice of the true prince boomed over the crowd of nobles and invited foreign dignitaries.\n\n"Khuraltai yaks! Afar friends! Our land stand true, in harmony! Yaks become stronger, smarter! Me honored to guide them!" Decisively, he placed the crown on his head. It felt cold and somehow heavier than before, but Rutherford never shied from any burden."

 newyaks.21.t:0 "The Yak Vote"
 newyaks.21.d:0 "Despite the end of the overt hostilities, a certain unease could be felt throughout Yakyakistan. The process of harmonic reforms started by Prince Rutherford snowballed into something global, sidelining its own founder and creating an outlet for itself in the form of national elections. The idea of a chosen government was close to the clan tradition of family heads appointing their leaders, but now every yak had a chance to shape the future of their own country with a thump of a hoof.\n\nYona observed the proceedings with great apprehension. Not only was she the very yak who in the critical moment swayed the direction of the state towards these uncharted ranges, she had also joined the race for the post of the chairyak for the new Khural - for her it was the path clearly dictated by duty. As a candidate, she was not allowed to work at polling stations in any capacity, so instead Yona spent the day at home, enjoying a calm moment with her family.\n\nLate in the evening, when all the chores were done twice over and a few hours after her little siblings were tucked away in beds, a guest came to visit. It was a stocky yak by the name of Nir, formerly a volunteer under Yona's command, and now one of the members of her political team.\n\n"Results now in! Number yaks counted hard!" Enthusiastic enough to forget the greetings, Nir spoke loudly as soon as Yona opened the front door.\n\nShe raised the hoof telling him to quiet down, and then slipped outside. "Please not Yngvar. Thyra had great campaign, should be her. Maybe..." Whispering loudly, she was swept up by the same excitement, but Nir interrupted her before she could continue.\n\n"Not Yngvar! Not Thyra! No one else! Yaks want Yona to lead!""

 newyaks.22.t:0 "Blood Ties"
 newyaks.22.d:0 "Two yaks, two brothers, two princes stood opposite each other in a small, humble room. One was visiting, the other was confined here, one was older, the other was younger, one was crowned, the other was disgraced, and even though they shared the same sadness, it was of shattered kinship.\n\nRutherford spoke first, his voice low and his mind focused. It was the first time he came here, as he spent dozens of moons thinking, weighing the words and the options.\n\n"Traitor prince Bradford judged by clans and ancient spirits. Some call for blood, some say banishment, few kind yaks believe in forgiveness. Much chaos on the madyak's hooves, many lives broken."\n\n"Brother strong." Averting his gaze, Bradford snorted. "Lost his way to ponies, set yaks on same path, but mighty, willful. No need to listen to elders, consult shamans - should pass sentence, like true yak chieftains did."\n\nThere was silence for a while, and Rutherford continued to stare at his fallen sibling until the other yak raised the head and met his glare once more. In the dark eyes, covered in part by unkempt brown fur, the true prince could see his own reflection. He remembered it looking young and happy when they played together in the snow, proud and stubborn when they politicked in Khuraltai or carefree and cheerful during Yickslurbertfests. He also recalled it being hurt and angry when Bradford smashed the gifts from the Equestrian diplomatic mission before storming off to Saihan Tolgod. Here and now, however, it was a reflection of someone ready for a decision."

Unsurprisingly, the variety of opinions between them guaranteed that decisions on punishments would be carefully devised compromises, and for many, including Prince Bradford, the result took the form of banishment.\n\nYona did know Rutherford's wayward brother personally, even if she could not say much good about him - after all, the deposed prince went from vehemently opposing any reform and positive diplomacy, including her enrollment in the School of Friendship, to plunging Yakyakistan into a bloody war. Still, she wanted to oversee his departure personally, both as a symbol of renewal and to support Rutherford.\n\nThe smaller terminal of Yakistown train station was cordoned off for the proceedings, and the platform housing the armored train was guarded by an additional squad of police. Allowing Rutherford and Bradford to talk privately, Yona kept her distance, only occasionally glancing towards them. The farewell was cut short as the older yak thumped his hooves, loudly scoffed and went back inside. When Yona hurried to catch up with him, the remaining brother called out to her.\n\n"Braided yak cunning, like pony. Stole power, kept fur clean. Should be proud." Bradford's words rang with bitterness.\n\nThere was a lot she could say back, on battles she fought, on companions lost, on guilt or on sacrifices. Instead, she picked a different way.\n\n"Prince should go, see more, learn more. One day return to best, strongest Yakyakistan.""

Past an audience of labourers dressed in simple fabrics (versus to the helmet and trinkets the former prince had taken) stood a judge grilling Yona and Rutherford for their crimes—the judge wore overalls, blackened probably at a coal mine.\n\nYona's treason against Yakyakistan was clear: She'd been spreading slave-minded ideas to her neighbours and beyond. Camaraderie was well and good, but she'd gone as far as to plan for Yakyakistan's entry into Equestria as a new state ruled by pony aristocrats and capitalists. Her stint at the Friendship School didn't help matters, and she couldn't deny that she'd talked personally with Princess Twilight Sparkle on a few occasions. She had to go.\n\nRutherford, however, had it worse. Blood was on his cloven hooves, after all, and they could be traced back to right before Yngvar stormed into the Khuraltai. The prince's guards had open fired on a thousand innocent yaks—for what, the precious life of one other yak who had protection thanks to a royal title that should've meant nothing? All when these yaks had so many righteous grievances to tell their prince? And before then, he'd refused to outright take out Bradford and his dangerous and reactionary upstarts from the moment they seceded, protecting a brother content with slaughtering Yakyakistan if it meant his own peace and quiet. Rutherford was, in the end, a yak who had neglected the lives of his subjects.\n\n"Guilty," so the both of them pleaded. At the judge's mercy, they hung their heads.

"Yak worried for Yngvar, becoming too far-"\n\nA fierce stomp in response, Yngvar's hooves having slammed the ground mere inches in front of the scientist. "Yaks do what necessary. If Yaks stay yaklike, then lose to reaction." He butted his head against the scientist, almost bowling him over in a matter of seconds. "Coward think reactionaries wait for Yaks to be ready? Coward thinks reactionaries not use potion bombs, or firespewer, or poison spray? COWARD THINKS THIS GAME?"\n\nWith an upward lift, the scientist ended up on his back, staring up at the generalyak about to gore him. For a moment even Yngvar thought he would.

Of course, her own experience, the status of "monarchy smasher" and the successes of the provisional government made Thyra quite popular. Still, there was a chance that the same renown would lead her to a position of advisor to other potential leaders. In this room she could see two such creatures, different as snow and vanilla.\n\nThe first, Kari, came from the Ghenikhan peasantry, and Thyra knew her agrarian outlook well. Although a certain concern could be raised regarding Kari's distrust towards technology, the younger yak would make a great champion of welfare for the Republic. The other one, a bit unexpectedly, was a griffon going by the name of Felix Rainfeather. As far as Thyra understood, he built his fame on pushing for the rights of factory workers and their unions. A modern nation could surely benefit from a deeper cooperation between the state and the industry, but mechanization was new for yaks - then again, so was communism.\n\nThe senior polling committee member entering into the room immediately attracted attention from all sides.

Unrelenting in speed and durability, they were supersized bullets in slow motion—and no less powerful, for their turrets and barrels could make mincemeat of the rest of today's armour.\n\nUnderstandably, Yngvar's underlings then claimed that it was "their" slice of the military that could wipe out the changelings' metal hubris. He was first harangued at by his own tank mechanics who'd boasted that even the prototypes of what they were cooking up would send their foes running—and naturally, yak tanks had to be bigger to accommodate yak bodies. The Panzers being dwarfed by much bigger cannons: this would send fear down their spines.\n\nYngvar then deigned to get a tour of the hundreds of anti-tank guns that had already been produced as well as vehicles created precisely just to destroy tanks. Instead of going to the changelings' level, the plan was to level the playing field: disable their armour and force the bugs to fight hoof-on-hoof, bullet-by-bullet with the much heftier yaks. This was a humiliation in the making: a row of changeling tanks, suddenly stopping then spewing out burning oil. Chrysalis's pride on the ground, destroyed.\n\nYet what if they couldn't even fight back? Yngvar thought not of fighters but bombers. He ordered a demonstration; a cheap test bomber was hastily made in a few days' time. Wobbily and unstable, it nonetheless flew and dropped small explosives onto several dummy targets. How fast it flew! Unable to be shot at from so high up... to think the tank crews wouldn't be able to do anything but watch in sheer helplessness...\n\nStill, Yngvar wasn't made of money.

 newyaks.52.d:0 "Landing into the neat and organised pile of Princess Celestia's correspondence is a petition from Yngvar of [YAK.GetNameDef] to help form a coalition of nations against Chrysalis. Considering the looming threat of the changeling queen, any help will be needed and appreciated, and supporting the yaks through Crystal territory should not be a problem (as much as they can help take off some of the burden from our Crystal ponies).\n\nHowever, it's undeniable that something dark brews in the land of the yaks. The reports that have come out of Yakyakistan (apart from obvious propaganda) paint Yngvar as less of a shining red star of the workers and more of a bloody black hole of tyranny in the name of public safety. We cannot bow down to the requests of dictators, even if they try to justify it with talk of "greater evils".\n\nStill, there is some gain that can be gotten from their help. Our dear friends Prince Rutherford and School of Friendship student Yona are stuck in [YAK.GetName], and as far as we know, they remain true to the magic of friendship. Yngvar can be pressured to release these two to us as a show of both Equestria's merciful generosity to his undeserving regime and of strength that these "little ponies" can bend even the most determined of autocrats to do a hint of good."

 newyaks.53.d:0 "To Yngvar of [YAK.GetNameDef]\n\nYour request for a "great anti-Chrysalis pact" is certainly a noble one. We recognise the dangers that the Queen of the Changelings poses, so despite the differences the nations of Equus have with each other, they pale in comparison to the threat of changeling supremacy.\n\nNow, this alliance, like all other alliances, does require a level of trust. You can rest assured that you and your government can rely on the Principality of Equestria and its subjects to support your battle against the changelings in your lands. As for us, however, we will need you to release to us two important figures from your custody so that they may be of better use in other lands: the former leader of the Kingdom of Yakyakistan, Prince Rutherford, and a prominent student of the School of Friendship, Miss Yona. Once you do send them to us, we can formalise this useful partnership.\n\nWe eagerly await your reply.\n\nFrom Her Majesty,\nPrincess Celestia of Equestria"

 newyaks.54.t:0 "A Letter From the Princess"
 newyaks.54.d:0 "Yngvar,\n\nWhile I personally am not in full agreement with the ideas of Caramel Marks, Steel Stallion, and other visionaries you claim to follow, many of their supporters come from a place of love for, duty to, and solidarity with their fellow creature. Even the most hawkish vanguardists I've met wield a paternalistic devotion to care for the entire working class.\n\nBut a danger lies when this greater good becomes a shield you hide behind to justify vile means. You understand—if only at the back of your mind—that your duty as a people's leader is to serve them above all else. So, I ask of you, in the name of the workers you've sworn to protect, if you can name the benefits of hauling out your opposition to be exiled, to be shot, or worse? That is what I hear from a stream of exiles and refugees. Toppling reactionaries does not seem enough to explain the litany of abuses you not only tolerate but praise in the name of defeating Chrysalis. And what will be left when you defeat her, after your systematic torture of your country?\n\nFeel free to retort that great leaders must possess the will to make the toughest of decisions. What you do not understand is that these "tough decisions" will never be easier to make. (I speak from experience.) Thus, any warped version of communism or harmony that tells you otherwise only blinds you to the blood you spill with every decree you sign.\n\nUntil you renounce your post and hoof over the reins of Yakyakistan to someone who truly stands up for the downtrodden—instead of violently treading down so many in their wake—[EQS.GetNameDef] will have no relations with you nor your government.\n\nHer Majesty,\nPrincess Celestia"

 newyaks.55.d:0 "There were many developments Rutherford thought would happen after his abdication, and most of them were worrisome. That being said, he did not anticipate that the newly formed Yakistown city council would order a reconstruction of the noble smashing grounds, greatly expanding them and creating an outdoors space available for all creatures.\n\nAt first, the former prince saw this as another turn for the worse, one extra bit taken away by the communists. Nonetheless, the building-up stress required its release as always, and before long Rutherford could be seen in the queues for the so-called Supreme Multi-Activity Sports Hub together with hundreds other visitors. Many recognized him instantly, and while some preferred to keep their distance from the deposed ruler, most were excited to see him up close, or, even better, exercise together with a famous partner.\n\nSuch attention was a bit awkward at first, but Rutherford quickly grew into the new position, with coaching younger yaks becoming somewhat of a passion for him. He continued to doubt many of Thyra's ideas, but these communists were right regarding one thing - people held a lot of potential waiting to be uncovered, and helping them was a worthy cause. Thus, when a ringing voice called out to him, he leisurely turned towards its source, expecting another trainee.\n\n"Rutherford! Rutherford! Ooh, you are looking stronger than ever!" A pink-hued, pint-sized hurricane of excitement rushed closer to him. "Yona has been telling me you've been working out! I've been doing the same, actually. Made it here faster than before..."\n\nOnce again, Pinkie Pie did not manage to end her tale before the yak swept her in a crushing hug."

Earlier today, rebel forces took control of all government buildings within the city were seized, along with any military installations and the old city wall. The so called "Commune of Karsakag" was declared and a hastily designed flag was raised above the centre of the city.\n\nThe Commune is clearly not a military threat, but it could become a political threat. Their first and foremost demand is an end to the nationalisation programs, followed by demands to hold immediate elections and decentralise power to the councils. The whole ordeal is more of an elaborate protest than the beginnings of some second revolution.\n\nDespite the ramifications of the city at Yakyakistan's centre going rogue, Yngvar has shown no intentions of giving in to their pressure, saying that the young idealists lack the resolve to maintain their stance for long."

 newyaks.57.d:0 "Yngvar glowered at the photo. In it, a slightly-less shoddy flag flew proudly over the Karsakag city centre, above giant red text on the walls reading 'NO TO TYRANT! DOWN WITH RED KHAN!' It had been almost three weeks since the declaration of the Commune, and the city wasn't budging an inch. The military had been barred from entry, and the demands of the communards had persisted. And the fact that it was Yngvar's hometown was not lost on the public.\n\n"Counterrevolutionaries!" Yngvar growled. Some of the other generals fidgeted nervously.\n\n"They clearly reds. Like us. Not counterrevolutionary." One of them posited, his attempts to sound calm twinged with discomfort.\n\n"Revolutionary not just about being red." Yngvar retorted. "It's about winning. Success of revolution above all. Yak revolution needs strength. Must crush invaders and reactionaries. This?" He gestured to the picture. "Stupid. Undermines Yaks. Weakens Yaks. Helps Changelings. Therefore, counterrevolutionary."\n\nIt was clear to Yngvar that the generals were concerned, but it was clear to the generals that Yngvar's mind was made up."

On and on Khutngvar went, screaming at Yngvar to no avail, not even prompting a change in expression. "You are... you are like brainchild of Allard and Chrysalis!"\n\nThe Marshall's stony expression almost cracked. Almost. The assault on Karsakag had been a resounding success, with the commune capitulating in under an hour. A few had died upon resisting arrest, but most had submitted eventually. What he hadn't expected was for his cousin to have been one of the movement's most adamant supporters.\n\nGradually, Khutngvar's screaming wavered, her voice beginning to break. Yngvar noticed tears beginning to form. "...You killed your own people. Fellow yaks..."\n\nYngvar desperately tried to keep his face calm. "They got themselves killed. Soldiers did not have orders to kill. Should not have resisted. Maybe I am tyrant. But a necessary tyrant, for that is what Yaks need now." She simply stared at him in disbelief. "I am sorry for your loss. Take her away."\n\nKhutngvar began shouting again as the guards took her away, fury returning to her voice. "You are traitor to Karsakag! Murderer! Tyrant! I hate you!""

 newyaks.59.d:0 "Yngvar charged through the streets of Karsakag. He didn't need a map, the route was the same as it was all those years ago. The city was familiar, but the army – his army – had twisted it into a nightmarish parody. He remembered the bakery on the right, now charred and abandoned, its windows shattered by stray bullets. He remembered his old school on the corner of the leftward turn, now blown open by an artillery shell and burning. He remembered the market square as he sprinted straight through it, now littered with bodies and patrolled by grim soldiers, the tattered flag of the commune laying defeated in a pool of slush and blood.\n\nLeft. Left. Straight ahead. Right. Left. Yngvar didn't stop, even as his breath grew ragged and strained. Another left. Right. Straight on. There was barely any time to think, and even when there was, the Marshall's concentration was splintered by sporadic gunfire - executions by pistol, on his authority. It was necessary, he thought to himself, again and again, more and more desperately. He closed his eyes, repeating the mantra, forcing himself to think about the consequences of letting them live, willing his nightmares of a Changeling occupation back into his mind. And then, he tripped on a loose flagstone.\n\nYngvar slid across the road, rolling to the side and hiking up any limbs that could be caught out. He winced in pain as he raised himself back up, bruised and grazed but nothing broken, his thick uniform and hide softening most of the damage. Winded, he looked up, his breath hitched as he beheld the street of his cousin's home. He gave a gasp of relief as he noted the lack of damage to the houses: there were no craters, exploded buildings or fires. But he still had to be sure, he couldn't dare to hope.\n\nHe hurried to No.20, and it was entirely as he remembered. An all-wood construction, painted in shades of mauve and maroon. He pressed onwards to the door, but something in Yngvar's peripheral vision brought him to a dead stop. A shape, slumped against the garden wall. Terror clawing at his face, he turned to his left. It was Khutngvar, his dear cousin. She was dead, a bullet wound in her head. The red wraps around her horns identified her as a communard. A 'reactionary'. The rest became a blur, as Yngvar collapsed to the ground, tears overwhelming him."

The law could have called it vandalism, wanton destruction or even assault for those who have already gone further than Erdene and his fellows, but he did not care. The wealthy were long overdue some payback for the hungry days and cold nights the common yaks had to endure, and if these tyrants chose to stay here, they definitely needed a reminder that nothing would ever be the same.\n\n"Comrades, attention!" A low, commanding voice cut into the rejoicing. Turning around, Erdene saw a squad of council militia, armored and ready, right at the wrecked mansion gates.\n\n"No problem here.

There were no clocks in her cell, and the guards never spoke to her, even when she tried her best transformations to get them to laugh, or to talk, or to cry, or to rage, or just to do anything. The pool in the center of the cell had grown hour by hour, but the dripping was not quite regular enough to tell time by.\n\nShe'd tried to sleep... she didn't know how many times. Every time she tried the "drip, drip, drip" had gotten louder, and she'd found herself cracking her eyes open to see if the pool had reached her straw mattress. It didn't help that she knew her cell was somewhere under Key Lake. There were... things in that water. Or so she'd heard.\n\nThey were two. A soldier and a lawyer, by the looks of them. They gave her no time to speak, and when she tried to interrupt the lawyer, the soldier snorted at her.\n\n"Ocellus. You stand accused of the following crimes: failure to insurrect against Chrysalis, service as Oberleutnant in the Heer, and indoctrination of the youth into Chrysalianism. The sentences are two, five and five years of hard labour, respectively. If you plead not guilty, you will have one hour to make your case before a judge that you are not Ocellus, or to provide proof that you did indeed insurrect against Chrysalis. The next court date is in eight months."\n\n"What about my family? Where is everyling? What do you mean eight months, do I stay here until then?"\n\n"No charges have been lodged against your family as of yet. On that topic, the revolutionary court will conduct the trial of Lacin Cardo in three days."\n\nThe lawyer hoofed her a clipboard with pen and paper.\n\n"A full account of what you know of Cardo, plus verbal testimony confirming his crimes, would be considered amends for the third count against you, and would count in your favour in any future parole hearing.

"Then accused may rest. Court committee will convene and return with verdict shortly."\n\nNodding weakly, the detainee took the offer in full. While the officials shuffled around her and the large clock on the far wall counted its way forward, she paid the physical world no heed, collecting dispersed thoughts. When the sound of her own name pulled her back into reality, a few minutes or maybe a couple hours later, this task could hardly be called completed.\n\n"...Ocellus, ranked Oberleutenant in Heer. Committee considered your story. We find it sincere and you repentant. We also find your claim of keeping to war laws even against your orders supported by evidence and testimonies." A sharp gavel strike caused her to shudder, spurring the slowed mind fully into focus. "So we sentence you to six months of public work. Atone by rebuilding your land."\n\nAs the burden of guilt and uncertainty suddenly became so much lighter, Ocellus shyly bowed her head.

Soon enough the Marshal, flanked by his guards, met with the yak who hated him most, Yaara the Butcher, younger sister of Khan Kerr.\n\nTales of her during the war had traveled far. No trickery, no mercy and almost certainly no tactics. The pure power of her strikes and brutality of her charges were enough to put many to flee.\n\nThus neither were stupid enough to be unarmed, as a fight could break, but both trusted the tea before them, for neither would be cowardly enough to strike with poison.

The slight tremble that threatened to take his grimace from him, that dared him to let the mask slip and discover whether it'd be a cruel smile or a frown underneath, knowing full well he would never be able to put it back on.\n\nThe paper beneath his hooves crinkled, bringing Yngvar from his musing for a moment. He looked closely at the paper, it's contents having not changed since the last three times he had done this. Long range rocket bombardment, deployed from the most remote reaches of Yakyakistan. He could only imagine the noise heard by the few who'd live to hear them, the smell of brimstone they'd leave in their wake, the sight of an entire hive crumbling in on itself as they crash against its support structure.\n\nThe echoed march outside didn't dissipate, even as Yngvar closed his eyes to picture, for but a moment, a world without the need for such actions.

The hoofstomps outside slowly grew fainter as his own moved closer to the dotted line. One signature and months of work, and potentially millions of those uninvolved in the war would be tested and tried, to be found wanting or to never be found again.\n\nThe images of a better world dissipated from his thoughts as his roc feather quill left the page, the well worn handle cracking under Yngvar's grip.

Riding the wave of expectations, Karsakag council declared that the anniversary of the Revolution was to be commemorated with a grandiose festival - to say that the citizens were happy to oblige would be an understatement.\n\nFrom top to bottom the town was covered in lights and ornaments, the latter hoof-made and quite mismatched, yet inspired and joyful.

For him it was more than nostalgia or habit, no, the very spirit of the army was shaped by recruits tackling racing tracks, shooting ranges and obstacle courses. Indeed, when the soldiers would meet a real foe, when the chaos of battle would strip everything but the very basics from their minds, their core, their nature would be tested. For this essence, the fancy tactics devised in the headquarters or the minutia of equipment design mattered little, as it was hardened by the sense of duty and by the ability to fight. By being here, Yngvar tried his best to give them both.\n\n"Yes, sir!" A hundred voices carried the response back, and soon the stampede of four hundred hooves shook the ground.\n\nThe exercises also determined those resolute enough to share their strength with their comrades. From the observation point, the commander could easily spot that when the cohort reached a barrier which slowed down the last attempt, one of the yaks decisively took point and organized an efficient traverse. Usually, it would be just a good sign, but now Yngvar felt something beyond a simple satisfaction - namely, a bit of pride. It was his own young cousin trying on the role of the leader out there, and judging by the results, she had promises of talent greater than the marshal himself.

By destroying the millennia-long societal isolation she had already proven that these barriers were not infallible, and now, duty-bound to ensure the safety of revolutionary gains, she sought a better protection for the country. By spearheading a new program for military construction which would employ most skilled creatures with relevant experience - yak fort busters, Severyanian engineers, bear veteran forgemasters, penguin amphibian architects and many more - she managed to design and erect a new defense line in record time."

 newyaks.79.t:0 "Mending the Fractures"
 newyaks.79.d:0 "Even though peace was once again proclaimed across all of Yakyakistan, the mountains as well as their steadfast inhabitants had long memories. It was clear that the war exhausted the yaks' desire to fight each other, dousing the flames of anger with blood, but the bitter resentment lingered in the cold ashes. The loyalists grumbled at the merciful treatment of the rebels, who in turn had a long way towards accepting the changed nation, while some clans were shattered altogether, with families once separated by the frontline forced to go back to living side by side.\n\nUnder the orders from [YAK.GetLeader] Khuraltai acted swiftly, organizing and overseeing local and multi-clan councils with the main purpose of reforging and adjusting economical and social links binding the disjoint tribes into a proper country. Their progress was slow, hardly straightforward and definitely not as visible as resolution of other important issues, such as the trials of separatist leaders, however with each passing day more and more yaks were turning towards the shared future."

 newyaks.80.t:0 "Leashing the Avalanche"
 newyaks.80.d:0 ""Royal visit, hmm. Great honor, rare chance to talk one-on-one." The yak before Rutherford seemed composed and collected, but a sliver of mockery was wedged into his deep voice. "Of course, always welcome to my abode."\n\nFurrowing his brow, the prince examined the prisoner. There was strength in Kerr's posture, that of an ancient proud beast, caged, yet unbroken. "Yakyakistan whole again, clans not shed each other's blood. Even your Yürkids stand with coalition." Rutherford spoke slowly, trying to catch any change in the elder's demeanor.\n\n"So they do. And so you come here." After a few rhythmic nods, the warchief clicked his tongue. "Harsh winters await home." This time, no threat or disrespect could be heard in his words, only a cold, plain declaration of a fact. "Must stand together. Kerr pledge hoof and horn to fight for kingdom."\n\nFor Rutherford the satisfaction of tradition upheld - indeed, no true yak leader would ask for help, relying on the projected authority and direct actions to invite it instead - was quickly cut short by a shadow of a grin appearing on the face of the elder. Perhaps, Kerr caught his moment of softness, or maybe he simply dared to test the snow, but the prince had no intention to let it slide.\n\nWith a bellowing roar, Rutherford rushed forward, smashing his horns against those of his opponent, forcing him to step back. "War over. Harmony not weak, never weak." The prince exhaled sharply and continued calmly. "Kerr will serve and know it well.""
 newyaks.80.a:0 "For now, the Yürkid brute was cowed."

 newyaks.81.t:0 "Dishonorable Discharge"
 newyaks.81.d:0 "Among the rebel commanders, Rutherford was perplexed the most by Star Mountain. There was a misguided idea for an honorable future behind Bradford's actions, an arrogant ambition burned inside Kerr, and many of their lieutenants were further driven by the inclination towards brute force. However, nothing in the doings of the mare-proclaimed-yak even remotely resembled proper smashing.\n\nThe prince was well-aware of the separate political agenda maintained by the Ghenikhans, but their reports on the outbursts of violent savagery during the conflict were confirmed by observers from other clans many times over, with more spiritually inclined scouts declaring the horrific attacks to be the work of snow demons. Such mystical rumors were finally disproved when a daring brigade of volunteers assaulted Star Mountain's hideout, discovering scores of bloody trophies and barely taking her alive.\n\nIt turned out that the experience did little to quell her temper, and even before the transfer from a prison hospital to a regular incarceration facility, Star Mountain picked several bloody fights with the guards, making a physical barrier for the meeting a sensible measure. When the prince arrived, the wardens opened a small slit in the cell door, allowing Rutherford to take a look at the captive. A blond-maned pony sat atop the straw bed haughtily, her head following the clanging sound. As soon as she was able to realize who was standing on the other side, Star Mountain jumped up closer.\n\n"Socialist pawn! Marksist puppet! Came here to gloat on behalf of your masters?" She was screeching, almost frothing at the mouth. "Oh, I have something to tell them!"\n\nUnfazed, Rutherford made a swiping gesture with his hoof, and the wardens shut the hole back, muffling the crescending rant."
 newyaks.81.a:0 ""Mad one stay as she is. Maybe pony friends talk to their own.""

 newyaks.82.t:0 "Building Coalition"
 newyaks.82.d:0 "Despite ruling over the Yürkids with iron hoof for years, or possibly thanks to his unprecedented authority, elder Kerr wielded significant support among his clan members, and many perceived casting him out as an outright insult. Still, Yona approved of the sentence and was eager to join the government delegation to Bara'dur to ensure the integrity of the country.\n\nThere were a few factors in her favor, namely the general weariness from the war, the sharp drop in Kerr's popularity after his defeat in strict accordance with his own "rule of the strong'' idea, and the lack of clear successor, as it seemed that the long-horned chief had no intention of leaving his position. Knowing well that she will not be able to completely uproot the local ways of thinking, Yona focused on the next best thing - ensuring that the new leader would be forthright and ready to earnestly join Khuraltai by engaging in practical diplomacy, from personal meetings to public "agi-tai-shun", the latter being a neat trick borrowed from Thyra's tactics.\n\nA young warrior by the name of Royznbarg was the single suitable candidate, respected for her prowess on the battlefield and reputed to be honorable due to her actions before the ceasefire, negotiating a fair surrender for her banner-force and a safe passage for Yürkid non-combatants. After a short, but intense back-and-forth she accepted the support of the harmonists, proceeding to beat the disjointed competition quite soundly and declare her intention to be "voice of clan in yak unity". When Yona was departing, for the demonstrated efforts Royznbarg even considered her worthy of a farewell horn bump!"

 newyaks.83.t:0 "Strange Ways"
 newyaks.83.d:0 ""In the end, I'm a pony who had enough punch to be true yak's equal." Star Mountain squinted at Yona and then spitted on the ground. "And you are a yak who wasted her life to be a worse pony imitation."\n\nThe sentencing of the most unusual rebel commander was one of the few which could conceivably have a different outcome. Many members of the High Court, especially those from the Ghenikhan clan, pushed strongly for a harsher penalty in response to the campaign of bloody terror wrought by the "Severyanian madmare", up to and including a public execution. Although Yona was glad that the calmer voices prevailed, she feared that the banishment was not that much better of an alternative - after weathering the scornful semi-coherent sermon, the young chairyak became even more convinced that Star Mountain truly needed some kind of help, not isolation alongside her followers.\n\n"Nothing to say, huh? You communist patsies are all the same, can only repeat after your stupid little books or the dumb painted slogans." Changing her tone between disdainful and mocking, the pony carried on. "Don't worry, we'll have some words of our own when we come back from the north."\n\nIndeed, what was there to say? Could a phrase or two or a hundred make a difference? Mustering all her willpower, remembering all the lessons of the School of Friendship, Yona finally answered, right as the military police trucks were driving inside the prison courtyard to collect the exiles for their transportation."
 newyaks.83.a:0 "Only stars knew if she was heard."

 newyaks.84.t:0 "White Banner"
 newyaks.84.d:0 "A very curious group of creatures has recently crossed our southern border, all of them formerly a part of a military unit involved in the recent Yakyakistan civil war. They have been banished from the country in its aftermath, not only due to fighting for the losing side, but for demonstrated ferocity and brutality, and now these exiles seek a new cause.\n\nThe fact that all of the expats are ponies, apparently of Severyanian descent and strict anti-communist outlook, makes the situation even more interesting. Their leader, one called Star Mountain, has already directed a missive to [PLB.Capital.GetName], offering us her services and expertise in return for a proper post at our chain of command and incorporation of her subordinates into the army."
 newyaks.84.a:0 "We will see if horseyaks make good horsebears."

 newyaks.85.t:0 "The Formation of the Agrarian Union"
 newyaks.85.d:0 "In Thyra's eyes the post-war drop-off in the popularity of the hardline left movement was somewhat disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Yakyakistan weathered this dark storm while staying on the course towards harmony, and since its inhabitants were famously headstrong, they took it as a surefire sign to press on with the original reforms, maybe with a slight change in the specifics of leadership.\n\nOf course, Thyra was also a yak, meaning that there was no way she would abandon her struggle for the cause. Nonetheless, being stubborn did not equate to being stupid, so she had been toiling tirelessly, revising the approach towards the character of socialism in her homeland. Pressed by the need to keep up with the times, she also genuinely wanted to learn from and contribute to the forming democratic system which held the potential for many good things, especially with a suitable touch.\n\nDue to the aforementioned wilful nature of her comrades, this conciliatory route meant that the previous communist organization would have to come to an end, but Thyra quickly found that she did not lack for new allies and followers, especially among the young and the clanless. As a result of her efforts, the Yak Agrarian People's Union was born, advocating for peaceful peasant cooperatives and expanded worker rights, as well as the steady continuation of industrialization, and ready to carry the torch."

 newyaks.86.d:0 "A few years ago, when the diplomatic mission sent by Prince Rutherford, ruler of Yakyakistan, toured Equestria with great success (admittedly, after a few hiccups), Princess Celestia was quite pleased with the previously isolated country finding a harmonic place in the modern world. She had personally authorized several projects aimed at the industrial development of the region, approved of supportive packages for businesses willing to undertake ventures in the north and became acquainted with Yona, the first yak student at Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship. The positive trend came crashing down recently, as a bloody war between reformists and reactionaries broke out beyond the Crystal Mountains, threatening to undo all of the progress achieved. However, yaks were not the ones to ask for assistance directly - at least that was what the princess believed until a small royal delegation once again made its way south.\n\n"True clans brought down, their banners tattered." The voice of Rutherford echoed across the audience chamber, ringing with weariness and desperation. "Snow red with blood, salted with tears."\n\n"Please, Your Majesty. Please." Repeated by Yona, this word made her prince wince, but he did not interrupt, only lowering his head further. "Yaks need guns to fight, for hope, for families, for future. Ponies did so much for us - can they help in darkest hour too?"\n\nLooking at the brave souls forced to leave their kin and beg for salvation in a strange land brought Celestia great sorrow. Still, what they sought was not kind words, but weapons, supply of which was limited at best and crucially important for the defense of her own nation."

These lands were forcefully occupied by the latter centuries ago in the colonization drive and have remained an unresolved issue for the two regimes in the modern era.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that after dealing with their internal problems our allies are seeking diplomatic support in the endeavor, but the ongoing war makes it hard to divert political or economical resources to this project of historical revisionism in the less-than-stable north and brings about a risk of aligning griffons closer to the cause of our enemies. Moreover, it is worth considering that our endorsement might make Yakyakistan foolhardy enough to use their armed forces, while the lack of it might cause the tensions to reach a similar breaking point by themselves."

 newyaks.91.d:0 "Tired from traveling from all corners of the world, the group of once "dangerous and unpredictable creatures", as the six prominent students of the School of Friendship were named by the more conceited staff members, agreed on properly meeting after some freshening up. Gallus, Silverstream, Ladybug, Smolder, and Sandbar, the one who invited them all in for a little reunion - Yona felt weird seeing them after so much time and so many things. She was rather restless, startled by the warm, yet awkward greetings, so she wandered the place, trying to wrap her head around being here again.\n\nA sudden clanging sound brought her out of the contemplation. As Yona tried to determine its origin, a hushed curse followed the racket from a room to her left.\n\n"Ladybug alright there?" Recognising the voice of her shy friend, the yak peeked inside without waiting for an answer. To her surprise, there was no pony in sight, just a startled changeling. The stranger flapped her wings, mumbled something and then, before Yona's very eyes transformed into Ladybug and back.\n\n"I'm sorry... I can explain. Just come in, please!" With each word, the desperation of the changeling increased noticeably.\n\n"Talk. Promise to hear out." Cautiously, Yona entered the chamber and closed the door.\n\nLadybug or, going by her true name, Ocellus, talked as prompted, about everything - hive childhood, selection for duty, covert mission to the School and the chaotic web of circumstances, feelings and considerations which allowed her to go back willingly. Not all of these revelations sat well with Yona, but she could make out her old friend obscured behind them, remorseful and scared, shaking from the pouring truth, obviously different, but so very familiar, just as the School itself."

 newyaks.92.t:0 "For This Was Made Out of Nothing"
 newyaks.92.d:0 "Vesalipolis melted from Yngvar's vision. Streamers, balloons, and the loud din of marching bands had given him the noise he needed to reflect—walking with precision like he'd taught the greenhorns, then partying before his comrades ransacked the hives. Several changelings had even been won over to the cause of Marks, holding high the hope that they also could redeem their own proletariat.\n\nThe high didn't last forever. Their work was cut out for them: the reconstruction smelled of ash. Charred buildings gave way to missing names, then yet another corpse. This was changeling territory, Yngvar thought, so this was alright—yet his mind was cast to his motherland. Radiation threatened to soil their legacy, if it hadn't been crippled by enough chemical weapons to bathe the world in green and yellow and other colours of his toxic rainbow. The reactionaries of the world turned their back on him, but then the whole world was reactionary anyway, so Yakyakistan stood alone, though not as the vanguard but as a weak and feeble old hermit.\n\nDeeper within, steel and bullets backed the party line, that sacred communist orthodoxy—anyone could be a heretic. Peace and good will among yaks had frayed, as a walk through Karsakag showed him. Behind the praise for the Grand Marshal, they schemed on who to turn over to him on revisionism charges. Not that they had many suspects left for the mines and prisons: depopulated yurts and blocks said enough.\n\nThen there was Thyra. She couldn't be reached. Dead or in exile would've been a fitting fate to answer Yngvar with after she'd spurned his last letter to her: no, she wouldn't take up the reins of a maddening fail-state. He couldn't blame her; whatever dreams she had of a more perfect union were dashed against his rocks. But the rocks, too, would erode. The prime of his life wouldn't last forever. By then, the collapse he authored would come."

A few years ago when given such a chance she would have a whole speech prepared, explaining the inevitable issues found in the socialist movement and the necessity of harmonic reform. However, things have changed since graduation, and after everything was said and done, after the smoke of war cleared, the reformed nation stood bruised, yet strong, reaching for a promise of prosperity never seen before.\n\n"Thyra taught Yona lots. By big words and by good deeds." Perhaps this was not what lecturers at the School of Friendship understood by "keeping an open mind", but the star student was always eager to learn.\n\n"That what longhorns do." Thyra spoke with wisened gravitas, but her mischievous grimace caused Yona to smile back. "In seriousness, Thyra glad. Soon, new generation will guide community - smarter, better than the elders, - and Yona could..."\n\nA knock on the door interrupted their tete-a-tete, and in a moment Yngvar entered the room. The marshal was unusually cheerful, and even the surprise of discovering Yona here in the office only improved his mood.\n\n"Comrade Councilor. Comrade." After a curt soldiery greeting, he returned to a more relaxed pose. "Sorry to interrupt. Heard just now - family plan big dinner for next moon day. Wanted to invite you. Both, of course. And with kin-yaks."\n\n"Thyra's schedule quite open for now. Party sound very good. Yona?" Both revolutionaries turned to her with hope,\n\n"Happy to be guest with such company."

Sitting together around the fire late into the night, all of them had turned a bit sleepy and a little dreamy. Meanwhile, the flames danced, the smoke soared and magic was weaving its threads through the air, the rare type of spell born in a truly close circle of creatures.\n\n"We do live in an interesting time, don't we?" Speaking in a relaxed manner, a stallion with a turtle cutie mark smiled. "It's good to be here, though. Remember what you said at graduation, Smolder?"\n\n"In fact I do remember, Sandbar." The dragon parodied his tone and then playfully poked the pony with her elbow. "Something along the lines of exams, homeworks and this whole place going ablaze. And that I will miss you bunch dearly. So I did."\n\n"Isn't it great that it did not go ablaze? I mean, I know it was a metaphor." Silverstream, a hippogriff and the final member of the merry six after Yona and Ocellus, quickly glanced towards the School building. "But then there is a certain spark..."\n\nThe banter went on and Yona listened closely, allowing the reality to blend with her old memories. In her opinion, she had talked enough for now, especially after a barrage of questions everyone had for the latest head of yak state. This state, the country changed so much by her beliefs and actions, waited for her patiently in the north, and even though the more practical side of Yona was already setting up the plans for her return, this was the night for her other side, one not as calculating, but equally important in setting the way forward for her kin.

The gathered creatures were excited to see their ruler and obviously happy to take part in welcoming his return to the capital from the annual tour.\n\nAs for himself, Rutherford found great relief in this cheer, waving to the passerby and even loudly hollering back from the seat of an "all-terrain cabriolet", a special model designed by the rapidly growing local automotive industry. The path taken by Yakyakistan under his guidance was a turbulent one, and at times it seemed that only a handful of friends shared his intentions and values. Chief of these was Yona, once just an exchange student and a symbol of nascent change, and now a respected member of Khuraltai and a trusted advisor, sharing the ride with her leader and demonstrating similar enthusiasm, especially whenever her own name was brought into the boisterous rhythm.\n\nOf course, many yaks required to be dragged out from the past by horns and tail, and the prince proved to be an able hauler. With each visit to the home mountains and the new provinces, he talked and he listened, he iterated on the developments and he was ready to admit and rectify any mistakes, doing everything with a rugged perseverance as if there was something to prove. At this very moment though, as the car was approaching the palace gates, an idea - the slogan he heard so many times, the dream he always had, the motto he strove to live by - resonated in his mind with the much deserved conviction."

Should not frown!"\n\nWith a reminder of the upcoming feast stirring pleasant thoughts, the redeemed yak pretended to sigh, but then saluted those calling out to him with a broad smile. Their very much audible response allowed Rutherford to conclude that another issue has been resolved.\n\nOf course, over the last years he had seen many grander problems, and would see a score more, but Rutherford was confident in everything he had built with the same attention and care, be it family ties, friendships, or the whole reformed nation.

As the country turned away from its isolation, it was deemed right to share Yickslurbertfest with others, and so a large number of foreign delegations, ranging from sponsored school trips to official ambassadorial missions, were invited to join the festivities, with Yakistown naturally hosting the biggest party.\n\nWhile pessimists from within and beyond the border claimed that such an event could never work, they were quickly proven wrong. Indeed, there were some "cultural misunderstandings", but these small incidents could hardly measure up against the infectious happiness spreading to creatures young and old, always light-hearted or usually stern, first-timers or fest-veterans alike.

 newyaks.107.d:0 "Even a position as busy as the chairyak allowed for some time off, but Yona rarely used it. Over the months, she quickly found out that there always would be a lingering problem to deal with, for the country never rested. Since she was sitting in a fancy new cafe on the main street of Yakistown with no trace of paperwork in sight, today was somehow special.\n\n"Wow, this place has great stuff." Her pony guest, the sole reason for this break, flipped another page of the menu. "You must come here all the time!"\n\n"Yona order cupcakes from them. Se-mi-regularly." A shy smile appeared on her face.\n\n"Ooh, they do have a cupcake section, don't they? Wait. No. We wouldn't want me to spend this whole afternoon choosing desserts - there's so much to catch up on!" Putting the booklet away, the stallion waved with his hoof. "You go first."\n\n"No, Sandbar go first." Adding to the mix of emotions, a tinge of mischief colored Yona's expression. "In presence of nation leader, after all."\n\nAfter exchanging a quick knowing glance, both giggled. The connection built by the two in the School of Friendship proved to endure the shift in distance and seasons, and soon a blissful conversation flowed between the old friends, interrupted only by an occasional change in courses. When the list of the undiscussed topics grew thin and the visit was coming to a close, they felt almost fulfilled, if a bit sad, promising to write to each other often."

 newyaks.108.d:0 "After hours of dreaming, the inevitable morning came, reminding every creature of the world outside. One by one, the members of the little gathering - Gallus, Silverstream, Smolder, Ocellus, or rather "Ladybug" - said their goodbyes, ready to go on with hearts lighter and spirits higher.\n\n"We should do that again sometime." Looking wistful, Sandbar turned away from the departing train. "When's your ticket, Yona?"\n\nEven though the yak heard him well, she did not answer immediately. Now that only two of them were left, she was building up courage for something she did not trust herself to put in writing. Nonetheless, in hindsight, a letter would be easier.\n\n"Actually, leaving tomorrow. Have rest of day free." Yona tried her best to keep the voice steady and not devolve into a flustered mumble. "So, maybe we go out?"\n\n"Like for dinner? Sounds perfect! I know some..." The pony, quite surprised, stopped mid-sentence, seeing his companion shaking her horns.\n\n"Not that. Yona have everything planned." Despite the effort, she blushed, but it was no longer possible to go back. "Like... Like for date."\n\nThe few seconds it took for Sandbar to process what he heard flashed in an instance, while also stretching painfully long. Without noticing, Yona leaned in closer, yet instead of a "yes", or a "no" or anything audible at all, she felt a simple gentle kiss. "

 #Clan Events
 yakistan.31.t:0 "The Yürkid Betrayal"
 yakistan.31.d:0 "Prince Rutherford stood beside the ceremonial fire pit in Yakistown, speaking with his subjects and watching them go about their days. Every yak was talking about the Jaki Secession Crisis, but their Prince wasn't overly concerned.\n\nRutherford knew better than anyone how desperate the Jaki-Clan's situation must be. They barely had enough soldiers to defend their small domain, and they stood no chance against him on the battlefield. He wouldn't be surprised if the Jaki and his traitorous brother Bradford surrendered before the year's end.\n\n"Prince Rutherford..." said a messenger yak, looking very pale. "Yürkid Clan..."\n\n"What, Yürkid Clan upset?" the Prince scoffed, "Bah! Yürkids always upset."\n\n"No, Prince, Yürkid Clan announce secession. Elder Kerr join with Jaki-Clan."\n\n"More traitors? YAKS DESTROY!" The messenger cowered in fear as Rutherford began furiously destroying his surroundings.\n\nRutherford tried to calm down but couldn't; this was a disaster. The Yürkids were some of Yakyakistan's fiercest warriors, and with their aid the Jaki could form a real army. This betrayal would breathe new life into the secessionist movement and may even cause other clans to defect. An all-out war was now inevitable.\n\n"Take message to clan elders!" Rutherford yelled, "Prince call meeting of Khuraltai!""
 yakistan.31.a:0 "They will pay for this!"

 yakistan.33.t:0 "The Juyilkhai Secession"
 yakistan.33.d:0 "With those swearing allegiance to Prince Bradford encroaching upon slopes of Tengeriin mountains, some pessimists in our government claimed that it was only a matter of time before the "weirdyaks" of Juyilkhai clan would switch allegiances. Unfortunately, they were proven right, as we are receiving reports of their banners being withdrawn from the frontlines and their Khuraltai representatives seemingly vanishing."
 yakistan.33.a:0 "Backstabbing occultists!"

 yakistan.34.t:0 "The Mankhutayid Secession"
 yakistan.34.d:0 "Another clan has completely fallen for the lies of the rebels and deserted the progressive coalition! While it is clear that the anti-foreigner sentiments of Menggei and his followers made them a prime candidate for the enemy rhetoric, the complete breakdown of our relationship is still quite disappointing to say the least."
 yakistan.34.a:0 "They will not stop the change."

 yakistan.35.t:0 "The Arusharii Secession"
 yakistan.35.d:0 "As the number of yaks under Bradford's command swells, every warrior is worth their weight in gold, and losing a whole clan of such capable fighters - or indeed seeing them turn to the opposite side - is devastating. What's worse, with Arushariian betrayal, Yakistown stands unprotected before the gathering horde..."
 yakistan.35.a:0 "Rally the defenders of the capital!"

 yakistan.36.t:0 "The Kiyatukh Secession"
 yakistan.36.d:0 "As the war which tears our country apart is waged not only on the fields of battle, but in the hearts and minds of yaks as well, the treason of the clan of shamans and lorekeepers comes as a particularly hard blow. Certainly, without their support it is going to be even harder to maintain the fracturing alliance."
 yakistan.36.a:0 "They forgot what "true yak" means."

 yakistan.37.t:0 "The Noyamanan Secession"
 yakistan.37.d:0 "The richness of our mountains in raw resources cannot be denied, but it could be quite aggravating when this wealth ends up serving our enemies.

 yakistan.37.a:0 "At least ponies know loyalty!"

 yakistan.41.t:0 "The Süldintjid Secession"
 yakistan.41.d:0 "Pure madness seems to reign on the frontier as the Süldintjid clan has abandoned all reason and followed their old nemesis, Yürkids, in joining the forces with Prince Bradford.

 yakistan.39.a:0 "This must remain as it is."

 yakistan.40.t:0 "The Kiyatukh Revolt"
 yakistan.40.d:0 "Instead of customary promises of good tidings and bountiful snowfalls, the yaks of Ariun Ordon have delivered the proclamation of loyalty to Bradford.

 yakistan.42.t:0 "The Juyilkhai Revolt"
 yakistan.42.d:0 "Be it due to some dark omen, or the more common dissatisfaction and scheming, the usually withdrawn yaks of Juyilkhai clan have declared open support for the cause of Prince Bradford.

Bradford wouldn't be able to do much on his own, but his presence would help boost morale for the few Jaki defenders.\n\nSilhouettes appeared on the horizon. As they approached Bradford could make out the banners of the Yürkid Clan. When they came in closer he realized none of them had their weapons at the ready. Kerr, the clan elder, was at the front.\n\n"Prince Bradford!" Kerr called out across the snowy ground, "Yak want to talk!"\n\nSurprised, Bradford came out to meet him, telling his guards to stay behind.\nKerr smiled at this brazen display. "Rutherford is pony-loving traitor, Yürkid yaks serve him no longer. Yürkids pledge loyalty to Bradford, true Prince of Yakyakistan!"\n\nPrince Bradford smiled back jubilantly. This was the miracle he and the Jaki had been waiting for!\n\n"Prince yak accept pledge. Yürkids and Jakis will defeat Rutherford, restore true yak spirit!""

Naturally, their help in the conflict is very welcome."
 yakistan.50.a:0 "What took them so long to see the truth?"

 yakistan.51.t:0 "The Arusharii Join Us"
 yakistan.51.d:0 "While there are more populous or influential clans, the recent declaration of support by Arusharii yaks provides us with the most vital resource - capable, driven warriors. Furthermore, this development puts our forces directly at the gates of Yakistown, the coveted capital."
 yakistan.51.a:0 "Soon, the throne will be brought under the better ruler."

 yakistan.52.t:0 "The Kiyatukhs Join Us"
 yakistan.52.d:0 "Realizing their duty to our nation, the monks of Ariun Ordon have abandoned Rutherford's coalition and welcomed our soldiers with abundant blessings. Once again, the ideals of true yaks are vindicated and a powerful message resonates through the realm."
 yakistan.52.a:0 "Remember your roots, reject the new falsehoods!"

 yakistan.53.t:0 "The Noyamanan Join Us"
 yakistan.53.d:0 "There is no doubt that the war and its consequences will prove costly, so taking control over the resource-rich territories diplomatically is a significant gain for our cause. Naturally, our enemies will not let this slide, so we should consider all possibilities for defending the new lands."
 yakistan.53.a:0 "Steel for strength and honor!"

 yakistan.54.t:0 "The Süldintjids Join Us"
 yakistan.54.d:0 "It required some careful maneuvering due to the complicated history between Süldintjid and Yürkid clans, but the former understood that standing with an old rival is better than casting lot with a doomed cause. We can count on their unconditional support for the approaching conflict."
 yakistan.54.a:0 "All is fair in the war."

 #JAK Responses to Non-Bordering Secessions
 yakistan.55.t:0 "The Noyamanan Allegiance"
 yakistan.55.d:0 "With a bit of guile, we have managed to snatch the favor of the linguist clan away from the despicable reformers, and completely secure their loyalty. Even though their territories are not connected with our frontlines for now, the network of our supporters has been hard at work creating routes for the transportation of their valuable resources into the war chest."
 yakistan.55.a:0 "They shall serve us well."

 yakistan.56.t:0 "The Arusharii Allegiance"

 yakistan.57.t:0 "The Kiyatukh Allegiance"
 yakistan.57.d:0 "Even though their remote position does not offer us an immediate strategic advantage, the support of the respected shaman clan will now provide an undeniable boon to our legitimacy. Moreover, many faithful soldiers are relieved to know that the army will fight under proper blessings, and morale is on the rise."
 yakistan.57.a:0 "We will banish Rutherford's lies!"

 yakistan.58.t:0 "The Juyilkhai Allegiance"
 yakistan.58.d:0 "A prophecy comes from the depths of Tengeriin mountains, one that promises death to the change and strength to the past. The strange yaks have little they can offer us from their isolation, but every step bringing us towards the full control of the realm is most welcome."
 yakistan.58.a:0 "One wonders how deep the past goes..."

 # Clans encircled
 yakistan.59.t:0 "The Süldintjid Encircled"
 yakistan.59.d:0 "The position of the Süldintjid clan is now quite precarious, as they are completely surrounded by Bradford loyalists. While there is some hope that they will maintain control of their territory until the full-blown invasion, and we receive assurances for their continued campaign against our enemies, Yürkids in particular, a hasty relocation of our forces seems prudent."
 yakistan.59.a:0 "We shall come back in triumph."

 yakistan.60.t:0 "The Ghenikhan Encircled"
 yakistan.60.d:0 "Our adversaries have managed to isolate the territories controlled by the key member of the progressive coalition, Ghenikhan clan. After an emergency meeting of the high command, a decision was made to withdraw from the region, with further discussions on formation of partisan squads or plans for a linking charge not reaching conclusion as of yet."
 yakistan.60.a:0 "The communal spirit of Karsakag will be tested."

 yakistan.61.t:0 "The Mankhutayid Encircled"
 yakistan.61.d:0 "Envoys sent by elder Menggei report that the reactionaries have seized all significant routes connecting our territories. This development is most troubling, especially since this clan harbors a significant number of yaks skeptical towards reform and we might soon lose support from one of the last loyal families."
 yakistan.61.a:0 "We have to withdraw from their lands."

 yakistan.62.t:0 "The Kiyatukh Encircled"
 yakistan.62.d:0 "Dire tidings come from Ariun Ordon, as the land of great temples is now besieged by the Jaki-Clan and their minions. While the faithful pray for deliverance, we need to reconsider our internal policies and reorganize the front lines - at least, whatever is left of them."

 YAK_KOLETIV_GENERAL_DESC:0 "A brutal butcher and brilliant commander, Kerr has led the Yürkids longer than anyone in hundreds of years. While normally a Yürkid leader's rule lasts only a few years before being overthrown by a harsher, crueler successor, Kerr's has lasted since 982. It is a testament to his intelligence and skill that Rutherford did not kick him from the clan coalition when the first reports of slaughter trickled in. For now, he broods in the North, with intentions unknowable. Without a doubt among the most hated yaks in Yakyakistan, no one has yet lived to cross him."

 POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of February, 967 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_KARSAK_SUKHBATAAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 970 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yngvar has had a long and successful career in the Ghenikhan clan army, from infantry grunt to commander. Heavily influenced by Thyra's radical rhetoric, he hates the rich who exploit the worker, the priests who brainwash them, and the royalty who rule them. He supported her popular protest against Rutherford, but when she condemned the violence it produced, he knew she was too soft for the business of revolution.\n\nNow he steers the ship of state alone, a red autocrat, and he intends to march Yakyakistan to glory and free the rest of the workers of the North - whether they like it or not. And in pursuit of this great and noble goal, no method will be too extreme. The Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army will see the North liberated, no matter what it takes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
 POLITICS_OVLIINKHUVISGAL_ELBEGDORJ_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 959 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Thyra is a polarizing name in Yakyakistan. As often called a traitor as a hero, she studied at Stalliongrad for years, and saw both how brilliant Steel Stallion's leadership was and how it disintegrated after his death. Would this be the fate of every communist revolution? Distraught, she returned to the peasants, and saw their councils taking charge. She formulated a new thesis then: the vanguard party could not be the basis of communism. Only the workers themselves could liberate themselves, and the councils would be the core of this.\n\nWhen Rutherford reunited Yakyakistan, she knew the time was ripe to free the yaks. She organized a peaceful protest in the capital, and persuaded him to abdicate and let her form a new government in return for some promises to treat the harmonists of Yakyakistan well. Now the time has come to form a Northern Republic of Councils, so that all the peoples of North Equus might be truly free.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_FELIX_RAINFEATHER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of November, 981 in Guidonuovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: A hardworking griff, Felix Rainfeather grew up in the socialist hotbed of Guidonuovo. His work as a machinist led him to a uniquely union-focused strain of Marksism, believing in industrial unions rather than either the trade unions or the party as the vehicle for worker power. With Thyra's recent holding of elections he has been unexpectedly propelled to the presidency. While a griffon running a yak nation is quite surprising, Felix has firmly earned the trust of the industrial proletariat. Now he has to earn the peasantry's trust too.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"
 POLITICS_KARI_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of January, 975 near Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: A peasant in the Ghenikhan countryside, Kari has long had a somewhat dissident position among her clan. While Thyra was already deeply invested in the welfare of the peasantry, as an elder herself she was somewhat detached from their conditions. Kari has spent most of her life farming, and consequently has acquired not only a pride for the agrarian life, but something of a distaste for factory workers and industrial society. While she is unlikely to act upon these opinions, they have been a cause for some concern among her contemporaries--especially Felix Rainfeather, her nemesis in the Grand Council.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

 POLITICS_YONA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of December, 990 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yona is a young, eager, and bright yak, who loves her home and her people. From a humble family, she volunteered to visit Princess Twilight's School of Friendship, where she became good friends with five other students, especially a pony named Sandbar.\n\nShe's a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility, but she's sworn to do her friends proud. Rutherford may no longer be Prince, but he's still a valued friend and she often finds herself consulting with him. If only the world could know peace, rather than the constant fighting that the extremists seem to be imposing on them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_KHAN_KOLETIV_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 962 in Bara'dur.\n\n§YBiography§!: Kerr is the leader of the Yürkids, the most militaristic and expansionist of the clans, and a onetime friend of Prince Bradford's. Unfortunately, politics must always come before friendship, and Bradford would have led Yakyakistan to ruin through his tepid isolationism. How could he not see the growing threats on the continent? The changelings would never be content to have the yaks as a neutral nation, and nor would the ponies let the enclave live in peace with Rutherford and Yona slandering them. No, only by massively expanding the army and striking first can the yaks be safe. By proclaiming himself Khan, Kerr has thrown a gauntlet at the rulers of North Equus--no more will the yaks just accept the attacks against them. No longer will the yaks cower. No, from now on, it will be those others who cower at the yaks' hooves!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

 YAK_evanna_boom:0 "Evanna Boom"
 YAK_EVANNA_DESC:0 "As the leader of the Süldintjid clan banner, Evanna has risen high in military experience. Her fascination with artillery in particular was directly responsible for Prince Rutherford's investment into modern cannons. However, she is very skeptical of tanks, seeing them as little more than "artillery on wheels"."

 YAK_brigan_taih:0 "Brigan"
 YAK_BRIGAN_DESC:0 "A childhood friend of Rutherford's, Brigan had always planned to uphold the ancient Mangchijid-Mankhutayid alliance. With the consequences of industrialism, however, she has come to question those plans. Especially with Ghenikhan to the south constantly pushing communism on their members..."

 YAK_ridoven_taini:0 "Taini"
 YAK_TAINI_DESC:0 "A Mangchijid noble, Taini is something of a hawk among the harmonists. She pushed for a harsher treatment of the Jaki-Clan, opposed the truce, and now is eager to see war looming. She utterly despises Yona, seeing her as a soft wimp who would lead Yakyakistan to ruin. But Rutherford is Prince, and nothing can be done."

 YAK_khan_ainsley:0 "Ainsley"
 YAK_AINSLEY_DESC:0 "Arusharii's militarism is at odds with their clan leader Ainsley's calm, serene demeanor out of combat. Said to be remarkably well-spoken, he turns into a ferocious beast in combat, smashing anything in his way. Losing his allegiance would be a dire proposition."

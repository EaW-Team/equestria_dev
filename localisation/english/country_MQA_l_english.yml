 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_Ceyda_desc:0 "During her coronation ceremony on the eleventh month of 1006, few expected that Ceyda Vatosoa, sole daughter of the late Mpanjaka Serkan Vatosoa, would have the austere, iron-fisted attitude nor the administrative expertise needed to rule the turbulent nation of Sambovato that her father possessed, at least not at such a young age. However, what the new Mpanjakavavy does not lack is the wits of a learner, the resolve of a leader and most importantly the charisma befitting of her stunning beauty as the \"Ebony Pearl of Sambovato\".\n\nBorn on a stormy summer night in 988, Ceyda was surrounded by nothing but the vast opulence of the Vatosoa clan as early as she could remember, as a true silver spoon filly. However, the devastating death of her mother shortly after her birth in circumstances still mysterious to this day left her without siblings and the sole heir of the fledgling Vatosoa dynasty, a reality her father Serkan remedied to by keeping her daughter far removed from the politics, machinations and intrigue of the Rova's court culture for the preservation of her relative safety and innocence. Thus Ceyda grew up to be a cultured and beautiful, if rather eccentric young socialite mare, unwittingly becoming the popular public face of the monarchy through her lavish parties and grand public festivities, relaxing with her best friend by the pool of her family rova or watching the movements of the mighty National Protection Fleet from her seaside balcony in between occasions, all while being counseled by the best tutors money could afford. However, with the Mpanjaka's abrupt and premature death in late 1006, the barely mature Ceyda was called upon by her late father's advisory council to assume the throne of Sambovato as the second monarch of the Vatosoa dynasty.\n\nAs the young queen prepares to enter the chambers of the National Rova for the very first time of her life to confront and read the faces of these supposedly altruistic and well-meaning ministers and set the course of her country's increasingly uncertain future, she thinks to herself...\n\n\"Inexperience be damned, aren't politics after all just another party to navigate?\""

 ### General & Admiral Descriptions ###
 MQA_rano_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:  May 27, 951 in Tsenalakana\n\n§YRank§!: Amiraly Lehibe\n\n§YBiography§!: Having come into the world facing the sea on the lively shores of the city of a hundred markets and a thousand boats, the eventual ascension of Yüce Ranomasina to the rank of Grand Admiral and consequently that of Commander of the National Protection Navy of Sambovato, a title whose power and influence is claimed to only be topped by that of Mpanjaka itself, was manifestly assured from his dawn, for he had the celestial destiny of being born into the noble Ranomasina clan, a family of accomplished mariners whose great princely Maroseranana ancestors once ruled the southern stretches of the island and its many ports before kowtowing first to the great Mpanjaka of Sambovato, then their Senturyan suzerains as their most loyal servants on the deep blue waves for centuries thereafter.\n\nAnd thus, just like his father and grandfather before him, Yüce enrolled into the then Senturyan Navy at a young age, experiencing a meteoric rise to the rank of second officer by the age of 25 before the Great Mutiny gradually consumed his home around him. It is said within the court whispers that on the night of his promotion ceremony to first officer, the young commander burst out of his cabin a completely different zebra, suddenly rallying his ship’s crew before mutinying and sending their centaur superiors overboard into the sea before declaring his zealous allegiance not to the traditional Mpanjaka, enfeebled and sidelined by centuries of humiliating submission over in the royal highlands, but to the new, young and vigorous Mpanjaka over in Akorandriakarova, one hailing from his beloved coast and sea where his people truly belonged, Serkan Vatosoa.\n\nHis fervent loyalty to the new dynasty was handsomely rewarded after the success of the Great Mutiny and the affirmation of independence from the Kingdom of Senturya, being entrusted first the full command of the newly acquired Senturyan fleet present in Sambovato as its first Grand Admiral, then that of the Committee of National Protection tasked with overseeing the nation’s military upkeep and modernization before the Mpanjaka’s untimely death in late 1006. The  middle-aged admiral now stands tall as a pagoda mast as one of the court’s most powerful advisors, with critics and supporters alike noting his particular uncle-like fondness for Serkan’s daughter Ceyda as well as his strong belief in the rebirth of Sambovato’s glorious thalassocratic past.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Ryan"

 MQA_aziz_desc:0 "Aziz was Born on the 19th of July in the year 970 in Tsenalakana, with his family serving the Military for 3 Generations at that point with the only exception being his “good for nothing Brother” as his Father did call him. In-School he surpassed most of his classmates due to his Father often pushing him beyond his limits since he wanted Aziz to continue the family legacy of proud soldiers and a good soldier can not be lazy. After his first Years of School, he showed great promise and was transferred to the Akorandriakarova Military School away from home and all his few friends he had. There he would struggle the first time in his life, but he would keep pushing himself beyond his limits as his Father taught him.\n\nIn the Year 986 he Graduated with honors and finally joined the military in the same year making his father proud, who had retired last year from his position as Drill instructor of the Royal honor guard. From there on he would ace basic Training due to his years of practice and would quickly climb the ranks and becoming somewhat of a favorite of his superiors since he did not just follow orders, but he would follow them to the letter, and sometimes he would even go out of his way and grab the initiative on his own, as long as it was inside the boundaries of what he was allowed to do.\n\nIn the Year 995 he would finally have a spot in the Royal Guard, commanding his troops and even fighting off a small uprising in 997 from those crazed trees loving Eco Zebras. In the Year 1003, he would finally reach the rank of Drill instructor as his father did before him...yet he didn't just want to become like his father, he wanted to surpass him, but he was quite up in the food chain at this point, he had friends in high places and his father reputation was one of the reasons why he did even get this high so fast. So for now he will have to do his part and wait for another chance to climb the ranks.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Ryan"

 MQA_Fasika_desc:0 "Beyza was born in the summer of 985 on a Fishing boat, where her mother was working to feed her family, even then Beyza welcomed the waves that would later shape her career. As she grew older she became more and more of a “water rat” spending most of her free time swimming and helping her mother on the fishing boat.\n\n A few years after she entered School, she was on the way to the nearby beach again to swim a bit, there she saw a bunch of grown Zebras she had not seen before train Maneuvers on the beach and in the water. Impressed by their swimming she started to watch them regularly and tried what she saw alone with makeshift equipment till one day after her swim she was welcomed by the officer who always instructed the swimmers. First, she was scared if she was in trouble, but instead of getting scolded she got praised and got an official invitation to join one of their training sessions. She happily accepted and a week later it was finally time for it, she was an hour early due to her sheer excitement, and according to another older-looking officer who was present, she did perform quite adequately for someone so young and with no real training. After that, she was allowed to watch the more dangerous maneuvers, and she always tried them out as best as she could, alone after the session...or at least she thought she was alone.\n\n After her graduation, the older-looking officer that she had only met a couple of times in the past 3 years approached her. He gave her an official invitation into the Sambovatan Costal Operative Force, telling her that she had been watched the past few years since she was found and that she would make a fine asset...with the right training. But first, she would have to go through basic training and serve for a couple of years. She didn’t hesitate to take the offer and joined basic training. Her gift to learning and adapting quickly served her once again and she even made some new records in basic training. After serving the army for 3 years she was finally allowed to join the Special forces she had watched for half her childhood, as the youngest member to ever join them at the age of 20. Since then she didn’t lose her gift and she even rose into a commanding position. And now she serves her country in the one way she knows best and she is proud to do so.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: SESEK"

 sambovato.1.d:0 "My Queen, we got a proposal to make. Have you heard of this new invention called Flighters? It's a magnificent new piece of technology that opens up the Skies for even those that are not blessed with wings! We should host a grand fair having the Pilots of those so-called Fighter Plains demonstrate their skill and their command over those flight machines. I asked some of the Pilots, they say they will start with a so-called formation flight, and the Grand Final will be the best two of them flying in sync followed by fireworks. There is of course the slight chance that the people could see this show of splendor as a waste of the fuel we created by our exploitations, but is that enough of a reason to give up such a clear sign of progress for our Nation?"

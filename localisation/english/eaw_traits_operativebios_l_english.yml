She spent her early years playing pretend and hide and seek with her sister and the other foals, baking delicious treats when otherwise unoccupied. Throughout their youths the sisters were curious about the world outside the village. They dreamed of adventure in far off lands.\n\nWhen old enough, the two set off for Rijekograd. Their amazement of the tall buildings and automobiles faded quickly once they experienced the modern wonder of the cinema. Of all the films they saw, Dead Drop particularly favoured the ones featuring the exploits of spies. Oftentimes she dragged her somewhat less enthusiastic sister to see them on release day.\n\nEventually, the magic wore off, and the two agreed that they could easily do better than the agents depicted in the films. Dead Drop actually decided to go for it. Bringing her sister along, she sought out the OHS and managed to get them both hired.\n\nDrop was excited. With their new occupations, she had a chance to live out her dreams and fantasies. Their special talents seemed uniquely suited to spywork, resulting in good performance in the field and helping to pave the way towards smooth advancement in the agency.\n\nIn her spare time, Dead Drop runs a bakery in Rijekograd with her sister under their cover identities and still likes to bake all sorts of pastries. She particularly enjoys the taste of torta princeze regentkinje and choux à la crème. Her favorite pastime is still playing with disguises.§!"

Their amazement of the tall buildings and automobiles faded quickly once they experienced the modern wonder of the cinema. Of all the films they saw, False Flag found particular enjoyment in tragedies, though her sister's love of spy films meant she was often dragged along to see any.\n\nOne day, her sister decided that the two of them would be much better spies than the ones in the movies. False Flag, assuming this was a joke, readily agreed with her sister. However, her sister took this seriously and actually dragged False Flag into the OHS, somehow getting them hired.\n\nFalse was initially reluctant about their new occupation, but soon took to it like a fish to water. Their special talents seemed uniquely suited to spywork, resulting in good performance in the field and helping to pave the way towards smooth advancement in the agency.\n\nIn her spare time, False Flag runs a bakery in Rijekograd with her sister under their cover identities and still likes to bake all sorts of pastries. She particularly enjoys the taste of key lime pie and cinnamon rolls. Her favorite pastime is still messing with her sister.§!"

She was a subpar flyer, was unable to learn to transform her appearance, and was found to have a phobia of extremely loud noise. In spite of this, she endeavored to serve her country any way she could, and was eventually placed in a psychological warfare group called the Special Ambassadors for her prodigious skill at emotional manipulation sans-disguise, an already-rare ability for changelings.\n\nShe rose through the ranks at lightning speed due to this talent and the organization's rapidly-changing purpose, until it solidified in the form it is in today with her as the highest-ranking field officer. She has written much literature on improving interrogation training and methods, for common soldier and secret police alike and has earned an honorary four-year degree in psychology.\n\nNow, she stands as living proof that no matter who you are, the Changeling Lands can find a use for you in its quest for domination. §!"

Seeing his father's failures as a thug, and learning from his example, Garry would sneak along jobs, and watch from the shadows, learning how he could better fit the job his father held.\n\nAt the age of 19, Garry was finally caught stowing away in his father's car during a bank heist as the police were closing in. Thinking fast, he took the wheel, and quickly became the getaway driver, giving the police the slip and saving the crew from being busted. This would serve as his initiation into the Holvedor crime family, and he would be tasked with odd jobs every other week, learning the ropes of the trade. By the age of 24, Garry's father was found to be embezzling funds from Holvedor, and rather than being forced to wear concrete shoes, Garry stepped up, and offered to double his routine to spare his father's life.\n\nThis would launch him into a prime position as one of Willem Holvedor's personal informants, keeping him posted as to the Family's woes, and how they might deal with them.§!"

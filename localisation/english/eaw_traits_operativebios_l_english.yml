She spent her early years playing pretend and hide and seek with her sister and the other foals, baking delicious treats when otherwise unoccupied. Throughout their youths the sisters were curious about the world outside the village. They dreamed of adventure in far off lands.\n\nWhen old enough, the two set off for Rijekograd. Their amazement of the tall buildings and automobiles faded quickly once they experienced the modern wonder of the cinema. Of all the films they saw, Dead Drop particularly favoured the ones featuring the exploits of spies. Oftentimes she dragged her somewhat less enthusiastic sister to see them on release day.\n\nEventually, the magic wore off, and the two agreed that they could easily do better than the agents depicted in the films. Dead Drop actually decided to go for it. Bringing her sister along, she sought out the OHS and managed to get them both hired.\n\nDrop was excited. With their new occupations, she had a chance to live out her dreams and fantasies. Their special talents seemed uniquely suited to spywork, resulting in good performance in the field and helping to pave the way towards smooth advancement in the agency.\n\nIn her spare time, Dead Drop runs a bakery in Rijekograd with her sister under their cover identities and still likes to bake all sorts of pastries. She particularly enjoys the taste of torta princeze regentkinje and choux à la crème. Her favorite pastime is still playing with disguises.§!"

Their amazement of the tall buildings and automobiles faded quickly once they experienced the modern wonder of the cinema. Of all the films they saw, False Flag found particular enjoyment in tragedies, though her sister's love of spy films meant she was often dragged along to see any.\n\nOne day, her sister decided that the two of them would be much better spies than the ones in the movies. False Flag, assuming this was a joke, readily agreed with her sister. However, her sister took this seriously and actually dragged False Flag into the OHS, somehow getting them hired.\n\nFalse was initially reluctant about their new occupation, but soon took to it like a fish to water. Their special talents seemed uniquely suited to spywork, resulting in good performance in the field and helping to pave the way towards smooth advancement in the agency.\n\nIn her spare time, False Flag runs a bakery in Rijekograd with her sister under their cover identities and still likes to bake all sorts of pastries. She particularly enjoys the taste of key lime pie and cinnamon rolls. Her favorite pastime is still messing with her sister.§!"

She was a subpar flyer, was unable to learn to transform her appearance, and was found to have a phobia of extremely loud noise. In spite of this, she endeavored to serve her country any way she could, and was eventually placed in a psychological warfare group called the Special Ambassadors for her prodigious skill at emotional manipulation sans-disguise, an already-rare ability for changelings.\n\nShe rose through the ranks at lightning speed due to this talent and the organization's rapidly-changing purpose, until it solidified in the form it is in today with her as the highest-ranking field officer. She has written much literature on improving interrogation training and methods, for common soldier and secret police alike and has earned an honorary four-year degree in psychology.\n\nNow, she stands as living proof that no matter who you are, the Changeling Lands can find a use for you in its quest for domination. §!"

One of the finest agents in Her Highness' secret service, the highly intelligent and charming Con Mane received a true stallion's upbringing in only the best of Equestria's academies. Frequent travels around the greater world sharpened the sophisticated pony's knowledge and sense of culture, and it is said that he is a fluent speaker of over a dozen languages! When he isn't off in defense of the princesses and country, he enjoys countryside travels and casino games, in addition to practicing his mastery of various solitary sports.\n\nDapper looks in signature tuxedo and slicken mane bonded with deadly charisma and quick thinking on his hooves ensure Con Mane access to any high-level events and sites. And when an open entrance isn't on the table, sleek and stealthy suits this pearly pony's repertoire perfectly.\n\nUtilizing a custom-tailored armory of gadgets envisioned by some of Canterlot's brightest minds grants Con Mane an edge over rival spies and organizations. Mad nobles, shapeshifting assassins, rogue wizards, and rampaging hydras are but a few feathers in his marks of macaroni. Con Mane would be a truly formidable foe, if not for his unwavering loyalty to Equestria, to the alicorns, and to harmony.§!"

For once, the day hadn't been saved. The pillars of over a thousand years of Harmony collapsed, leaving behind a titanic wake of dust and debris. Few would notice a pearly pony in tattered suit among the ashes, clawing his way out, where he retreated to remote Froud Valley to spend a number of years in solitude and self-reflection.\n\nHere, Con Mane brought himself to terms with what had happened, retraining his skills, relearning all there was to know about spywork. He learned to work without his equipment, without his mentors, partners, or the support of S.M.I.L.E., practicing his skill on the occasional patrol. But he knew he would have to return eventually.\n\nThe realm that was once 'Equestria', his home, was being ravaged; Each day its occupants ruthlessly drained dry of all the love they could muster. When he intercepted news of the uprising on his improvised radio, Con Mane knew it was time to go.§!"

Seeing his father's failures as a thug, and learning from his example, Garry would sneak along jobs, and watch from the shadows, learning how he could better fit the job his father held.\n\nAt the age of 19, Garry was finally caught stowing away in his father's car during a bank heist as the police were closing in. Thinking fast, he took the wheel, and quickly became the getaway driver, giving the police the slip and saving the crew from being busted. This would serve as his initiation into the Holvedor crime family, and he would be tasked with odd jobs every other week, learning the ropes of the trade. By the age of 24, Garry's father was found to be embezzling funds from Holvedor, and rather than being forced to wear concrete shoes, Garry stepped up, and offered to double his routine to spare his father's life.\n\nThis would launch him into a prime position as one of Willem Holvedor's personal informants, keeping him posted as to the Family's woes, and how they might deal with them.§!"

 scientist_trait_bio_sabana_pescada_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31 October, 986 in Keowen (government census), or 9 September, 9522 BLB on Venus (self-reported)\n§YBiography§!: It can be hard to figure out where Sabana came from since by her own admission she spent much of her life either homeless, on the run, or both at the same time, and it's not helped by the fact that she's an unreliable narrator. It seems that she was born to an abusive single father in the Sicameonese city of Keowin, ran away from home at the age of 17, was too unstable to hold down a job, and came to Greifwald to escape creditors and court dates.\nShe came to our attention when she started talking about secret government programs that actually existed. No matter how deeply we investigated her we couldn't figure out how she was finding out what she knew. Eventually we gave in and asked her. Her answer was that she was being told about them by one "Mr. Hailstorm", who she was (and is) in regular communication with, and who also drip-feeds her theories on the magical sciences and on future technologies in general. We have yet to figure out who that is, or if it's a real creature at all, and we believe Maar is using the deranged as a mouthpiece again.\nWhatever the case, her radical and often-incomprehensible scientific theories are considered brilliant by the experts whenever they can understand them. We've put her in charge of her own research division, and although her juniors and seniors both consider her "difficult", she gets good results.\n§YPortrait By§!:N/A"

barrad_silver_star.1.d:0 "His Magistrate Silver Star is known for his overbearing paranoia. However, it seems to run deeper than expected, as even in sleep, he is not able to escape it.\n\nThe mage came running out of his room in a fit of madness, shouting at the top of his lungs about the horrors he'd seen. When the servants managed to pin him down, he proceeded to go on about being chased by terrifying monsters who sought to tear into him. He then talked about seeing his allies surrounding him and unsheathing daggers before stabbing him repeatedly, leaving him a withered husk in the woods\n\nThe servants tried to reassure him, but it was to no avail. Silver Star got up and went around the halls, ordering for extra security to be posted around his bedroom and for the servants to be on alert for any possible assassins. He then locked himself in his bedroom and paced around, rambling about traitors and spies."

BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner:0 "Look for Silver Star"
BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner_desc:0 "All the pre-hunt preparations had gone smoothly, and everyone was set. Everyone, except Silver Star. The paranoid mage was nowhere to be found. The Count quickly dispatched Asinti and Leopold to find Silver and take him out of his hiding spot."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things:0 "A Matter of True Importance..."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things_desc:0 "Her Magistrate Viira is known for her stubbornness and selfishness. However, she is also ambitious and driven. If she could be convinced to leave her tower and forget her ego, the Pentarchy could have much more fun!"
BAR_put_an_effort:0 "...After a Second Thought"
BAR_put_an_effort_desc:0 "After countless failed attempts to get her out of her tower, Viira made it clear that there was nothing in it for her. Ambrosius told her that if she left her tower, she would be rewarded with access to some of his most ancient forbidden texts. After a brief moment of silence, Viira acceded."
BAR_produce_guns:0 "Gun Production"
BAR_produce_guns_desc:0 "His Magistrate Leopold is very reserved, often spending days locked up in his tower, away from the outside world. However, as a Herzlander, he has great knowledge of modern weaponry. He has sent a request to the Count to produce a batch of guns. The Count received the request while inebriated and approved it without even bothering to read it."
BAR_produce_magical_guns:0 "Crystal Rifle Experiment"
BAR_produce_magical_guns_desc:0 "For years, Leopold has tried to perfect what he calls the "crystal rifle", a rifle capable of running on magic instead of gunpowder. However, he has never been able to perfect it. Until now, that is. Recently, Leopold was able to demonstrate his new rifle to the Count by violently destroying his front yard in a flash of magical light."
BAR_produce_more_guns:0 "Future Gun Production"
BAR_produce_more_guns_desc:0 "Leopold has sent another request for guns. The Count received the request whilst being in a relatively sober state. He decided that, to prevent any more requests, he would order the construction of an arms factory on the eastern river. The Count congratulated himself on his brilliance, and then proceeded to drink five pints of beer."
BAR_gather_peasants:0 "Gather Peasants"
BAR_gather_peasants_desc:0 "Barrad's leadership has garnered a lot of attention. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be very positive. Dozens of aspiring adventurers enter our lands, seeking to destroy the illustrious Pentarchy. The time has come for us to deal with these wandering "heroes". We shall conscript a levy of peasants from the villages of Barrad to counter these intruders, even if we have to drag them out of their homes." 
BAR_borrow_peasants:0 "Borrow Peasants"
BAR_borrow_peasants_desc:0 "After our conscription of dozens of Barradian peasants, His Magistrate Asinti has kindly asked to borrow some peasants in order to further his research. We shall gladly oblige in giving him the resources he needs to better our collective understanding of the world we live in and more."
BAR_gather_nobles:0 "Gather "Nobles""
BAR_gather_nobles_desc:0 "Scattered across Barrad are the estates of its wealthiest ponies. These "nobles" spend almost everyday partying with the Count and performing dark magic. They control levies that could prove useful in solving our problem. Since all of these "nobles" are drunkards, this should go off without a cinch." 
BAR_hunting_party:0 "Hunting Party"
BAR_hunting_party_desc:0 "We have armed our hunters with weapons and told them the plan. We have thrown a great pre-hunt feast to inspire our allies. Now, it is time to find all the game lurking in our woods.\n\nLet the hunt begin!"

### Chapter 2 ###
BAR_meeting_of_four:0 "Meeting of Four"
BAR_meeting_of_four_desc:0 "We have discovered... something. A loosely bound codex containing faded ink and crumbling parchment. Whatever knowledge is contained within will be very old. Now who's reading it first?"
BAR_viira_adventure:0 "A Different Approach"
BAR_viira_adventure_desc:0 "Although the language is unreadable, it is not unfamiliar either. There are some similarities to the language used by the local cult. Too many to dismiss as a coincidence."
BAR_contact_cultists:0 "Contact Cultists"
BAR_contact_cultists_desc:0 "Viira has managed to successfully track down more members of Barrad's shadowy cult. Now all she needs to do is initiate contact and gain their trust. After that, they will hopefully be willing to shed some light on our recent discovery."
BAR_barrad_machine_concept:0 "Secrets Revealed"
BAR_barrad_machine_concept_desc:0 "Formalities have concluded with Viira persuading the cultists to consider her worthy of hearing their teachings. The time for introductions is over, now is the time for some answers."
BAR_viira_resources:0 "A Gift"
BAR_viira_resources_desc:0 "Viira has made a good impression on the cultists, and several of them were nice enough to provide her with some interesting artifacts in appreciation. Despite their obscurity, these ponies seem to be very well connected."
BAR_barrad_machine_mystery:0 "A Mystery?"
BAR_barrad_machine_mystery_desc:0 "Viira approached the cultists in search of answers, but she leaves with more questions than ever. Their beliefs are very strange; what they claim would explain some parts of Barrad's bizarre nature, but not everything. Something bigger is going on here, and Viira is determined to get to the bottom of it."
BAR_capture_cultists:0 "Capture Cultists"
BAR_capture_cultists_desc:0 "Asinti has no patience for indulging these maniacs. What they know is of no consequence compared to what they are: ideal candidates for a ritual. Luring them to their dooms will be a simple matter."
BAR_grand_sacrifice:0 "Grand Sacrifice"
BAR_grand_sacrifice_desc:0 "Asinti is eager to perform a sacrifice for his divine companion, and all the preparations are complete. Let the blood flow! This offering will gain us much favour, indeed..."
BAR_elisay_valley_factories:0 "Elisay Valley Manufacturies"
BAR_elisay_valley_factories_desc:0 "Elisay Valley's high and resource rich peaks make it less affected by Barrad's infamous weather, and a considerable source of the nation's ore and crystals. Together, these traits make the valley a prime candidate for a new industrial park."
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming:0 "Valley Terraforming"
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming_desc:0 "In the dark ages, our ancestors were limited by the land around them. With projects to clear otherwise unusable terrain being extraordinarily expensive and time consuming. Now, with the power of industry to assist us, we can do in months what may once have taken years to accomplish."
BAR_alchemy_plantations:0 "Alchemical Plantations"
BAR_alchemy_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture! This is the foundation on which civilization is built. Asinti knows this and as such has made proposals to create new crops that will be resistant to the extreme of our land, and totally immune to the various strains of blight that plague their less magical brethren."
BAR_sentient_livestock:0 "Sentient Livestock"
BAR_sentient_livestock_desc:0 "With the appropriate application of magic it may be possible to instill a greater intelligence into our livestock, permitting them to perform more complex tasks and lessen the burden our peasants carry."
BAR_new_mine:0 "New Mine"
BAR_new_mine_desc:0 "Barrad's land houses a cornucopia of crystals. We must extract as much of them as possible. To do so, we will establish new mines and excavate them by any means necessary. Soon the riches deep within these lands will be ours."
BAR_mining_eq:0 "Mining Equipment"
BAR_mining_eq_desc:0 "There exists many fundamental truths in this world. The sky is blue, water is wet, and steel is stronger than stone. We'll need new equipment to prove that last one."
BAR_leopold_research:0 "Crystalic Research"
BAR_leopold_research_desc:0 "With such an abundance of crystals now at our disposal it would be a shame to have very narrow uses for them. Leopold has already discovered many practical uses for the magical gems, in his spare time but a dedicated team would undoubtedly find even more. The only issue is funding such a team."
BAR_industrial_eq:0 "Industrial Equipment"
BAR_industrial_eq_desc:0 "The forge and anvil have served us well for a long, long time but now it's time to lay them to rest. With modern equipment like lathes we will be able to produce far more complex goods of significantly higher quality."
BAR_leopold_res:0 "Quick Benefits"
BAR_leopold_res_desc:0 "Leopold's efforts are already paying dividends. The output of these new mining and industrial facilities will greatly aid him in his research. Research that will help bring about a new age for all creatures!"
BAR_another_party:0 "Another Party"
BAR_another_party_desc:0 "Things have been unusually quiet around Ambrosius' manor recently. Since it has been a while since the Count's last shindig, it will not be long until he demands another to quell his boredom."
BAR_another_party_stay_longer:0 "Stay..."
BAR_another_party_stay_longer_desc:0 "Enjoying yourself? Wait, don't leave! You don't want to know what happened to the last ones that tried to leave... Come closer, there is something we must discuss... erm, what was your name again?"
BAR_just_a_bit_longer:0 "...a Bit..."
BAR_just_a_bit_longer_desc:0 "Ah yes, of course, I remember now. Have a seat, I insist. Let us indulge in games and drink! All the while, I shall tell you about the wondrous advancements made possible by my magical experiments."
BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles:0 "...Longer"
BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles_desc:0 "Yes, overcoming death itself! Truly extraordinary, is it not? Of course, such a thing would only be possible if you were to help me in acquiring materials for my research..."
BAR_virra_magic_trick:0 "Party Trick"
BAR_virra_magic_trick_desc:0 "Viira knows that the best way to get support from wealthy ponies is by impressing them. A little performance can go a long way, it makes them lower their guard and open their coin purses."
BAR_meeting_of_four_two:0 "Decision to Be Made"
BAR_meeting_of_four_two_desc:0 "Much has happened since the last meeting of the four Pentarchs, and many things have become clear. It is time to meet once again to agree on what next steps to take, and who should take the lead."

### Chapter 3 ###
BAR_search_for_knowledge:0 "Search for Knowledge"
BAR_search_for_knowledge_desc:0 "As we begin planning for the reactor, it is important that we keep our eyes open for new information that might help aid in its construction. Getting to the point where its power can be harnessed is absolutely crucial, the future of Barrad depends on it."
BAR_ambrosius_wants_a_car:0 "A Kind Request"
BAR_ambrosius_wants_a_car_desc:0 "Ambrosius' imagination has recently become captured by the aesthetics of automobiles, along with their inner workings. It is doubtful he will give up this obsession until he has obtained one to call his own."
BAR_attack_of_mutant_plants:0 "Wild Plants Problem"
BAR_attack_of_mutant_plants_desc:0 "It seems a truly bizarre situation is developing in the mountains. We aren't sure how it could be possible, but local villages report sighting angry mutant plants that are attacking anyone that comes close. What is going on?"
BAR_begin_building:0 "Begin Building"
BAR_begin_building_desc:0 "At last, the process of planning and preparation is complete. We have uncovered all the knowledge we need to continue forward with our plans, and real progress on the reactor can finally begin."
BAR_underground_forges:0 "Underground Forges"
BAR_underground_forges_desc:0 "Leopold sees the wisdom in keeping manufacturies hidden from view and safe from threats. Given the unique difficulties presented by our climate, such subterranean complexes must form the backbone of Barrad's industry if we are to advance."
BAR_crystals_experiments:0 "Crystal Experiments"
BAR_crystals_experiments_desc:0 "Few creatures fully appreciate the enormous potential of magical crystals, destructive or otherwise. Using Leopold's specialised facilities, we can study the properties of these crystals to further our understanding of the universe."
BAR_reactor_research_bonus:0 "This will help in designing the reactor."
BAR_leopold_tanks:0 "Tools to Maintain"
BAR_leopold_tanks_desc:0 "During this critical moment, we cannot afford to sit idly and remain content with our military arsenal. We must constantly strive to invent and perfect new weapons of war, for technology is our only hope of survival."
BAR_leopold_rifles:0 "Weapon Tinkering"
BAR_leopold_rifles_desc:0 "While some fail to appreciate the intricacies of rifle designs, Leopold is aware of the importance of these weapons, and he knows that improvements can always be made. Our infantry forces will no doubt appreciate the effort."
BAR_leopold_clockwerks:0 "Autonomous Clockworks"
BAR_leopold_clockwerks_desc:0 "Leopold's clockworks are truly incredible creations! Capable of moving all on their own, every observer that sees them up close comes away awed by their construction. However, the fact is that these machines are harmless and not very useful, for now..."
BAR_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Deeper"
BAR_dig_deeper_desc:0 "As we endeavour to obtain the materials necessary to fuel our industry, we must step up our deep mining efforts. The valuable metals hiding beneath the rock and soil are ripe for recovery, and will be critical as we build new and more advanced war machines."
BAR_seek_cultist_knowledge:0 "Seek Cultist Knowledge"
BAR_seek_cultist_knowledge_desc:0 "Viira's investigation has led her to the Inner Circle of Barrad's obscure cult and their home inside a compound deep in the forest. Hopefully she will be able to uncover the secrets hidden inside this isolated enclave."
BAR_trial_of_the_machine:0 "Trial of the Machine"
BAR_trial_of_the_machine_desc:0 "It seems these cultists will not reveal their secrets to any outsider unless they complete some sort of initiation rite. They are appalled by the prospect of gifts from their god being looked upon by one who lacks proper reverence. In any case, Viira is prepared to do whatever it takes to prove her worth."
BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_deeps:0 "Pilgrimage to the Deep"
BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_deeps_desc:0 "There are whispers of a heavily guarded hallowed chamber that lies beneath the compound, which is said to house something of great importance. Descending to examine this chamber would surely be a fruitful inquiry, assuming the guards are willing to step aside..."
BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_ancient_machines:0 "Pilgrimage to the Ancient Machines"
BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_ancient_machines_desc:0 "The cultists are finally willing to let Viira lay eyes on some of the strange relics under their protection. They say they have guarded a large collection of ancient devices for generations, and that the mysterious machines were gifts from their god."
BAR_power_machines:0 "Power Up Machines"
BAR_power_machines_desc:0 "Viira cannot deny that these machines are truly astonishing and unlike anything she has ever seen before. She clearly sees the potential contained in these machines, and chooses to activate them to make use of their potential."
BAR_closer_look:0 "Closer Look"
BAR_closer_look_desc:0 "Viira cannot deny that these machines are truly astonishing and unlike anything she has ever seen before. Rather than risk disturbing them, she chooses to closely observe the machines and record their design."
BAR_listen_to_whispers:0 "Listen to Whispers"
BAR_listen_to_whispers_desc:0 "Sometimes, when all else is silent, Viira hears something; faint voices at the edge of her perception. Strange thoughts are entering her mind, thoughts that are not her own. Somehow, forgotten knowledge is seeping in..."
BAR_minimal_undead_autonomy:0 "Thinking Undead"
BAR_minimal_undead_autonomy_desc:0 "Silver Star has long found skeletons somewhat disturbing, but he has been making an effort to overcome this fear. In order to make the most of his undead servants, he has decided to grant them a degree of autonomy as they fulfill their tasks."
BAR_undead_overseers:0 "Undead Overseers"
BAR_undead_overseers_desc:0 "Some undead possess greater cognitive capabilities and leadership qualities than others. Such undead are valuable assets, and should be used to keep the rest in line. This will free up Silver Star and allow him to focus on his important research."
BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks:0 "Simplify Factory Tasks..."
BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our undead factory workforce is not performing well at all. They are incapable of following the simplest instructions! It seems we need to make things even simpler for them before they are capable of operating at the level we require."
BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_leopold_help:0 "...Or Use Mechanical Aid"
BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_leopold_help_desc:0 "Our undead factory workforce is not performing up to Silver Star's expectations. Fortunately, Leopold indicates that he may be able to help with the matter. He has suggested that some of the more complex factory tasks might be automated, and even proposed designs for the machines."
BAR_streamline_production:0 "Streamline Production"
BAR_streamline_production_desc:0 "Thanks to our adaptations, the output of undead-operated factories is soaring! The process of industrialising the country continues to move forward. Another brilliant contribution to Barrad from the magnanimous Silver Star."
BAR_architectural_thought:0 "Temple Construction"
BAR_architectural_thought_desc:0 "Asinti demands the building of a grand new temple where he will be able to conduct further research into cross-world communion and summoning. We must do as he asks. After all, he is extremely wise, being privy to knowledge denied to other mortals."
BAR_bring_architects_zebra:0 "Zebra Architects"
BAR_bring_architects_zebra_desc:0 "Asinti still has great fondness for the building style of his kin. For his temple, nothing other than zebra architects will do! It should be a simple matter to lure in some foolish Kásans with promises of riches if they aid us."
BAR_bring_architects_deets:0 "Deer Architects"
BAR_bring_architects_deets_desc:0 "For this construction, there is no need to remain bound by tradition. Deer buildings are compact and efficient, and using their style would bring a certain elegance to the temple. A quick trip to Austurland is all it would take to "persuade" a few deer to help us out."
BAR_local_resources:0 "Local Resources"
BAR_local_resources_desc:0 "Acquiring the capital needed for the temple will be slightly difficult, as it seems Ambrosius can't be bothered to assist at all. No matter, we can get all the resources we need simply by making use of the land. Let's get digging!"
BAR_foreign_resources:0 "Foreign Resources"
BAR_foreign_resources_desc:0 "Acquiring the capital needed for the temple will be slightly difficult, as it seems Ambrosius can't be bothered to assist at all. We must look outward for a way to attain the resources we need. This is going to require quite the sales pitch..."
BAR_bring_architects_ponies:0 "Pony Decorating"
BAR_bring_architects_ponies_desc:0 "There is no shortage of ponies in Barrad who would be more than capable of applying the finishing touches to the temple. While it might not be the flashiest, the job will get done on time."
BAR_bring_architects_griffons:0 "Griffon Decorating"
BAR_bring_architects_griffons_desc:0 "Although finding skilled candidates may be difficult, griffon aesthetic sensibilities would greatly elevate the grandeur of the temple. We must do all we can to locate qualified griffons for the job."
BAR_living_rock:0 "Living Rock"
BAR_living_rock_desc:0 "The temple is complete! Although, while constructing it, workers stumbled across something truly bizarre. It appears some of the rock they were tunneling into is alive and has a will of its own! Asinti is completely baffled by this living rock; perhaps one of his colleagues might have some insight?"

### Chapter 4 ###
BAR_progress_is_being_made:0 "Progress is Made"
BAR_progress_is_being_made_desc:0 "Preparations are complete and construction is finally ready to begin in earnest. Soon the reactor will be complete, and Barrad will be launched into a new age. Very soon..."
BAR_party_never_stops:0 "Party Never Stops"
BAR_party_never_stops_desc:0 "It seems some particularly insolent fools have expressed exhaustion at the pace of the Count's festivities. Who are they to tell Ambrosius what to do? It's over when he says it's over, and this party is just getting started!"
BAR_initial_spark:0 "Initial Spark"
BAR_initial_spark_desc:0 "At long last, construction of the reactor is nearly complete. In a short while the device's first tests will be ready to begin, a momentous occasion for all those who worked to bring this wondrous creation to life."
BAR_strike_the_earth_focus:0 "Strike the Earth!"
BAR_strike_the_earth_focus_desc:0 "Our previous underground excursions up to this point have yielded very little, probably because we have not descended far enough. However, Leopold has devised a plan for us to dig deeper than any creatures have before! Who knows what secrets we might uncover?"
BAR_strike_the_earth_focus_tooltip:0 "We shall begin a deep underground mining expedition."
BAR_clockwerk_dev:0 "Gears and Bolts"
BAR_clockwerk_dev_desc:0 "Leopold's clockwork machines are currently seen as mere curiosities without practical value, but this will not always be the case. Further development will greatly improve their function and design, opening up new worlds of possibilities."
BAR_clockwerk_dev_reactor:0 "Simple autonomous clockworks can help with maintaining the reactor."
BAR_clockwerk_military:0 "Military Applications for Clockworks"
BAR_clockwerk_military_desc:0 "Clockworks do not sleep. They do not hunger for food or thirst for water. They never lose morale. They always follow orders. In short, they are the perfect soldiers!"
BAR_clockwerk_workers:0 "Non-Specialised Clockworks"
BAR_clockwerk_workers_desc:0 "Rather than overspecialising and narrowing the areas in which clockworks can operate, it would be best to design them to be smart and versatile. Such adaptable machines will greatly help Leopold in his research."
BAR_clockwerk_industrial:0 "Industrial Applications for Clockworks"
BAR_clockwerk_industrial_desc:0 "Machines are capable of performing far more work than a pony, far more efficiently. We must leverage the labour of these clockworks and put them to work in Barrad's factories!"
BAR_sanctuary_for_poor:0 "Sanctuary for the Weak"
BAR_sanctuary_for_poor_desc:0 "Asinti has a vision for a better society, where all creatures live in peace and equality. One where none are slaves! Already, thousands are flocking to become part of this new utopia."
BAR_reactor_integration:0 "Device Integration"
BAR_reactor_integration_desc:0 "We can reap many benefits by connecting our grand temple to the nearly complete reactor. Perhaps combining the two will even enhance our understanding of the reactor's nature?"
BAR_has_builded_temple:0 "Started construction of the temple."
BAR_separate_entity:0 "Separate Entity"
BAR_separate_entity_desc:0 "Although our grand temple and the nearly complete reactor are in close proximity, these two great engineering wonders should remain separated. Many would have disapproved of the effort, anyway."
BAR_undead_army:0 "Hidden Potential"
BAR_undead_army_desc:0 "Silver Star is pleased with the performance of his undead servants, so much so that he wishes to create a true undead army! Their potential is great, sure to surpass all feeble efforts of the living."
BAR_commanding_constructs:0 "Commanding Constructs"
BAR_commanding_constructs_desc:0 "The common undead soldier, for all their ferocity, lacks the tactical mind required for complex planning and manoeuvring. Specialised undead must be created and empowered with the skills needed to command the army."
BAR_bind_undead_to_undead:0 "Binding Net"
BAR_bind_undead_to_undead_desc:0 "Different undead may have different gifts and capabilities, but they share a common purpose all the same. Soldier and commander shall be bound together, so that all will obey Silver Star's command."
BAR_freedom_with_limits:0 "Freedom With Limits"
BAR_freedom_with_limits_desc:0 "In order to operate effectively in the field, undead troops must be able to adapt to rapidly changing situations and respond appropriately. Soldiers and commanders shall be given this leeway during battle. However, this autonomy will not extend far beyond the resolution of the engagement."
BAR_undead_command_chain:0 "Chain of Command"
BAR_undead_command_chain_desc:0 "Any army needs a well-defined command hierarchy, and an undead army is no different. It must be organised so that Silver Star can make it clear to all how he expects his orders to be carried out."

BAR_beggining_of_end_desc:0 "What undead uprising would be complete without a little fire and brimstone?"
BAR_new_barrad:0 "A New Barrad"

BAR_fate_of_asinti_desc:0 "The occult zebra shaman. What shall become of him?"

BAR_undead_horde_focus:0 "Undead Horde"
BAR_undead_horde_focus_desc:0 "Our neighbors are ignorant and horrified by the prospect of undeath. We must quickly rally an army and destroy them before they can do the same to us. While this means the overall quality of our undead will be lower, there are some advantages to having unthinking and unfeeling creatures to command."

BAR_undead_nation_tooltip:0 "I was denied right to rule at life, now in death my realm shall begin."
BAR_who_needs_guns:0 "Alternative Weapons"
BAR_who_needs_guns_desc:0 "It is a simple fact that many undead soldiers in our horde lack the ability to operate firearms. Instead of viewing this as a detriment, we should realise the potential for more... crude methods to be equally effective."
BAR_no_guns_no_problem:0 "No Guns? No Problem!"
BAR_undead_workshops:0 "Undead Workshops"
BAR_undead_workshops_desc:0 "The undead are ceaseless. They never tire, they never eat, they never drink. The undead never complain, and they can perform the most monotonous of tasks perfectly. Every. Single. Time."
BAR_every_dead_protect_their_lich:0 "Everydead Protects Their Lich"
BAR_every_dead_protect_their_lich_desc:0 "Liches are powerful and intelligent creatures, fulfilling the same role lesser nobles would. Unfortunately they are just as tempermental too. If provided modest comforts and adequately protected however, they can perform what few tasks they have spectacularly."
BAR_march_into_wittenlands:0 "March into the Riverlands"
BAR_march_into_wittenlands_desc:0 "The time to strike is now. A pre-emptive and decisive war will ensure our safety, and allow us to share our gift with the entirety of Eastern Griffonia."
BAR_unstopapable_force:0 "Unstoppable Force"
BAR_unstopapable_force_desc:0 "No matter how unending our forces are and well trained they may be, we are still a fledgling nation facing off against half a continent. Perhaps a small... nudge would assist our forces."
BAR_undead_mass_assult:0 "Endless Legions"
BAR_undead_mass_assult_desc:0 "What point is there to fighting when your enemy has more bodies than you have bullets? With our armies bolstered every time a foe falls in battle, we are sure to achieve victory thanks to our overwhelming numbers."
BAR_undead_mass_guns:0 "Weapons for Our Needs"
BAR_undead_mass_guns_desc:0 "Even the most inexperienced or decayed of undead should still be adequately equipped. We must make the mass production of arms our foremost priority."

BAR_undead_nation:0 "A Nation That Cannot Die"
BAR_undead_nation_desc:0 "If we truly wish to distinguish ourselves as a nation of undead we must not act in haste or fear. Only by creating new weapons and tactics, with a strong economy to back them up, will we be able to prevail over our foes."
BAR_hierarchical_society:0 "Hierarchical Society"
BAR_hierarchical_society_desc:0 "Now that the commoners want for nothing, dangerously egalitarian ideas are beginning to arise. Even the dullest farmers are seriously considering intellectual study, and the abolishing of physical labor. We must remind them that Barrad will always need ditch diggers before we suddenly find ourselves ruling over a nation of lazy poets."
BAR_critical_allocation:0 "Critical Allocation"
BAR_critical_allocation_desc:0 "Even with modernization efforts Barrad has always lagged behind the Riverlands in industrial capacity. By liquidating the Barradian treasury we could construct even more factories, and perhaps finally match the Riverlands bullet for bullet."
BAR_divide_country:0 "Dividing the Country"
BAR_divide_country_desc:0 "Many of our citizens have found themselves suddenly displaced with their newfound undeath, their trades and skills having been rendered worthless. Reorganizing an entire country's labor force will be difficult and unpopular, but well worth the effort."
BAR_workers_caste:0 "Workers Caste"
BAR_workers_caste_desc:0 "Barrad's considerable population of farmers have suddenly found their skills and products completely unwanted. This untapped and untiring workforce could be easily retrained for other labor intensive tasks."
BAR_constant_shift:0 "The Neverending Shift"
BAR_constant_shift_desc:0 "There are many perks to having an undead workforce, not the least of which is their ability to continuously work at all hours without need for rest or replacement."
BAR_land_terraformation:0 "Widespread Terraforming"
BAR_land_terraformation_desc:0 "It's no secret that Barrad's unique climate and geography has rendered rural development extremely difficult. Now that our workers are no longer affected by the oppressive heat or year-long blizzards however, we can finally make the more remote regions of Barrad useful."
BAR_new_bulding_standard:0 "New Building Standards"
BAR_new_bulding_standard_desc:0 "Our newly trained workforce are still not entirely used to their jobs, occasionally forgetting to add minor things like paint, flooring, and load-bearing walls. Standardized building designs and procedures should help to iron out this issue and radically decrease building collapses."
BAR_economy_to_protect:0 "The War Economy"
BAR_economy_to_protect_desc:0 "Despite the increase in public works projects a considerable part of our population remain unemployed. With plans already being drafted to mobilize against our neighbors, perhaps an increase in military spending would achieve nationwide full employment."
BAR_science_caste:0 "Science Caste"
BAR_science_caste_desc:0 "Many of Barrad's brightest minds have had their intelligence dimmed by their transformation or lacking the motivation to work at all. New blood will be needed to continue our technological ascendency."
BAR_freedom_of_thought:0 "Freedom of Thought..."
BAR_freedom_of_thought_desc:0 "Limitation kills creation. Without a greater increase in autonomy or the freedom to pursue what drives them, how can we ever hope for our scientists to achieve anything?"
BAR_under_tight_supervision:0 "...Under Supervision"
BAR_under_tight_supervision_desc:0 "Unrestrained brilliance, however valuable, is also incredibly volatile. An unexpected attempt to seize power, while certainly doomed to fail, could prove fatal if attempted at a critical moment. Trusted overseers must be put in place to snuff out revolutionary notions and guide our brightest minds towards productive endeavors."
BAR_scientific_consciousness:0 "Scientific Consciousness"
BAR_scientific_consciousness_desc:0 "With our science caste now thoroughly organized and administrated the only thing left to do is provide the facilities and methods to discover breakthroughs... perhaps the lesser Pentarchy's towers can be repurposed."
BAR_war_caste:0 "War Caste"
BAR_war_caste_desc:0 "There was already fierce debate in the military on how best to adapt tactics and strategies to an increasingly modern world. Now that casualties and logistics are no longer issues, even the most forward-thinking ideas appear to be woefully dated."
BAR_organise_high_command:0 "Restructuring the High Command"
BAR_organise_high_command_desc:0 "Much of the old guard has thrown in the towel, unwilling or unable to adapt to the new circumstance that have been thrust upon them. There are many promising commanders in our military who would be happy to take their place."
BAR_undead_officers:0 "Undead Officers"
BAR_undead_officers_desc:0 "The new blood have already begun adapting to the rigors of commanding entire armies. But there is still the matter of who should have sweeping authority to command our entire forces. It will take time to find the most loyal and capable candidates."
BAR_army_structures:0 "Modern Army Structures"
BAR_army_structures_desc:0 "While many of the issues that make large standing armies unfeasible no longer apply to us, we must still ensure that each and every one of our soldiers is well equipped and able to function as part of a unit."

BAR_undead_spec_ops:0 "The Special Operations Division"
BAR_undead_spec_ops_desc:0 "Our special forces should not be exempted from the military overhaul we have undertaken. With a modern command structure, small mobile forces can work in harmony to achieve goals entire divisions would struggle to accomplish."

BAR_potential_new_enemies:0 "Potential Enemies"

BAR_old_enemies:0 "Old Enemies"
BAR_old_enemies_desc:0 "Wittenland was once Silver Star's home. Before paranoia and persecution drove him into exile. Now, the most powerful creature in existence, Silver Star can finally claim his rightful place on the Wittenland throne."
BAR_deepest_fear:0 "Deepest Fear"
BAR_deepest_fear_desc:0 "As powerful as Silver Star now is, even he cannot overcome a sickness of the mind. The Griffon Cossacks which drove Silver Star down the path of darkness still lurk in his dreams and haunt his daily thoughts. We must eliminate the root of the problem if this waking nightmare is ever going to end!"

BAR_take_down_the_coalition:0 "Take Down the Coalition"

BAR_barrad_great_wall:0 "The Great Wall"
BAR_barrad_great_wall_desc:0 "While our armies have been every expansionistic as of late, it would be wise to enact measures to keep our newfound gains. By constructing an immense line of fortifications, and with our undead soldiers keeping a restless vigil, we will become nigh invulnerable to any foreign threats."
BAR_skelt_rifles:0 "Reinventing the Rifle"
BAR_skelt_rifles_desc:0 "Our current generation of rifles have many superfluous quality of life designs. Removing these would substantially cut down on design complexity and material use."
BAR_army_that_never_stops:0 "The Long March"
BAR_army_that_never_stops_desc:0 "The greatest threat to our forces is large networks of fortifications and trenches. Unless we pursue or maneuver around our enemy before they have the opportunity to re-entrench themselves, any breakthroughs in the front line will not last long."
BAR_industrial_potential:0 "Industrial Potential"
BAR_industrial_potential_desc:0 "Although our economy is far better than it once was, it is still inefficient. Many workers are doing the same task at the same time as several other workers, and only succeed in getting in each other's way. New facilities will ensure our workers have productive jobs."
BAR_undead_airports:0 "Barrad Airports"
BAR_undead_airports_desc:0 "Modern warfare has had an increasing emphasis on aerial superiority. The strategic and tactical possibilities of annihilating enemies from above is incredible, and plans for a new airfield are already underway to give us access to the skies above."
BAR_undead_fighters:0 "Conquer the Sky"
BAR_undead_fighters_desc:0 "Unfortunately, none of the advantages of being undead apply to aerial warfare. Only the latest aeronautical innovations will give us a decisive advantage over our enemies."
BAR_undead_bombers:0 "Burn the Ground"
BAR_undead_bombers_desc:0 "While air supremacy can provide incredible advantages, fighters can only do so much on their own. More advanced bombers carrying larger payloads can apply direct pressure onto enemy forces."
BAR_armoured_experiments:0 "Armoured Experiments"
BAR_armoured_experiments_desc:0 "The demands of our new war doctrine should be fulfilled by new technology. Armored vehicles will not only let us pursue enemy forces, but completely overrun them. Their large caliber guns will also be a potent tool against heavily entrenched forces."
BAR_heavy_armour:0 "Heavy Equipment"
BAR_heavy_armour_desc:0 "Initial trials have begun for a slow, but heavily armed and armored tank design. These tanks, much like our soldiers, will be extremely hardy, and nigh invulnerable to conventional weaponry."
BAR_tanks_made_for_undead:0 "Designed for the Dead"
BAR_tanks_made_for_undead_desc:0 "Initial Barradian tank design has been greatly influenced by Leopold's mechanical experiments. But tools are only useful if they are designed with the user in mind. We should stop relying on the griffon's prior work and feild something created by the undead, for the undead."
BAR_doctrine_of_terror:0 "Doctrine of Terror"
BAR_doctrine_of_terror_desc:0 "The living fear us, and although we aren't the monsters they think we are, there is no reason for them to know that. Conducting a mass terror campaign will mean investing in new communication methods, but the effort will be worth it just to see the look on their faces."
BAR_prepared_for_everything:0 "Prepared for Everything"
BAR_prepared_for_everything_desc:0 "Why should we go and confront our enemies on the field of battle? Our forces have a decisive and unobtainable advantage in attritional warfare. Our foes should be the ones to dash their troops against unbreakable lines!"
BAR_undead_support_comp:0 "Support Companies"
BAR_undead_support_comp_desc:0 "While logistical issues have been greatly simplified, there are still reports of soldiers been given too little equipment for too many tasks. Abolishing mixed training and instead creating highly specialized units will further simplify logistics and increase the fighting effectiveness of our divisions."
BAR_undead_arty:0 "Close Range Bombardment"
BAR_undead_arty_desc:0 "Without flesh to flay or blood to bleed, our troops cannot be affected by the shrapnel and debris created by heavier artillery pieces."
BAR_high_staff_education:0 "High Staff Education"
BAR_high_staff_education_desc:0 "Our generals have performed remarkably well despite having no formal military backgrounds. There is always room for improvement however. Some military theory will teach them the finer points of military engagement."
BAR_slow_and_steady:0 "Slow and Steady"
BAR_slow_and_steady_desc:0 "When enemy forces inevitably crash against our frontline, our soldiers must reamin calm and resourceful under pressure. They must trust with every fiber of their being that they cannot die twice."
BAR_new_arsenal:0 "New Arsenal"
BAR_new_arsenal_desc:0 "Our scientists have begun investigating the usage of restricted and outlawed weaponry. Weapons too dangerous to use without fear of mass, self-inflicted casualties. But some of these weapons may not be very dangerous at all. At least not to us."
BAR_harsh_mining:0 "Harsh Mining"
BAR_harsh_mining_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, we've not been able to convince the miners to abandon many of their now unnecessary safety measures.

BAR_undead_infrastructure:0 "New Infrastructure"
BAR_undead_infrastructure_desc:0 "The wilderness of Barrad is difficult to navigate at the best of times. It is time at last to replace the sprawl of poorly maintained trails with a streamlined network of roads and rails."
BAR_reconstruct_country:0 "Pre-emptive Reconstruction"
BAR_reconstruct_country_desc:0 "Although no longer an issue, Silver Star's show of power immediately prior to his reign devastated Barrad's infrastructure, requiring several months of arduous labor to fully repair. Should a similiar incident occur, it would be wise to already have measures in place to repair any totally destroyed infrastructure."
BAR_undead_mil_fact:0 "Additional War Funds"
BAR_undead_mil_fact_desc:0 "The vast swaths of land, formerly owned by haughty nobles or lowly farmers, still remain untapped and unused since Silver Star took power. Recent mobilization efforts have demanded an increase of war production, and these fertile grounds have already been considered for redevelopment."
BAR_undead_civ_fact:0 "Consumer Market"
BAR_undead_civ_fact_desc:0 "As our nation grows our reliance on heavy industry grows with it. Unless we increase production of construction materials and electronics we may find our growth unexpectedly stunted."
BAR_undead_society:0 "Undead Society"
BAR_undead_society_desc:0 "While we still have much growing to do, our nation is now the equal of many other countries on the Griffonian continent and beyond. If we continue down the path we're on, there is little doubt we will soon surpass even the most advanced of nations!"

BAR_a_price_to_be_paid_desc:0 "When the Old Asinti is gone, there will be a price to be paid. There is the new Asinti though, and this one will become the Demon King. No more weakness, only strength and freedom as I lead Barrad to the victory!"

BAR_leopold_party_crasher:0 "The Party's Over"
BAR_leopold_party_crasher_desc:0 "While Ambrosius may have kept his seat of power in name, every creature in Barrad knows who really runs the state. As Leopold solidifies his grip on power, Ambrosius becomes anxious. And with each day that goes, Leopold is ready to take the final step."

BAR_leopold_old_industrial_method:0 "New Work Models"
BAR_leopold_old_industrial_method_desc:0 "The old industrial methods are not suitable for a growing nation, one that has needs for innovation and higher rates of production. If we cannot have as many factories are our enemies, then let each one of ours produce three times the numbers of theirs!"

BAR_leopold_factories:0 "New Industry Sectors"
BAR_leopold_factories_desc:0 "Across Barrad there are those who frown upon working in factories, toiling on machines and preferring instead their magics. For a griffon like Leopold, this disrespect of iron and steel shall not stand. Let them learn the might of machines as they work double shifts!"

BAR_leopold_new_tanks:0 "The Beasts Of War"
BAR_leopold_new_tanks_desc:0 "As the world ever shifts so do the tools we use for war, with the advent of the tank so too must our doctrines of war change with them.

BAR_leopold_doctrine:0 "The Modern War"
BAR_leopold_doctrine_desc:0 "Only through the might of firepower are wars won, you may throw all the ponies and griffons you want at a line, yet enough lead will kill any beast. Only through the power of tanks, artillery and bullets will we have enough black powder and lead to end our foes. They may call us dishonorable, but this will only be written on their tombstones."

BAR_leopold_doctrine2:0 "Hammer and Anvil"
BAR_leopold_doctrine2_desc:0 "With finer artillery pieces being made available to us, it is high time we refine our troops as well. The infantry shall be the anvil holding the enemy down, while our bombardments hammer the enemy to ash and dust."

BAR_leopold_improved_tanks:0 "The Beasts Of War"
BAR_leopold_improved_tanks_desc:0 "As days turns to months, our tanks become more outdated by the minute.

Only with the finest armour will we make it."

BAR_leopold_magical_tanks:0 "Magical Tanks"
BAR_leopold_magical_tanks_desc:0 "Steel and magic, a holy combination that is more than the sum of its parts. While some nations may enjoy their steel beasts, ours will be the leap that crushes them. With our future armour secured as the finest, no one will stand in our path anymore."

With this knowledge he has gotten his workers to build a new factory over a crystal deposit, though at the speed they work they might as well be working two factories in one! This will surely aid the war effort."

BAR_leopold_clear_crystal:0 "Magical Prospecting"
BAR_leopold_clear_crystal_desc:0 "With innovation, comes yet more innovation. As our demand for crystals has increased, so too have our ideas become ever more creative. Some earth pony shamans have found that if you put enchanted sticks together in the shape of a Y, they will shake when near a crystal deposit. While crude, it does get the work done."

BAR_leopold_new_clockwerks:0 "The Clockwork Horde"
BAR_leopold_new_clockwerks_desc:0 "Tick, tock. Our enemies will soon find that they have been outmatched, outfought and outmade. Their flesh will not protect them from our steel claws, their cover will not guard them from a torrent of magic ripping through their lines. Their tanks' armour will serve only as a grip for Leopold to grab, as he throws them to the wind."

BAR_leopold_push_the_boundaries:0 "Waking The Titan"
BAR_leopold_push_the_boundaries_desc:0 "Under us has been power beyond mortals imagination, ancient mechanisms that no living creature has fought. As our drills and picks crack this treasure open, Leopold can only feel bad for the rest of the world."

BAR_leopold_let_hate_flow:0 "Burn Them Down"
BAR_leopold_let_hate_flow_desc:0 "Metal cools a griff, turns him to ice in front of the stresses of life. As Barrad is surronded by foes, the pain from being as much machine as he is flesh is starting to take its toll on Leopold. No longer does he smile, or joke, it's all statecraft and war for him. His latest order was simple, take and burn until it is done."

BAR_can_raid_for_giggles:0 "Burn it all, break their things, smash their stores. They will not hold against our superior force."


BAR_leopold_magic_weapons:0 "Magic Weapons"
BAR_leopold_magic_weapons_desc:0 "Our researchers have begun working with the mages, hopefully their work together will lead to new advancements in the field of Thaumtech. We will have the edge against our enemies in the end."

BAR_leopold_magic_arty:0 "Greater Artillery"
BAR_leopold_magic_arty_desc:0 "With our current artillery cannons, we cannot even hope to outpace our enemies. If we wish to bomb them to the ground then we'll need better cannons, better ammo and finer rangefinders. To this end Leopold has allowed the use of magic to enhance their artillery pieces."

BAR_leopold_magic_arty_bonus:0 "Magic Artillery Pieces"
BAR_leopold_magic_arty_bonus_desc:0 "With the newly allowed use of magic within artillery, our finest mages and scientists have worked together to create new ammo for our weapons more powerful than ever before. With this, there will be no other enemy that can compete with us. There is no other nation as magically advanced as Barrad."

BAR_leopold_inf_eq:0 "Investments Into Infantry"
BAR_leopold_inf_eq_desc:0 "As our armies require more boots on the ground, magic cannot be our only weapon against our foes. This was the downfall of the Pentarchy, but Leopold will not follow in their steps. Proper training, equipment and discipline will lead us to victory."

BAR_leopold_magic_magic_infantry:0 "Crystal Bullets Are Magic"
BAR_leopold_magic_magic_infantry_desc:0 "With ever increasing co-operation between mages and scientists, some have begun to work together in ways that go above and beyond their missions. After the combination of artillery and magic, some began experimenting with new ways to combine rifles and magic. Using crystals in the bullets as magical shrapnel. Even if you don't hit your enemy, you are hitting something."

BAR_leopold_subdue_pentarchy:0 "Subduing the Pentarchy"
BAR_leopold_subdue_pentarchy_desc:0 "Subduing the Pentarchy will be the next step before their fall, few will survive and none may thrive. For now they will be kept in an advisory role, until the stage is set for their removal."

BAR_leopold_old_friend:0 "Old Friends"
BAR_leopold_old_friend_desc:0 "Some of the Pentarchy weren't always so awful to Leopold, he even considered a few of them his friends. And honestly? When it comes to friends, why not let bygones be bygones?"

BAR_leopold_old_enemies:0 "Old Enemies"
BAR_leopold_old_enemies_desc:0 "But in the end, most were despicable. Those that were will not be shown mercy, they will not be given a graceful end. Let this be a reminder to Barrad of what happens to those who go against Leopolds will."

BAR_safety_first_desc:0 "There is an obscure faith which has long remained hidden, operating on the fringes of society. I walked among them myself in the past.

BAR_organise_servants:0 "Organise Servants"
BAR_organise_servants_desc:0 "My followers are presently scattered all across the country, operating mostly independently. This will not do at all! They must be carefully watched and guided, for their own good, of course."
BAR_segregation:0 "Segregation"
BAR_segregation_desc:0 "Society under the Mad Count was far too messy and chaotic, I could hardly stand it! The population is in desperate need of structure. Its groups must be broken out and kept separate, so everything stays neat and tidy."
BAR_dictate_new_rules:0 "Dictate New Rules"
BAR_dictate_new_rules_desc:0 "Let it be known that the Pentarchy is gone, along with its tolerance for petty squabbling and dissention. I am the sole ruler of this land, and my will is law!"
BAR_embrace_new_nature:0 "Embrace New Nature"
BAR_embrace_new_nature_desc:0 "This land is home to wonderous phenomena not seen anywhere else in the world. The people must learn to live within the climate instead of trying to flee from it. This blessing is something to be exploited, not feared!"

BAR_psi_controll:0 "Make Up Their Minds"
BAR_psi_controll_desc:0 "It is easy to manipulate the thoughts of the ignorant when you know what switches to flip, as I do. It will be a subtle thing at first, but eventually every living thing will be mine. Mind, body, and soul..."
BAR_aquire_coast:0 "Acquire Coastline"
BAR_aquire_coast_desc:0 "Further development of the country is stunted by its lack of access to the ocean. The pathetic zebras to the south are all that stands between me and a new universe of opportunities, unfortunately for them."
BAR_delve_into_the_network:0 "Barradian Networking"
BAR_delve_into_the_network_desc:0 "In ages past, my servant experimented with constructing organic computing machines. These turned out to be failed experiments, ultimately, but there is still value in delving deeper into this bizarre network and studying its strange properties."
BAR_reunion_with_her_kins:0 "Family Reunion"
BAR_reunion_with_her_kins_desc:0 "Long ago, I left my home in search of knowledge, the knowledge of how to master the crude matter of this world so that deer could take their rightful place within it. I have succeeded, and it is now time to bring the gift of magical rule to my kin!"
BAR_exotic_knowledge:0 "Exotic Knowledge"
BAR_exotic_knowledge_desc:0 "I walked paths all others feared to tread, and uncovered mysteries which vexed the ponies of this land for centuries. After absorbing such esoteric secrets, no area of study is beyond my ability to master."
BAR_interesting_opportunity:0 "Interesting Opportunity"
BAR_interesting_opportunity_desc:0 "In the past, I once journeyed to the mountains and saw the griffon communities living there. The Count foolishly allowed these griffons to flaunt his authority and contribute nothing to larger society. I will not be making the same mistake."
BAR_spark_the_machines:0 "Spark the Machines"
BAR_spark_the_machines_desc:0 "Perhaps the ancient machines are not failures after all? These machines, although disturbing to stand near, have extraordinary capabilities that could not be fully harnessed before now. It is time we made use of them."
BAR_viira_ambitions:0 "Great Ambition"
BAR_viira_ambitions_desc:0 "I have accomplished much since first arriving in Barrad, yet still I feel unsatisfied. Although I am the master of this domain, I know I am destined for even greater things. Soon, the entire world will recognise my power..."
BAR_viira_manpower01:0 "Subdue the Ponies"
BAR_viira_manpower01_desc:0 "To the north lie the Riverponies, the greatest threat to my rule. I grow tired of their arrogance. Those cowards are blind to the truth of power, or the price that must be paid to attain it. I will humble them and show them this truth."
BAR_viira_manpower10:0 "Subdue the Griffons"
BAR_viira_manpower10_desc:0 "The lands to the west are filled with foolhardy griffons. Such creatures have a propensity for destructive infighting. This instability is unacceptable so near to my domain, and will need to be corrected."

BAR_viira_cult_mil_knowledge:0 "The Cult of Military Knowledge"

BAR_viira_mountain_tanks:0 "Mountainous Tanks"
BAR_viira_mountain_tanks_desc:0 "To those who lack imagination, the idea of a mountainous tank sounds absurd. However, my brilliance has enabled me to devise a new type of war machine, capable of dominating mountain engagements while at the same time being nimble enough to traverse the terrain."
BAR_viira_arty:0 "Big Guns"
BAR_viira_arty_desc:0 "Artillery is a vital component of any modern army. These heavy weapons can hurl destruction over long distances, with incredible lethality. My forces must be properly supported by mortars if they are to be effective."
BAR_viira_full_scale_warfare:0 "Conventional Warfare"
BAR_viira_full_scale_warfare_desc:0 "I will never shrink from battle with the enemy army, I will face them head-on and crush them! This will inspire my soldiers, and as the ruler of a mighty realm, anything less is absolutely unacceptable."
BAR_viira_asymetrical_warfare:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
BAR_viira_asymetrical_warfare_desc:0 "Sometimes, the smartest strategy is not fighting the enemy head-on. By biding my time and only striking when opportunity presents itself, I can exploit the enemy's weaknesses and achieve victory with the greatest possible efficiency."

BAR_viira_a_free_state:0 "The "Free State""
BAR_viira_a_free_state_desc:0 "Now that the zebras have been crushed, it is time to show them the folly of their insolence. They fought for so long in the name of their vaunted freedom, only to see it taken from them in the end."

BAR_true_herald:0 "The True Herald"
BAR_true_herald_desc:0 "Although Viira has seen the light and been graced with the title of Chosen, there was another, long before: Count Ambrosius. The Count has heard the whispers of the divine and enacted Its will for decades! No doubt, he deserves to retain his place at the head of the nation."
BAR_call_non_believers:0 "Call on Non-Believers"
BAR_call_non_believers_desc:0 "As it prepares to enter into a glorious new age, there is no more need for Barrad to maintain the structure of the Pentarchy.

BAR_protectors_of_new_age:0 "Protectors of a New Age"
BAR_protectors_of_new_age_desc:0 "It was a long and difficult journey, but the long night is over. Barrad's salvation has arrived at last. And so it is our sacred duty to heed the words of our saviour, and defend our soil to the last drop of blood!"

BAR_resources_of_future:0 "Resources of the Future"

BAR_amb_fac:0 "Forced Workforce"
BAR_amb_fac_desc:0 "If we are to meet the challenges ahead, every able-bodied Barradian must be put to work immediately working in or constructing factories. Forced labour may not be pleasant, but it is a necessity."
BAR_amb_dev_up:0 "Forced Organisation"
BAR_amb_dev_up_desc:0 "Our economy is in dire need of advancement and development, not a quick fix that will only temporarily increase production. A complete reorganising of the economy is necessary, and although the results will not be immediate, they will be lasting."

BAR_contact_him_desc:0 "In far-flung corners across Barrad, there are whispers of a shadowy artifact broker who offers magical items with incredible powers, for a price. We must track down this merchant and see what he has to offer us..."
BAR_pentarchy_friends:0 "Our Noble Friends"
BAR_pentarchy_friends_desc:0 "We must meet with the nobles of Barrad and see where they stand. We cannot have them plotting against the Count at a time like this. Although, surely none of them would be foolish enough to contemplate something like that!"
BAR_cult_shisma:0 "Cult Schism"
BAR_cult_shisma_desc:0 "There have been reports of greater unrest in areas where a certain mysterious cult has been known to operate. Hopefully, we can put a stop to these squabbles before they grow into something more dangerous."

BAR_autonomus_land_promise_desc:0 "Henceforth, the autonomy of the communities of the southwestern mountains shall be guaranteed, and the griffons there will have the power to manage their own affairs in the way they see fit.

BAR_homeland_promise:0 "Homeland Promise"
BAR_homeland_promise_desc:0 "The griffons in the mountains are exiles. Barrad is not their true home, but we will help them return to the lands to the west and build a free society."

BAR_create_griffon_legion:0 "Create the Griffon Legion"
BAR_create_griffon_legion_desc:0 "With the support of Barrad's griffon population, we now have a new pool from which to draw recruits. The mountain fighting capabilities of these soldiers is sure to come in handy."
BAR_griffon_legion:0 "Mountain griffons together with their friends abroad will form a Legion for us."
BAR_make_your_pledge:0 "Make Your Pledge"
BAR_make_your_pledge_desc:0 "We have a simple way to guarantee the loyalty of the nobility: all shall make a magical pledge to the Count affirming their fealty. If any were to break this vow, the results would... not be pleasant."
BAR_feed_the_masses:0 "Feed the Masses"
BAR_feed_the_masses_desc:0 "It's time to put the magical artifact so generously provided to us to use. Such a bountiful harvest will be sure to put a damper on dissatisfaction and civil unrest."

BAR_inner_circle_desc:0 "Those closest to the centre of the cult structure are the most dedicated and have been involved the longest, so they probably know what they're doing? Siding with them sounds like a safe bet."
BAR_inner_circle_tooltip:0 "Cult elite will join our cause."
BAR_outer_circle:0 "Outer Circle"
BAR_outer_circle_desc:0 "The rank and file cultists are obviously being misled and exploited by the cult elite! Instead of seeking riches, the Outer Circle are only concerned with finding universal truth. It is they who deserve our support."
BAR_outer_circle_tooltip:0 "Low ranked members will join our cause."
BAR_cult_peacekeepers:0 "Cult Peacekeepers"
BAR_cult_peacekeepers_desc:0 "Now that the rift within the organisation has been resolved, the cult can be used as a tool to help maintain order in Barrad. After all, it's only fair that they help us after we were kind enough to help them..."
BAR_matter_of_court:0 "Matters of the Court"
BAR_matter_of_court_desc:0 "It seems some are harbouring misapprehensions about their place in Barrad. Just because Ambrosius is away does not mean his will is liable to be undermined by ambitious upstarts. Let there be no ambiguity: the Count's authority is absolute."
BAR_trickery_experience:0 "A Lesson in Trickery"
BAR_trickery_experience_desc:0 "Throughout history, those dwelling in the mountains have proven to be very effective fighters. Especially when it comes to guerilla warfare. Perhaps our griffons could teach us a thing or two about tactics?"

BAR_heal_entity_desc:0 "Preparations are complete, the time has come. Gąsienica is called by Ambrosius to return to the reactor for the culmination of his life's work. With one act, perhaps everything wrong with Barrad can be set right?"
BAR_true_army:0 "A Real Army"
BAR_true_army_desc:0 "We must move beyond our chaotic, disorganised approach to national defence. No more warlords commanding their own personal forces. We shall have one Barradian army, with one single leader."
BAR_griffon_way:0 "The Griffon Way"
BAR_griffon_way_desc:0 "Griffon doctrine emphasises the importance of mobility and manoeuvring forces into positions where they can do the most possible damage. This unconventional approach to warfare may be the best fit for our army, given its current composition."
BAR_cultist_experience:0 "The Cultist Way"
BAR_cultist_experience_desc:0 "The cultists believe battles are best won using planning and preparation, and that our best hope of achieving victory over our enemies is by digging in and holding highly defensible positions. In this way, we can negate our disadvantages while forcing our opponents to fight on our terms."
BAR_old_pentarchy_way:0 "The Pentarchy Way"
BAR_old_pentarchy_way_desc:0 "By bringing overwhelming firepower to bear against our enemy, we can paralyze their perception of the battlefield and destroy their will to fight, winning the battle as soon as it begins.

BAR_mountain_tenk:0 "Light Tanks"
BAR_mountain_tenk_desc:0 "In recent years, there have been exciting advancements in armoured warfare that we are finally in a position to take advantage of. Tanks are wonderous machines that are totally resistant to small arms fire, and are capable of rolling over our enemies without suffering a scratch!"
BAR_mountain_maintance:0 "Barradian Technicians"
BAR_mountain_maintance_desc:0 "Although our new war machines are powerful, they require constant attention and maintenance in order to function effectively. We must train specialists to perform these necessary repairs and incorporate them into the army."
BAR_griff_mointaineers:0 "Griffon Mountaineers"

BAR_army_engineers:0 "Engineer Corps"
BAR_army_engineers_desc:0 "The effectiveness of an army is greatly aided by support from specialists who are capable of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of transport and communications.

BAR_army_tenk_rocket:0 "New Age Combat"
BAR_army_tenk_rocket_desc:0 "The future of warfare is upon us! Armoured forces and rocket artillery will form the backbone of Barrad's army if we are to survive into the modern age. We must embrace this new reality and begin developing new designs post-haste."
BAR_army_inf_arty:0 "Improve What We Know"
BAR_army_inf_arty_desc:0 "Instead of pursuing radical new designs, we should stick with improving the tried and true technologies we currently use. After all, traditional infantry weapons and artillery are far from perfected."
BAR_look_in_the_sky:0 "Eyes Towards the Sky"

BAR_air_fighter:0 "Develop Fighters"

BAR_air_bomber:0 "Develop Bombers"
BAR_air_bomber_desc:0 "The enormous potential of air power is plainly evident. Bombing has the ability to destroy enemy industry and break enemy morale, as well as provide battlefield support in tactical engagements. If we are to realise this potential, we need to start by designing bombers."
BAR_air_baccidents_prevention:0 "Accident Prevention"
BAR_air_baccidents_prevention_desc:0 "It is imperative that we implement safety practices to be used by Barradian organisations concerned with aviation. Aside from the loss of life, unnecessary destruction of expensive aircraft must be prevented!"
BAR_air_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Bombers"
BAR_air_strat_bombers_desc:0 "By striking at our enemies critical wartime industries, we can cripple their ability to supply troops in the field with equipment. To strike at these well-guarded locations and survive, we must improve the range and durability of our bombers."
BAR_air_cas:0 "Close Air Support"
BAR_air_cas_desc:0 "Although tactical bombers can be used in a close air support role, it would be advantageous to develop a specialised type of aircraft dedicated to performing airstrikes on enemy troops. This strike aircraft would be capable of carrying out precision ground attacks as well as surviving low-level air defences."
BAR_air_battle_support:0 "Friends in High Places"
BAR_air_battle_support_desc:0 "Support from aircraft has the potential to be the decisive factor in ground battles, and by making effective use of it we can tip the scales in our favour. We must train our pilots to coordinate closely with ground forces in order to provide support and protection."
BAR_air_strat_dest:0 "Strategic Destruction"
BAR_air_strat_dest_desc:0 "Not all wars are won on the battlefield. An enemy can also be defeated by destroying its morale and its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations."
BAR_rebuild_countryside:0 "Rebuild the Countryside"
BAR_rebuild_countryside_desc:0 "The infrastructure of rural Barrad was decimated by the cataclysm decades ago, and since then has been completely neglected. We can not allow this to continue. We must incorporate these creatures back into the whole of society!"

BAR_work_predispositions:0 "Work Predispositions"
BAR_work_predispositions_desc:0 "All ponies are naturally suited to certain professions over others. However, every Barradian is presently left to find their path on their own, without any structural assistance. Doing more to help guide ponies towards appropriate vocations would decrease unemployment and improve our economic situation."
BAR_river_system_transport:0 "River System Transport"
BAR_river_system_transport_desc:0 "Since the cataclysm, traders have had enormous difficulty hauling cargo through Barrad. It is vastly easier to travel over water than on land, and fully leveraging our nation's waterways would result in a far cheaper way to transport supplies across the country."
BAR_griffon_connections:0 "Griffon Connections"
BAR_griffon_connections_desc:0 "The griffons of Barrad are an invaluable resource we must draw on as we continue modernising. Their unique perspective will aid us in coming up with new advancements and innovations."

BAR_pentarchy_scholars_desc:0 "Many scholars remain in Barrad who remember the old Pentarchy well, and they amassed much knowledge while the other members were still alive. It is time these scholars were formally invited into Barrad's new order."
BAR_formalise_living_subjects:0 "Formalise Societal Organisation"
BAR_formalise_living_subjects_desc:0 "Through our tireless efforts, we have dragged Barrad into the modern age, but our work is not yet done. The social structure necessary for continuous progress must become formalised and crystallised to prevent the land from ever again falling into chaos."

BAR_most_open_closed_community_desc:0 "Although we may still be feared and misunderstood by the outside world, Barradians themselves are no longer plagued by mistrust isolation. We see our neighbours for what they are: creatures just like us."

BAR_a_ruin_has_come_desc:0 "Before we move into our bright future, we must first cleanse Barrad of its dark past. Ambrosius' old manor is an evil place, tainted by his past madness. It must be destroyed to finally put this evil to rest."

The mad Count refused to abdicate, and battle was joined. Ambrosius and his minions were no match for the combined power of the four friends, however, and they were quickly defeated. As the four became close friends, they fully realized the depths of their wrongdoing. They appeared before the commoners of Barrad and apologized for their actions, admitting that their aims were misguided.\n\nThe peasants, however, did not care. When they realized the four had let their guard down and were within reach, they immediately descended upon them to enact their vengeance for decades of horror, abuse and slavery. An angry mob of hundreds of ponies armed with pitchforks and torches swarmed the magocrats and slew them one by one before they even realized what was happening. Thus, the Pentarchy came to a violent and sudden end.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events is sure to signal the beginning of a new era for Barrad, although only time will tell if it is to be a happy one."

barrad_friends.1.t:0 "Library Use"
barrad_friends.1.d:0 "Viira always left Silver uneasy: that calm, collected deer held a smile that strained his calm; her eyes, seemingly docile, that kept a secret beneath. Profoundly unsettled, trying to converse with Viira was akin to chatting with a ravenous wolf behind its toothy grin.\n\nHowever, this sensation had recently changed. Before, Silver would've searched a way out of a situation involving Viira. He now found himself oddly at peace as the two of them shared the main table at the library, each diving deep into their tomes. The unicorn hadn't even noticed Viira, and when he did, there was no reflexive recoil nor a shudder. Instead, as Viira looked up to meet his eyes, she smiled and greeted him with a "you're looking well."\n\nPerhaps, had Silver been anypony else, Viira might have seen him as a threat that required eliminating. Together, however, she merely treated him as a partner, an ally... a friend?\n\nSilver, with a faint smile, greeted back."

barrad_friends.2.t:0 "Mechanical Aid"
barrad_friends.2.d:0 ""So, what have you been up to, Silver?"\n\nSilver nursed his glass of red wine with some hesitation. He kept eyeing Leopold's study for some hidden trap or weapon stash that the griffon would reach for were he to take a disliking to Silver suddenly.\n\nHe swallowed his hesitation. "What else? Worrying over the frailty of mortality."\n\nLeopold's mechanical eye whirred as he sipped his drink, making Silver tense up slightly. "Do you fear me?" Leopold asked unexpectedly.\n\n"I– yes," Silver replied with a start, somewhat surprised at his own candidness.\n\n"And why is that?" Leopold placed his glass on the table beside him. "I've never once made an attempt on your life, have I?" At Silver's silence, the griffon added, "I've only spoken about bettering people. I've mostly referred to enhancements in strength and durability, true, but in essence, I want people to live better. And how do people who enjoy better lives fare?"\n\nSilver looked up. "They... they live longer," he answered, slowly understanding.\n\n"Exactly, Silver," Leopold said with a cackle. "Were we to work together, why, you could live forever. Wouldn't you fancy that?"\n\nSilver suddenly became very interested in what Leopold had to say."

barrad_friends.3.d:0 "Silver eyed the bleached form of what he presumed were zebra skulls. They looked startlingly like that of a pony, and it unnerved him how Asinti seemed to speak unheard words to them. Silver wasn't even sure why he'd come to Asinti's own abode—the mad stallion was talking to skulls!\n\nAsinti's cold eyes shifted. "What brings you here, Silver Star of Wittenland?" He spoke quietly yet with authority.\n\n"Did– did you know them?" Silver asked, trying not to imagine the corpses that the skulls once were.\n\nThe zebra rose to all four, a grimace forming on his face. "Not all of them," he admitted, "but they all deserve respect regardless."\n\nSilver had to fight against baulking at the idea of giving praise to skeletons—to death itself, but his reaction was still evident. "I know of your fears, young one." The elder zebra slowly approached the Wittenlander, and placed a hoof upon his shoulder. "I only wish to stop the institution that causes the needless pain and suffering that always ends in the deaths of innocents."\n\nThe unicorn turned to face the grinning skulls. Had he been born a zebra, how likely would it have been that his skull was part of Asinti's collection? Facing Asinti, Silver asked, "To stop their deaths and those of others?"\n\n"Wherever I am capable of doing so," he stated firmly, his grimace fading. "Why won't you help me to stop the deaths of those in suffering?"\n\nSilver mulled over his words. Perhaps he would never get over the absurdity of the skull collection. Still, he could put his unease aside to save others besides himself."

"I extend to you an invitation to attend a great celebration. The most esteemed creatures of the land will be in attendance, and together we shall witness amazing wonders, the likes of which have never before been conceived!" Just saying the words made Ambrosius hop in excitement. "Come to my manor at once so that we may begin the festivities. Your friend, Count Ambrosius I." The griffon struggled to keep up with Ambrosius' words, scribbling as fast as he could onto a piece of parchment. "Oh this will be fun. So fun!" laughed Ambrosius.\n\nThe griffon finished writing and looked up to Ambrosius. "Who should receive this message?" The Count stood still, not acknowledging the question at all. "The Pentarchy?" asked the griffon.\n\n"Pentarchy. Pentarchy..." Ambrosius stared off into nothingness, trailing off for a moment. "Well, we simply must have Viira. Her extraordinary talents will help us greatly." Ambrosius tapped his chin. "And Leopold. To deny our party a mind like his would simply not do at all! He shall be there. Silver Star, on the other hoof..." The Count's face twisted in disgust. "Very rude guest. We could do without him. And... what was that old zebra's name again?"\n\nThe griffon unhooked a vial of liquid from around his neck and offered it to Ambrosius, who greedily took a swig. The Count blinked several times before glancing around the room. "Thank you, Gąsienica." He sighed and sunk into a chair. "Yes. Send it to the Pentarchy.""

He gleefully told them of the great hunt that he had arranged. The nobles were ecstatic and pressed the Count to tell them more. He told them that there was much game in the woods, and that it was only increasing in number.\n\nHe then announced in a loud voice, "And so, dear friends, it is time to poach this game, in a grand hunt!" Speaking in a softer tone, he said, "But before the hunt can begin, we must first feast to prepare our spirits for such a spectacle. Today, you will see before you the most exquisite food and vintage drink that I could produce. Let us dine, then, to our health, and to glory!"\n\n"To glory!", exclaimed the nobles, who quickly set about to devouring the food brought before them, before downing it with copious amounts of wine and beer.\n\nAs the Count prepared to dine, Silver Star nervously asked to be excused. The Count reluctantly allowed him to go, before returning to his meal and mug."

barrad_first.5.d:0 "The day after the feast, the Count rallied the hunters. He distributed high-grade weapons, produced in Leopold's forge, he then told them about the game they were to find. With all of the Pentarchy members arriving in the space of a few hours, the hunting party, numbering about a hundred members, set out from Ambrosius' manor. They began to trek into the woods, killing any lone adventurers and small bands they found, as well as a few unfortunate peasants. They went on for hours killing over a dozen ponies and griffons in the woods and putting their bodies in a wagon that Asinti ordered be dragged along with the party. Even Silver Star, in spite of his nervous disposition, was able to kill a few adventurers, for which he was lauded by his allies, especially Ambrosius.\n\nThe party had begun to turn back, when they heard a noise off to the side. The Pentarchy, along with a few dozen nobles went off to find out what the cause of it was, whilst the others guarded their bounty. When the expedition came to the source, they found a well-sized band of adventurers preparing to execute a small number of oddly dressed ponies. The expedition quickly cut down the adventurers and captured the robed ponies. They returned to the main party and continued back to the manor."

barrad_first.51.d:0 "After sorting out their bounty, and having yet another feast, most of the nobles retired to their own estates, and the peasants were set free. The Pentarchy quickly assembled to address the elephant in the room, the captured ponies. Asinti pleaded for them to be given to him, to which Viira responded, "Don't you have enough, doctor?" Ambrosius quickly silenced them before stating his own plan:\n\n"It is clear that we know very little about these strange ponies. I am dying to know more about them. I propose that we interrogate them, to find out who or even what they are."\n\nThe other Pentarchy members nodded in agreement. The ponies were briefly interrogated, before they offered to show the magistrates their meeting place. The ponies showed the Pentarchy into a cave containing all sorts of mysterious inscriptions. It was rightfully assumed that these were members of some sort of ancient cult. The last thing the cultists presented was a series of runes that looked like instruction for some kind of device. The type of device was completely beyond the Pentarchy members, and even the cultists had little knowledge of it. Sated with this knowledge, the Pentarchy split up, with Silver Star racing back to his tower, Asinti and Viira engaging in a lengthy argument, Leopold trying to figure out how the device worked, and Ambrosius drinking a few pints of ale, before passing out on his throne."

barrad_first.6.d:0 "After scouring through half of Elysium looking for him, Leopold got the brilliant idea to search Silver Star's tower. Upon reaching the tower, they were interrogated at length about their intentions. Half an hour later, they were let in. They entered the mage's room, only to find it empty. The two groaned and turned around to leave. They were walking past the large closet in the room when Asinti heard something.\n\n"Did you hear that scratching, Leopold? It sounded like it was coming from the closet. Surely he wouldn't"...\n\n"Where else would he possibly go?"\n\n"The bathroom, like any other sensible creature."\n\nAsinti burst the closet wide open to reveal a whimpering and petrified Silver Star. Silver fell out like a piece of timber, with Leopold barely breaking his fall. He set the unicorn down on the floor gently, and then walked over to Asinti.\n\n"How are we going to convince him to come with us?"\n\n"Don't worry, I've got this under control."\n\nAsinti proceeded to make loud sounds at Silver, telling him about a terrifying band of cossacks in the woods that they were about to hunt and that the Count wanted Silver to lead the party. Leopold, witnessing Silver's increasing fear, pushed Asinti aside, and began to reassure Silver that there were no cossacks and that the Count only wanted to see him. Silver slowly got up and left with them, though very timidly. Asinti and Leopold followed, and the griffon loudly scolded Asinti for his poor behavior."

barrad_second.1.t:0 "Matters"
barrad_second.1.d:0 "In the study of Count Ambrosius, the other four members of the Pentarchy sat around a table, contemplating the strange events they had witnessed. "Since our brave Count is currently incapacitated, it is up to us to decipher the meaning of this." Viira placed the mysterious codex down on the table. "We need a plan of action," she said, glancing at each of her compatriots. Leopold paid her no mind, continuing to study the inscriptions he had copied from the cave. Asinti's eyes were closed and his head bobbed slowly. Was he sleeping? Silver Star scowled and grabbed the codex with his magic.\n\n"I am certain that one of the ancient books in my possession will have the information needed to understand these runes," said Silver Star, narrowing his eyes. "I would never allow any of YOU to get a peek at my library, though." He shifted his gaze around the room, suspiciously. "That would be unwise. Very unwise," he muttered to himself.\n\nLeopold waved a dismissive claw. "If we put our minds to it, we can figure this out on our own. No need for any of your obscure, dusty texts," he said matter-of-factly. Silver Star pursed his lips and pushed the codex back to the middle of the table.\n\n"That would take too long, Leopold. We have to go to the source of this." Viira tapped the codex. "We need to get in contact with the cult, so we can question them and find out more," she said. Her tone left no room for argument; it was clearly an order, not a suggestion.\n\n"No." A raspy voice arose. "I can hear their whispers." Asinti looked at Viira with wide eyes. "Yes, we should track down the cult. But not to question them, to kidnap them! Their sacrifice will please the ones beyond." His face broke into a wide smile. The other three eyed Asinti in silence."

"You know, it's been so dull around here lately." He began trotting through the halls of the manor with Gąsienica keeping pace at his side. "But that party was invigorating. Hunting! Killing! Mystery! So much excitement..." Ambrosius stroked his beard in contemplation. "I know what we must do: throw another party, bigger and grander." The Count was positively giddy by the time he entered the throne room.\n\n"More drinking, more feasting, more merriment!" Ambrosius was smiling just imagining the festivities. "Begin preparations at once! Send out invitations to the Pentarchy, and all the nobles." He slowly turned to face Gąsienica, his smile remaining but his eyes becoming dark.

"Viira, care to entertain our guests?" he shouted. The doe sighed, and began to walk toward the balcony. Ambrosius galloped to join her and beckoned for the group to follow. From the manor's balcony the two looked over a nearby village, as well as the untamed forests and mountains in the distance. Ambrosius pointed to the village watchtower. "There, that's a good spot."\n\nViira focused intensely before closing her eyes. A strange energy could be felt in the air around her, and the seer's robes began to ripple with magical power. Suddenly, a large section of the village surrounding the tower became shrouded in a dark fog. When the fog dissipated, everything that had been inside it was gone. "Spectacular!" shouted one of the guests, as the rest of them mumbled in amazement. "Where did it all go?" asked another.\n\nViira smirked. "A magician never reveals her secrets.""

The acolyte began some kind of short ceremony, before looking to Viira expectantly. "Did you devise these plans?" asked Viira, showing the instructions for the strange device.\n\n"No, they come from the master." answered the acolyte.\n\n"Master?"\n\n"You think Count Ambrosius is the master of Barrad? No, the true master lies hidden from the unworthy and undiscerning. It is our purpose to serve It, for we have done so for countless generations." The acolyte lowered her head. "But we have failed. It has become angered by the greed and cruelty of the land, and unleashed the plagues that afflict Barrad. It is the cause of all our suffering.""

"Can I meet it?"\n\n"Only a privileged few can discern Its will, much less stand in Its presence. We are but the Outer Circle, and I have told you all that I can. If you wish to know more you must contact the Inner Circle."\n\n"I see." Viira bowed humbly.\n\n"When you are ready, seek them out." The acolyte held up a hoof. "But be prepared to prove yourself.

barrad_second.6.d:0 "Deep into the night, Viira sat studying the codex, looking closely at its inscriptions and comparing them to every ancient script she had samples of. She sighed in frustration, yet another dead end. The runes were alien, but at the same time they seemed so familiar. There was still a missing piece to the puzzle. She needed answers, and so she took the codex and journeyed through the woods to return to the cave. At the entrance, she saw a solitary pony emerging from its depths. "What were you doing in there?" asked Viira.\n\nThe pony stopped in his tracks. "Just exploring," he answered. Viira examined him closely, there was something odd about him. He wore strangely fine clothes, and didn't seem very comfortable in the natural environment.\n\n"Anything inside?" asked Viira. The pony shook his head, agitated. "Is that so? Because I believe I've met some of your friends who would disagree." Viira took out the codex and showed it to the pony, whose eyes went wide in realisation. He became tense, silently staring at Viira. "Please, I mean you no harm. I just want to understand!" she pleaded.\n\nThe pony scrutinised her for a long moment, before sighing. "We will be in touch. If you prove your intentions, you will find your answers." He trotted off into the forest without saying another word."

"It goes without saying that this device has enormous potential, it could give all of us the means to achieve our ultimate goals."\n\nLeopold raised his claw. "We must decode these schematics so that we can begin construction immediately. I shall begin preparation of the site: excavation will be no issue," he said, his artificial eye scanning the instructions on the table.\n\n"And I will be able to provide an ample supply of undead labour," Silver Star boasted, drawing a scoff from Leopold. "Insolence! You DOUBT my power?" Silver Star reeled, nearly falling out of his chair.\n\nAsinti interrupted, paying Silver Star no mind. "I will be happy to assist in this matter, but first I must heed the words of the ones beyond. They demand a temple, and so I must build one." He smiled serenely.\n\n"Fair enough," said Viira. "In the meantime I will attempt to track down any groups who may know more about the origin of these plans.""

A truly bizarre situation." Ambrosius took the documents and leafed through them, lazily. "Many griffons down there... that's near where you grew up, isn't it?"\n\n"Yes," said Gąsienica. "Are we going to do anything to help them?" There was obvious concern in his voice.\n\n"No need to worry, I've sent a letter to the Pentarchy." Ambrosius waved a dismissive hoof. "They can handle it. Probably. Do you know how they're doing? Are they all still alive?" The Count blinked several times before shaking his head vigourously.

"It is my understanding that Count Ambrosius recently requested that you travel to the mountains in order to address reports of aggressive vegetation," Gąsienica began the letter.\n\n"Disregard those instructions, and do not concern yourself in any way with this matter. I will attend to it personally." Gąsienica's claw trembled as he thought of the hardships being endured by the border villagers. "Those griffons are my kin, and this is something I must do myself. Your faithful servant, Captain Gąsienica." Upon finishing the letter, he sighed and clasped his claws together. It was done.

"I humbly ask for your aid in my research, for I have no doubt that you all are the key to securing our future." The cultists listened silently, before conferring among themselves.\n\n"You wish to know the secrets of the Inner Circle," one of the figures said. Viira couldn't tell which one.

She seemed to be in charge of all the other guards. "You're not from around here, are you?"\n\n"That is true. I was... compelled to come here and abandon my natural history studies in Aquileia." The unicorn's eyes looked past Viira for a moment. "But it is here that I found my purpose, in the service of the Great Machine."\n\n"I have come a long way from my home, as well." Viira brought a hoof to her chest. "I hope that I may also find my purpose here."\n\n"That's all well and good, but you're still not getting in." said the unicorn, unimpressed.

barrad_third.6.d:0 "The air was thick and heavy as Viira wandered through a cavern deep beneath the lair of the Inner Circle. Hidden behind layers of oppressive darkness, she could just barely make out a series of bizarre silhouettes filling the cavern: the Old Machines. According to the cultists, they were gifts from the Great Machine to be worshiped and cared for, although when she pressed them they confessed not to know the original purpose of these strange creations.\n\nViira got close to one and examined it using the light of her torch. The "machine" was tall and intimidating, but also unlike anything she had ever seen before. Its lines and curves were aesthetically pleasing, seeming more the work of a sculptor than a mechanist. The texture was nothing like the machines of Leopold, it did not look metallic at all. Viira reached out a hoof to feel its surface and found it not as cold as she expected. It felt rubbery, so she pushed to test its firmness. And it groaned.\n\nThis thing was... alive? The surface shifted all on its own. Viira's blood went cold. There was no doubt. These machines had been grown, not built. Now aware that she was surrounded by organic beings, Viira was overcome by a feeling of unease. She felt like she was being watched, watched by something larger and more alien than anything she had previously imagined. Most of all, she felt afraid. Viira steeled herself. Now was not the time to turn back, not when confronted by such an opportunity for discovery. She needed to push forward."

Distant memories from when he had lived there; memories of joy, innocence, and then the most intense fear. Back before he had been saved by Ambrosius... but now was not the time to dwell on that. Much more pressing was confronting the novel menace that threatened to destroy his kin.\n\nAfter emerging from a narrow pass, he at last laid eyes on his home village, only to see it besieged by an army of shambling trees. The villagers were mounting a stiff resistance, but clearly wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer. Gąsienica let loose a shout and charged towards the trees at full speed, slamming into them with all his weight and ferocity. Fighting using only his bare claws, he split trunks and ripped off branches with his incredible strength. The villagers were inspired by the show of bravery and pushed forward, cutting down the trees with their swords and axes.\n\nOne of the fighters chucked an improvised incendiary bomb into the cluster of trees, which exploded setting many ablaze. Frightened, the remaining trees ceased their attack and began to slowly retreat. "I said no fire!" a voice shouted. "Maniacs! Are you trying to burn the whole village down?" Griffons rushed to keep the flames under control, but the voice brought back memories for Gąsienica. It was a voice he had not heard in a lifetime."

"I hope you've been staying out of trouble!" Jánošík laughed and pulled Gąsienica in for an embrace.\n\n"I try my best," Jánošík said with a grin, drawing a sceptical look from Gąsienica. "Sure, occasionally I liberate a noble passerby from their wealth, but I never keep it for myself. It all goes to the people who need it most." Jánošík had to tilt his head up to engage in the conversation, such was the degree to which Gąsienica towered over him. "Say, I remember you being big, but now you're built like a tank! What's your secret?" Gąsienica frowned, remembering the many experiments Ambrosius had performed on him to enhance his physical performance. In the awkward silence that followed, Jánošík nervously tugged at the ornate amulet around his neck.\n\n"What's that?" asked Gąsienica, noticing it for the first time. "I never pictured you being very fond of jewelry."\n\n"This? Erm... it's just a trinket. Sort of a good luck charm." Jánošík gave a sheepish smile. "Silly, I know."\n\nA sharp gust of wind blew a branch from one of the slain plants onto the ground between them. Gąsienica picked it up to give it a closer look. "That's strange. These leaves look like the kind I use to make the Count's medicine." He took one in his claw to feel its texture.\n\n"We'll have more time for botany later, but right now I think we just made them angry." Jánošík looked towards the horizon. "There will be more of those things coming soon, and we need to prepare.""

barrad_third.82.d:0 ""Gather 'round, everyone!" Gąsienica shouted as he stood next to a pile of nondescript crates. "We're going to need all the firepower we can muster to beat back these monsters. Fortunately, I came prepared." He kicked open one of the crates to reveal its contents: dozens of shiny new magical rifles. "Grab one, and take up a defensive position around the village!" The townsfolk did as they were told, and soon formed a makeshift skirmish line facing the approaching enemy. The shambling trees were slow to advance, but were coming closer and closer by the minute.\n\nWhen they came within range, the villagers began firing, their magical projectiles proving highly effective against the plant monsters. At the same time, Gąsienica charged out ahead, using his claws to rip the trees apart with reckless abandon. Jánošík was right by his side, felling many trees with his axe.\n\nDuring the fierce fighting, Jánošík tripped and became tangled in the roots of the slain plants, and the trees around him converged to finish him off. In desperation, he ripped the amulet off his neck and held it out towards the encroaching monsters, closing his eyes in anticipation of the killing blow...\n\nBut the blow never came. Sensing the magic of the amulet, they dared not come any closer to it. As the plants remained still, shots from the villagers and Gąsienica's devastating strikes shredded them. It did not take much longer for the remaining trees to be broken. Gąsienica, Jánošík, and the entire village stood victorious."

barrad_third.83.d:0 "After fighting off all the attacking trees, Gąsienica sat recovering with Jánošík in his home. "I think it's time you explained what's really going on with that amulet," said Gąsienica. Jánošík nodded.\n\n"In the past, you may have seen a group of robed idiots scurrying around Barrad, raving about their god, who lives somewhere underground," began Jánošík. "A merchant I know works with them, gathering magical artifacts and the like. It's all supposed to go to the cult, but sometimes they offer some of it up for sale, and this particular item caught my eye. It's said to be imbued with magic that can scare away anything born from the cult's god." He held up the amulet. "Anything that could scare a god sounded pretty interesting to me. Of course at the time I thought that was all nonsense... but maybe those cultists were on to something after all?"\n\n"You know, I've learned a bit of magic in my time around the Pentarchy." Gąsienica examined the amulet closely. "I believe we can use this artifact to cast a warding spell that will make sure those things don't come back." Jánošík was intrigued, and watched as Gąsienica channeled the item's power into a spell. He could feel the magical energy in the air, and from Gąsienica's smile he knew the spell had been a success.\n\nAfterwards, the two went off to save the other mountain villages that were threatened, defeating any plants attacking them and casting the warding spell. After all the other villages were protected, they parted ways, and Gąsienica began his long trek back to Count Ambrosius."

The ground was littered with twisted trunks and branches scarred by deep cuts and magical blasts, the bodies of trees which had only recently threatened to wipe the mountain villages off the map. Viira took a sample from one of the plants, tucking it away inside her bag, before heading towards the nearby village. As she approached the town she could sense a strange magic in the air. She questioned the villagers about the spell, and they pointed her towards the griffon who had cast it.\n\nViira tracked down the griffon, who was named Jánošík, and eagerly shook his claw. "Greetings, I am Viira." She smiled. "And I must say, superb work dealing with those nasty plants! May I ask you a few questions about how you managed it?" Jánošík clearly recognised her and scowled, remaining silent. "Now I know you may not be fond of the Pentarchy, but any information you can provide will help me get to the bottom of this matter, and ensure such a tragedy never occurs again," pled Viira.\n\nJánošík sighed, moved by her sincerity. "All right," he said, leading Viira to the location where he kept an ornate amulet. "This is it." Jánošík offered the amulet for inspection.

He was engrossed as the flames consumed the paper, watching it with fascination. Gąsienica was mostly nonplussed.\n\n"But not this little flame, no. Something bigger. Much bigger." Ambrosius smiled contemplating the spectacle. "An inferno that sweeps through all the land, and lights up the sky!" He jumped up from his desk. "Let's go out and set the kindling.

The massive device positively radiated with crackling energy just begging to be harnessed, bathing the cavernous chamber housing it. Before moving any closer, he paused to reflect upon the life that had led him to this point. It was a life spent in the shadow of White Star, shunned and persecuted by close-minded cowards. They forced him to flee his home, simply because he was searching for a way to become strong enough to protect the creatures of the Riverlands. But his search was over, and now none could stand between him and his destiny.\n\nSilver Star approached the reactor, using his magic to take control of the wisping energy and direct it towards himself. He closed his eyes to focus, and it began to flow into his horn in a cascading torrent. Bright light emanated from his horn, causing shadows to dance on the walls of the chamber. As he absorbed the incredible power of the reactor, Silver Star strained to keep it all contained. Once the process was complete, he could feel his magic was stronger than he ever could have imagined.\n\nHe knew he was more powerful than White Star now. He was more powerful than any mage that ever lived! With his newfound magical abilities and knowledge of the dark arts, Silver Star could at last truly conquer death. He knew what title he would take: archlich. There was no need to run from anything anymore. He had all the power in the world, enough to crush any pathetic mortals that threatened him.\n\nBut first, he would have to deal with the foolish Count Ambrosius.

At least until his army had broken down the door and Silver Star was personally overseeing the elimination of his rivals for power.\n\nIn a matter of days, Ambrosius and the rest of the lesser Pentarchy had all been killed.

But most of all Silver Star disliked Asinti for his power.\n\nMuch like the loathed Queen White Star, Asinti gained his power not through intense study and practice, but by having been born lucky. The shaman had been powerful though, and if Silver Star's kingdom was going to thrive he would need his own Pentarchy. After a long period of thought Silver Star summoned his magic, and Asinti's body began to stir."

Unlike Ambrosius, who used his authority to force Silver Star to indulge his frequent, hedonistic whims.\n\nBut Ambrosius had still been his patron. He sheltered Silver Star from those who would persecute him, he provided him some of the finest texts Eastern Griffonia could offer, he spared no expense in constructing the reactor that ultimately brought him to power. Perhaps that was worth a few indulgences.\n\nPerhaps that was worth a second chance.\n\nAmbrosius' limbs shuddered, as if reacting to a cold breeze. Then they began to move on their own.

While they certainly disagreed on the methods, their end goals were the same. To achieve total immortality and protect those they cared about from external threats. Though, admittedly, in Silver Star's case that latter goal included only himself.\n\nStripped of his mechanical enhancements, the sickness that ravaged Leopold's body throughout his entire life was now laid bare before Silver Star's eyes. This ritual would be uniquely challenging. Not only would it be difficult to preserve Leopold's vast intellect, but Silver Star would also need to repair every failed organ and restore any necrotic tissue.

In fact, prototypes have already been created for artillery shells to be filled with gasses and other chemicals, which have proven to be highly effective. This technology has the potential to cause widespread panic among enemy ranks on the battlefield.\n\nThe alternative is biological warfare. This option encompasses the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Thanks to the self-replicating nature of these "bio-weapons," their use would be inadvisable by a mortal army, thanks to their potential to backfire and bog down the attackers.

"Already, we have saved so many poor souls. Soon, they all will be freed!" However, Osvananga said nothing in response.\n\nSuddenly, Asinti's legs became weak and his whole body started trembling. "What's... happening?" He tried to take a step forward but found it hard to command his limbs. With each second it was becoming harder and harder to breathe. Asinti struggled to find something to brace himself on, but he collapsed to the ground before he had a chance. After what seemed like an eternity, Asinti saw his hoof rise all on its own. Asinti screamed, but his mouth refused to comply.\n\nAsinti's body rose from the ground. Osvananga smiled wide. A whole new world of possibilities awaited."

barrad_asinti.3.d:0 "While conducting an inspection of his new abode, Osvananga paused to examine the stripes on his coat. This puppet would still take some getting used to. But a far more urgent concern was Asinti's atrocious sense of decor. "This is unacceptable!" Osvananga shouted "I want all those trinkets torn down from the wall, and this place made fit for one such as I to occupy." With a flick of his hoof, he commanded a gaggle of possessed servants to get to work renovating the space.\n\nBy now, Osvananga's rule had been solidified across all of Barrad, and those not possessed were enslaved. Chains for the body or chains for the soul... Truly, Osvananga would find no shortage of puppets in this quaint land. Osvananga chuckled at the irony. But this was only the beginning; he had big plans, which would demand even bigger sacrifices."

barrad_asinti.4.t:0 "The Decision"
barrad_asinti.4.d:0 "As he walked through the halls of the former Count Ambrosius' manor, Osvananga sighed. The excitement and challenge of conquest was over, now there was only boredom. It truly was lonely at the top. And so he decided the time had come to invite the others. They would have to be summoned into suitable bodies, of course. Fortunately, he already had two suitable candidates in captivity.\n\nFirstly, there was the former Count himself. Ambrosius was old, but dignified. The pony would make a lithe and nimble vessel for one of Osvananga's friends. Alternatively, there was the Count's bodyguard: Gąsienica. That griffon was built like a tank, and stood enormously tall. He was an absolute monster! Truly, quite the specimen...\n\nThey both had their merits, but which one to choose?"
barrad_asinti.4.a:0 "Ambrosius."
barrad_asinti.4.b:0 "Gąsienica."
barrad_asinti.41.t:0 "Another Decision"
barrad_asinti.41.d:0 "Fortunately, not all of Asinti's former associates have yet perished, meaning that there is another spare Pentarch whose body would serve as an excellent host for one of Osvananga's demonic friends. The novelty alone makes such a prospect highly appealing, not to mention the prestige of making use of such a notorious vessel. And so, after a quick ritual, Osvananga welcomed into the world his newest commander, wearing the flesh of..."
barrad_asinti.41.a:0 "...Leopold."
barrad_asinti.41.b:0 "...Silver Star."
barrad_asinti.5.t:0 "Salvation"
barrad_asinti.5.d:0 "In the midst of a raging thunderstorm, Osvananga walked through the grandiose halls of the temple that Asinti had erected to please him. Although, finally seeing up close, Osvananga had to admit that he was not at all enthusiastic about the design. That zebra certainly had ambition, if not good taste, which meant that there would be no shortage of materials to repurpose. But when objectively evaluating the construction of the temple, Osvananga could come to only one conclusion."
barrad_asinti.5.a:0 "Is this some kind of joke?"

barrad_leopold.1.d:0 "As he stood before the pulsing reactor, Leopold's feathers bristled in anticipation. The massive device positively radiated with crackling energy just begging to be harnessed, bathing the cavernous chamber housing it. Before moving any closer, he paused to reflect upon the life that had led him to this point. Once a sickly griffon, he was now on the cusp of wielding more power than any griffon in history! It was a lifetime of struggle that required inner strength, but he had refused to accept what nature had given him.\n\nLeopold approached the reactor and its power began flowing through him, a trickle at first before morphing into a deluge. It was painful, at times feeling as if his body was being ripped apart, but he persevered. At last, the process was finished and Leopold emerged a changed creature. He was now a divine fusion of griffon and machine, stronger than ever before. Leopold felt like he could take on the world by himself. He had all the power he needed to create a new future for Griffonia. A better future, free from strife. With his clockworks keeping the peace, all creatures would be able to achieve their full potential, as he had. Yes, that future was now closer than ever before..."

barrad_leopold.2.d:0 "After emerging from the depths, Leopold swept through Barrad with an unstoppable ferocity, greatly aided by his newly-enhanced mechanical body. Even if Count Ambrosius had been prepared enough to mount a defence, it would have been useless. As it was, both the Count and the Barradian nobility were busy wallowing in their hedonism and were blind to the ascension of Leopold. At least until he had broken down the door and Leopold was personally overseeing the termination of the Mad Count.\n\nIn a matter of days, Ambrosius and the rest of the lesser Pentarchy had all been killed. Leopold was now the sole master of the nation, and he had the power to mold it however he wished. No longer would Barrad be mired in backwardness. It was the dawn of a new age."
barrad_leopold.2.a:0 "All eyes now look to Leopold Schmeller."
barrad_leopold.3.t:0 "Perfection"
barrad_leopold.3.d:0 "Leopold had a problem. Although the reactor had empowered him and made possible his enhanced form, the process remained incomplete. While most of his body now consisted of sturdy metal, some weak flesh remained. This served only as a reminder of the imperfection he had been cursed with. Fortunately, he had devised a procedure to remedy that situation.\n\nAs he laid down on the operating table, Leopold steeled himself for the first incision from the operating machine—another one of his creations. Once it began, the process was more painful than anything that Leopold had felt before, but he bore it all the same. It was simply the price of conquering nature. After the procedure was complete, Leopold rose from the table and flexed his mechanical claws. At last, he had done it. He was a griffon free from all mortality."

The beast was ferocious, but ultimately proved no match for Leopold's might. Once slain, the Titan's body provided a treasure trove of enchanted materials and technology to be salvaged. Leopold is now in a position to fully augment his body with armour composed of these materials, sturdier and more durable than any other alloy in this world. He is now truly unstoppable."

barrad_viira.11.d:0 "In a chamber deep beneath the ground, Viira stood in the presence of the divine. Ever since the activation of the reactor, creatures far and wide had been witnessing bizarre and inexplicable events, and wondered what force could possibly be capable of such feats. But Viira knew, and she was in awe.\n\n"I have seen the truth." Viira bowed to her master. "I have witnessed your power, and I will be your herald," her body tingled from the unfathomable energy in the air. "Across this land, all shall know your glory!" As Viira said the words, she became overwhelmed with joy. It was the joy of knowing that after a lifetime of searching, she had finally found her destiny."

barrad_viira.12.t:0 "Transcendence"
barrad_viira.12.d:0 ""Enough with the act! You may have fooled the ignorant creatures of this land, but not me," Viira shouted defiantly. "It took a bit of investigating, but eventually the pieces all fell into place and the truth became obvious. You are no god. You are a made thing, crafted by mortals and then forgotten," her words dripped with contempt. "Consumed by hunger when denied the energy you crave. Crying out in desperation for so many years until I came along. Pathetic." she sneered.\n\n"I can provide you with what you desire, but it will come at a price." Viira brought up a hoof for emphasis. "The price for my satiating your hunger is this: YOU will serve ME, always." An unnatural silence and stillness filled the room, which Viira knew could only mean the acquiescence of the desperate being. Concentrating intensely, she magically drained the reactor of all its incredible energy, empowering the entity while at the same time enslaving it.\n\n"Excellent," she chuckled. There were still things to take care of. That insane Count, for one. Viira grinned. She had something special in mind for him..."

barrad_viira.13.t:0 "Untapped Potential"
barrad_viira.13.d:0 "As Viira contemplated the fate of the griffon villages near the southwestern border, an idea came into her head. Her perspective had changed greatly since the last time she had been to the mountains. Whereas before she had found such communities quaint and charming, she now saw how primitive and underdeveloped the mountain griffons truly were. They were isolated, crying out for a better way! They needed to be put to work and given more fulfilling lives. But put to work doing what?"
barrad_viira.13.a:0 "Carrying out construction projects."
barrad_viira.13.b:0 "Working in weapons factories."
barrad_viira.14.t:0 "Special"
barrad_viira.14.d:0 "In a deserted town square, Viira looked up to see a sky choked with smoke as ash rained down around her. It was a consequence of the village being burned down so its population could be forced to move to their new homes elsewhere. She sighed, relocations were always such messy affairs. The silence was abruptly pierced by shouts from a nearby building, and Viira turned to investigate. From a window, she glanced inside and saw a group of deer huddled together as the structure around them was engulfed in flames and collapsing. The peril became even more immediate when a beam high above them broke loose and began to fall right towards them.\n\nBut somehow, they were not crushed. At the second before impact, a magic shield surrounded the group and deflected the falling beam. Viira was surprised, the shield was not her doing. The only creatures inside were deer, unlikely to be capable of such feats. Her curiosity piqued, Viira's eye was drawn to what looked to be the youngest deer in the group. The small girl was fearless, in contrast with the cowering adults around her. She took the initiative and guided the group through the smoke and flame to safety. The young deer had saved them all with uncanny foresight combined with magical aptitude. At that moment, Viira knew without a doubt that the young deer had the potential of a Seer.\n\nOutside, Viira approached the group to find them gathered around the girl, praising her for rescuing her family. "How quaint," Viira marveled, before turning to the adults she presumed to be the young deer's guardians. "All of you, stand aside!" she ordered. The order was immediately heeded, giving Viira a wide berth to talk with the now-frightened girl. Viira smiled and leaned down to get at the young deer's level, looking into her eyes. She saw magic mixed in with terror. "Don't be afraid!" Viira laughed. "You are gifted, as I was." Viira put a hoof on the young deer's heart. "There is no reason for you to ever be afraid.""
barrad_viira.14.a:0 "You are destined for great things, little one."
barrad_viira.997.t:0 "Overcharged"
barrad_viira.997.d:0 ""Yes!" Viira laughed as she made use of her newfound powers. She had always boasted powerful magic, but her current abilities were far beyond those ever wielded by any mortal before. She was the master of fire, earth, water, air, and more! The possibilities were limitless!\n\nSuddenly, Viira felt a pain in her stomach. "Erm." she grimaced. Discomfort was spreading rapidly through her body. "Think I need to lie down..." There she stood one moment, and the next she was gone. A violent explosion consumed her, leaving only a puff of smoke in the shape of her body which slowly dissipated. All that remained of Viira were a series of scorch marks on the ground."

Viira smiled. "Now all I have to do is-"\n\n"WHAT are you DOING in here?" Silver Star exploded, standing at the library entrance.\n\n"Silver Star, thank goodness I found you!" Viira ran frantically over to him. "They've come back for you, they want to kill you!" She grabbed his shoulders and shook vigourously.\n\n"Oh no." Silver Star's eyes went impossibly wide. "No, no, no," he repeated, shaking on his own now.\n\n"Don't worry. You find someplace to hide, and I'll take care of them!" Viira packed up her things, including the tome containing the missing piece.\n\n"Hide, yes. Good idea!" Silver Star rushed to open a secret alcove behind one of the bookcases.

barrad_ahist.1.d:0 "Dead. They were all dead.\n\nIt was a difficult thing for Count Ambrosius to come to terms with, that the four he had trusted and encouraged for so long had each come to such a miserable end. Ambrosius had always heard voices. He wanted to understand what they were, why they spoke to him. The Pentarchs were the ones who could answer the questions, unravel the mystery... But now they were gone. The whispers in his head grew louder. Now there was no escape. No reprieve.\n\nTheir will could no longer be denied."
barrad_ahist.1.a:0 "What is thy bidding?"
barrad_ahist.11.t:0 "True Madness"
barrad_ahist.11.d:0 "The whispers had become screams. Unrelenting inside the mind of Ambrosius, they forced him to epiphany. He knew what he had to do. Abandon understanding. Abandon hubris. Surrender his will...\n\nThat was the answer, yes! Then the voices that guided him would solve everything. He just had to listen. They called to him, demanding that he become their herald and reveal to his subjects what had been revealed to him. Ambrosius agreed without hesitation; this was his new purpose, one he had tried to avoid for far too long, but no longer. At last, he had found his destiny."

barrad_ccamb.1.t:0 "First Contact"
barrad_ccamb.1.d:0 "Deep beneath the surface of Barrad, Count Ambrosius stood before the reactor with Gąsienica at his side. Ambrosius was in awe of the majestic device, and ephemeral voices beckoned him to approach it, come closer... He did, shambling towards it until suddenly the voices stopped and the pain started.\n\nIt was as if an entire universe was trying to make its home inside his skull! Unable to withstand it, he keeled over, screaming in pain. He brought his hooves to his head in an attempt to keep it from bursting from all he felt inside it. Upon seeing Ambrosius' state, Gąsienica was frantic, and poured many doses of the Count's medicine into his open mouth. Was this much of the drug unsafe? Gąsienica didn't know, but he had to do something.\n\nWithin the mind of Ambrosius, he fought against the invading presence with all his will. His thoughts were chaotic and it was impossible to centre himself. All seemed to be a whirlwind of hatred and hostility, until he noticed a voice inside the cacophony that was different from the rest. He sensed this part of the presence did not wish him harm, and so he focused on it. It told him what the presence truly was, that it was the product of seven ancient unicorns who had used a primordial spell from another age to merge together into one consciousness, but now was totally dependent on magic in order to survive. It told him that they did not want to cause all this, but that Ambrosius had unleashed a power that had corrupted them. Finally, it told him that it would use the last of its uncorrupted will to free him from his madness.\n\nAmbrosius awoke to find Gąsienica beside him, grateful to see him alive. For the first time in an eternity, the fog was gone. His thoughts were finally clear. He felt like vomiting, but there wasn't time. He was responsible for an immense mistake, and there was no time to waste in putting things right. "Return to the surface, Gąsienica," said Ambrosius. "I must stay here and work on a way to fix what I have broken. Make sure things don't fall apart out there in the meantime.""

After emerging from a narrow pass, he smiled as he laid eyes on his home village at peace. The aftermath of their battle with the plants was still visible, but now the mangled monstrosities were overgrown by vegetation of a more mundane variety.\n\nAs soon as he entered the town Jánošík came out to greet him, laughing heartily. "Good to see you, friend! Come to drag us out of the fire again?" He gave Gąsienica a playful punch which had absolutely no effect.\n\n"Not this time, fortunately," said Gąsienica. "In fact, I have come to ask you for assistance. The Count is... away dealing with a matter of some importance. As you are a more respected figure than I among the mountain villages, your support would be appreciated at this time." Jánošík wore a mask of inscrutable contemplation. "Since he protected you in your time of need, it's only fair that you help him in return."\n\n"No, no." Jánošík wagged a claw. "It wasn't him that saved us, it was you. And so I will do this for you." His voice shifted to become deadly serious. "Under one condition - if we are to respect your rule, you should respect ours. Promise that our villages will retain their autonomy, and I will help." Gąsienica nodded, and the two shook claws."

It was this dealer that had provided them the artifact to ward off the corrupted plants when no other means proved effective, and any creature trading in such powerful magic was worth seeking out. Gąsienica had gone to the last place Jánošík said he met with the merchant, but saw only abandoned buildings with no civilisation in sight.\n\nHe was on the verge of giving up hope when a raspy voice slithered out from the darkness. "A visitor?" Gąsienica turned around and was surprised to find a stallion dressed in discoloured rags beckoning to him. As Gąsienica approached, the stallion gave a wide smile, revealing a glimmering gold tooth. "Come in!" He disappeared into a decrepit shack with Gąsienica following behind.\n\n"You have come a long way looking for something, haven't you?" The stallion looked over the strange items that covered the walls before rummaging through one of the many containers laying haphazardly around the shack. "How about this?" He asked, pulling out an item and tossing it to Gąsienica. "This artifact will ensure you gain the favour of the people," he explained. Gąsienica ran his claws over the teardrop shaped object and could feel the magical power within. "Use it during the wet season to increase crop yields by an enormous amount."\n\nGąsienica had found his merchant, but this was quite unexpected. "You're just... giving it to me?" he asked.\n\n"You have earned it." The merchant raised his hooves high in praise. "You have done more good for this land than you know, my griffon friend!""

barrad_ccamb.5.d:0 "Gąsienica traveled to contact a shadowy cult that operated at the fringes of Barradian society. Although a bit obscure, they had several wealthy patrons and wielded a lot of influence, so gaining their support could prove very useful. When he reached their secluded compound, he found a scene of chaos and heated arguments. No two cultists had kind things to say to one another, and the volatile atmosphere felt like it could combust into violence at any moment.\n\nIt seemed that the Pentarchy's actions had ultimately created a schism within the cult. None of the members had heard from their god in some time, and they felt the deity's influence was growing weaker by the day. Those in the cult's Inner Circle accused the Outer Circle of being faithless, while those in the Outer Circle accused the Inner Circle of becoming corrupt and rotten, prompting their god to abandon them.\n\nGąsienica sighed.

Gąsienica held his breath as Ambrosius approached the reactor to perform the ritual. When he began the ritual in earnest, power started swirling all around them until suddenly, everything stopped, and the world became still.\n\nA voice spoke to both of them, but it was not the elusive, shifting voice Ambrosius was used to hearing. It was a calm voice, low and quiet but at the same time not difficult to hear. "I am awake." The presence in the air washed over them like an ocean current. "My actions have wrought so much pain, so much destruction. For that, I can not express the magnitude of my sorrow." The room seemed to somehow fill with sadness. "But now I am freed from hunger and chaos, and I wish to do now what I have been unable to do for far too long. Let us make this world a better place."\n\nGąsienica was in shock from what he was witnessing and was completely unsure how to react. Ambrosius, however, smiled. "Yes, let's.""

With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workponies and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.

As he dug deeper, Leopold uncovered an enormous being made out of reshaped magical crystals and various ores which he dubbed the "Titan".

Never to dominate the physical world, never to bring enlightened magical rule to her people. It seems all hope is lost."

bar_pen_screen_silver_info_text:0 "Fear and desire. These emotions have come to define the life of the unicorn known as Silver Star. Originally, he was nothing more than another arrogant scion of the Wittenland noble class. Scheming, somewhat paranoid, and jealous of those in a better position. In this case, it was jealousy directed at a sibling - Queen White Star of Wittenland, who managed, much to the dismay of Silver Star, to become the monarch of the realm purely through her magical talent.\n\nUsually such nobles would remain in the background of important matters of the world, lacking in ability to fulfill their ambition. However, fate had other plans for Silver Star. In his hometown of High Mane, at the border of the Wittenland, Silver Star would learn why the griffons were such a threat to the creatures of the Riverlands. He would experience several raids by the griffon cossacks over the course of a few weeks, and would nearly perish during them.\n\nThe raids affected him greatly, and the culmination of these experiences were recurring nightmares of his untimely death. This pushed Silver Star into studying powerful magic, as one theme was present in all of these dreams no matter who slew him - a lack of power and inability to persist beyond the weakness of his flesh. He would become obsessed with his own mortality, and this led the unicorn down a very dark path, as no matter how much power and knowledge he acquired, the enemies in his nightmares persisted; unbeatable and impossible to endure as ever. And after reaching ones potential in raw magical prowess, there remains only one way to become stronger – by breaking the greatest of taboos in most magical societies. Thus, in an attempt triumph over all his perceived enemies, which Silver Star believed were circling him like vultures, the unicorn turned to dark magic.\n\nHowever, despite his ever increasing power, the safety that Silver Star desired seemed to be fleeting. His paranoia only worsened, as usage of the dark arts transformed his body and mind, forcing him into hiding as it became obvious to any magical creature that the unicorn was being corrupted by the darkness. He was convinced that, one day, his nightmares would become reality, and an armed guard would come to kill him, with Queen White Star, his corruption having become especially obvious too, at their lead.\n\nWith these fears of demise and insatiable desire for power, it was no wonder that Silver Star was very willing to accept the invitation that was presented by Ambrosius. After all, even among the chaos of the Griffonian continent, few were as appreciative and accepting of the dark arts and their user's talents. Furthermore, perhaps due to some remnants of his pride, Silver Star believed that Ambrosius, an earth pony, nor any of his allies and subordinates belonging to other races, were a danger to him, or at least Silver Star was unwilling to admit that.\n\nNow Silver Star spends his time studying any and all knowledge of unicorn magic that can be found. All in an effort to become so powerful that nothing would be able to hurt him, and death would never be able to take him."
bar_pen_asinti_info_text:0 ""The ends justify the means" is a very popular statement among many ideologues, especially those representing the more radical parts of the political spectrum. However, if one were to bring up the means that Asinti uses, many of these radicals would be horrified, and agree that, whatever the end goal is, there was no way what the elder zebra shaman was doing to be justified.\n\nOriginally, Asinti was nothing but another slave, a victim of the brutal institution that is still dominant in many parts of Zebrica. Many who experienced such fate would try enduring, if not resisting against their subjugators. Yet it seems that most lacked "strong spirit", as in recorded history, Asinti has been the only zebra slave that was approached by a power from beyond the material realm. This ally from the immaterium helped Asinti to free himself from the shackles of slavery, slay his former owner, and flee from those who would persecute him, eventually reaching a country established by similar runaways.\n\nThe ideals of the Kása Free State greatly inspired Asinti, as living among so many zebras, deer, and griffons that had fled similar fates and desired to end slavery and serfdom across the world, convinced the zebra shaman that maybe there is a way to do more than survive. His otherworldly ally, like always, was supporting and helpful, agreeing with the notion, and even suggesting a rather fascinating plan. According to the creature, Asinti was a very unique individual, with a spirit that burned like a roaring fire, allowing him to interact with the plane of the divine, and thus could be noticed by deities and spirits that resided there. Most other creatures lacked such a trait and thus lacked the power to liberate themselves. But what if they could somehow be connected to this realm of the divine?\n\nHowever, this was not such an easy task as no matter what Asinti tried, he could not find what exactly made him so special. As years and even decades went on, with increasing desperation from the increasing brutality of the modern world, and with the whispers from beyond always encouraging him, the zebra chose to employ more questionable methods in order to complete his research. Eventually Asinti would succeed, and rather than simply connecting to this plane, Asinti discovered a way to transfer the creatures of the immaterium into the bodies of living things. He saw it as the solution to the seemingly eternal struggle of Kása, even if the methods leading to its discovery had been morally dubious. The leadership of Kása reacted to revealed actions of Asinti with horror, and the zebra shaman was swiftly driven out of the country.\n\nWhile Asinti had many disagreements with other members of the Pentarchy, the Ambrosius' proposal and access to all the magical knowledge and resources it brought was too good to pass up. After all, with these means the elder zebra shaman could now achieve the end he was striving for so long."
bar_pen_ambrosius_info_text:0 "Once a prominent merchant and artisan, Ambrosius lived a decadent life, constantly surrounded by luxury and wealth. His true goal however, joining the elite circles of the noble class, always remained out of his hooves, no matter how much he spent on lavish appearances and rare magical artefacts. To his peers in their lofty castles, Ambrosius would always remain a haughty upstart, grasping at something just out of reach.\n\nEventually Ambrosius would grow tired of conventional life. He retreated to his stately mansion in the Barrad countryside, away from the courtly intrigue of Wittenburgh, where he began unravelling the true mysteries of magic. Lack of progress drove Ambrosius to boredom, and he returned to his usual routine of courting local nobles. They were more receptive to his silver tongue, and even began to see Ambrosius as one of them, which would later become crucial. Rumors began to float that Ambrosius was engaged in acts of debauchery that would shame the most decadent of nobles, or that he conspired with malevolent spirits for a grasp at forbidden power. These rumors were ultimately dismissed as merely fever dreams and servant gossip, until it was too late.\n\nOne day, Barrad became wrapped in fog and storm, impenetrable to sight and body, nopony knowing what transpired for weeks until the mists cleared. As Wittenland's authority had become increasingly atrophied, Ambrosius had a free reign ruling over the blasted earth, the trapped ponies remaining as his playthings and subjects of experiments. Over time, he would invite like-minded creatures to join him in the pursuit for knowledge, without ethical strings attached. It would seem that Ambrosius was finally cured of his restless ennui, or so he convinces himself."
bar_pen_leopold_info_text:0 "The desire to help others is a noble one, especially when one wants to help an entire continent, if not the world. It was this desire that would define the life of a griffon known as Leopold.\n\nLeopold was born in and would spend his early life in the Herzland, the heart of the Empire, and of course, one of the most technologically and scientifically advanced regions of the world. Perhaps this is why the griffon managed to survive his adolescence, though most agree it would be better if he perished as a chick. For since his very first years, Leopold was a very sickly griffon, with only the best medicine available preserving his life.\n\nIt was this sickness and weakness that accompanied him his whole life, combined with his genius, that would define Leopold's life goal. Unlike any of the other great minds of Griffonia, even those from universities such as Gamia, he began to devise a less conventional solution for biological issues. He believed that instead of relying on medicine or even biological modifications, it would be technological enhancement that would allow sickly and weak to survive and reach their potential. This belief was only reinforced when Leopold managed to somewhat alleviate his own maladies with the usage of magical crystal injections and by implanting enchanted machines which assisted his organs. These additions also had the effect of greatly increasing Leopold's physical abilities far beyond what he had previously been capable of.\n\nThis side effect led to even more unorthodox and, to many, unacceptable ideas that the griffon had to alleviate the endless and every increasing number of issues that effected Griffonia. Instead of just using his research to heal the weak and broken, Leopold could use it to protect them from becoming as such in the first place. By creating a force of griffons that through the usage of magical technology were pushed beyond the limits of their flesh, the weak could be protected for generations, and the strong could resist the ravages of age and disability. After all, considering the most prosperous and stable realm in the world - Equestria, has survived for a thousand years through the efforts of the great few, how long might Griffonia last under the care of such heroes, even if they were manufactured?\n\nHowever, to most, even the most wicked of Gamia, the prospect seemed like insanity and perhaps even the worst of heresies, and thus Leopold was forced to flee beyond where the rapidly shrinking power of the Griffonian Empire could hunt him down. In his exile he would be approached by Ambrosius, who to Leopold's surprise, applauded such an idea and more importantly, the potential of the mastermind behind it, inviting him to come to a domain where such ideas could be entertained.\n\nMany years have passed since then, and now Leopold is something far beyond the wide eyed idealist genius he once was. While initially reluctant to apply the usual Barrad methodology, the nightmarish brutality of the Republican Uprising, has convinced the Griffon that the sacrifices are worth the potential result. Furthermore, now Leopold doesn't limit himself to the idea of creating modified heroes, now believing that Griffonia needed its own "alicorns", demigods who could rule and protect the populace, and believes that through magical and technological modifications, he could become this savior."
bar_pen_viira_info_text:0 "When we are little, most of us are told that we are special, unique, and not quite like the other inhabitants of this world. In many cases this belief is shattered as we grow up, and learn the world is just too large for uniqueness, and that we are nothing special in the grand scheme of things. For very specific cases however, it's different. One of these special cases is Viira the Seer.\n\nViira was born as a deer with substantial magical powers. An especial rarity for a species who rarely possessed active magical abilities. Thus, she was spoiled in her youth, being treated like an offspring of the highest of lords, despite of her somewhat unremarkable bloodline, and taught the intricacies of the strange magic of the deer. It became quickly apparent that her innate power was rivaled only by her innate prowess, learning and mastering the few controlled magical abilities deer could have at an extremely young age. This was her greatest triumph yet, but one which wouldn't last. Viira would soon discover that many species were far more powerful than the deer, with regards to both their countries and their magical abilities.\n\nThis was a shattering revelation to the young doe, who thought herself on top of the world. But it also gave her inspiration. After all, if other creatures could use their magic to dominate the physical world to such an extent, why not the deer? The issue must have been that no seer had thought to or attempted to reach such heights, or of course was too weak or lazy to try achieving something. She would not be like that. This unfortunately meant that there was no future for Viira at her home, and so she left to wander the world, searching for any magical secrets which could lead to a deer becoming as powerful as the magic users of other races.\n\nViira would become somewhat of an oddity in many places, a single doe wandering the land in pristine exotic clothes which most don't recognize, much to the annoyance of the seer, usually carrying around several tomes for recording any new information. Her priorities and acting towards others would also be surprising to onlookers, as she would choose to speak with a simple peasant rather than the lord or flip from polite to furious all based on what sort of knowledge about magic the creature in question would possess. An exception to this pattern would be countries openly dominated by magicians, as these were the only places where Viira would show respect and even admiration, and try mingling with the elite in an attempt to learn how such paradises were created and governed. It would be during one of such meetings, that Viira would meet Ambrosius and hear about his proposal. She of course accepted, after all, who could refuse?\n\nNow Viira spends her time as one of the more distant members of the Barrad Pentarchy, studying magical arts within her quarters, trying to achieve the ability of dominating the material world through her magic so that one day she could bring this knowledge and the enlightened ideal of rule of the magical to the rest of deerkind."

Gąsienica has retained his intelligence and cleverness throughout his time in the Count's service, and is a well-liked and competent commander of troops.

He is then said to have been subjected to experiments which mutated him into an unstoppable killing machine.\n\nThe griffon's monstrous stature and reputation for brutality quickly earned him his position as the Count's Right Claw, acting as the Ambrosius' bodyguard as well as commanding his soldiers. But, as many who have underestimated Gąsienica have learned, brutality does not equal stupidity. Gąsienica has retained his intelligence and cleverness throughout his time in the Count's service, and is a well-liked and competent commander of troops. In fact, given the eccentricities of the Pentarchs, Gąsienica is often referred to as the last sane creature in Barrad."

He proudly pointed to a particularly odd bit of architecture, expecting it to be self-explanatory.\n\n"I can see that. It's certainly... something." Viira forced a polite smile. "Although I must say I am curious what's wrong with the ceiling." She took a few steps away from Asinti.\n\n"What?" Asinti raised an eyebrow, barely having time to glance upwards before becoming trapped by chunks of collapsing temple. Suddenly, the ground began shaking and a loud rumbling echoed throughout the entire temple.\n\n"A pity, but I'm afraid I can't stay any longer." Viira laughed. "Thanks for the tour!

Leopold watched them silently, glee filling him at the sight. They were crude, for now, but they were moving under their own power, and they would fight.\n\nMost of the clockworks were the simple model, an adequate machine at best, but one easily manufactured and replaced. Expendability was a virtue of its own after all, and these were expendable like few others.\n\nStill, he found the second generation clockworks much more appealing in so many ways. They stood taller, had stronger armor and moved faster as well as with greater precision. They were an actual threat one on one, even if not quite as deadly as he'd have wanted them to be. Naturally, the production costs skyrocketed, but that was the price of quality.\n\nThe last models though, were his pride and joy. They moved with a fluid grace that set them apart from the pure constructs, and their mechanical eyes scanned the environment, actually aware of their surroundings. They understood the world around them much better than any of the simpler clockworks, and they would be able to actively command the lesser clockworks in battle. Alas, it was a shame that he had not figured out how to make a true artificial intelligence, and that for now he had to cheat by binding a mortal soul into the machines. Then again, considering the lesser clockworks could be produced en masse, he had sacrifices to spare now."

They have been used for centuries and remained a well-guarded secret weapon, always feared by Wittenland's enemies. A Fire-siphon is a relatively simple pump with a nozzle, used to spray burning liquid simply known as "Wittenlandic fire". The ingredients of this incendiary and sticky substance are numerous and the full recipe is only known to Wittenlandic crafters, but it is known magic is involved in its production."

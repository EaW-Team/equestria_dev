 KTZ_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Shotel"
 KTZ_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "A shotel is a traditional weapon of Abyssinia. It is a long, curved metal sword, appearing like a large sickle. The shape of the sword allows the wielder to bypass the shield of the enemy."
 KTZ_melee_equipment_1:0 "Paw Cannon"
 KTZ_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Paw Cannon"
 KTZ_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Paw cannons are the first firearms used in Abyssinia. Like their name implies, they are paw-held miniature cannons with an external fuse, without any kind of firing mechanism. It is infamously inaccurate, but the loud noise it makes has a strong effect on the enemy's morale."

 KTZ_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Garcano M91"
 KTZ_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "As part of the agreement with Wingbardy, Abyssinia received an ample supply of rifles, with instructions on how to manufacture more of them. The M91 is the last Garcano model that saw widespread use by the Abyssinian army."

No one says this out loud though, and the M91 is still considered the last Garcano model used in Abyssinia."

 KTZ_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Bronze Mortar"
 KTZ_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "Queen Mewodora II famously commissioned the creation of the first domestic artillery weapons in Abyssinia. These massive bronze mortars are very unwieldy and inaccurate. It sometimes takes up to 800 slaves to move one mortar."

 KTZ_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "Cannone da 75/27"
 KTZ_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Wingbardian artillery guns proved to be far superior to the crude mortars of old, but were also very expensive to produce due to licensing costs. As such, initially only the Crown Guard utilized them."
 KTZ_artillery_equipment_2:0 "105mm Mountain Meow-Howitzer"
 KTZ_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Mountain Meowitzer"
 KTZ_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "Meowitzers are light howitzers developed for usage in Abyssinia's rough and mountainous terrain. It is easy to deploy and disassemble, allowing artillery units to rapidly change positions after firing, and it can shoot at very high angles. The name comes from the designer of the weapon, Kebede Meow, who based his design on foreign howitzers."

### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 KTZ_kaiser_kattail:0 "Kaiser Kattail"
 KTZ_kaiser_kattail_desc:0 "Kaiser Kattail is the supreme, mostly-undisputed ruler of the infamous Katzenartig Imperium. Charismatic and mysterious, yet markedly goofy at times, Kattail is known for his utterly insane megalomaniac tendencies that drive him to seek the ultimately unattainable goal of conquering all that exists.\n\nRegardless of the fundamental impossibility of this lofty scheme, he is nonetheless unwilling to give up on attempting to achieve universal conquest, something which he has done countless times before thanks to his ability to travel to future Universal Cycles, essentially granting him near-unlimited attempts. Thus, most of his supposed genius and competence is simply the result of brute-force trial and error.\n\nDespite his imperialistic tendencies, Kattail vehemently believes that all species must be treated equally, and can thus be described as a sort of semi-benevolent despot who does genuinely wish to improve the lives of his subjects. However, while he attempts to enforce equality between all citizens of his empire, regardless of their origin, dissent is nevertheless cracked down upon, and local cultures tend to be erased or amalgamated into Katzen culture whenever possible.\n\nIt is thus difficult to define whether Kattail is villainous or benevolent, as while his empire tries to provide good living conditions to every single of its citizens, things can quickly take a turn for the worse should his empire find itself on the back foot militarily, with forced conscription and harsh crackdowns becoming the norm in a desperate attempt to keep the empire alive.\n\n§4For more information pertaining to Kaiser Kattail, check out his Wiki Page on the Gigastructural Engineering Lore Database website!§!"

### FOCUS ### 

 KTZ_this_isnt_flusion:0 "This Isn't Flusion..."
 KTZ_this_isnt_flusion_desc:0 "Wherever this is, it isn't Flusion. Everything is strange, different and odd. Perhaps this is a chance to start afresh, with ripe clay for moulding."
 KTZ_but_their_technology:0 "...But their Technology..."
 KTZ_but_their_technology_desc:0 "Whilst the felines here do not have the technological might of Flusion, it is at least sufficient for the Kaiser to guide them and to begin a fresh conquest on unspoiled land."
 KTZ_and_their_powers:0 "...And Their Powers..." #Comma
 KTZ_and_their_powers_desc:0 "Something odd here sets this world far apart from Flusion. By all known laws of physics, what passes for normal here should not be possible. Instead of raging at the inconsistency of it all, though, Kattail can see the use of all this new... stuff. Magic, they call it."
 KTZ_are_worth_taking_over:0 "...Are Worth Taking Over!" #Comma
 KTZ_are_worth_taking_over_desc:0 "Abyssinia may just be the springboard the Kaiser needs for the path ahead: a species that look just like him, political turmoil not too dissimilar from Flusion's, and a population who clearly has no experience with someone who can play them like a fiddle (for Kattail has done so millions of times)."
 KTZ_cementing_my_grasp:0 "Cementing my Grasp"
 KTZ_cementing_my_grasp_desc:0 "While the capital may be loyal to Kattail, much of Abyssinia's countryside remains under the de-facto control of noble rabble who do not necessarily wish to follow through with their new sovereign's ideas of grandeur. However, as Kattail knows well, if he is to lead his nation into the future then said nation must be united as one. As such they shall bend... or break."
 KTZ_food_for_the_masses:0 "Matters of Sustenance"
 KTZ_food_for_the_masses_desc:0 "With harsh climate and inefficient agriculture, Abyssinia finds itself in a precarious food situation. And what good are millions of would-be soldiers if they fall over from hunger after taking five steps? As great as he might be, Kattail simply cannot materialize food out of thin air, and so we may have to look outwards for the time being."
 KTZ_free_the_slaves:0 "Under New Management"
 KTZ_free_the_slaves_desc:0 "Slavery! What is it good for? The previous feline rulers of this land have indulged upon this detestable practice for so long that a veritable catastrophe looms over the nation should nothing be done to improve the lot of the downtrodden."
 KTZ_kiloforges:0 "Build Kiloforges"
 KTZ_kiloforges_desc:0 "With a sprinkling of Katzen know-how and a hefty dose of Katzen industrial might, things will start to get interesting. Establishing of Kiloforges will help pump out the machinery of war for the Kaiser's plans."
 KTZ_kiloforges_tt:0 "New §YManufacturers§! or §YMIOs§! will be available."
 KTZ_the_trains_run_on_time:0 ""The Trains Run on Time""
 KTZ_the_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "In a long-forgotten cycle, a bunch of pizza-eaters revered this Beakolini-sound-alike figure who allegedly made the trains run on time. (Unrelated to that: the Kaiser orbital-bombarded them into submission) Still, everything working smoothly will be a miraculous turn-around for these battered kats."
 KTZ_the_sieger_project:0 "Projekt 1: Towards the Riesieger"
 KTZ_the_sieger_project_desc:0 "The pitiable hunks of metal that pass for "armour" here will be a thing of the past. It may be too early to think of space-faring behemoths powered by entire solar systems, but the Kaiser's know-how can produce the next best thing with limited resources: a tank that screams "overlord.""
 KTZ_establish_production_lines:0 "Establish Foundries"
 KTZ_establish_production_lines_desc:0 "Whilst they may not be Kiloforges, a serious effort should be made to rip out surplus buildings and turn it into manufacturing forges. This will help alleviate some of the production demand."
 KTZ_project_two_the_tractor:0 "Projekt 2: The Katzen-Kampfpanzer"
 KTZ_project_two_the_tractor_desc:0 "Close your eyes and imagine the thunder of wheels across these dunes. Behold an entire country blessed with the power of wheels. Every kat, a trucker—and they better be, if they are to keep up the pace."
 KTZ_every_kat_must_do_their_duty:0 "Every Kat Must Do Their Duty" 
 KTZ_every_kat_must_do_their_duty_desc:0 "In Kattail's many cycles, he has found that many civilizations do not effectively use their populations in wartime. Why limit the contribution to just the adults? The more Kats in the military, whether on the frontlines or in the factories, the better. A bullet is deadly no matter who fires it and every able-bodied katzen who contributes to the war effort is essential."
 KTZ_the_mark_in_your_pocket:0 "The Mark in Your Pocket"
 KTZ_the_mark_in_your_pocket_desc:0 "Cities and villages alike will flood with money, both a promise of inconceivable prosperity and a sweetener to make the bitter reality of war go down once we walk into the rest of the world uninvited... and if they're worried about spending too much, the Kaiser's smile graces each coin, blessing every transaction."
 KTZ_katnological_marvels:0 "Katnological Marvels"
 KTZ_katnological_marvels_desc:0 "For Katzens nationwide, it is time to break the chains of ignorance. The Kaiser's great intellect has already shown, with primitive materials, what can be possible. Let's be optimists and discover what boundaries we can break when we innovate together."
 KTZ_thunderstorm_and_lightning:0 "Thunderstorm and Lightning"
 KTZ_thunderstorm_and_lightning_desc:0 "Whip everyone into a fervour! Frenzy, battle, fighting! A few speeches and some witty repartee will be more than enough to stoke the fires of conquest in the Kaiser's name."
 KTZ_very_very_frightening:0 "Very Very Frightening"
 KTZ_very_very_frightening_desc:0 "With catlike tread, our agents steal into the night, venting into foreign offices and snooping in on emergency meetings. Pretty soon, we'll have sleeper felines (and sleepy felines) embedded in every one of our neighbours, and they shall face the terror that is an agency's freakishly unpronounceable name."
 KTZ_i_have_a_dream:0 "I Have a Dream"
 KTZ_i_have_a_dream_desc:0 "The Abyssinia of old was limited by its lack of ambition. Every feline monarch in the past would've said 'Impossible!'' at the mere idea of a single continent under their rule. Kattail is the first to say never to never as his Katzens march to prove their ancestors wrong. And it begins by ridding ourselves of this troublesome Wingbardian influence."
 KTZ_the_end_of_all:0 "The End of All Things"
 KTZ_the_end_of_all_desc:0 "The brilliant chessmaster that is Kaiser Kattail is at his best brooding over the next step to greatness. A cantankerous few might say it should be an easy stomp-fest, but Kattail has decades, centuries, possibly even millenniums of experience to back up his striving for that one fool-proof offensive."
 KTZ_new_world_old_acquaintances:0 "New World, Old Acquaintances"
 KTZ_new_world_old_acquaintances_desc:0 "In nearly every iteration of Flusion, several friendly faces have popped up like universal constants in the Kaiser's rise to power. Although this Cycle seems highly irregular, those good old allies of his shall arrive to seize the day!... even if they just need some reminding about who they are."
 KTZ_let_loose_the_cries_of_war:0 "Let Loose the Cries of War" 
 KTZ_let_loose_the_cries_of_war_desc:0 "We must not count days, we must not count miles, for we must count only the territories we gain and the numbers we stack against those who stand in our way. We must let loose the propaganda machine and push onward to victories waiting for us!"
 KTZ_towards_the_sea:0 "Towards the Sea" 
 KTZ_towards_the_sea_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves strong on land. Yet, we cannot hope to win further victories and gain more land if we cannot sail across the seas and oceans. Our sights must now turn to the lands beyond the shores of Zebrica."
 KTZ_exploit_the_oil:0 "Exploit the Oil" 
 KTZ_exploit_the_oil_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of our new empire. If we wish to survive, then we must not waste the expertise of our citizens for nothing. Surveys and proper funding for oil extraction and processing must begin very soon."
 KTZ_modernized_work_programmes:0 "Modernized Work Programmes" 
 KTZ_modernized_work_programmes_desc:0 "While it is nice to put our backs into our labor, it certainly would be nicer if we could invest in the equipment of our workforce and ensure that the projects we have are not backwards in thinking. Innovation, investments, and improvements should be the order of the day."
 KTZ_trade_with_the_worlds:0 "Integration of the Worthy" 
 KTZ_trade_with_the_worlds_desc:0 "While we certainly can have some use for the cultures that we've absorbed through our conquests, it is vital that we carefully consider which of these are worthy of greater things. Integrating the more loyal and skilled creatures would mean a much easier process of establishing our control and legitimacy over any new territories we have gained so far."
 KTZ_crack_the_lines:0 "Crack the Lines"
 KTZ_crack_the_lines_desc:0 "The feline body is not suited for the lightning war required to conquer the world. Luckily, Kattail knows of a certain crystal substance that may help. But using these crystals for defense is not something we can commit to all the time. We can't afford to put our troops through lengthy sieges or fancy maneuver operations. Our katzen must punch through the enemy lines and bite hard."
 KTZ_march_on_mages:0 "March on the Magocracy"
 KTZ_march_on_mages_desc:0 "This Maretania has the tools and artefacts needed to better utilise (or profane) this world's magic. Their whole gimmick of confining these entities away just won't do for eager conquerors: Putting them on the field will give them results far more accurate than any peer-reviewed study can produce. To that end, we must push our way toward their well-guarded caverns, no matter the cost."
 KTZ_project_three_claw_steel:0 "Projekt 3: Supertensile Blast Plates"
 KTZ_project_three_claw_steel_desc:0 "The old tanks were stop-gap measures. Some more Katzen know-how will make true machines of war! Afterall, there is no such thing as a tank that's too big."
 KTZ_the_vaults_are_open:0 "The Vaults are Open"
 KTZ_the_vaults_are_open_desc:0 "We might've breached containment a bit too much, given that we still need to look for where these artefacts are. Still, we've gathered that what these mages have been studying were of Aeternite origin, so no time to waste!"
 KTZ_enlighten_them:0 "Enlighten Them"
 KTZ_enlighten_them_desc:0 "The Kaiser pierces through the abyss of ignorance like a lantern. The blessings of his reign penetrates many minds, and they've borne further fruit: reading, available to all at your nearest public library!"
 KTZ_clock_is_ticking_kattail:0 "Clock is Ticking, Kattail!"
 KTZ_clock_is_ticking_kattail_desc:0 "Running an empire is like riding a bike, wherein momentum keeps you, well, moving. That, or some public vehicle rigged to explode if you go lower than a certain speed. Either way, such hyper-militarization does not come for free: the empire's maw must grow, lest it collapse under its sheer obesity."
 KTZ_victory_parades:0 "Victory Parades"
 KTZ_victory_parades_desc:0 "In a matter of months, we've accomplished what few, if any, have done. These cats, who've had nothing to aspire to before we arrived, have experienced joy after joy, achievement after achievement. Making official these celebrations will keep their thoughts away from the gargantuan need for yet more..."
 KTZ_katzenfication_take_one:0 "Begin Katzenfication Protocols"
 KTZ_katzenfication_take_one_desc:0 "We are not club-wielding brutes, despite our rivals' slander. The Katzens' long history with and admiration for war has turned the affair into a rejuvenating, civilising force... a zeitgeist this planet's cats (and otherwise) are not used to yet but will happily adopt. When the Imperium strings along victory after victory, everyone will want to be a Katzen!"
 KTZ_strongarm_wingbardy:0 "Just One Missing Piece"
 KTZ_strongarm_wingbardy_desc:0 "At long last we have accumulated sufficient strength to impose our will upon the perfidious Griffons who still retain a foothold in our rightful lands. The time has come to correct this historical anomaly."
 KTZ_the_zebtropa_plan:0 "The Zebtropa Plan"
 KTZ_the_zebtropa_plan_desc:0 "It's a few centuries too early for water cities, so let's settle for second-best: a dam to drain the Arabian Sea and reveal new lands for settlement and industry. A massive diplomatic power play, to be sure, though the details are rather top secret."
 KTZ_a_grand_gesture:0 "A Grand Gesture"
 KTZ_a_grand_gesture_desc:0 "From sea to shining sea? Not exactly, but the Kaiser has done a great deal in such short time. This world's power blocs will surely realise that the Katzens are here to stay. They will surely send their best to stop us. To that, we say:\n\nBring it."
 KTZ_continental_ambitions:0 "Continental Ambitions"
 KTZ_continental_ambitions_desc:0 "An empire's first obstacle is distance, the bane of every ruler's desires, from levying armies to nabbing taxes. Roads and rail may be kindergarten to the Kaiser, but he knows their necessity in cementing the Imperium's gains."
 KTZ_along_the_sea:0 "Along the Sea"
 KTZ_along_the_sea_desc:0 "From the Zarantian dunes where spices and other exotics flow to the suspiciously similar pyramids of the suspiciously named Maregypt, there is a lot of valuable coastland (that isn't desert). They're ripe to be the staging of more serious campaigns."
 KTZ_the_capable_hippogriffs:0 "The Capable Hippogriffs"
 KTZ_the_capable_hippogriffs_desc:0 "Across the strait lies the proud islands of Hippogriffia, whose natives pose a real threat of combined naval and aerial operations by virtue of shapeshifting from winged creatures into seahorses. However, any challenge is a good challenge, and soon, they'll collectively transform from independant into subservient."
 KTZ_the_road_ahead:0 "The Road Ahead"
 KTZ_the_road_ahead_desc:0 "What stands between the Imperium and the other two landmasses with their envious eyes are the seas. These deep waters will inevitably be our bridge to the rest of the planet, though before we can mount a magnanimous landing force, we require the fleet to match. Let's re-orient several city-wide factory districts this way..."
 KTZ_cleaning_up_stragglers:0 "Cleaning up Stragglers"
 KTZ_cleaning_up_stragglers_desc:0 "North-east Zebrica is nearly ours. There is but one civilisation left to challenge: Colthage, a (probably) not-so-stable republic with quite the corrupt and nepotist recent history. Whatever ails it now, the future cadaver of Zonicia's pride will make for a fine souvenir."
 KTZ_the_queen_over_the_water:0 "The Queen over the Water"
 KTZ_the_queen_over_the_water_desc:0 "Without fear or apology, the Katzen Navy shall stand supreme. The beaked fish people across the channels will receive our heavily armed courtesy calls. They can either submerge themselves into their graves or surrender to keep their aquatic homes intact."
 KTZ_downfall:0 "Downfall"

 KTZ_fixing_abyssinia_cat_desc:0 "Kattail dreams of turning a bankrupt backwater into a globe-spanning empire the likes of which history has never seen before. Tremendous effort will have to be poured into overhauling and optimizing every facet of [KTZ.GetAdjective] society if his ambitions are to be realized before the stars burn out."

 KTZ_tour_abyssinian_front_state:0 "Personally Tour [From.GetName]"
 KTZ_tour_abyssinian_front_state_desc:0 "It is not common for a Katzen as busy as Kattail to remain in the same place for more than a few days. Deals need signing, warplans need revising and frontlines need overseeing. Going the extra mile to directly talk to the members of the Old-Abyssinian Front in [From.GetName] over a month may alleviate their concerns, although Kattail being gone for long will have consequences on the smooth running of the state."
 KTZ_kattail_on_tour:0 "Kattail is touring a state."

 KTZ_katzenify_the_nobles:0 "Further Katzenification of the Nobility"
 KTZ_katzenify_the_nobles_desc:0 "While the Mesafint has been converted into provincial governor, many of them still cling onto their old Abyssinian identities. They must understand that they are now part of a greater whole. They will most notably be trained in matters martial as to ensure their ability to contribute to Kattail's grand conquests."

 KTZ_educate_the_nobles:0 "Dedicated Governor Education"
 KTZ_educate_the_nobles_desc:0 "Much of our Mesafint-turned-governors are, to put it plainly, unfit to govern a modern province in a modern state. Can one blame them? After all, they are used to lording over feudal fiefdoms in an agrarian backwater rather than managing the bureaucracy of a rapidly-expanding modern empire. Those willing to put in extra work should be provided the opportunity to hone their skills in the matter."

 KTZ_nobles_into_governors_1_desc:0 "The Mesafint has been formally abolished, with its members promoted to provincial governors instead.

 ### EVENTS ###

 katzen_AF.643.t:0 "The Old-Abyssinian Front"
 katzen_AF.643.d:0 "Much to Kattail's dismay, the jubilation associated with the reclamation of Purrsia and Katren is already waning as the newly-reclaimed provinces, which were not subjected to Katzenification owing to being under a foreign power, are struggling to find their place within the new Katzen order.\n\nWhile the Ras of Purrsia himself is as cooperative as one can be, the actual populations of the states are not so easily swayed, demonstrating only lukewarm enthusiasm towards the new culture and society which Kattail prepared for them.\n\nWorse still, their plight is evidently shared by parts of Katzennia proper as these provinces have organized alongside the somewhat neglected northern mountainous reaches of Katkat, Jirati and Meowtekel into a movement known as the Old-Abyssinian Front.\n\nSupporters of this movement include farmers, priests, former low-nobility and slave-owners who find themselves dillusioned by Kattail's promises, claiming that his centralist and expansionist policies left them as little more than an underdevelopped and irrelevant periphery, all while nonetheless robbing them of their lifestyle and culture.\n\nWhy then, should they follow Kattail, if all it will bring them is erasure into a collective which doesn't care about them? In blatant defiance, many of the movement's members have already renounced their Katzen names and in some places re-established pre-Kattail societal customs and orders.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers are currently waiting for orders from Kattail, as many are worried that taking too stern action may taint Kattail's image and shatter the impression of societal harmony which he had so painstakingly created. But this movement cannot be allowed to spread either, as much of Katzennia still consists of 'proud' Katzens who, mere years prior, were proud to be Abyssinian.\n\nWhile Kattail's policies certainly brought them glory, many nonetheless lost family members or friends during recent conquests, or have been forced out of their ancestral lifestyle for the sake of productivity. Is this really what they want?\n\nSome in Kattail's entourage are concerned that this may indicate a deeper fault within Kattail's delicately-crafted societal order. Who knows how fragile his 'Katzen' culture really is?"
 katzen_AF.643.a:0 "We must guide them back into civilisation."
 katzen_AF.643.a.tt:0 "The §YOld-Abyssinian Front§! has formed. We may handle it via the §YInternal Management§! decision category."

 katzen_AF.644.t:0 "[ktz_new_loyal_state.GetName] Loyal Once More"
 katzen_AF.644.d:0 "The inhabitants of [ktz_new_loyal_state.GetName] have at last seen reason and disbanded their branch of the Old-Abyssinian Front, evidently finally accepting Kattail's rule as legitimate."
 katzen_AF.644.a:0 "Splendid."

 katzen_AF.645.t:0 "United Once More"
 katzen_AF.645.d:0 "After months of carefully threading the needle between assertiveness and understanding, local authorities have proudly informed Kattail of the Old-Abyssinian Front's complete dissolution.\n\nKattail thus decided to embark on a tour of the formerly-rebellious northern provinces, as to cement this political and cultural victory. Starting in the newly-refurbished Purrgadae harbor, where he gave a resounding victory speech, Kattail made his way to Katren via a modern diesel boat, then over to Meowtekel on the newly-constructed high-speed railway crossing the formerly-impassable province of Dollo. He would then travel to Catemte aboard a picturesque mountain-train decorated in his honor.\n\nWhat a sight it was! These formerly backwater regions now boasted a state-of-the-art electric grid powered by high-altidude wind turbines, hospitals with the latest in medical technology, school networks fit for educating the next generation of loyal Katzens, and vast mining hubs extracting thousands of tons of valuable minerals to feed the Katzen military-industrial complex. And, most importantly - the northernmost tip of the peninsula had to be well-prepared as to become the staging ground for future invasions towards Equus and Griffonia.\n\nThe final stop was none other than the rock-hewn Temples of Felibela, a place of spiritual importance to old Abyssinian spirituality. While Katzennia had long-since discarded state religion, Kattail had nonetheless allowed the area to remain a cultural heritage site and place of worship for those who felt the need to continue practicing their faith."
 katzen_AF.645.a:0 "It almost felt like a vacation."

 katzen_AF.646.t:0 "The Star-Person"
 katzen_AF.646.d:0 "On the way to the temples they passed by a large mining town, freshly connected to the rest of Katzennia by a newly-built railway. The locals poured out of their apartment complexes to meet with the Kaiser himself. One of them was a young, plump kitten wearing a school uniform. He approached Kattail, and asked: 'You're the Kaiser, right? How do you know so much?'\n\nKattail smiled. 'Experience. It's all about experience. The more you do, the more you know.'\n\n'But you've only been around for a few years! And yet you brought so many fantastical technologies to us! And you knew exactly where to build everything! Daddy says even the Alicorns of Equestria couldn't do that. Are you... are you a god? Or wait. You told us not to believe in gods. Oh! Perhaps... did you come from the stars? I read about star-people in the books at school! You must be a star-person!' The kitten said, with stars in his eyes.\n\nA singular drop of sweat coalesced beneath the Kaiser's helmet. 'Oh, no. I just have great intuition, and I always surround myself with the best of the best.' He would gesture to Denjen, and Loris von Kattensbach, who stood by his side.\n\n'Wow!' The kitten stared in awe. 'Even then! You did all of this on your first try! Whenever I try to learn I make tons of mistakes before I pull through!'\n\nKattail stood silent for approximately five seconds as the kitten eyed him weirdly. Visions flooded his mind. The towns in open revolt at his policies. The quarries collapsing the mountainside and killing thousands. Railways leading to nowhere and budget ever-depleting. Revolution. Chaos. Defeat. Again. And again. And again...\n\n'I guess I'm just... lucky! Possibly blessed by Baast.' Kattail replied, as he hastily patted the kitten on the head and gave him a Katzmark before walking away with his aides."
 katzen_AF.646.a:0 "Are we at Felibela yet?"

 katzen_AF.647.t:0 "A Site of Pilgrimage"
 katzen_AF.647.d:0 "Finally Kattail's convoy reached Felibela. The temples were as resplendent as ever - thanks to his investments they became bustling touristic hubs attracting individuals of all races from throughout Kattail's recent conquests. Kattail gave his usual set of speeches and went off for a private walk throughout the temples. Well. As private as a walk can be when you're under the tightest of supervision by heavily-armed snipers, of course.\n\nHe sat down upon a rock next to a large statue of Baast as to personally speak with curious Katzens. It was more of the same - platitudes, admiration, gifts, thanks, the likes. Sometimes a thinly-veiled complaint about the destruction of Abyssinian heritage would break the monotony. Then came an old grey Katzen adorned in pure white clothes.\n\n'Greetings, Katzen. What is your name?' the Kaiser inquired.\n\n'It matters not. Names and titles - all are meaningless.', the feline replied.\n\n'Ah! You must be a priest of Felibel-'\n\n'Particularly in your case.', he interrupted. 'You are not Kattail. You are not a Kaiser. You are Conquest. That is all you are. And is all you will ever be.'\n\nKattail felt... oddly flustered? 'Well. That's an overstatement. I conquer, yes, but I bring prosperity too. That is not my only purpose.'\n\nThe old priest continued unfazed. 'You conquer. You conquer more. And more. What will you do, O Conquest, when there will be no more worlds to conquer?'\n\n'Well. If you want to play that game - there's always more to conquer. Enough to sustain us for millennia to come.'\n\n'So your task will never be done. It is futile.' He stared at Kattail for a few seconds. 'You live a sad life, Conquest. You will either perish, stagnate, or forever chase an unachievable goal. I pray your next life is better, if this is not your ninth already.'. The priest turned around and left before Kattail could respond.\n\nKattail's usually proud smile would unperceptibly bend into a frown for a fraction of a second. It was time to return to Katown. His empire needs ruling..."
 katzen_AF.647.a:0 "That fool knows nothing."

 katzen_AF.648.t:0 "Global Embargo Declared against Kattail!"
 katzen_AF.648.d: "In light of Kattail's blatant encroachement upon the territorial sovereignty of an entire continent, and his now-evident intent to take over the entire world, the international community has unilaterally decreed the establishment of a total trade embargo upon [KTZ.GetNameDef].\n\nEffective immediately, the Katzens will be completely isolated for international trade, in hopes of starving out their war machine before it can engulf any more sovereign states."
 katzen_AF.648.a:0 "Good, good."

This will drastically increase the negative consequences of a food deficit on our nation."
 katzen_AF.649.a:0 "We don't need them!"
 katzen_AF.649.a.tt:0 "Having a negative §YNutritional Balance§! will now incur §Rfar greater§! penalties."

 katzen_AF.650.t:0 "Food Situation Degrades"
 katzen_AF.650.d:0 "As much as Kattail would like it be to the case, the logistics of a continent-spanning empire cannot ever be perfect. Our recent and blisteringly rapid expansion across the world is putting severe strain on our food distribution networks. This will negatively impact food safety throughout [KTZ.GetNameDef]."
 katzen_AF.650.a:0 "It shall be resolved in due time."

 katzen_AF.640.t:0 "To Feed an Empire"
 katzen_AF.640.d:0 "'Thirty-five-percent.', Dejen said calmly to Kattail. The two felines were in the middle of touring Abyssinia's arable foothills aboard a small airship.\n\n'Are you certain?', Kattail replied as he leaned nonchalently against a railing on the airship's deck, glaring at the endless fields of coffee and khatnip stretching beneath him.\n\nFlipping through some notes, Dejen continued. 'Yes. That is how much Abyssin-er, Katzennia's current agricultural capacity can sustain your planned population growth policies and... high-protein combat diets. We are headed for complete collapse at this ra-'\n\n'We will buy it.', Kattail interjected. 'Simple as that.'\n\n'With the current wealth of Abyssinia, we will not be able to do that for very long. This will bankrupt the nation. More than it already is.'\n\nKattail's tone remained almost emotionless. 'No matter. It will feed our populace just long enough for us to then seize what we need.'\n\n'From whom? The donkeys down south also lack rich agriculture, and they are the only viable targets.'\n\n'From the Arabians, from the Great Lakes, and the Hippogriffs, maybe even the Kirians. They have rich breadbaskets that will feed our growing nation.'\n\nDenjen took a few seconds to process what the 'Kaiser' had just uttered. So he was serious about this whole... continental conquest affair? When Kattail first mentioned these plans, Denjen believed them to be some far-flung goal which his descendants would take care of in due time.\n\n'With... with all due respect, this will bring nothing but ruin to Abyssinia. We cannot take on Arabia, let alone the entirety of Zebrica!' Denjen noticed a frown forming on Kattail's face as he spoke.\n\n'...but, fret not! If you want, I can draft some ten-year plans to fix up our agriculture, and then we can look at southwards expansion if you so desire...'\n\nKattail let out a slight as Denjen rambled on about long-term planning and quotas and all that. There was no time for such niceties. He would cajole the breadbaskets of the world, get them to kindly feed him, and then he would bite these fools back and take what he needed. However, Denjen was still right. Maybe it wouldn't work out. Maybe Abyssinia would starve and collapse before any of this could be executed.\n\nBut, well. There was always next time."
 katzen_AF.640.a:0 "Denjen needs to think bigger."
 katzen_AF.640.tt:0 "We can now manage Katzennia's food situation via the §YTo Feed an Empire§! decision category."

 katzen_AF.642.t:0 "Untangling the Patchwork"
 katzen_AF.642.d:0 "Kattail kicked back on his ornate chair in his new palace-office as he studied the intricate patchwork of noble houses and clans making up his newly-acquired nation. Right now, his rule was less than absolute. While he and his supporters had seized full control of the capital, these 'Mesafint', as they were called, pretty much controlled the rest of the nation.\n\nHe smiled softly - at last, something familiar! This was essentially the same situation he usually found himself into when taking over the Cat Kingdom back on Flusion, which is usually dominated by dozens of noble families loosely held together by a central authority.\n\nBut, given Abyssinia had two orders of magnitude less subjects, this would surely be a far simpler affair. However, not all would be so easy. While on Flusion the Cat Kingdom's central authority nonetheless retained much influence over its squabbling houses, here, due to the previous Abyssinian king becoming politically incapable, the Mesafint believed themselves to have free reign over the governance of Abyssinia.\n\nThis would have to be resolved under short order. As he had secured the army's loyalty he could, in theory, strongarm all of them into submission, but given the sorry state of Abyssinia he couldn't really afford to tear its entire political structure down just yet.\n\nRather, he would start by formally abolishing nobility and reorganizing the nation's administration. As to avoid rebellion, upset nobles would then become the new provincial governors, which would, of course, allow them to retain significant leverage. This influence would, hopefully, be eroded and subdued as Katzennia expanded and its newly-acquired territories found themselves under the control of Kattail's loyalists, enabling more and more of the former nobility to be convinced to retire, step down, or fully embrace Kattail's dominance.\n\nBut for the time being, they will have to be cooperated with..."
 katzen_AF.642.a:0 "Ah! The joys of feudalism."
 katzen_AF.642.a.tt:0 "We can weaken the Noble-Governors' impact via the §YInternal Management of Katzennia§! decision category."

 katzen_AF.641.t:0 "Slaver's Bane"
 katzen_AF.641.d:0 "Kattail squinted as he read through a large manuscript detailling Abyssinia's administrative past.\n\n'Third Slave Revolt of 1005 ALB... First Slave Revolt of 1006 ALB...' Kattail was no stranger to slaver regimes, given they were a dime a dozen on the galactic stage, but, as morally abhorrent as they were, these had found the means of making slavery sustainable in the long term.\n\nBut... this? This was just a mess. Following the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinian slavery degenerated into a vicious cycle of uprisings and crackdowns, thus it actually provided little to no benefits to the nation's economy, not even in the short-term!\n\nKattail rolled his eyes as he closed the book. This too would have to be uprooted if he was to proceed with his plans. The next few weeks would be spent tirelessly working alongside Denjen to draft laws and regulations allowing for the slaves to be reinserted into society as free, productive members of the collective via jobs programs, education courses and land redistribution.\n\nBut how were the slaves to actually be freed? Legally-speaking, the plan was to reaffirm Queen Meowodara II's feline emancipation decree by extending the definition of 'feline' to... all sapient beings, as he personally intended.\n\nUnfortunately, this could not be done just yet. Much of Zebrican society - including those of his planned conquests, still relied on slavery. As tempting as it seemed to roll in and liberate the continent's servile caste, it would simply cause too much societal upheaval. His rule isn't quite absolute enough.\n\nFor now, progressives reforms will be undertaken whenever possible with compliant slave-owners, but Kattail knew this was merely delaying the inevitable."
 katzen_AF.641.a:0 "Kattail disliked pushing things back, but he had no choice."

 KTZ_progressive_emancipation:0 "Progressive Slavery Phase-Out"

 katzen_AF.654.t:0 "Rooting Out The Problem"
 katzen_AF.654.d:0 "With his empire spread sufficiently far, and most of his planned at last decently implemented, it was time for Kattail to tackle the beloathed remnants of Zebrican slavery which yet lingered within his realm. Indeed, while slavery was formally phased-out right after his takeover of Abyssinia, the practice was simply too engrained within numerous West Zebrican societies for it to be simply evicted and forgotten about without major societal upheaval. As such, he has implemented a number of slow reforms and programs to progressively emancipate slaves in conquered territories and transition towards a fully slavery-free society.\n\nBut it didn't suffice. While this worked to tremendously reduce the amount of 'official' slaves within [KTZ.GetNameDef], oftentimes the practice had simply morphed into other, more subtle forms. Some slaves were freed immediately, only to be re-hired under harsh worker contracts providing so little salary that it made little actual difference. Those who refused were more often than not coerced into acceptance by local mafias or paramilitary groups.\n\nWorse still! Some outright managed to retain slaves by obfuscating their administrative records. The still-lacking communications and transportation networks throughout much of Kattail's empire meant that Katzen authorities simply could not exert the vigilance and crackdowns necessary against these sneaky perpetrators.\n\nWith Kattail looking outwards, the time had come to take action. In front of him, laid out across his ornate desk, were two possible plans of actions drafted up by Denjen and Loris. The first plan was merely a continuation of current policies, aiming to covertly weed out slavery through political and societal pressure rather than outright coercion as to avoid conflict... but it would take several more years to be complete. Did Kattail really have that time? His delitcately-attuned societal model was running on a tight schedule, after all.\n\nHe eyed the second dossier, which proposed complete crackdowns upon any and all slavery and slavery-adjacent practices. Slave-owners would completely give up their slaves, now, or be shot. No in-between. Given his past reforms have had some time to take root, this could be undertaken without literally tearing society apart, but is nonetheless likely to cause a minor civil conflict across the nation.\n\nKattail ponders."
 katzen_AF.654.a:0 "There is time! Better be safe."
 katzen_AF.654.a:0 "Starting tomorrow there shan't be a single slave in my domain!"


 katzen_AF.612.t:0 "Run, run, run..."
 katzen_AF.612.d:0 "Meklit, or Karl as he was now called, was running.\n\nIt all began three days ago, when an officer came to his platoon's makeshift encampment and handed them paper maps roughly marking the locations of current enemy capitals. Still exhausted from an arduous campaign the day before, Karl barely had any time to look at it before the officer ordered everyone to get up and run to the marked locations.\n\nOf course, there was much confusion. These locations were dozens, if not hundreds of miles south. There was no feasible way for an Abyssin-er, Katzen, to get there without some sort of motorized transport, which the “Katzenarmee” sorely lacked.\n\nThe officer insisted that Kattail needed these cities to fall within the next two weeks, and fall they shall, he clamored, before handing everyone several rolls of what looked like off-brand Khatnip. Of course, believing it to be some nice relaxation ahead of the coming offensive, Karl wasted no time smoking his hard-earned roll.\n\nIt wouldn't take long for him to realise that it wasn't Khatnip at all. What it was, he wasn't sure, but he'd spend the next three days frantically running south, occasionally firing his antiquated rifle at some vaguely equine-looking figure.\n\nHe had lost track of his platoon long ago within the dunes. Supposedly, that didn't matter. Both opposing armies were spread so thin that the conflict really just depended on who could outmaneuver the other first.\n\nAfter running for so long, Karl's only wish was to finally get to an enemy city and partake in its triumphant capture, like the Kaiser said he'd get to do. Just gotta keep on going south, south, south. Where's the south again? He has no compass. Too expensive, the officer said, just use the sun, he had declared.\n\nThe sun, alright. It rises in the... west, yes, the west. Wait, does it? He can't remember. Whatever, it's almost over, he thinks, as he spots a city in the distance. At last! Three days of hell to be immortalized in the history books? Worth every minute, he figures.\n\nThere's a large sign ahead of the city. What will Karl's prize be, he ponders? Maybe they'll rename the city after him? Five minutes, and he's there. Five more minutes, and Karl's fainted on the ground beneath the sign's impeccable letters welcoming him back to Katzennia."
 katzen_AF.612.a:0 "It was the last welcome Karl would ever receive."

 katzen_AF.613.t:0 "Conquest Report - Klugetown"
 katzen_AF.613.d:0 "Following protracted urban warfare, the microstate of Klugetown and its half-a-million inhabitants have fallen under Katzen control. However, due to the state's extensive criminal underground, the situation remains unstable, with the overstretched Katzenbodentruppen struggling to put down the extensive resistance exerted by members of Klugetown's various cartels.\n\nOwing to its position as a hub of Zebrican crime and illegal smuggling, it is unrealistic to hope for the problem to go away on its own. As such, the officers in charge of garrisoning Klugetown have brought forth two proposals to be considered.\n\nThe first proposal suggests simply collaborating with Verko, the crime boss in charge of Klugetown, who has himself offered to work with us to act as a unifying force between the various organizations in Klugetown. One such agreement had already been established between Klugetown and the Storm King, which fostered Klugetown's prosperity and freed up the Storm King's forces for other purposes.\n\nThis proposal would effectively eliminate the issue of Klugetowner resistance in the short-term, but shatters the possibility of turning into a properly-integrated part of our empire. We could, however, work to regulate the city's illegal activities in a way which benefits us, albeit this comes with the risk of bolstering crime across Katzennia as a whole.\n\nThe second proposal is to toss Verko aside and work to uproot Klugetowner crime completely as to transform the city into a model Katzen state. This would be undertaken in collaboration with an Abyssinian resident of Klugetown known as Capper, known for his reformist pro-harmonic and anti-crime ideals.\n\nThis would undoubtedly be significantly more expensive and might detract from our current conquests, but would allow us to experiment with societal remodeling and “Katzenification” of conquered territories, all while securing a powerful industrial and trade hub in the long run.\n\nWhatever option we pick, the choice must be undertaken quickly before Klugetowner resistance grows out of control."
 katzen_AF.613.a:0 "Working with Verko is a safe bet given the situation."
 katzen_AF.613.b:0 "No compromises. Tear it down and rebuild it as Kattail orders!"

 katzen_AF.614.t:0 "The New Klugetown"
 katzen_AF.614.d:0 "Although it has taken extensive effort, our program to stamp out Klugetowner crime bore fruit. The city's extensive criminal underground has been mostly rooted out, while the incorporation of Abyssinian settlers into the city's population has helped tighten our grasp on the area under Capper's leadership.\n\nIt will still take several more years for it to truly be integrated into Katzen society, but the results bear promise regarding the prospect of further territorial integration."

 katzen_AF.653.d:0 "Kattail, flanked by his advisors, stood in front of an immense, ornate wood table onto which an intricate political map of Western Zebrica was laid out. Across the table from him stood a group of [katren_holder.GetAdjective] diplomats. Kattail glanced at the map, gesturing to his blistering conquests from Asstyria to Maretonia.\n\n'There is one error on this map, gentlebirds. Could you point it out for me?' the Kaiser said with an almost light-hearted tone. The diplomats looked to one another, uncertain of how to respond. One shook his head and slightly puffed out his chest.\n\nAssertively, he responded. 'There is no error, Herr Kattail. This map is correct. Your cartographers are very impressive.'\n\n'I suppose some aid will be needed.' A Katzen aide took out a set of pins and put them down on Katren and Purrsia. 'Is this better?'\n\n'These territories were rightfully ceded to [katren_holder.GetLeader] by past treaties. We are its legal controllers. This is not an error.', the same diplomat responded. There was whispering between the other Griffons.\n\n'Yes. Treaties signed with a now-defunct Abyssinian state. But consider.' Kattail grabbed a data sheet. 'Over the past five years, our industries, armies and population have all increased tenfold.' He looked back at the griffons. 'Have yours?'\n\nThe griffons remained silent for a few seconds, alternatively staring at the map and then Kattail. 'And so?', one tentatively replied.\n\n'And so, draw your own conclusions, gentlebirds. I have nothing else to add and as such this meeting is dismissed. I expect to hear from [katren_holder.GetLeader] regarding the correction of this cartographic anomaly by the end of next week.' Kattail would stare at the diplomats as they shook their heads and departed while mumbling amongst themselves.\n\nHe snickered to himself. He was usually more direct with his demands, but, given how irrelevant Wingbardy had become in the face of his ever-growing empire, he couldn't resist but put up this quaint little show every time a Cycle got to this point.\n\nAfter all, trying to conquer infinity can get a little repetitive after a while."

It mattered little in the end, Kattail thought, as he barreled through eternity and unto the next iteration of the Infinite Cycle, where he knew that another Flusion and its billions of zealous Katzens would be waiting for him to arrive and retry everything once more.\n\nKattail found himself in a cave, presumably somewhere near Katown. As he got up to exit the cave and restart his conquests, he felt... heavier than usual. How strange, had he put on weight since the last Cycle? No matter, he thought, as he walked out of the cave, expecting to be greeted by the familiar sight of the suburban outskirts of the Katown megalopolis.\n\nHowever, Katown was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the lukewarm and verdant plains of the Northern Katzen Herzlands. Instead, in front of him stretched a large, arid plain beneath a scorching, nearly-equatorial sun. There was no megalopolis in sight, only scattered and evidently rather poor villages surrounding a moderately large city in the distance.\n\nPerhaps he had arrived too early, back when Flusion was warmer? Or maybe this Flusion was simply different from the rest... or perhaps, he thought, as he stared at the rustic villages, strangely bereft of all the usual aspects of Katzen militarization..."

"Tell me. What is it that you like to do?'\n"Well... um... is this a date...?'\n"No, but I like that way of thinking. Carry on...'\n"Well I of course like a good military campaign, yes.'\n"Excellent. And do you yearn for the great beyond?'\n"I think I do yes, although I never really got the opportunity to really dive into what it actually is.'\n"Have you ever dreamed of piloting the moon?'\n"What?'\n"Well, have you?' the Kaiser said with an overtly serious tone in stark contrast with the question he had just asked.\n"Thinking about it... I think I did, when I was 6 or 7, yes. I was flying the moon with some giant cannon on it... it was pretty neat.'\nThe Kaiser's eyes brightened as the Katzen spoke. "Excellent. Then, I believe you've passed the test.'\n"Cool. What do I get?'\n"You get a new name.'\n"Pardon me?'\n"From now on, you are now Douclaw MacCathur, Grand General of the Katzenartig Imperium's armed forces.

He eventually concluded that, while it would be a brazen departure from his habits, this world had...certain potential, when it came to furthering his ambitions.\n\nIn the end, maybe all that his grand plans of universal domination needed to finally succeed were merely... a little bit of magic."

Of course, some false promises and manipulation had to be undertaken, but the repercussions of that would be dealt with in due time.\n\nNaturally, Kattail still expected King Gomez to resist and cause a civil war, but, much to his surprise, as he stepped into King Gomez's palace and confronted him in person, the monarch quite simply stared at Kattail, before handing him the crown, seemingly almost... happy, to do so. And well, that was that. After generously allowing Gomez to retire in a rural cottage, Kattail now found himself at the head of Abyssinia and its six million inhabitants.\n\nBut it was evident that this was only the beginning as the nation he had managed to take over was... not in the best of shapes, to say the least. Devastated by the Storm King, plagued by slave unrest, and threatened by Wingbardy's ambitions, Kattail knew that he'd need to put in quite a bit of elbow grease if he was to make any of it work."

After his livelihood was devastated by the Storm King's plundering, he had just barely managed to rebuild his life to an extent that he deemed acceptable and thus really didn't want to lose everything to the whims of some megalomaniac leader again.\n\n"Name, age, occupation, skills, ambitions?" The Katzen at the office's counter asked gruffly, snapping Tailbeba out of his thoughts.\n\n'Tailbeba Mewda, 37, laborer, hm, laboring, I guess? I did a bit of military training in my youth but nothing else... and...' Ambitions? That's an odd question, he thought. '...uuh... to travel the world, I suppose? I... never got the opportunity, being a peasant and all.'\n\n'Excellent. Then you're being assigned to the 1st Katzenkorps which is to be the Kaiser's finest. Forget about your peasantries though, the Kaiser will need the full potential of fresh Katzens like you if his visions are to be realized. As per the Katzenification Decree, you shall henceforth be known as Gustav Mewbert, proud Katzen of Katzennia,' the Katzen said, handing 'Gustav' some papers and a freshly stamped ID.\n\n'Well, welcome to your new life!

Built out of the finest Katzen concrete and steel." Kattail said triumphantly.\n\n"But... but why?"\n\n"I'm glad you asked. Well, it will hold back the ocean itself and allow for the reclamation of hundreds of square kilometers of land from the Arabian sea. A network of canals will keep former cities connected to the sea while we'll later be able to redirect the evaporated water to irrigate the Zebhara and turn it into something actually useful for our purposes."\n\nDumbfounded, the head engineer thought for a bit. He and everyone else knew that this Kattail was a megalomaniac, but to dry a sea was a whole new level of insanity, really. "We'll... we'll need some time to think about the schematics, Herr Kai-"\n\n"Ah, the schematics, do not fret! I've got a few leads." Kattail said as he pulled out a thick pile of paper from a suitcase before setting it down in front of the engineers. "I've done some of the preliminary thinking by myself, you should find that most of the math checks out, we just need sufficient industrial capability and it should all work out."\n\nOf course, he could have provided the full schematics, but that would have been a bit too... suspicious. And besides, letting them fill in the blanks was a good test of their competence, Kattail thought as he watched his engineers trying to make sense of the plans..."

 katzen_AF.25.d:0 "Meorge Pawtton, the proud Abyssinian-turned-Katzen serving as the head marshall of the Katzenarmee, was sitting in his well-furnished office in Katown. The rapid growth of the Kaiser's empire required constant attention in order to stave off catastrophic collapse and so that is exactly what Pawtton dedicated his life to, but right now he was simply enjoying a nice break with a bottle of Colthaginian whisky.\n\nAnd then... it appeared. In the corner of his eye, seemingly out of thin air, some sort of... creature? Monster? Entity? Pawtton was at an utter loss for words, for whatever that was, it looked nothing like anything he had ever seen before in his entire life.\n\nNow hovering in the middle of his office was a strange, L-shaped geometrical entity, made out of some unknown dark material criss-crossed by eerie glowing green lights and exhibiting a pair of what appeared to be circular "eyes" seemingly looking around the office as the creature slowly rotated to observe its surroundings, making some sort of low humming sound.\n\nInitially struck by some primordial fear of this supernatural entity, Pawtton quickly glanced at his bottle of whisky and then at the creature before shrugging and speaking up in a coarse, authoritative yet slightly drunk voice.\n\n"Hello? You are within the office of Katzenmarshall Meorge Pawtton, please state your business at once or face..." Suddenly, Pawtton's own voice was cut off, as if he simply could not speak anymore, followed by the creature turning around and facing him head-on, its circular eyes... staring deep into Pawtton's soul.\n\n"Face what? Elaborate, Pawtton. I am most curious, for I currently mean no harm." the creature "spoke" with an almost-ethereal voice which, given that the entity had no mouth to speak of, seemed to resonate within Pawtton's mind. And how did it know Pawtton's name? How come he seemed unable to speak seconds ago? How was it speaking with no mouth? Thoughts rushed around Pawtton's mind as he thought about his reply..."

It said as it seemingly looked towards Pawtton's Katzenluger, "You may want to invest into better weaponry in the coming millennia."\n\nPawtton found the courage to speak up. "Well... I mean, that's not up to me, really... besides... millennia? We'll all be dead by then anyways. Everything dies doesn't it? I heard even the universe and creation themselves were gonna die in the end, so I don't bother with thinking so far ahead... better to focus on the present," he said, as the creature just stared at him.\n\n"Don't be so sure. Although, I like you, you have your charm, so I'll help you a bit, just this once." the entity said before Pawtton suddenly sensed his thoughts becoming faster and his mind sharper. "Farewell, for now." And with that, the creature quite simply vanished from Pawtton's office without a trace, disappearing into thin air leaving nothing behind.\n\nPawtton stared at the empty area where the creature used to be, and noticed that his mind truly did feel... clearer, as if his very consciousness somehow had been made more efficient. Was this the creature's doing? No matter, he thought. He glanced at his bottle of whisky, and, with his newfound clairvoyance, threw it out the window before resuming his break."

katzen_AF.252.d:0 "Pawtton got up from beneath the desk to find the creature completely unfazed. His grenade had simply vanished and so had the shots fired at the entity. Just as Pawtton was about to scream something, his speech was once again cut off as the entity spoke up.\n\n"This, Pawtton, is most uncouth. I simply arrive for a gentle discussion with your kind, and such is how I am welcomed?"\n\nAs the creature spoke, Pawtton felt a feeling of primordial... hatred, for this pretentious trespasser. Without hesitation he called up reinforcements via an emergency button and soon enough dozens of Katzen soldiers stormed into the large office, surrounding the entity with armed rifles which soon began to fire. The entity, however, remained unfazed, seemingly just absorbing the machine gun fire into itself while continuing to stare at Pawtton, who, alongside the soldiers, began to panic.\n\nIt quickly turned into a veritable commotion as more and more soldiers rushed into the rooms with heavier and heavier weaponry, grenades and even anti-tank weapons, none of which had any effect whatsoever, although the creature's stillness led Pawtton to believe that it was perhaps being paralyzed by the assaults.\n\nEventually the entire building was evacuated and leveled by heavy artillery fire in an attempt to destroy the intruder, who then simply stood in the air where Pawtton's office used to be as the building collapsed. Then the cannons suddenly stopped firing and the hundreds of soldiers and civilians surrounding the area found themselves unable to speak as the creature spoke up.\n\n"Is this a competition? Fine then, I shall participate." With a flash, the entire area in a one-hundred meter radius surrounding the building simply disappeared into thin air, leaving Pawtton and the many soldiers to fall into the newly-formed crater.\n\n"I wish you good luck if this is how your kind reacts to the unknown. Farewell." And with another flash the entity simply disappeared without a trace, leaving hundreds of dumbfounded soldiers at the bottom of a new crater and a very, very confused Pawtton who swore to never again drink another drop of alcohol."

Pawtton said in a shaky voice.\n\n"Me? What I am will be revealed in due time, although not to you. I would say more, for my kind hates such mysteries, but that would be going against the protocols. You are a military commander, are you not Pawtton? I have perused through your memories and your kind is expanding at a rapid pace, which I find fascinating. Are you happy about it?"\n\nWas the creature asking Pawtton about how he felt? Did it just read his mind? Pawtton felt overwhelmed but, thanks to his rigorous training, quickly reasserted himself and spoke once more.\n\n"Well, yes. I do like it, it is pleasant to watch my kind finally rise out of the mud it had been wallowing in for the past decades or so, all thanks to the guidance of Kaiser Kattail."\n\n"Excellent. May I join you? I know you are about to say "Excuse me?", so I will answer ahead of time. I am curious about the way your kind engages in terrestrial warfare and wish to partake in it, for it is a subject of great interest to my consciousness. If not, that is alright, I shall depart and you will not be bothered anymore. By the way, you may call me however you'd like, if that makes you comfortable."\n\n"Join... join us? Well... uh... I'll call... I'll call you Herb, since you're a bit green, like grass, I suppose, yes? I'll... I'll think about it, yes?" Pawtton was dumbfounded. Evidently that... thing, Herb, was leagues beyond anything anyone on this planet could conceive of, and it wanted to join them? It all made so little sense... and yet Pawtton could sense that Herb was being genuine, somehow. The way it spoke directly into his mind felt eerie, yet comforting and so... unfathomably honest and clear."

Most of the artifacts stored there, while interesting in their own right, were mostly curiosities of little actual value for his plans.\n\nThey would thus be allowed to remain there with oversight from Katzen scientists who would be working with the Obsidian Council, whom promises of funding and cooperation had managed to sway to his side, in order to ensure the continued security and study of these magical trinkets.\n\nSome of the artifacts were far more dangerous, but also much more interesting. These would be studied extensively in order to bolster the Imperium's still lackluster science base, in a final bid to finally drag the Abyssinians out of the mud of technological backwardness which had impeded the Kaiser's conquest for too long.\n\nBut the Kaiser soon came face to face with what was perhaps The Cave's most important item. A large resplendent artifact from ages past, gleaming with ethereal purple energy, whose visible age only made it all the more enthralling.\n\nIt seemed as if it was of near-infinite complexity, orders of magnitude beyond what the people of this planet could have ever produced in their entire history. To everyone, its origins remained shrouded in mystery, with many believing it to be divine in origin, a construct perhaps forged by Boreas himself.\n\nBut to Kattail, the answer was obvious: the item's creator was none other than Aeternum, the galactic core's ancient precursor civilization. It seemed that, just as they had tempered with Flusion, so had they also tempered with this world and its people. Thus, so many more of these artifacts were almost certainly scattered throughout the planet.\n\nAnd Kattail intended to find each and every single one of them."

Reportedly, the region had fallen under the control of a certain "Kaiser Kattail", and every so often she spotted some railway or settlement being built in the distance, a distance which she preferred to keep as she didn't mind her lifestyle all that much.\n\nShe had her spot within her community; that was all she needed. Besides, whoever that Kaiser fellow was, he likely didn't care much for a few nomads in the sand, she thought. While tall felines clad in strange attires occasionally approached her with "job opportunities", she always declined and it seemed to be keeping change at bay.\n\nUntil it started raining. "Tis the annual rainfall", the elders said. "It will end soon.", except it, of course, did not end. Drizzle turned into rainfall washing over the Zebhara as the desert's oasis swelled into gargantuan lakes, often swallowing entire heritage sites beneath the waves in the process.\n\nIdir barely had any time to process these changes before a flurry of gargantuan tracked construction vehicles began tearing the desert asunder with a vast network of canals, followed by wave upon wave of eager settlers planting forests, building cities, and constructing solar panel networks in the vast expanses where her people used to roam.\n\nShe eventually found herself having to join these settlers if she was to carve herself a spot in this strange new world, but not without swearing to never forget the sight of the beautiful white sand glistening in the sun. \n\nIt was all she had left from her world."

Katown, which the Kaiser humbly dubbed the Kattail Military Academy.\n\nMuch like the recruitment office that had dragged him into this strange new life, many of these had popped up throughout the nation, often within the same buildings as the office, all with the supposed goal of preparing the populace for the "upcoming trials', whatever that meant.\n\nHowever, perhaps due to Abyssinia's rather crippling lack of modern military masterminds, Gustav and many hundred if not thousands of Abyssinians were listening to none other than Kaiser Kattail himself speak about his plans for the nation, with his speech being relayed to the other academies via radio.\n\nFor hours and hours, Kattail went on about a vast variety of subjects, ranging from new-era military doctrines involving armored vehicles to societal transformation and new exciting technologies to be implemented across Abyssinia.\n\nGustav emerged out of the lecture feeling overwhelmed by it all, and so he sat down in a large park next to the building to allow his laborer mind to process the vast amount of information he had just been given. He just sat there, taking in everything, when his thoughts were, once again, interrupted by the sudden sound of someone else's voice.\n\n"Pretty nifty speech, huh?' a black-furred Katzen clad in an impeccable military outfit addressed him. "You look a tad lost. The name's... Hans. Used to be Yelekai but I'll admit that Hans has a nice ring to it. What's yours?'"

Incredible how Kattail is making it all work, huh?'\n\n"I... used to be a laborer too... I didn't mind it too much, admittedly. Although the Storm King really messed everything up and I had to start nearly from scratch rebuilding everything.'\n\n"Ah! The Storm King! Didn't you hear? The Kaiser said that we'd make the Yetis pay back what they inflicted upon us a thousand times. Isn't that sweet? Frankly, I just want to do something more with my life than till soil until I become soil myself if you catch my gist.'\n\n"That's... one way of looking at it, I suppose?' Gustav said, staring into the distance where many Abyssinians and numerous freed slaves were busy working on construction projects... prompting Gustav to think about the way Kattail had somehow managed to do so much for Abyssinian society in so little time. Perhaps Hans was right to be excited? Yet he couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all moving far too fast. All it'd take is one mistake...\n\n"Not very chatty, are we? Well, the Kaiser said it was important to develop a sense of camaraderie between Katzens, so, want to be friends?'\n\nGustav looked up, having almost forgotten about Hans' presence already. "Oh? Friends? Friends... friends. Sure. Let's be friends, it... can't hurt, really.' Gustav said in a low voice. Having lived a somewhat lonely life in rural Abyssinia for most of his life, he wasn't really used to talking with complete strangers like that, especially such overtly ambitious ones, but he figured he'd give it a shot anyway. If anything, maybe it'd help him fit in better.\n\nAfter all, he had already rebuilt his life from scratch once, what's a second time?"

Across the newly captured cities of Katzennia, columns of KK-Panzers followed by hundreds if not thousands of foot soldiers paraded down avenues and boulevards. Much to Kattail's delight, these cohorts were made up not only of Abyssinians but also a myriad of other species that had stopped seeing the Katzens as invaders but rather as allies worthy of their cooperation.\n\nAnd yet, watching the largest of the parades from atop a balcony in Katown, he knew this was nowhere near enough. All across his new empire countless partisans and freedom fighters were already arraying themselves against his rule and that of the Katzens.\n\nThese would have to be stamped out quickly before the problem grew out of control, he thought, as he began working to establish proper integration protocols and widespread counter-insurgency tactics with his intelligence agency, to ensure his empire was ready to weather the incoming storm about to be unleashed upon it.\n\nAs indeed! To many external observers, Abyssinia has gone far, far beyond the nation's wildest dreams, and was surely satisfied with its new conquests. But to Kattail, this was only the very, very beginning of his great journey across this world. Soon, the Hippogriffs and the Yetis would fall, followed by the rest of the continent, and then, the world.\n\nBut for now?

Nothing against anyone, really, except for strange 'ice cream people' that sometimes appeared in his dreams, but they weren't real so it didn't matter. But this complicated things. Zebrica, and the world as a whole, had so, so many species, and uniting it as Kattail intends is going to have to require somehow unite all of these species into a singular, semi-cohesive civilization.\n\nBeyond the obvious cultural differences, which could be alleviated with time, every species had different needs for housing, exercise, rest, diet, education, and with these Loris really had no choice but to try and aim for the best possible middle-ground satisfying as many species as possible in a given area so as to avoid segregation.\n\nKattail insisted that 'Everyone could become a Katzen'. Sounds nice in paper, yes, but when you've got two species with completely different psychologies, beliefs and physiological needs, well that's a lot of sleepless nights for Loris. And when you've got twenty or thirty?\n\nWell let's just say that, even with all the proper hierarchy and all the advisors in the world, poor old Loris hasn't had the chance to properly hit the hay for quite some time now.

It'll all be worth it in the end, when we're all a big, happy family spanning across the entire world.\n\nLoris sighed as he reviewed the latest warplans and realized that, well, Hindia and Kiria were likely next, and with them, many, many hours of tireless work spent making sure that family didn't break apart..."
katzen_AF.274.a:0 "Where'd all those species come from, anyways?"

katzen_AF.275.t:0 "Evening it Out"
katzen_AF.275.d:0 "With the fearsome Yetis subjugated beneath Katzen might, Kattail felt that it was time for what one could call a little righting of historical wrongs. Indeed, while he obviously wasn't there, several years ago the Storm King and his legion swept over Abyssinia and pillaged nearly everything of value out of the nation, leaving the entire country in a state so sorry that it would likely have lasted for several more years had he not intervened.\n\nKattail thus visited the palace in the Eye of the Storm, which once served as the Storm King's seat of power. And so as to reward his loyal Abyssinians for sticking with him all the way to the ends of Zebrica, he ordered it to be quite literally dismantled stone by stone, to have those stones shipped back all the way to the Abyssinian homeland, and then for the palace to be rebuilt and turned into a museum to both old Abyssinian culture and history as well as its recent newfound Katzen glory.\n\nWhile the Abyssinians themselves cheerfully welcomed this development, Kattail of course expected the Yetis to protest. They were however fearsome warriors which would be of great help to Kattail's crusade, and thus he took great care to ensure the Yetis were nonetheless treated fairly as an integral part of his ever-expanding empire.\n\nAs with other conquered nations, religious rights for the Yeti's ancestor worship were enshrined while Kattail personally overlooked most of the occupation of Yeti lands in order to ensure that his armies did not commit too many (or ideally, none at all) revenge-fueled war crimes. He additionally promised the construction of a grand and monumental power plant intended to fully utilize the Eye of the Storm's potential, which will provide near-limitless power to the Yeti lands and beyond.\n\nDespite his best efforts, it will obviously still take several years of arduous work for the relationship between Yeti and Abyssinians to be fully mended, but Kattail felt confident that eventually, both species would see eye-to-eye under the glory of Katzen militarism.\n\nHopefully."

katzen_AF.276.t:0 "Everfreed"
katzen_AF.276.d:0 "With the recent seizure of Ponyville, Kattail's forces found themselves faced with perhaps the most esoteric area in the entire world: the Everfree Forest. Now, naturally, being the good Katzens that they are, they had drafted up plans to utterly devastate this wild patch of untamed nature and replace it with the glory of efficient Katzen civilization, just like they had planned for the jungles of Zebrica and Southern Equus.\n\nIt was to be glorious. Conventional and white phosphorus bombardment, bioweapons, pesticides, heavy explosives, and even several nuclear strikes were to be unleashed upon tactical locations across the Everfree in order to wipe it off the map in one fell swoop before its supernatural properties could save it. Within days the equipment had been prepared and all they needed to begin was the Kaiser's word.\n\n'No.'\n\n'What... what do you mean, no, mein Kaiser?' The Katzen officer in charge of the operation said, bewildered. 'You want us to burn down the jungles of Zebrica and Equus, yet you wish for this vile patch of defiant nature to stand against our rule?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'...why? It stands no chance against our might, does it not?'\n\nKattail seemed slightly uneasy as if remembering something traumatic. 'Yes, but consider that it would make a nice nature preserve. We can study it, for science and magic, yes?'\n\n'Hm. I suppose so. Are you absolutely certain?'\n\n'My word is final. Establish a perimeter and move in our research teams at once, but don't, EVER, harm the Everfree. Failure to comply will...' He'd stare into the distance for a bit. '...end badly for whoever did it. Got it?'\n\n'Got it. We'll see what we can do.'\n\n'Excellent.' Kattail said, suppressing what seemed to be a sigh of relief."

katzen_AF.277.d:0 "The Katzenartig Imperium had been more ready than ever. Battleplans revised, soldiers drilled, and fresh ammunition loaded. The dark magic of Magehold was amongst the most powerful on the planet, and thus matching preparations had been made for a grand conflict pitting the living against the dead.\n\nAnd yet Gustav couldn't help but feel... disappointed. In mere days, the terrifying undead hordes had been ground to dust under KK-Panzer tracks, sometimes coming back to life only to be crushed once more. His division found itself impeded more by logistical troubles in the far north rather than by the actual undead themselves.\n\nThe storming of Magehold too was just as anticlimactic. A barrage of strangely well-placed howitzer shots leveled nearly the entire fortress before infantry squads moved in to clear out the stragglers. Was that it? Surely it couldn't be. Surely the peninsula's dark magic would cause something to happen and the fight would be on once more.\n\nHowever, all that Gustav got to witness was the quietude of the windswept plains of the north followed by the scurrying of Katzen countercurse divisions moving in to purify the area and integrate it into the empire. Gustav had seen it all, from Equus to Zebrica and Griffonia. He was a weary veteran by now, ready to take on the entire universe for his Kaiser, and frankly? This whole ordeal felt like an affront to his skills."

katzen_AF.28.t:0 "Dominance"
katzen_AF.28.d:0 "At last, it is complete. Likely the greatest feat of engineering in the world, perhaps in all of history, has been realized according to Kattail's grand plan, as indeed, the almighty Riesigerkatzenpanzer is now operational.\n\nFive hundred meters in length, two hundred meters tall, and weighing over three hundred and fifty thousand tons, it is to be the ultimate manifestation of Katzen dominance. Its gigantic Bergbrecher tracks, powered by dozens of nuclear reactors embedded into the vehicle's fortified innards, make the very ground tremble as the vehicle rolls out of its gargantuan construction yards near the outskirts of Katown.\n\nAs is to be expected for such a vehicle, it features hundreds of cannons, aimed at laying waste to enemy infantry, armor, and aircraft alike, all while remaining nearly indestructible thanks to its meter-thick armor. It is estimated that it will cost four hundred million Katzmarks to fire this weapon for twelve seconds.\n\nAnd yet all of these pale in comparison to the vehicle's most powerful asset: the almighty Kontinentale Sturmer. This fearsome weapon is capable of lobbing a shell consisting of seven thermonuclear warheads at any point on the planet, tearing the sky and land asunder and bringing devastation upon our foes like a mechanical angel of death. Kattail is hopeful that we will never, ever have to fire it.\n\nThe vehicle, which has now been dubbed "Dominiontracks', as well as its crew of fifteen thousand loyal Katzens, is now awaiting orders near Katown. Should we wish to incinerate a state in nuclear hellfire, we may now do so."

katzen_AF.29.t:0 "To Tear the World Asunder"
katzen_AF.29.d:0 "With its target being confirmed, and the order being officially given to fire, Kattail and the High Command proceed with the last authorizations before the Riesigerkatzenpanzer can begin its act. The Kontinentale Sturmer is ready, and within minutes, the railgun, over 150 meters in length by itself, fires.\n\nA massive explosion follows the projectile, the sabot shell being twenty meters itself at the largest, as it screams across the sky. The immense force of the Sturmer bends the land surrounding it as trees lean backward in the wake of the sonic boom as the shell flies high into the sky, rupturing the cloud layer in mere seconds and vanishing from sight.\n\nBut it doesn't take long for it to return. Within mere minutes the shell climbs to its apogee, thousands of kilometers into the heavens themselves, before turning around and detonating its propulsive nuclear charges in rapid succession. This accelerates it to tens of thousands of kilometers per second before its fairing separates, revealing its seven thermonuclear warheads.\n\nThe warheads puncture through the atmosphere in less than two seconds before detonating with full force over [From.From.GetName]. In the blink of an eye the fury of seven suns tears apart the landscape, setting plains alight and turning entire woodlands into little more than tinder for the flames, while any rivers in the vicinity are near-instantly flash-boiled as millions of tons of water evaporate into superheated steam.\n\nAny enemy forces or military installations in the area are essentially removed from existence before they are allowed to react. Meanwhile, the sound of the explosion is heard several times everywhere as it circles the planet several times over like a testimony to the wrath of the Katzenartig Imperium sent to the entire world.\n\nAs Kattail watches everything unfold, he hopes that this warning shot will suffice."

katzen_AF.10.d:0 "One hundred fathoms... two hundred fathoms... three hundred fathoms. The reading came off the chain as it disappeared into the inky sea. At one end of the chain, one of the latest floating fortresses slowly lowered the line link by link into the deep. On the other sat the largest cluster of nuclear bombs that the Imperium had ever gathered. Kilotons upon kilotons of explosives had been prepared for this. And for what purpose?\n\nRumours had it that it was for mining. Others said that it was for clearing blockages for submarines. And yet, only one person knew its true purpose.\n\nHe had seen their power, their prowess. He knew what they were capable of if they were not stopped in time and stopped with extreme prejudice.\n\n"Ignition!" Kattail heard from the crew. Seconds passed with naught but silence. There was nothing.\n\nAfter a few minutes, they began to get radioactive readings from the waters beneath them. One less problem to worry about, Kattail thought to himself. He turned to address his crew. "We're done here. Set sail for home."\n\nAs the ship sailed away, a question formed amongst the crew:"
katzen_AF.10.a:0 "What lurked beneath the waves?"
KTZ_nuked_the_sirens_play_gigas_tt:0 "\nWhat creatures could be lurking down in the depths of the abyss? What could they do with an entire planet with their disposal? The §OGigastructural Engineering§! mod for §CStellaris§! might hold the answer!"


katzen_AF.100.t:0 "§RTwilight's Theory§! and the Chaos in Equestria"
katzen_AF.100.d:0 ""What kind of 'Harmony' is this?" Kattail frowned as he read the latest report from the front. The nation formerly known as Equestria seemed to have collapsed overnight and shattered into several pieces as its poor little ponies went absolutely insane in the wake of their missing leaders. Now the groups brutally slaughtering each other seemed to be led by... a random pony declaring herself to be the new princess, a genocidal unicorn race supremacist, a "super communist," and a... musician? To top it off, at the center of it all was the hypocritical "Princess of Friendship" and regent of the missing alicorns, Twilight Sparkle. She seemed to have become an utterly ruthless and bloodthirsty ruler in the other alicorns' absence.\n\nKattail made a note to himself to be very careful with how he treated the common ponies of Equestria once he liberated them from the wanton chaos and destruction they seemed too eager to inflict upon themselves. Their mental fortitude was clearly minimal if they jumped to such extremes after a few weeks of a lack of leadership.\n\nFunnily enough, the economy of the communist faction seemed to be soaring despite nobody there seeming to know anything about economic theory. They believed it to be successful, and so it was.\n\nKattail didn't expect these factions to be difficult to deal with, so long as they were focused on fighting one another."
katzen_AF.100.a:0 "Kattail made another note to prioritize building mental health facilities for them, too."

katzen_AF.101.t:0 "The §RImperium of Griffonkind§! and the §RDawnclaw Heresy§!"
katzen_AF.101.d:0 ""Where did they get this kind of tech?" Kattail frowned as he read the latest report from the front. At a heavy cost, his troops had recovered a damaged suit of armor along with a gigantic, oversized pistol from his latest foes. The quality of the metal in the equipment and the electronics present in their design was at least a thousand years, no, at least forty thousand years ahead of this planet's most sophisticated technology.\n\nKattail turned his eyes back to the report. A most unusual occurrence had transpired within the region of the world known as the Herzland, causing a swift reconstruction of the Griffonian Empire into... Kattail squinted as he reread the words before him, "An Imperium of their own." He allowed himself a chuckle. In addition, the former Griffonian Republic seemed to have vanished overnight, and in its place came a chaotic death cult themed around one of the local deities.\n\nWhile these new developments were alarming, Kattail theorized that if he acted swiftly and decisively, then he could crush these new problems before they figured out how to utilize the full potential of their advanced technology."
katzen_AF.101.a: "Unfortunately, they executed our ambassador for heresy."

katzen_AF.102.t:0 "T H E §RD R E A D  F L O O D§!"
katzen_AF.102.d:0 ""This can't be right." Kattail frowned as he read the latest report from the front. All the information he had on the so-called Dread League indicated that they were supposed to be pushovers, and yet not only were they standing up to his troops, they were pushing them back and advancing south.\n\nThe undead armies were far, far stronger than they had any right to be. Kattail grimaced. Evidently, there was some unknown factor at play. A magical artifact, perhaps? Were they utilizing Aeternum relics? He didn't know. But he had to defeat them, and soon, or his time here might be wasted.\n\nHe glanced one last time at the report. His troops had claimed that the undead were moving at such high speeds that it made Kattail wonder if they were somehow bending spacetime around them."
katzen_AF.102.a: "In any case, they need to be dealt with before it becomes too late."

katzen_AF.111.t:0 "To Go Further Beyond"
katzen_AF.111.d:0 "All is well. With the surrender of both the mighty Arisians and the dreaded Yetis, as well as the ongoing implementation of wondrous megaprojects across Zebrica, Kattail now found himself at the head of what would soon become this world's greatest superpower.\n\nGiven his knowledge of war and the vast resources now available to him, the next step was obvious. While it remained relatively secretive for now so as to not stir up the still-integrating populations too much, a series of ambitious warplans was already being drafted, aiming to sweep over the rest of Zebrica and strike at both Griffonia and Equus in order to finally secure Kattail's hold over the entirety of this world.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of it all, Kattail felt... uncertain. Was this really worth it? This world was not Flusion. Yes, it was rich and populated, but it wasn't quite as rich and quite as populated as the planet he was used to.\n\nBut, most importantly, while he usually enjoyed the support of several billion Katzens on Flusion, here he only had a few scant hundred million to work with, with the rest having to be assimilated into his society which of course complicated things quite a bit.\n\nWould this world's potential be sufficient to realize his grand vision? Would he even be able to defeat the remaining two-and-a-half continents with what he had amassed thus far? Or was all of this little more than a waste of his time, an illusion of victory propped up by the Kaiser's general ignorance of this world's true nature?\n\nKattail pondered for a bit. His arrival on this world was likely just a fluke, and Cycle-shifting now would certainly return him to his beloved world of Flusion, where he could once again return to his usual strategies. Should he leave this world, which had proven to be a nice experiment and a distraction from his usual schemes, he had no doubts that the Abyssinian to whom he entrusted the role of Loris von Kattensbach would do a fine job at taking over for him, so at least his departure would not cause a catastrophic collapse.\n\nBut he couldn't deny this world had great potential, only waiting for a guiding hand to realize it and bring its inhabitants to galactic glory. Did he really want to commit to this uncertain and unpredictable world, or should he cut his losses and return to his usual strategies back on Flusion?"

katzen_AF.12.d:0 "Standing on a balcony atop the mighty Katown Pyramid, Kattail marveled at the bustling megalopolis stretching far in front of him as news concerning the surrenders of his last few remaining foes trickled in from all four corners of the world. Soon enough, they stopped coming, and Kattail smiled.\n\nHe had done it. From the south pole to Kiria, to the Mountain, across the sea to Wingbardy, Griffenheim, and Cloudbury, to the hellscapes of the frozen north and onto the vast, once-indomitable Equestrian continent, the Katzen flag flew both metaphorically and physically.\n\nFor perhaps the first time in this world's history, billions of sapients from dozens of different species now found themselves united under one rule. His rule, but also their own rule. As indeed! While he had transmitted unto them the glory of Katzen culture and militarism, so did they impart some of their values and ideas upon the collective, worldwide culture that Kattail had forged through conquest, a culture of glory and conquest, disparate yet united in purpose.\n\nBut what was that purpose? Kattail thought as he looked up to the sky. The answer was obvious: this was only the beginning. Through strife and triumph, he had once again built himself a proper power base from which to spread across the very heavens themselves.\n\nSoon enough, once all resistance has been properly pacified, he and his billions of citizens shall take a grand leap into the great unknown and accompany him toward galactic conquest, just as he had done with Flusion countless times prior.\n\nBut he wasn't quite ready yet, for there was one last thing to be done. He needed a weapon, a weapon so powerful as to be a symbol of his power, one that could project his might across the stars and even beyond. And he knew just where to find it, he thought, as he looked at the moon slowly rising through the night sky..."

A world united in purpose, pouring its collective potential towards the realization of something greater.\n\nBut it was only the beginning, Kattail thought, as he watched countless rockets soar into the night sky and towards the moon, all with the noble goal of reshaping it to his own will. Just a few more years and all would be complete.\n\nAnd then? Then it shall begin once more. Kattail shall lead the people of this world towards the stars, and together they shall expand across the heavens, crushing all resistance beneath their united might to establish a glorious, galaxy-spanning Imperium.\n\nThen the galactic core shall fall, and so shall the Harvesters. After that, Kattail will take to the intergalactic scene, and soon enough, the Katzen flag shall fly metaphorically across all that exists!\n\nKattail was snapped out of his thoughts by reports concerning delays in the Mondkanone's construction that needed his immediate oversight. Well. The universe-spanning Imperium wasn't quite there yet, it seems, but all it'd take is a little bit more elbow grease and it would surely come in due time.\n\nOr so Kattail hoped, as he had hoped countless times before."

Like many other refugees, however, the invaders eventually caught up to them, but what they did once the war for Colthage was over surprised her.\n\nDespite the great violence unleashed by the Katzen to conquer Maregypt and the other countries until they made it to Colthage, these new invaders weren't interested in enslaving them like the Chiropterrans did. Instead, they saw the Katzen begin reconstruction efforts and encouraged the populace to return to work and continue with their lives.\n\nZenora couldn't believe her own eyes when she saw a poster on the town board announcing a request for workers. She had thought it impossible to get a job back in the city, but seeing this opportunity open not only for her but for other zebras? The mare knew herself to be a competent scribe, and it seemed that not only were the Katzen interested in getting creatures into the factories again but also the skilled and educated into offices and other workplaces. She gave it a read and eventually found a nearby office that she could make an application for.\n\nFor once, since the capitulation, Zenora smiled."
 katzen_AF.602.a:0 "Perhaps there is hope after all."

 katzen_AF.603.t:0 "Promotion"
 katzen_AF.603.d:0 "Work wasn't easy, but it definitely was something she was good at. Zenora was quickly hired by the firm she applied to. She was made a secretary for the manager, a Katzen, and she proved herself a worthy asset to him.\n\nShe had given the firm vital service for a year and a half, not once failing to come to work on time and not once failing to be on time with her reports and the completion of other tasks. For all of this, she was summoned to the office of her superior just after work. Trying not to show her nervousness, she stood up from her desk and entered her manager's office, hoping that she had not come in for a scolding. She was certain that she had done well, forgiven only for very slight errors or mistakes. That was the worst of anything she did. So what was going to happen to her now?\n\nZenora sat down and faced her manager. The katzen was a good creature, reasonable but firm. He sat at his desk and said, "Thank you for all the work you do and the time you put in. You're one of our best employees and I didn't want to ignore that. With the way the economy is going, I think it's the proper time for rewards for you, indeed. Why don't you consider stepping up the ladder and becoming the head secretary for our firm as we expand? This promotion will improve your pay and give you more benefits. What do you think?"\n\nOnce again, Zenora couldn't believe her ears. She teared up and struggled not to be too overcome with emotion. The katzen patiently let her process this before eventually the zebra finally restored her composure."
 katzen_AF.603.a:0 "Rising up the ladder."

 katzen_AF.604.t:0 "Katzenification"
 katzen_AF.604.d:0 "It had been quite the effort to wrangle all of her relatives into the city she lived in. Despite now having settled herself down again in the city she fled from during the conquest of Colthage, she had to live with the fact that many of her family had scattered themselves across the former Republic. At first, she didn't think that was much of a problem as they all adapted to a new but strange life under the Imperium. Zenora was relieved that she could look after herself and her new family of two little foals which she adopted with her husband, a Katzen named Dreifuss.\n\nShe was content with this, but she had always felt that she wasn't exactly equal to the Katzens, despite her husband being loyal to her. That changed when the Imperium declared the protocols, allowing creatures like Zenora and her family to acquire citizenship. That, however, required that they, like many others, make appointments so they could be processed.\n\nNow that everyone she cared about was in the city, at least those close enough but still needed coming into the city for processing, Zenora brought them all over to the city hall. The wait was long, but eventually they were able to get new papers that officially proclaimed them as citizens of the Imperium. Now they were Katzen. Now they were equals, no longer bound to the past, to a corrupt Republic."
 katzen_AF.604.a:0 "Kattail welcomes all."

 katzen_AF.605.t:0 "Lead Me, Follow Me, or Get Out of My Way"
 katzen_AF.605.d:0 "The general marched down the line of recruits, inspecting them with careful eyes. Though this would be one out of many new divisions ordered by the Kaiser to form, this particular one would be a first in the history of the Katzen army.\n\nUnlike the very first divisions that formed in Abyssinia, this one would be composed of creatures from all over the empire. Ponies, zebras, horses, hippogriffs, and more. This would be a first of many planned mixed combat units intended not for garrison duties but for true active duty in the many wars being fought and to be fought. While the logistics of creating such a division certainly needed adjustment and reinforcement, the top officers of the Katzen army were satisfied.\n\nThe next step would be to train this division. If they wished to prove themselves worthy of the empire, then their deeds must be done not through foolishness. General Pawtton would hate to be disappointed and the great katzen would shape these creatures up to not only earn this honor but to become deserving of what shall transform them into equals of the founders of the Imperium.\n\nWasting no time, the general finished his inspection, faced the division, and began to deliver his speech.\n\n"You will know me as General Pawtton. You, soldiers, shall begin your training under my command. Though you all hail from different lands, you will earn your place in the Imperium as Kats. But to do so, you must give me your best. Perform well and you will survive. Sweat hard so you may not shed your own blood and waste your lives. Instead, I expect you to kill the poor dumb bastards opposing you and not get killed in turn. Will you follow me?"\n\nA roar rose out from the creatures and the general smiled at his new soldiers."
 katzen_AF.605.a:0 "Hopefully it'll work out."

 katzen_AF.606.t:0 "Dare to Die"
 katzen_AF.606.d:0 "Captain Torch Light had fought day and night with his Katzen-loyal kirin. Out of the hundreds that once made up his battalion, only half remained after a long battle with the enemy. Yet, they have inflicted greater damage to the enemy, even capturing several vehicles and prisoners. He and some of his kirin even turned nirik at times, driving back reinforcements and inspiring his comrades to fight on. But at the end, he frowned at the reports, realizing that only they and a handful of other battalions made it through the bloodshed for the river crossing.\n\nThey were hoping they would be allowed to move forward for a counter-offensive, but they were all ordered to stand down. What was going on? The silver scaled kirin decided not to question it, consulting the rest of his orders. He and his unit, whatever was left of it, were ordered out of the front lines officially to rest and refit. But just as they were about to make it to one of the resupply bases, they were met by a car of senior officers who ordered them to stop and present themselves.\n\nWhilst some of his subordinates grumbled about their wounded and exhausted comrades, they all obeyed. They formed their lines and did their best to look presentable, despite so many of them being filthy after ceaseless fighting. Were they being reprimanded?\n\nInstead of barks and disapproving looks, the katzen generals and their non-katzen subordinates instead bowed to them. What murmurs rose amongst the kirin were quickly silenced as Captain Torch Light was ordered out of the formation. One of the katzen generals faced him, looked him up and down, and presented him the Uranium Cross. The kirin, wide eyed and stunned, could only watch as the general pinned the cross with the uranium atom upon the chest of his uniform. He opened his mouth to speak, but the general instead ordered him and his subordinates to continue on to their destination. However, before they were allowed to leave, Torch Light was given a box and instructed to take care of decorating his own soldiers. The car and staff at last departed from them, leaving Torch Light and the kirin to continue on their way."

 katzen_AF.608.d:0 "Sunny Smiles stared at the document, perplexed. She glanced from side to side, down the winding dirt road leading out into the far distance, and then back to the document. She looked forward, at the sweeping hills of crops of her farm, and then looked back at the document.\n\n"...overpass?" Sunny whispered, once again, baffled by the word in the context.\n\n"Evicted for an overpass?" Sunny questioned, "... to where?"\n\nSunny Smiles would find out soon, as the immense machinery arrived the next day. To give the government credit, she would be lodged in an apartment in a city she had never heard of. She left, ferried away in a bus filled with the other farmers from the region, and left their crops behind.\n\nThe work proceeded at a breakneck speed, as colossal machines moved earth and soil and scarred the ground with viciously efficient construction. Soon enough the gleaming lanes of concrete sprouted out of the ground like a cancerous maze of grey, and the crops shrunk under the shade.\n\nThe machines moved on, and behind them the roads were abandoned. Weeks later, Sunny Smiles would be with her friends enjoying the view from atop their apartment- and gazing towards the distant curve where their homes had been.\n\nIt was, it had so turned out, been a mistake. A simple misreading of measurements, old Abyssinian miles not converted to Katzen kilometers, and yet there was no going back. The terrifying efficiency of their tools had turned their own fallible minds into weapons against the very earth, but even now weeds and grasses started to consume the wound. In time, it would be dust. Like everything would be.\n\nSunny Smiles however was not filled with such philosophical ponderings, for her new apartment was exactly as far south as the now converted units, and the machines would arrive tomorrow.\n\nWith an upward scowl, Sunny looked to the heavens as if her glare would even be noticed by whatever cruel mind had set this all in motion."

 katzen_AF.607.t:0 "A Salty Tale"
 katzen_AF.607.d:0 "As it is known, of the big issues faced by the Zebtropa project is none other than salt. Indeed, the land reclaimed from the Arabian Sea is extremely salty and as such methods have been devised to help desalinate the new land, such as bioengineered plants capable of thriving in high-salinity environments that extract the salt out of the land.\n\nThese plants have been grown and spread throughout the new land by the millions, thus rendering the land more habitable. As the goal of the project was to turn one big sea into a myriad of smaller lakes, an aquatic version of this plant was created, which when injected into the salty lakes leftover by the retreating sea could clump the salt together into huge chunks that are later easily recovered from the water, enabling the Imperium to transform saltwater lakes into more habitable freshwater reservoirs. Developed with support from the mainland, these two plants have been an efficient and ecological way of dealing with the salinity issue.\n\nIn addition to these plants, large 'scraping' vehicles which somewhat resemble combine harvesters, generally based on a mechanised infantry vehicle chassis, have been constantly crisscrossing the reclaimed land to scrape up the salt from the ground and pave the way for the introduction of the aforementioned plants by rapidly decreasing the ground's salinity to non-toxic levels.\n\nWhile the operations to desalinate the new land have been mostly successful, this has had the peculiar yet expected side-effect of granting the Imperium access to truly mind-boggling quantities of cheap salt harvested directly from the former seabed, to the point that the Katzens now produce more salt daily than the entire planet does in a full year.\n\nUnder Loris' advice, this salt has been massively exported across the world, which have reportedly caused salt market crashes everywhere due to the sheer quantity being injected into the market While not quite as good as other 'high-quality' salt brands, the Arabian Salt has quickly grown to become the most widespread form of salt sold throughout the world, making up a record 85.7% of salt sales both within and outside of the Imperium in the last quarter."

For all this seapony's communist filibustering in her fish tank, she'd harboured an interest in the "extranormal", in conspiracy theories... yet she'd been the only one to see past the facade of fake scientists he'd forged to mask how much he knew. Like a dead clock being right twice a day, she was right, and she'd get the truth sooner or later.\n\nPerhaps to his benefit.\n\n"Just to be clear," Kattail said, "You believe that I've uncovered ancient alien records to use them for imperialist gains. Your plan now, I can only guess, is to help accelerate this... er, 'futuristic capitalism' until it collapses under its own weight, then use our 'alien' technology to contact their makers who, apparently, are also communists." He blankly looked at Posada floating in the water, whose withering glare accused him of so much. "Even if this alien stuff were true, why should we accept a brazen revolutionary like you?"\n\n"Because you'll face the march of history," she answered, her waterproof mic conveying her voice. "If you bring me in, you'll have a high-ranking scientist who isn't afraid to explore where others don't tread, and more importantly, you'll have someone who listens to the heart of your workers, all tens of millions of them. They will revolt eventually, whether from us here or the aliens coming back to us, and whether they'll skewer you in the end will depend on what I can do.

 katzen_AF.611.d:0 "Everything was in place. Through a series of intricate and complicated reforms, Kattail had managed to turn Abyssinia from a complete backwater into something somewhat resembling a modern state.\n\nIt took many, many tireless months of work as well as numerous deals with all strata of Abyssinian society, but the nation's various social classes, ranging from the nobility to the laborers, had been mostly reconciled while the numerous slaves had been finally freed and allowed to become true "Katzen" citizens. Of course there were still tensions and clashes given how fast everything was moving, but Kattail was confident that would be resolved in due time.\n\nThe implementation of novel industrial methods and production chains across the nation enabled the production of modern equipment to slowly yet surely fulfill Kattail's dream of a grand Katzenarmee, which was steadily swelling with fresh recruits from across the nation as it prepared to march beyond Katzennia's borders and expand Kattail's dominion over the continent.\n\nAnd it desperately needed to, as, unbeknown to most, these "miraculous" transformations of Abyssinian society came at a cost, for Kattail's delicately-tuned economic and societal model, which had for now succeeded in uplifting Abyssinia, was not actually stable on its own.\n\nJust like the Katzenartig Imperium back on Flusion, it was built on and for one thing: war. In order to keep the industries running, the companies working, and the army growing, Kattail's hypermilitarized society needed a constant influx of fresh territories, population, and resources to be assimilated into itself, lest it would first slow down, then stall, and eventually, collapse in on itself under the weight of its bloated military spending and overmilitarized infrastructure.\n\nThus, as Kattail and his high command enacted their warplans upon Katzennia's southern neighbors, the race was on. Katzen boots and tracks were about to flood over the continent, and this flood had to never, ever stop, until there was nothing else to conquer, lest Kattail's supposedly "miraculous" modernization reforms were to be his own undoing..."

It now forms the very heart of the Imperium's mighty military-industrial complex, and is to fuel Kattail's conquests with the equipment and manpower it needs for decades if not centuries to come.\n\nAbove all the project demonstrates the Imperium's mastery in regards to weather manipulation, with every last detail of the project's artificial water cycle and revamped climate delicately and purposely designed for maximum habitability. Vast cohorts of weather-manipulation zepellins now regularly criss-cross the skies, re-distributing the evaporated water where it is needed the most and bringing life to the former seabeds and vast Zebrican deserts alike.\n\nKaiser Kattail himself has given a set of resounding speeches while touring the seabed settlements while himself inaugurating several of the bridges and highways connecting the hundreds of islands now jutting out of the waterline. Although, behind his jubilant and confident facade, the feline sovereign is finally relieved that this Cycle's Zebtropa didn't degenerate into mass ecological disaster throughout Zebrica..."

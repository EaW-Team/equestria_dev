 hero_of_legend:0 "Hero of Legend"
 MGY_nationalism:0 "Nationalistic Fervor"
 MGY_nationalism_desc:0 "We have spent the last thousand years in darkness and squalor, splintered into warring city-states, dominated by Arabian despots, having our land stolen by the vile Abyssinians, and just a few years ago, ravaged by the Storm King. At last, Maregypt says "No More!". We WILL reclaim our land from the cats! We WILL defend our borders from the enemy, and we will NEVER go back under the foreign jackboot! Maregypt free! Maregypt forever!"
 MGY_stomped_flat:0 "Trampled By The Storm King"
 MGY_stomped_flat_desc:0 "In 1001, the Yeti known as the Storm King invaded and conquered our country. For the next few years he pillaged our fair land, plundering it to build his bloated airship fleet. He was overthrown only recently, in 1005, and our economy is still reeling from the effects of his wanton savagery."
 MGY_ovambo_war:0 "Legacy of the Ovambo War"
 MGY_ovambo_war_desc:0 "The Ovambo "War" wasn't really a war - more of a period of protracted civil unrest, caused by the Ovambo Zebras migrating across our borders as the Storm King conquered their homeland in the south. We were conquered by the Storm King before the issue could really be solved, and now we have to deal with communities of foreigners who aren't formally part of our nation occupying substantial lands in our southernmost provinces. This problem has so far been pushed aside in favor of more pressing problems like the economy, but it surely can't be ignored forever..."
 MGY_somnambula:0 "Somnambula"
 MGY_somnambula_desc:0 "The past millenium has been cruel to Maregypt - we have gone from ancient glory to an embattled state that has been ravaged by war twice in the last twenty years. For many years, our predicament looked hopeless, and it seemed the glory of Maregypt would fade into a mere memory. But then, against all hope, Somnambula returned! The ancient heroine from two thousand years ago, whose aid was essential in the establishment of the glorious Second Kingdom, is once more with us! For the first time in centuries, Maregypt is filled with hope for a better future. But the world has changed a lot since those days...will the ancient heroine be able to live up to the pressure placed on her?"

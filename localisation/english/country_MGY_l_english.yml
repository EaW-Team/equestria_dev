MGY_20th_anniversary_of_the_birthday_revolt:0 "20th Anniversary of the Birthday Revolt"
MGY_20th_anniversary_of_the_birthday_revolt_desc:0 "In 987, a group of students rose up on the Grand Prince's birthday to demand political freedom and liberation from foreign domination. Their protest sparked a revolution, which ended in Maregypt securing its independence for the first time in centuries. On the anniversary of this momentous occasion, we honour those brave students and pledge to safeguard the principles they stood up to defend."
MGY_the_campaign_trail:0 "The Campaign Trail"
MGY_the_campaign_trail_desc:0 "We are just beginning to recover from the Storm King's pillaging, but next year's elections to the House of Commons are rapidly approaching. If we are to expand on our slim majority, we need to shore up support at the end of our term. There are a number of pressing issues which demand our attention, although there isn't enough time for us to address them all."
MGY_those_damn_cats:0 "Abyssinian Tensions"
MGY_those_damn_cats_desc:0 "The common ponies of Maregypt are enraged by the continuing Abyssinian occupation of western Manedalusia, and desperately wish to reclaim this land from the vile cats. The Knights of Maregypt would prefer a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but the return of Somnambula has caused the hopes of the populace to be reborn, and now more and more ponies call for war every day."
MGY_stick_to_diplomacy:0 "Stick to Diplomacy"
MGY_stick_to_diplomacy_desc:0 "Although it may be a politically costly position to take, we have a responsibility to avert further bloodshed if at all possible. We must make it abundantly clear that we stand by our commitment to peace and are willing to come to the negotiating table with the cats. The fact is that armed conflict with Abyssinia is not in the interests of any of the parties involved."
MGY_remind_of_defeat:0 "Memories of Defeat"
MGY_remind_of_defeat_desc:0 "Less than a decade ago, the Storm King's horde smashed through our defences and brutally ransacked the country. The humiliation exposed the Maregyptian army's fundamental flaws, and these weaknesses have yet to be fully reckoned with. In light of this, military victory over Abyssinia is far from certain. Recklessly starting a war now would be pure folly."
MGY_stage_debate:0 "Stage a Debate"
MGY_stage_debate_desc:0 "We have taken our position on the question of Manedalusia, but there remain many ponies who disagree or who remain undecided. Fortunately, there is no shortage of orators sympathetic to our view who would surely win over the public if given the chance. Organising a high-profile debate on this issue will greatly help ponies in making up their minds."
MGY_indulge_jingoism:0 "Indulge in Jingoism"
MGY_indulge_jingoism_desc:0 "The opinion of the public is clear: they despise the unjust settlement imposed upon us by the Great Powers and are spoiling for a fight with Abyssinia. Denying them would only serve to destabilise the country even further. And so we must let the ponies know that we share their passion and outrage, and that we will do whatever it takes to expel the Abyssinians tyrants from Manedalusia!"
MGY_manedalusia_is_maregypt:0 "Manedalusia is Maregypt!"
MGY_manedalusia_is_maregypt_desc:0 "Manedalusia has been a part of Maregypt for centuries, and was seized only recently by the treacherous Abyssinians. We hold that feline domination over any portion of Manedalusia is an intolerable affront to justice. If the Abyssinians refuse to concede and withdrawal from the territory, then we have no choice but to remedy this injustice by force."
MGY_win_without_war:0 "Win Without War"
MGY_win_without_war_desc:0 "Throughout the many disagreements we have had with the cats over the years, they have proven themselves to be a fairly reasonable lot. They surely recognise that a violent struggle would be destructive for both of our nations, to say nothing of the suffering it would inflict on the Manedalusians. There exists a peaceful solution, and we shall find it together."
MGY_the_two_year_proclamation:0 "The Two Year Proclamation"
MGY_the_two_year_proclamation_desc:0 "Although we have been forceful in our rhetoric, some ponies still question our willingness to take a firm stand against the cats. And so we shall demonstrate our commitment to the Manedalusians by making this solemn promise: that Maregypt will take decisive action to liberate them all from Abyssinian overlordship within two years, come what may."
MGY_the_economy_fools:0 "Economic Woes"
MGY_the_economy_fools_desc:0 "The nation still bears deep scars from the Storm King's invasion and subsequent plundering, to say nothing of his hijacking of Maregyptian industries to construct a massive fleet of airships. The economy remains devastated, and we are only now able to start picking up the pieces."
MGY_subsidise_cotton:0 "Subsidise the Cotton Industry"
MGY_subsidise_cotton_desc:0 "Cotton has always been a source of substantial income for Maregypt, and growth of the cotton industry was chiefly responsible for our years of prosperity during the early 990s. Maregypt's unique soil and climate provide an exceptional environment for cultivation, and so we must do all we can to prop up plantations until market conditions become favourable once again."
MGY_equestrian_barons:0 "Equestrian Barons"
MGY_equestrian_barons_desc:0 "Equestrian investment has brought us great wealth and advancement over the years, and further Equestrian aid will be absolutely critical for rebuilding the economy. There is no shortage of businessponies who can sense an opportunity, and if we need to make a few concessions to attract them then so be it."
MGY_mild_nationalisation:0 "Mild Nationalisation"
MGY_mild_nationalisation_desc:0 "Things are dire, and they are not being helped by our current state of economic dependency. Far too much Maregyptian wealth is being siphoned into the pockets of foreign industrialists, while our own ponies are going hungry! Nationalising some Equestrian-owned businesses will alleviate the problem, but at the price of potentially upsetting Equestria."
MGY_expand_mining:0 "Expand Mining Operations"
MGY_expand_mining_desc:0 "It would be pointless to try to save the failing cotton plantations. Fortunately, recent surveys have discovered massive, previously-unknown mineral deposits right beneath our noses! Making the economy more reliant on mining may pose a political risk, though, as it would have the unfortunate side effect of empowering the Miners' Union—a hotbed of communist agitation."
MGY_mining_towns_in_marekush:0 "Build Up the Mining Towns"
MGY_mining_towns_in_marekush_desc:0 "Of all the locations throughout Maregypt identified as resource-rich, Marekush is without a doubt the most commercially viable. However, although it sits atop a treasure trove of valuable mineral resources, a substantial buildup of industry and infrastructure will be necessary to enable efficient processing and export after extraction."
MGY_oil_in_swdesert:0 "Oil in the Desert"
MGY_oil_in_swdesert_desc:0 "Excitingly, large quantities of oil have been discovered in the vast deserts of the southwest. The process of drilling and extraction must be started without any delay! Developing these resources will be vital for continued industrialisation and securing our future prosperity."
MGY_a_reprieve:0 "A Reprieve"
MGY_a_reprieve_desc:0 "We were faced with an extraordinarily challenging situation, but thanks to our actions one of Maregypt's most vital industries has come back from the brink and is looking healthy once again. Things may still seem grim, but there is no doubt that we have taken our first steps on the long road to recovery."
MGY_the_ovambo_problem:0 "The Ovingo Problem"
MGY_the_ovambo_problem_desc:0 "When the Storm King cut his bloody swath across Zebrica, large numbers of Ovingo zebras fled into southern Maregypt after the yeti conquered their lands, and have remained there ever since. Although there has been little violence between native Maregyptians and the Ovingo thus far, there is much bad blood. A plan of action must be formed before the situation escalates out of hoof."
MGY_build_houses:0 "Build Houses"
MGY_build_houses_desc:0 "The Ovingo Problem is one that can only be solved with openness and compassion. After all, our peoples share a bond of mutual suffering under the Storm King's brutal rule. By investing in improving areas with large Ovingo communities such as Marekush, Neighpata, and Khaneigh, the zebras can be more fully incorporated into Maregyptian society."
MGY_build_walls:0 "Build Walls"
MGY_build_walls_desc:0 "The Ovingo Problem is one that can only be solved with constant vigilance. Since first arriving, these tribal zebras have proven themselves completely unwilling to integrate into Maregyptian society. Our best option is to build up defensible positions around large Ovingo communities, in case they decide to start causing trouble."
MGY_peace_summit:0 "A Peace Summit"
MGY_peace_summit_desc:0 "Despite our efforts thus far, low-level tensions continue to simmer. In order to head off the possibility of a Second Ovingo War, we must accept the fact that the Ovingo are here to stay and deserve to be treated as citizens with equal rights. By agreeing to a respectful meeting with prominent zebra leaders, we can surely come to a workable accommodation."
MGY_bolster_police:0 "Bolster the Police"
MGY_bolster_police_desc:0 "These Ovingo parasites are a menace to public safety! The best way to prevent things from degenerating into anarchy is to greatly increase police presence in areas with high concentrations of zebras. In addition to keeping the peace, if a Second Ovingo War ever breaks out they would be a great help in dealing with it."
MGY_vague_platitudes:0 "Offer Vague Platitudes"
MGY_vague_platitudes_desc:0 "This is a delicate situation, and it's up to us to calm things down. As we go about implementing our programme, the citizens must be assured that we are doing so with the utmost level of sensitivity towards communities of all races and their inhabitants. Putting out some public statements to that effect should do the trick."

### KM Main Tree ###

MGY_KM_victory:0 "The Knights Triumphant"
MGY_KM_victory_desc:0 "Our citizens have spoken and they have affirmed their trust in King Khefer, decisively renewing his mandate. But this is more than a victory for the KM: it is a victory for every creature in Maregypt who dreams of a modern and prosperous future. And so we affirm that we will always stand with our Equestrian cousins in defence of justice, in the name of Harmony!"
MGY_fulfil_promises:0 "Fulfill Our Promises"
MGY_fulfil_promises_desc:0 "Our previous summit with Ovingo leaders proved very fruitful at soothing tensions and promoting an environment of mutual trust and friendship between pony and zebra. Now the time has come to make good on the commitments we made there and fully eliminate any traces of second-class citizen status for the Ovingo. Only then can we ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for Maregypt."
MGY_hard_appeasement:0 "Hard Appeasement"
MGY_hard_appeasement_desc:0 "There is no denying that the current state of affairs with the Ovingo is far from ideal—tensions are growing by the day. We are standing at a knife's edge and need to take decisive action to avert a crisis. The time has come to reach an accommodation with Ovingo leaders, giving in to their key demands, so that we can put this matter behind us once and for all."
MGY_increase_EQS_aid:0 "Increase Equestrian Aid"
MGY_increase_EQS_aid_desc:0 "Although the current economic situation is dire, it was not long ago that Maregyptian textiles were renowned throughout the world! Let us not forget that those Years of Gold and Cotton were made possible only by substantial Equestrian investment. And so as we work to rebuild Maregypt's shattered economy, we shall do so with generous assistance from our Equestrian friends."
MGY_resource_economy:0 "A Resource Economy"
MGY_resource_economy_desc:0 "Maregypt's soil has been blessed with an abundance of precious metals, alongside being an ideal climate for the cultivation of cotton. These resources were the foundation of a booming economy in the past, and they will be so again: all we need to do is make use of new technologies to properly develop the sector."
MGY_expand_iron_mines:0 "Expand the Iron Mines"
MGY_expand_iron_mines_desc:0 "Without iron, we cannot produce vital steel needed for our weapons and armour. Many mines have been neglected in recent years, and a fresh surge of investment should yield immediate results."
MGY_exploit_aluminium:0 "Exploit Aluminum Deposits"
MGY_exploit_aluminium_desc:0 "Our land is rich in natural resources which we lack the ability to effectively tap. Designing and building new, better machines will allow us to dig deeper and take effective advantage of them."
MGY_assyut_dam:0 "The Assyut Dam"
MGY_assyut_dam_desc:0 "For centuries, ponies have dreamed of building a dam near Assyut to regulate the flooding of the Neighile, but we are only now in a position to make the project a reality. This proposed dam will enable us to control flooding, provide increased water storage for irrigation, and generate hydroelectricity which will be pivotal to Maregypt's planned industrialisation."
MGY_tourism:0 "Promote Tourism"
MGY_tourism_desc:0 "The civilisation of Ancient Maregypt left many grand monuments and temples that have become attractions for modern-day visitors. In order to better take advantage of these millennia-old monuments we should bring in tourism experts and advisors from abroad, as well as upgrading the infrastructure for major tourist centres along with our coastal areas."
MGY_the_big_cities:0 "The Big Cities"
MGY_the_big_cities_desc:0 "All of Maregypt's large coastal cities are well-visited by tourists due to their sunny beaches, ancient history, and museums. By establishing new and even more glamourous beach resorts, we can increase our income from this sector even further."
MGY_expand_the_docks:0 "Expand the Docks"
MGY_expand_the_docks_desc:0 "Somnambula was once the largest and most important port in Northern Zebrica. While she may no longer claim this particular honour, some expansion of her dry dock and anchorage will let us accommodate our increased maritime activity far more comfortably."
MGY_neighle_cruises:0 "Neighile Cruises"
MGY_neighle_cruises_desc:0 "Offering cruises along the Neighile river would be a fantastic addition to the tourism industry, requiring only that we improve the infrastructure around the upper portion of the river and its surrounding areas. As these large vessels would essentially function as floating hotels, they are sure to prove attractive to wealthy visitors."
MGY_job_explosion:0 "Job Explosion"
MGY_job_explosion_desc:0 "Our programme of economic development has proven wise indeed: the new investments are already paying massive dividends. Rejuvenated sectors are witnessing unprecedented growth and contributing to a surge in demand for labour. The times of despair are behind us. Gold is flowing once again!"
MGY_deal_with_manedalusia:0 "Deal With Manedalusia"
MGY_deal_with_manedalusia_desc:0 "Throughout our recent history, the unresolved question of Manedalusia has burned at the forefront of Maregypt's national consciousness. Now that we are in a stable position to address the crisis, it must not be put off any longer: it's time we settled the matter, once and for all."
MGY_seek_peace:0 "Seek Peace"
MGY_seek_peace_desc:0 "Another war with the cats would not resolve anything—it would only lead us both further down the path of mutual destruction, and ultimately ruin. The Abyssinian government is made up of reasonable cats, who surely can see this reality as clearly as we can. There exists a peaceful solution, and we shall find it together."
MGY_convince_our_people:0 "Convince Our People"
MGY_convince_our_people_desc:0 "If we are to build a peaceful future with Abyssinia, our citizens must bury their hatred of the cats. Despite their actions in the past, they remain our neighbours, and engaging in an endless conflict with them would be the height of foolishness."
MGY_proof_of_honesty:0 "Proof of Honesty"
MGY_proof_of_honesty_desc:0 "In preparation for our upcoming negotiations with the cats, we shall offer to open up trade relations with Abyssinia as a show of good faith. No doubt they are savvy enough to see the lucrative possibilities that will be opened up by burying the hatchet."
MGY_coltuba_summit:0 "The Coltuba Summit"
MGY_coltuba_summit_desc:0 "All the preparations are complete, and the time has come for negotiations with Abyssinia to begin in earnest. Representatives are gathering in Coltuba as we speak, where they will work out an agreement that will decide the fate of Manedalusia."
MGY_three_times_denied:0 "Three Times Denied"
MGY_three_times_denied_desc:0 "Ever since they began their illegal occupation of our territory in 988, Maregypt has endured humiliation after humiliation at the paws of the vile Abyssinians. Words have failed us at every turn: these past decades have proven that force is the only way to right a great wrong."
MGY_whip_up_a_frenzy:0 "Whip Up a Frenzy"
MGY_whip_up_a_frenzy_desc:0 "Inspiring our citizens to support the war effort is one aspect that should not be difficult at all. They all despise the settlement imposed by the Great Powers and have been spoiling for a fight with Abyssinia for years. One thing our army will definitely not be short of is enthusiasm."
MGY_prepare_the_troops:0 "Prepare the Troops"
MGY_prepare_the_troops_desc:0 "As we make plans for our attack on the cats, we must ensure that our soldiers are all properly equipped and in position for when the time comes. [Root.GetLeader] has requested that the Elite Guard be transferred out of the capital and towards the front lines, so that they will be able to contribute more substantially towards the war effort."
MGY_take_it_back:0 "Take It Back!"
MGY_take_it_back_desc:0 "The time has come to fight for our righteous cause. The citizens of Manedalusia are crying out for liberation, and so we shall free them, and strike down all the feline tyrants. This horrible stain on our national honour will haunt us no longer. To arms!"
MGY_put_to_bed_at_last:0 "Put to Bed at Last"
MGY_put_to_bed_at_last_desc:0 "It wasn't easy, but our efforts have finally settled the Manedalusian question with Abyssinia. We have dealt with the cats and the situation is stabilised. Now that the threat of conflict no longer looms over both of our nations, we can finally put this matter behind us."
MGY_a_new_maregypt:0 "A New Maregypt"
MGY_a_new_maregypt_desc:0 "Under the deft leadership of [Root.GetLeader], the Knight's policies have brought progress and prosperity to Maregypt, jump-starting the economy and finally settling the thorny issue of Manedalusia. Now that the urgent crises which once threatened our nation's stability have been resolved, we must look to the future and decide our place in the larger world."
MGY_full_membership:0 "Full Membership"
MGY_full_membership_desc:0 "Although we have long been on friendly terms with Equestria, the time has come to formally become part of their alliance. Let it be known that Maregypt will always stand in defence of Harmony, no matter where in the world it is threatened!"
MGY_renegotiate_aid:0 "Renegotiate Aid"
MGY_renegotiate_aid_desc:0 "Now that Equestrian interests are even more closely aligned with our own, we should request that the terms of their economic assistance be altered. We have proven that we can be counted on, and allowing us greater control over our production would be greatly beneficial to the wider alliance."
MGY_reinvest_money:0 "Reinvest Money"
MGY_reinvest_money_desc:0 "Increased consumer activity in recent years has already resulted in quite a windfall for state revenues. Instead of being satisfied with government coffers filled with gold, we should pour these funds back into promoting more economic growth and improving our citizens' lives."
MGY_every_foal_a_book:0 "Every Foal a Book"
MGY_every_foal_a_book_desc:0 "Tragically, many of our rural schools lack the resources necessary to provide their students a proper education. We must be proactive and take measures to increase funding and make sure all schools are capable of providing our children everything they need to flourish."
MGY_research_2:0 "Somnambula University"
MGY_research_2_desc:0 "In our capital, a new university shall be established with the goal of promoting scientific discovery and technological innovation. The education it offers will provide students with the knowledge and skills to bring Maregypt forward into a new age of progress."
MGY_industrial_partnership:0 "Industrial Partnerships"
MGY_industrial_partnership_desc:0 "We must push ourselves constantly to make the most of what we have, and never allow ourselves to grow complacent. On the quest for progress, no stone can be left unturned! By utilizing public-private partnerships we can encourage development in otherwise unattractive areas."
MGY_arms_buildup:0 "Arms Buildup"
MGY_arms_buildup_desc:0 "Maregypt has never boasted an overwhelming number of military factories, with its army never truly needing a large number of weapons. But as we move into a new age of warfare, it has become clear that we need to expand our industrial capacity to combat the threats we are faced with."
MGY_immigration_act:0 "The Immigration Act"
MGY_immigration_act_desc:0 "As we now have a very close relationship with Equestria, accompanied by an unparalleled level of diplomatic cooperation, we should make sure that our cousins across the sea know that they are welcome to come to Maregypt and stay. We shall take the bold step of greatly loosening restrictions on Equestrians who wish to settle in Maregypt, to promote an even closer bond between the ponies of our nations."
MGY_zebrican_harmony:0 "Zebrican Harmony"
MGY_zebrican_harmony_desc:0 "Although Equestia has aided us many times in the past, and we remain grateful, the fact remains that Maregypt's destiny lies in Zebrica, not in Equus. And so the time has come to step out from Equestria's shadow and forge our own path as protectors of peace and liberty."
MGY_influence_warzena:0 "Influence Warzena"
MGY_influence_warzena_desc:0 "We have much in common with the zebras of Warzena—they suffered as we did in the face of the Storm King's brutal onslaught. By joining together we can ensure that such a tyrant is never again able to overpower all of northern Zebrica."
MGY_influence_alwani:0 "Influence Alwani"
MGY_influence_alwani_desc:0 "The Alwani live along the same Neighile river as us, and close contact has resulted in a great deal of cultural exchange among our peoples going back to ancient times. Surely they are wise enough to see the benefits of closer cooperation between our nations."
MGY_close_economic_ties:0 "Economic Coordination"
MGY_close_economic_ties_desc:0 "Our closer ties with Warzena are already starting to bear fruit, as we were able to secure investment from prominent Warzenan companies to build factories in Maregypt. No doubt as our nations become closer allies, there will be even more possibilities in the future."
MGY_arsenal_of_zebrica:0 "Arsenal of Zebrica"
MGY_arsenal_of_zebrica_desc:0 "Maregypt has never boasted an overwhelming number of military factories, with its army never truly needing a large number of weapons. But now we need to arm not just ourselves, but our allies as well. It has become clear that we need to expand our industrial capacity to combat the threats we will face together."
MGY_join_hippogriffs:0 "Join With the Hippogriffs"
MGY_join_hippogriffs_desc:0 "The Hippogriffs have a mighty nation with formidable strength. They are also disciples of Harmony and have close ties to Equestria as we do. And so it is only natural that we should fight side by side together, protecting freedom on our continent."
MGY_strike_bats:0 "Strike the Bats"
MGY_strike_bats_desc:0 "At present, the greatest threat to freedom and stability in northern Zebrica is Chiropterra. This despicable regime is already menacing its neighbours, and it is only a matter of time until they come for us. We must strike first and shatter their dark empire before it ever becomes a reality!"

### LPMG Main Tree ###

MGY_LPMG_victory:0 "The LPMG Triumphant"
MGY_LPMG_victory_desc:0 "The ponies have spoken: they have no trust in the feckless King Khefer or his wealthy friends. They are sick of the exploitation of the working class, and have demanded true social and economic equality for all! Finally, after so many years of despair and humiliation, Maregypt enters into a new age of hope."
MGY_reform_labor_law:0 "Reform Labour Laws"
MGY_reform_labor_law_desc:0 "No longer shall ponies be taken advantage of by greedy and scheming employers. New labour laws will empower workers and put industry in their hooves, finally ending the days of gruelling slavery in the mines and factories. Reasonable shifts and overtime laws, safety protocols and paid sick days will improve the lives of the everyday pony."
MGY_seize_EQS_assets:0 "Seize Equestrian Assets"
MGY_seize_EQS_assets_desc:0 "For far too long, Equestrian businesses have controlled huge portions of Maregypt's textile and mining industries. It was this dependency that forced King Khefer to become little more than an Equestrian puppet. Such economic imperialism can no longer be tolerated! Seizing control of their assets will allow benefits to go directly to the ponies of Maregypt, instead of to faraway robber barons."
MGY_deal_with_army:0 "Internal Unrest"
MGY_deal_with_army_desc:0 "It is no secret that our regime has a great many enemies within. The Ovingo Zebras, heedless of our promises of liberation, oppose us just as fiercely as they did the old King, and many nobles strongly oppose our policies, perhaps even strongly enough to conspire with disloyal ponies in the army. And so we must act swiftly to purge reactionary elements within Maregypt. If left alone, these elements may plot to undermine the rule of the working class and foment counter-revolution."
MGY_ovingo_matter:0 "The Ovingo Matter"
MGY_ovingo_matter_desc:0 "Recently, tensions have been flaring up between zebra and pony communities in the south. The primitive and tribal Ovingo seem to be quite resistant to our ideas of socialist progress. This issue can not be allowed to fester: we must do something to defuse the situation before it erupts into a full-blown revolt."
MGY_strike_now:0 "Strike Now!"
MGY_strike_now_desc:0 "The Ovingo situation is far more dire than we had hoped: the whole region is a hair's breadth away from breaking away from our control entirely. If left unchecked, these zebras will fatally undermine the unity of Maregypt's working class and usher in a catastrophic counter-revolution. We must act aggressively to preempt this threat, using all available means."
MGY_buy_more_time:0 "Buy More Time"
MGY_buy_more_time_desc:0 "Although we have begun the process of assimilating the Ovingo, these measures will take a while to implement, and a while longer until we start to see the desired results. In light of this, all we can do is delay and act with prudence to prevent any escalation of hostilities."
MGY_confiscate_their_land:0 "Confiscate Their Land"
MGY_confiscate_their_land_desc:0 "Now that the Ovingo no longer live aloof and isolated from the rest of Maregypt, we can see that their territory is productively integrated into the larger economy. The resources which will be made available through this new land will be a golden opportunity for countless citizens who are currently struggling to make ends meet."
MGY_crush_reactionary_influence:0 "Crush Reactionary Influence"
MGY_crush_reactionary_influence_desc:0 "A disturbing number of officers revealed themselves to be supporters of the ARM during the recent election. As long as these ponies remain at their posts, they will represent an unacceptable threat to the development of socialism. This threat can only be eliminated by purging disloyal elements from the officer corps and enforcing ideological orthodoxy from the top down."
MGY_rebuild_officer_corps:0 "Rebuild the Officer Corps"
MGY_rebuild_officer_corps_desc:0 "Now that the Maregyptian military has been cleansed of counter-revolutionaries and other enemies of the people, the time has come to promote a new generation of talented, qualified, and above all loyal candidates into positions of authority. Only then can we say that our army is truly one that serves the ponies."
MGY_sign_up_today:0 "Sign Up Today!"
MGY_sign_up_today_desc:0 "It is likely that our recent purge of the officer corps makes us appear vulnerable in the eyes of our neighbours, and a tempting target. We need to expand the ranks to be ready to defend ourselves from such foreign aggression. Ponies looking for a job should be highly encouraged to do their part by joining the Maregyptian Army."
MGY_crush_remaining_dissent:0 "Crush Remaining Dissent"
MGY_crush_remaining_dissent_desc:0 "Although King Khefer and the Knights of Maregypt were instrumental in establishing a democratic political order after the Birthday Revolt, our ascendency proves that the country has moved beyond having any need for such weak-kneed leaders. Continuing to tolerate their presence would open the door for even more sinister forces to take advantage of their misguidedness."
MGY_revolution_secured:0 "The Revolution Secured"
MGY_revolution_secured_desc:0 "Thanks to our bold actions, all of our domestic threats have been neutralised and the rule of the workers is no longer threatened from within. Now that we don't have to worry about our progress becoming undone, we can focus solely on building a new Maregypt: one that will be a paradise for the common pony, and a beacon for oppressed creatures everywhere!"
MGY_address_poverty:0 "Address Poverty"
MGY_address_poverty_desc:0 "We still live in the shadow of the Storm King's brutal conquest, during which he ravaged our land, destroying so much and leaving untold numbers of ponies either homeless or at the very edge of bankruptcy. To reduce unemployment and to kick-start the economy, new housing and social programs must be implemented to assist these poor citizens."
MGY_socialism_rises:0 "Socialism Rises"
MGY_socialism_rises_desc:0 "It was inevitable that our righteous rule would put an end to the fragile tyranny of Maregypt's corrupt kings and nobles, and so it did. Thanks to our bold actions, we have solidified our position within the government and ingratiated ourselves with working ponies across the country. Many challenges still lie ahead, but Maregypt's workers will face them together, in solidarity!"
MGY_zebra_submit:0 "Solve the Ovingo Problem"
MGY_zebra_submit_desc:0 "Recently, tensions have been flaring up between zebra and pony communities in the south. The primitive and tribal Ovingo seem to be quite resistant to our ideas of socialist progress. This issue can not be allowed to fester! We must deal with it in a quick, aggressive manner—either the zebras cease their troublemaking, or we crush them ruthlessly."
MGY_red_education_1:0 "Liquidate Illiteracy"
MGY_red_education_1_desc:0 "Illiteracy has long plagued the ponies of Maregypt, and in light of what will be required for our transition into a communist economy, the problem has grown too large to ignore. A new system of universal compulsory education shall be established for foals, and illiterate adults all over the country will be encouraged to enroll in special literacy schools."
MGY_red_education_2:0 "Educate the Masses"
MGY_red_education_2_desc:0 "Social progress is impossible without scientific progress—we recognise that the foundation of our new system depends upon an educated population alongside development in the broad fields of engineering, the natural sciences, the life sciences, and social sciences. Cultivating a highly educated population is of the utmost importance."
MGY_pander_to_unions:0 "Power to the Unions"
MGY_pander_to_unions_desc:0 "The Miners' Union and many others were instrumental in our rise to power. It's only right that they be rewarded for their efforts: committees of workers shall assume control of every aspect of the economy. We will prove that workers are far more motivated to work when they don't do it for the benefit of their oppressive slave master, but for the mutual prosperity of all!"
MGY_steel_and_alu:0 "Steel and Aluminium"
MGY_steel_and_alu_desc:0 "Our land is rich in natural resources which we lack the ability to effectively tap. Designing and building new, better machines will allow us to dig deeper and take effective advantage of them."
MGY_georgism:0 "Geoism"
MGY_georgism_desc:0 "Geoism holds that while ponies should own the value they produce themselves, the economic rent derived from land should belong equally to all members of society. The Geoist paradigm provides solutions to many social and ecological problems. Let us adopt this paradigm so that we may better integrate economic efficiency with social justice."
MGY_unions_rise:0 "Mandatory Union Membership"
MGY_unions_rise_desc:0 "All workers in the same industry should be organized into the same union—regardless of skill or trade—to ensure they have maximum leverage in bargaining or strike situations. Instead of emphasizing the divisions among workers and fostering a narrow interest in the affairs of each craft, we must stress the mutual dependence of the skilled and the unskilled."
MGY_land_for_peasants:0 "Land for Peasants"
MGY_land_for_peasants_desc:0 "For far too long, the wealth and power of Maregypt has been monopolised by its corrupt nobility. Although their political stranglehold over society has been broken, these aristocrats have not yet properly paid for their injustices. Their lands are now forfeit, to be divided amongst the ponies."
MGY_devolved_democracy:0 "Devolved Democracy"
MGY_devolved_democracy_desc:0 "Historically, the Kings ruled over the governorates of Maregypt with an iron hoof, refusing to let them have many freedoms or much of a say in their own affairs. We, however, recognise the fact that the ponies themselves hold ultimate sovereignty. Through delegation of powers from the central government to government at the local level, we will put even more power in the hooves of the ponies."
MGY_heavy_metal_obsession:0 "Power to the State"
MGY_heavy_metal_obsession_desc:0 "Guaranteeing the ascendency of the proletariat will require state guidance of all industries and the introduction of strict centralised management. After all, Marksist revolutionary policy recommends a state-directed economic model from which we can better gear the nation up to increase production and streamline industrial bureaucracy."
MGY_military_first:0 "Military First"
MGY_military_first_desc:0 "All our revolution has accomplished thus far will be for nothing if we fail to build up an army strong enough to combat incursions from reactionary foreign powers. Extensive militarisation efforts must be undertaken immediately if we are to defend our new Republic properly."
MGY_war_resources:0 "War Resources"
MGY_war_resources_desc:0 "Maregypt's oil fields are an extremely valuable asset, but they are currently obsolescent and extraction could be massively improved. Developing these resources will be vital for continuing to modernise our armed forces."
MGY_economic_acceleration_plan:0 "Economic Acceleration Plan"
MGY_economic_acceleration_plan_desc:0 "Having established a viable economic base, the time has come to embark upon an intensive program of industrial growth and socialisation. This plan shall lay out the primary foundations for Maregypt's industrialisation, as well as facilitating the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce."
MGY_mandatory_work:0 "Mandatory Work"
MGY_mandatory_work_desc:0 "It is a well-known fact that socialism is not only completely different from capitalism, but also in all respects superior to it. For example, while unemployment is an endemic feature of capitalism, socialism abolishes it entirely and once and for all. Every citizen of Maregypt has not just a right, but the duty to work."
MGY_every_farm_a_tractor:0 "Every Farm a Tractor"
MGY_every_farm_a_tractor_desc:0 "The use of new agricultural machines to mechanise the work of agriculture has the potential to hugely increase the productivity of our farmers. Mechanisation has proven to be a large factor aiding other industrial economies; besides improving production efficiency, it also frees up a large number of farmhooves to work in the cities - or, more importantly, the army."
MGY_revitalisation:0 "Revitalisation"
MGY_revitalisation_desc:0 "It was a difficult process, but our ambitious reorganisation of the economy has been completed at last. No longer is the wealth of the nation hoarded by bosses and noble landlords: now it belongs to all the ponies, who are more prosperous than ever. The times of despair are behind us. It is a new dawn for Maregypt!"
MGY_prepare_liberation:0 "Prepare for Liberation"
MGY_prepare_liberation_desc:0 "Ever since they began their illegal occupation of our territory in 988, the Manedalusians have suffered terribly under the paws of the tyrannical Abyssinians. There is only one path for us to take: these past decades have proven that force is the only way to right a great wrong."
MGY_ponys_militia:0 "Ponies' Militia"
MGY_ponys_militia_desc:0 "Antipathy towards Abyssinia has motivated many citizens to organise themselves into militia groups in anticipation for the coming conflict. These passionate volunteers, although undeniably enthusiastic, lack discipline and reliability compared to our actual army. Despite this, there is no reason we can't find some use for them."
MGY_socialist_nationalism:0 "Socialist Nationalism"
MGY_socialist_nationalism_desc:0 "In the great struggle that lies ahead, we must embrace our spirit of revolutionary patriotism. The reborn Maregyptian nation fights not for the glory of a rarified pharaoh, but for the causes of popular sovereignty and social equality! Ours is a righteous, anti-imperialist mission."
MGY_demonise_cats:0 "Demonise the Cats"
MGY_demonise_cats_desc:0 "Inspiring our citizens to support the war effort is one aspect that should not be difficult at all. They all despise the settlement imposed by the Great Powers and have been spoiling for a fight with Abyssinia for years. One thing our army will definitely not be short of is enthusiasm."
MGY_workers_for_the_fatherland:0 "Workers for the Fatherland"
MGY_workers_for_the_fatherland_desc:0 "Workers are the foundation of the Maregyptian state, and they have embraced the patriotic cause of Manedalusian liberation wholeheartedly. This is good and necessary: when the time comes, every citizen will need to give their all to contribute to the war effort."
MGY_some_aby_war_focus:0 "Empty the Armouries"
MGY_some_aby_war_focus_desc:0 "Maregypt has spent years preparing for another conflict with Abyssinia. Consequently, we have amassed quite a stockpile of weapons ready to be used should the need arise. Now that the day is fast approaching, we must make haste getting them into the hooves of our soldiers."
MGY_liberate_manedalusia:0 "Liberate Manedalusia!"
MGY_liberate_manedalusia_desc:0 "The time has come to fight for our righteous cause. The citizens of Manedalusia are crying out for liberation, and so we shall free them, and strike down all the feline tyrants. This horrible stain on our national honour will haunt us no longer. To arms!"
MGY_deal_with_nationalism:0 "The Aftermath"
MGY_deal_with_nationalism_desc:0 "It was a long and difficult road, but the Manedalusia Crisis is finally behind us. We have made peace with the cats and the situation is stabilised. Now that the threat of conflict over this territory no longer looms over us, we can stop letting old wounds fester and embrace the future."
MGY_red_star_over_zebrica:0 "Red Star Over Zebrica"
MGY_red_star_over_zebrica_desc:0 "The sands of Maregypt along the Neighile river once birthed the civilisation of Ancient Maregypt, a grand Kingdom legendary for its decadence and grand monuments. From those same sands now rises a new revolutionary civilisation—one that is a shining beacon of equality and an inspiration to every pony fighting for a more just society."
MGY_revolution_in_alwani:0 "Revolution in Alwani"
MGY_revolution_in_alwani_desc:0 "The Alwani live along the same Neighile river as us, and close contact has resulted in a great deal of cultural exchange among our peoples going back to ancient times. Surely they are wise enough to see the benefits of social progress and revolutionary ideology as we have."
MGY_revolution_in_timbucktu:0 "Revolution in Timbucktu"
MGY_revolution_in_timbucktu_desc:0 "We have much in common with the denizens of Timbucktu—they suffered as we did in the face of the Storm King's brutal onslaught. By joining together in solidarity we can ensure that such a tyrant is never again able to overpower all of northern Zebrica."
MGY_revolution_in_yemane:0 "Revolution in Yemane"
MGY_revolution_in_yemane_desc:0 "Yemane secured its independence from Saddle Arabian domination in 988, only one year after our own Birthday Revolt. Just as they strove to throw off the yoke of the hedonistic and incompetent Saddle Arabians, they now yearn for liberation from their new unjust rulers. We must free them!"
MGY_create_the_zebra_ssr:0 "Proclaim the Zebrican SSR"
MGY_create_the_zebra_ssr_desc:0 "Under the impeccable leadership of [Root.GetLeader], we have forged a union greater than anypony could have imagined, free from economic exploitation and political oppression. What we have achieved is nothing less than the ultimate triumph of the working class. United in solidarity, we now march together towards a brighter future!"

### ARM Main Tree ###

MGY_ARM_victory:0 "The ARM Triumphant"
MGY_ARM_victory_desc:0 "The ponies have spoken: they have no trust in the weak King Khefer, who has become little more than an Equestrian puppet! Sick of decades of constant humiliation, they have chosen the ARM to restore Maregypt's national pride. However, the ARM coalition will first have to deal with the obvious, irreconcilable differences between its factions."
MGY_royalist_dominance:0 "Royalist Dominance"
MGY_royalist_dominance_desc:0 "The monarchist faction of the ARM, led by Prince Shepser, is destined to emerge from this power struggle as the victor. Along with an abundance of wealthy and powerful backers, Shepser clearly has the support of the common ponies, many of whom desperately wish to return to the grand old days of the Second Kingdom."
MGY_ban_republicanism:0 "Ban Republicanism"
MGY_ban_republicanism_desc:0 "The Republican radicals were useful when we needed allies during the election, but now the time has come to push them aside. This very moment, they are surely plotting to kill Shepser and declare a Republic! Arresting all their leaders will be essential for maintaining the Kingdom's stability."
MGY_reinstate_titles:0 "Reinstate Titles"
MGY_reinstate_titles_desc:0 "One of King Khefer's most misguided reforms was the revocation of many aristocrats' ancient titles and privileges. Those fine ponies did nothing to deserve such shabby treatment! Remedying this injustice will earn us a great deal of goodwill from the nobility."
MGY_absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
MGY_absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "In Ancient Maregypt, the Pharaoh wielded absolute power over the country, serving as a benevolent protector for all his ponies. King Shepser, mindful of this tradition, will not be denied supreme authority over his domain. Now that Maregypt has a proper Pharaoh once again, there is nothing to stop us from rising to our ancient heights. Glory to the Third Kingdom!"
MGY_republican_dominance:0 "Republican Dominance"
MGY_republican_dominance_desc:0 "The republican faction of the ARM, led by General Far Hook, is destined to emerge from this power struggle as the victor. Along with an abundance of prominent intellectual backers, Far Hook clearly has the support of the common ponies, many of whom yearn for even greater representation in the political system."
MGY_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
MGY_new_constitution_desc:0 "The current Constitution is far from a perfect document, being an awkward compromise reached between ponies who desired a strong King and those who desired a strong Parliament. As we craft a new Constitution, we will sidestep this problem by removing the need for any King at all, and having the head of government be an elected position."
MGY_seize_noble_property:0 "Seize Noble Property"
MGY_seize_noble_property_desc:0 "During the election, it was necessary to cooperate with the monarchists for the sake of victory, but now the time has come to put them in their place. Those arrogant nobles are relics of a bygone age, who clearly have no interest in supporting the future Maregyptian Republic. As a bonus, confiscating their assets will demonstrate to the populace that we are true champions of the common pony."
MGY_proclaim_the_republic:0 "Proclaim the Republic"
MGY_proclaim_the_republic_desc:0 "Going back to ancient times, the ponies of Maregypt have been constantly oppressed by monarchs and tyrants, be they Pharaohs or Saddle Arabian Princes. But no longer! Thanks to the bold actions of the Republicans, Maregypt is ready to step out from the shadow of its past and enter into a new age of liberty and democracy."
MGY_limited_monarchy:0 "Limited Monarchy"
MGY_limited_monarchy_desc:0 "Somewhat awkwardly, neither faction of the ARM seems strong enough to assert dominance over the other. Without a clear singular leader, this tense coalition of Pharaonists and Republicans will be forced to remain intact for the time being. Hopefully they will find a way to work together, for the good of the Kingdom."
MGY_seperate_powers:0 "Separation of Powers"
MGY_seperate_powers_desc:0 "Maregypt's government should be divided into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities: legislative, executive, and judicial. The other branches will serve as a check on the King to ensure that he does not wield tyrannical power over the nation's citizens."
MGY_reconcile_harmonists:0 "Reconcile Harmonists"
MGY_reconcile_harmonists_desc:0 "Oddly enough, the political structure that the ARM has agreed upon does not represent a significant departure from the current system, which was established in the aftermath of the Birthday Revolt. In light of this fact, it should not be difficult to obtain support from many ponies currently sympathetic to the KM."
MGY_kingdom_on_a_razors_edge:0 "Kingdom on a Razor's Edge"
MGY_kingdom_on_a_razors_edge_desc:0 "Although the Pharaonist and Republican factions did eventually reach a compromise on the role and status of the King, it is one that few ponies are very happy with. Both sides feel as though their victory was a hollow one, as neither achieved their ultimate goals. Regardless, the alliance holds for the moment."
MGY_saved:0 "A Nation Saved"
MGY_saved_desc:0 "When the ponies chose us to run the government, Maregypt was at its darkest hour, having suffered decades of defeat, humiliation, and foreign economic dependency. But now that we have established a new, stronger political system, the future looks hopeful. Although many challenges still lie ahead, Maregypt shall face them undaunted, as one nation!"
MGY_ARM_economic_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"
MGY_ARM_economic_policy_desc:0 "The previous government, instead of improving Maregypt's productive capacity, relied on Equestrian largesse to prop up the cotton and mining industries. During this period, far too much emphasis was placed on the primary sector while education was neglected. Our policy is to strengthen the economy by building up the nation's infrastructure and focusing heavily on improving education."
MGY_anti_communist_labor:0 "Anti-Communist Labour"
MGY_anti_communist_labor_desc:0 "Since 998, there has been a coordinated effort by the LPMG to infiltrate trade unions across Maregypt. It is time we did something about this sinister influence: their socialist agitation has already been extremely disruptive to the economy. And so we shall set up "industrial groups" within trade unions, to allow workers themselves to counter the communist threat."
MGY_rural_education_program:0 "Rural Education Programme"
MGY_rural_education_program_desc:0 "Tragically, many of our rural schools lack the resources necessary to provide their students a proper education. We must be proactive and take measures to increase funding and make sure all schools are capable of providing our children everything they need to flourish."
MGY_national_rail_corridor:0 "National Rail Corridor"
MGY_national_rail_corridor_desc:0 "The growing importance of intercontinental trade has made the construction of country-wide coherent infrastructure a necessity. Completion of our National Rail Corridor will stimulate the economy as well as strengthen public unity."
MGY_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
MGY_land_reform_desc:0 "The greatest problem plaguing our agricultural sector is the concentration of land ownership, which is causing mass emigration and economic disadvantage. At the moment, a staggeringly small percentage of farmers own their own land. Encouraging peasant proprietorship will cure everything that ails our countryside, enriching countless farmers who are currently impoverished."
MGY_build_the_dam:0 "Build the Dam"
MGY_build_the_dam_desc:0 "For centuries, ponies have dreamed of building a dam near Mareydum to regulate the flooding of the Neighile, but we are only now in a position to make the project a reality. This proposed dam will enable us to control flooding, provide increased water storage for irrigation, and generate hydroelectricity which will be pivotal to Maregypt's continued development."
MGY_as_we_rise:0 "As We Rise"
MGY_as_we_rise_desc:0 "Although we have taken significant steps, our transformation into a modern industrial economy is not yet complete. Serious government investment in the education and manufacturing sectors will be needed to take the next leap forward."
MGY_finalise_higher_education:0 "Promote Higher Education"
MGY_finalise_higher_education_desc:0 "If we are to place our nation at the forefront of the world's advanced societies, we must improve our citizens' access to post-secondary education. Increasing participation in higher education is extremely important for the national economy, both as an industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated ponies for the rest of the economy."
MGY_promote_gun_industry:0 "Bolster the Arms Industry"
MGY_promote_gun_industry_desc:0 "Maregypt has never boasted an overwhelming number of military factories, with its army never truly needing a large number of weapons. But as we move into a new age of warfare, it has become clear that we need to expand our industrial capacity to combat the threats we are faced with."
MGY_risen_from_ruins:0 "Rags to Riches"
MGY_risen_from_ruins_desc:0 "Our programme of economic development has proven wise indeed. Improvements to national infrastructure have greatly increased ponies' mobility, farmers now own their own land and are more prosperous than ever, and illiteracy has been all but eradicated. The times of despair are behind us: Maregypt now stands on its own four hooves, stronger than ever!"
MGY_university_of_marephis:0 "University of Marephis"
MGY_university_of_marephis_desc:0 "In Marephis, a new university shall be established with the goal of promoting scientific discovery and technological innovation. The education it offers will provide students with the knowledge and skills to bring Maregypt fully forward into the new age of progress."
MGY_war_plans:0 "War Plans"
MGY_war_plans_desc:0 "The day is fast approaching when we will be forced to confront the Abyssinian menace and finally settle the question of Manedalusia. We can not afford to wait any longer—preparations for war must begin immediately to ensure that the army is ready and in position to fend off any foreign aggression."
MGY_maneuvers_in_maned:0 "Manoeuvres in Maneisrata"
MGY_maneuvers_in_maned_desc:0 "Ever since they began their illegal occupation of our territory in 988, Maregypt has endured defeat after defeat at the paws of the vile Abyssinians. Words have failed us at every turn: large-scale manoeuvres on the border will demonstrate our commitment to liberating the people of Manedalusia, by force if necessary."
MGY_outcome_of_war:0 "The Outcome of the War"
MGY_outcome_of_war_desc:0 "After much toil and bloodshed, the Manedalusia Crisis has finally been put to rest. We have reached a detente with the cats and the situation is stabilised. Now that the threat of conflict over this territory no longer looms over us, we can move beyond a single-minded focus on Abyssinia and turn our attention elsewhere."
MGY_finish_them_off:0 "Finish Them!"
MGY_finish_them_off_desc:0 "Our previous campaign succeeded in reclaiming Manedalusia as well as exposing the pathetic state of the Abyssinian armed forces. In the conflict, limited goals were the only thing that prevented us from achieving complete superiority over Abyssinia. However, the cats are still demoralised and off-balance: this is a golden opportunity to neutralise the feline threat once and for all."
MGY_reclaim_old_glory:0 "Reclaim Our Old Glory"
MGY_reclaim_old_glory_desc:0 "During its Golden Age, the Maregyptian Kingdom dominated all of northern Zebrica while their benevolent rule brought peace and prosperity to the region. Tragically, the Kingdom declined over time and fell under Saddle Arabian rule for many dark centuries. But now Maregypt rises again, and King Shepser is ready to conquer our ancestral kingdom and restore its former glory!"
MGY_take_MSP:0 "Take Anseruk"
MGY_take_MSP_desc:0 "As we begin to march west, the first target that presents itself to us is Anseruk. It is imperative that we control this land, as it will serve as an important staging area for our eventual campaign against Saddle Arabia."
MGY_take_STI:0 "Take Asstyria"
MGY_take_STI_desc:0 "Asstyria is all that is preventing us from reaching the sea and cutting off the Saddle Arabian peninsula from the mainland. Neutralising them will be strategically vital, as control of the western coast is necessary if we wish to assert our naval dominance in the region."
MGY_five_centuries_of_revenge:0 "Five Centuries of Revenge"
MGY_five_centuries_of_revenge_desc:0 "After their shameful sacking of Somnambula in 567, the Saddle Arabians ruled Maregypt with an iron hoof and forced generations of once-proud ponies to suffer ghastly oppression under the Grand Prince's tyranny. But now the tables have turned: it is time for us to establish ourselves as the new hegemon of northern Zebrica, and avenge our centuries of humiliation!"
MGY_win_the_peace:0 "Win the Peace"
MGY_win_the_peace_desc:0 "Glorious triumph! In a few short years, [Root.GetLeader] has restored Maregypt's grandeur and led us to victory over the Saddle Arabians. However, conquest and administration are two different things altogether. Ruling over such a large population of horses will be difficult, but necessary in order to take advantage of the valuable resources in the territory."
MGY_republican_dream:0 "The Republican Dream"
MGY_republican_dream_desc:0 "We must accept the fact that Maregypt's ancient kingdom is long gone, and that trying to reclaim it represents the purest folly. As they enter into the modern age, our citizens simply want to control their own affairs and defend their nation's sovereignty. And so this is our goal: a strong, united, and proud Maregypt!"
MGY_self_strengthening_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement"
MGY_self_strengthening_movement_desc:0 "Ever since the military disasters of the Storm War, it has been obvious that the state of both our heavy industry and armed forces leaves much to be desired. Significant reforms will be necessary: we must adapt to make use of the latest military technology and scientific knowledge, with the goal of economic and military modernisation."
MGY_fortress_maregypt_project:0 "Fortress Maregypt"
MGY_fortress_maregypt_project_desc:0 "Maregypt is surrounded by enemies at every side, and it is only a matter of time before we are once again targeted by foreign aggression. In order to successfully withstand an attack, the nation's defences will have to be strong. Our borders must be massively fortified, so that our precious soil is never again defiled by invading hooves."
MGY_golden_age:0 "Our New Golden Age"
MGY_golden_age_desc:0 "It was only a matter of time, but our domestic policies are at last having the desired effect: stupendous economic growth. Now that our citizens are no longer obsessed with chasing the past, and are instead focused on looking inwards and improving themselves, nothing stands between Maregypt and the bright future we are destined for."
MGY_finally_time:0 "Our Moment Comes"
MGY_finally_time_desc:0 "When the nation seemed poised to descend into chaos, [Root.GetLeader] took control and stabilised the situation. Today, our ponies stand proud knowing that their once-backwards Kingdom has been reforged into a strong, modern Republic. This task having been accomplished, Maregypt is ready to seize its destiny!"
MGY_root_them_out:0 "Root Them Out"
MGY_root_them_out_desc:0 "Lacking both strength and resolve, the previous government refused to address the Ovingo Issue and allowed it to fester into a full-blown national emergency. Every moment we delay only gives the zebras more time to prepare, and so we must move to strike fast and permanently break the power of these pathetic squatters!"
MGY_expel_zebras:0 "Expel the Zebras"
MGY_expel_zebras_desc:0 "Now that we have attained victory over the Ovingo and reasserted our control over the southwest, the time has come to remove the vagrants from our soil once and for all. The land they were illegally occupying will go back into the hooves of hard-working Maregyptians, who no longer have to worry about being strangers in their own country."
MGY_the_alwani_plan:0 "The Alwani Plan"
MGY_the_alwani_plan_desc:0 "In light of the fact that the Ovingo have proven incapable of assimilating into Maregyptian society, we have devised a novel solution to the problem. We will give the Ovingo a home to call their own by conquering the territory of the Alwani, opening it up for colonisation, and allowing the zebras to administer the land as our vassals. Everypony wins!"
MGY_ov_vassals:0 "Our Ovingo Vassals"
MGY_ov_vassals_desc:0 "With the conquest and subjugation of the Alwani having been achieved, the territory is now ready to be turned over to the Ovingo. This is a momentous occasion, as a group of wanderers who have endured so much hardship finally have a land to settle in and rule over as they see fit. Let us tell every zebra in Maregypt: a new life awaits you in this wondrous land!"

MGY_victory_over_the_cats_desc:0 "Rejoice! Our soldiers have won a glorious victory over the vile cats, and the citizens of Manedalusia are at last free from Abyssinian tyranny. Thanks to our iron resolve, the unjust partition is a thing of the past: Manedalusia is whole again."
MGY_core_kom_marebo:0 "Integrate Kom Marebo"
MGY_core_kom_marebo_desc:0 "Away from the coast, deep in the Manedalusian interior, lies the Bone Dry Desert—a hostile and sparsely populated area notorious for its lawlessness. A settlement of particular note is Klugetown, which is a haven for smugglers and undesirables of all stripes. It's time we let them know there's a new sheriff in town, and that illegal activity will no longer be tolerated."
MGY_core_maned:0 "Integrate Manedalusia"
MGY_core_maned_desc:0 "Manedalusia was a part of Maregypt for centuries, and was seized only recently by the treacherous Abyssinians. Now that the situation has been rectified, reestablishing our rule should be a smooth transition. Soon, wealth from the port city of Coltuba will begin flowing back into Maregypt—where it belongs."
MGY_no_longer_shamed:0 "No Longer Shamed"
MGY_no_longer_shamed_desc:0 "The Abyssinian invasion of 988 cast a long and dark shadow over our recent history, but that great wrong has at last been righted. We refused to accept the unjust settlement imposed upon us by the Great Powers! Maregypt's brave soldiers fought with righteous fury, and in the end stood proud and unbroken. After so many years of shame, Maregypt's honour has been restored."
MGY_defeat_in_manedalusia:0 "Defeat in Manedalusia"
MGY_defeat_in_manedalusia_desc:0 "Although our cause was just, our campaign to eject the Abyssinian tyrants from Manedalusia once and for all resulted in ignominious failure. Our soldiers fought with valour, but in the end they were unable to match the ferocity of the savage cats. For the citizens of Manedalusia, it is a tragedy. For Maregypt, it is yet another in a long line of humiliations."
MGY_give_us_blood:0 "Give Us Blood"
MGY_give_us_blood_desc:0 "Securing what is rightfully ours will require sacrifice: every Maregyptian must give their all! Recruitment quotas will be expanded and factory hours will be extended.

MGY_for_our_fathers:0 "For Our Fathers"
MGY_for_our_fathers_desc:0 "Maregypt has gone through some difficult times recently, but we must not succumb to despair! Our nation has a proud heritage stretching back millennia. It has suffered defeat many times throughout its noble history, and each time it emerged stronger than before! And so we must always remember our ancestors, and honour them by continuing to fight against feline domination of our lands."
MGY_once_more_into_the_breach:0 "Once More unto the Breach!"
MGY_once_more_into_the_breach_desc:0 "The wounds of the Manedalusian Catastrophe are fresh, but the morale of our citizens has completely recovered. Maregypt stands bloodied but not beaten! Now the nation thirsts for revenge more than ever; no longer shall Abyssinian occupation stain our honour. As long as our cause is just and our spirits unbroken, Maregypt can never be defeated!"

### Army Tree ###

MGY_reform_army:0 "Reform the Army"
MGY_reform_army_desc:0 "During the Storm War, the Storm King smashed through our defences as if they were paper, leaving our army in shambles and laying bare all its inadequacies. True, foreign control has long impeded the development of our armed forces, but the current state of affairs is not sustainable. If our nation was to enter into a conflict without making substantial changes, we would be courting disaster."
MGY_GBP:0 "Strategy and Pragmatism"
MGY_GBP_desc:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken—the well-worn tactics of infantry formations, rigid and well-planned defensive fortification, and reliance upon meticulously drafted battleplans are the safest way to go, as a solid plan can win many battles which seem lost."
MGY_MA:0 "Citizen Soldiers"
MGY_MA_desc:0 "If we are to maintain our independence we need to focus on mobilising the masses in defense of their country, with propaganda promoting the common good of Maregypt. We shall glorify the idea of the citizen soldier—of the common pony who joins the fight in defence of their homeland."
MGY_SF:0 "Fire and Fury"
MGY_SF_desc:0 "Why throw good ponies to their deaths when we could launch shells instead? By making use of advanced artillery to overwhelm the enemy with constant bombardment, we will not provide them a single moment's rest—shattering their morale and allowing us to easily defeat them."
MGY_MW:0 "Speed and Manoeuvre"
MGY_MW_desc:0 "Tactics must change with the times, and it is clear to us that manoeuvre is the way of the future. With more and more developments in vehicular warfare, it would be unwise for us to stick to the old tactics—we should begin shifting towards a more modern way of thinking about war."
MGY_generic_mils_1:0 "Large-Scale Investments"
MGY_generic_mils_1_desc:0 "Heavy industries are key to our economic prosperity. Unfortunately, we have a deficit of heavy equipment, large machine tools, and specialized structures necessary to support them.

MGY_rebuild_professionalism:0 "Rebuild Professionalism"
MGY_rebuild_professionalism_desc:0 "In light of recent defeats, the ranks of our army are riddled with demoralised soldiers who lack proper discipline. We must make it a priority to whip them into shape and develop some esprit de corps; this will do much to reestablish them as a unified and motivated fighting force. We may have fallen a long way from Maregypt's times of ancient glory, but our proud tradition remains."
MGY_generic_mils_2:0 "Military Industrialisation"
MGY_generic_mils_2_desc:0 "Maintaining the security of our nation necessitates the creation of a new industrial economy. Modern technologies demand greater efficiency to make the most of our land and resources. Progress marches on, and we can not afford to get left behind."
MGY_GBP_bonus:0 "Back to Basics"
MGY_GBP_bonus_desc:0 "The foundation of our strategy involves infantry digging into defensive positions while waiting for an opportune moment to strike. And so it is absolutely crucial that we focus our attention on the equipment used by frontline soldiers and the personnel that will be supporting them."
MGY_reserve_fighters:0 "Expand Our Reserves"
MGY_reserve_fighters_desc:0 "No matter what efforts we take, it is impossible to rebuild an army without soldiers to make it up. Currently our pool of new recruits is somewhat lacking, and if we plan on creating a proper military we need to remedy that with propaganda and incentives."
MGY_heavy_investment:0 "Heavier Firepower"
MGY_heavy_investment_desc:0 "Advancements in artillery technology have the potential to massively increase the destructive capabilities of our forces. We must upgrade our artillery arsenals to keep pace with these new developments, or else risk being left in the dust."
MGY_tanks_and_trucks:0 "Army Motorisation Efforts"
MGY_tanks_and_trucks_desc:0 "Motorisation greatly increases the strategic mobility of our infantry units, which would otherwise be forced to rely on arduous marches or preexisting railroads. This advantage in mobility combined with armoured toughness will allow our forces to effectively outfight and outmanoeuvre any enemy."
MGY_radio:0 "Radio Implementation"
MGY_radio_desc:0 "The radio is a marvelous invention, and perfect for our army. Through its use we can maintain our command over vast distances, and transfer information from one side of the country to the other. We need to take advantage of this at once, lest our enemies do so first."
MGY_magic:0 "Magical Weapons"
MGY_magic_desc:0 "Lately, more and more nations have started researching and developing magic weapons. We should experiment with the crystal-fuelled rifles as well. If we are able to outfit some of our units with those guns, our army will be even deadlier."
MGY_support:0 "Improve Support Equipment"
MGY_support_desc:0 "The growing complexity of modern warfare has spawned a whole generation of military personnel who will likely never see combat. These include engineers, medics, truck drivers, radio operators, and mechanics. While their duties take them away from the battlefield their role is no less important than that of any front-line soldier."
MGY_generic_artillery:0 "Artillery Advancements"
MGY_generic_artillery_desc:0 "Over the last century, the role of artillery has become increasingly important within war. Without it, a modern army can not advance lest they take horrifying casualties. As such, we must ensure that Maregypt does not lag behind in either artillery production or technological innovation."
MGY_generic_ieq:0 "Small Arms Development"
MGY_generic_ieq_desc:0 "While the number of soldiers killed by small arms is tiny compared to those taken out by artillery, we should not underestimate the importance of such weapons. By investing in a new generation of small arms, we could have a very potent edge upon our enemies, allowing us to dominate the battlefield."
MGY_reformed_GBP:0 "Proper Planning and Preparation"
MGY_reformed_GBP_desc:0 "By combining mutually supporting strongpoints with a defence in depth, our forces will be able to sap the strength and break the momentum of any attacking army. Picking our battles carefully will allow us to achieve victory with maximum efficiency and minimal casualties."
MGY_reformed_MA:0 "A Nation at Arms"
MGY_reformed_MA_desc:0 "Ours is now a popular army: one where every citizen is ready to serve Maregypt, and every soldier knows that retreat is the ultimate dishonour. With this massive and formidable force, it is possible to overwhelm any enemy with sheer numbers, creating an unrelenting tsunami for them to contend with."
MGY_reformed_SF:0 "A Wall of Shells"
MGY_reformed_SF_desc:0 "With proper training and equipment, our forces can make use of their superior firepower to achieve rapid dominance on the battlefield. By quickly bringing their force to bear against the enemy, they can paralyze the enemy's perception of the battlefield and destroy their will to fight, winning the battle as soon as it begins."
MGY_reformed_MW:0 "The War of Movement"
MGY_reformed_MW_desc:0 "By concentrating as much armour into as small a front as possible, our forces will be able to overwhelm the opposition and achieve local superiority. Combining this tactic with a highly mobile army capable of moving quickly to take advantage of any break in the enemy lines is a surefire recipe for victory."

MGY_knockout_blow_desc:0 "Time is of the essence in this conflict. Our enemies greatly outnumber us, and we cannot allow them time to consolidate their positions.

MGY_push_harder:0 "Push Harder!"
MGY_push_harder_desc:0 "Our offensive is off to a promising start, but achieving ultimate victory will require the full commitment of every Maregyptian to the war effort.

MGY_running_out_of_steam:0 "Running Out of Steam"
MGY_running_out_of_steam_desc:0 "Enemy resistance is becoming more and more fierce as our offensive enters its final phase: the decisive moment is upon us.

MGY_weed_out_kingsguard:0 "Combat the Kingsguard"
MGY_weed_out_kingsguard_desc:0 "At last, the mad Prince Shepser's reign of terror has come to an end: no longer will innocent ponies be forced to pay the price for his endless greed and ambition. But despite the fall of their leader, we should not expect the fanatical Kingsguard to give up the fight so easily.

MGH_pacify_countryside:0 "Pacify the Countryside"
MGH_pacify_countryside_desc:0 "Although the Civil War may officially be over, many hostile combatants still refuse to surrender. These holdouts have become little more than bandits, robbing and harassing ponies in the name of their defeated causes. We must root out these terrorists by ensuring that all regions of Maregypt respect the authority of the central government."
MGH_good_is_not_vengeful:0 "Good is Not Vengeful..."
MGH_good_is_not_vengeful_desc:0 "However wrong it may feel, extending a merciful hoof is the only way to put an end to this conflict. Offering amnesty to those ponies who engaged in rebellion will give them a reason to lay down their arms. After all, bringing citizens back into compliance with a law is far more important than punishing them for past offenses."
MGH_but_nor_is_it_weak:0 "...Nor is it Weak"
MGH_but_nor_is_it_weak_desc:0 "The flip side of mercy for those who cease resistance to the government is harsh suppression for those who refuse. In such cases our response must be to restore the peace with intensive force: this country will be reunited, one way or another."
MGH_reconcile_northwest:0 "Reconcile the Northwest"
MGH_reconcile_northwest_desc:0 "It was only a matter or time, but the divisive resentments which were once fanned by the LPMG have dissipated completely with the collapse of their organisation. Due to this development, our government's control over the entire coast has been solidified: the red banner flies in R'ataphet no longer!"
MGH_reconcile_centre:0 "Reconcile the Centre"
MGH_reconcile_centre_desc:0 "Although it persisted long after the defeat of his armies in the field, we are pleased to observe that the cult of personality which once existed around the pretender Prince Shepser has been eradicated. With their fanatical devotion to his cause no longer standing in the way, the ponies of central Maregypt have collectively ceased opposition to the government."
MGH_reconcile_upper:0 "Reconcile the Upper Neighile"

MGH_return_of_harmony_desc:0 "Thanks to our tireless efforts, the tragic era of ponies living in fear of paramilitary insurgency has finally come to an end.

MGH_address_the_shellshock:0 "Address the Shellshock"
MGH_address_the_shellshock_desc:0 "As it was reckless jingoism and revanchism that unleashed a nightmarish Civil War upon Maregypt, the idea of getting revenge for our past shames no longer seems appealing to most citizens. While they will no doubt fight to defend themselves, our ponies are rapidly losing their desire to wage any offensive wars. If we want to change this, we'd better act quickly."
MGH_the_great_debate:0 "The Great Debate"
MGH_the_great_debate_desc:0 "While our nation spent the last year embroiled in internal conflict, the burning question of Manedalusia did not go anywhere.

MGH_just_forget_about_it:0 "Just Forget About It"
MGH_just_forget_about_it_desc:0 "Ever since we regained our independence, the Manedalusia Issue has been a poison destroying Maregyptian society. Further obsession with it will lead the nation down the path of moral and material ruin. The reality is that the ponies of Maregypt are simply exhausted, wishing only to let go of the past and move on with rebuilding their country."
MGH_attempt_peace:0 "Reconcile the Ovingo"
MGH_attempt_peace_desc:0 "Although Ovingoland broke from Maregypt during a period of great uncertainty, we must not jump to war as our first response.

MGH_non_negotiable:0 "Quell the Ovingo"
MGH_non_negotiable_desc:0 "The treacherous Ovingo made their choice when they decided to secede during Maregypt's moment of weakness, and now they must face the consequences. Their rebel government will be swiftly crushed, and its inhabitants will be reunited with their rightful government once more."
MGH_still_need_schools:0 "We Still Need Schools"
MGH_still_need_schools_desc:0 "Illiteracy has long plagued the ponies of Maregypt, and with modernisation becoming more important than ever, the problem has grown too large to ignore. The havoc caused by recent unrest resulted in the destruction of many schoolhouses, but it also provides us with an opportunity to reform and standardise the education system."
MGH_extra_research_slot:0 "Promote Higher Education"
MGH_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "While we work to improve education for our youngest foals, the health of our academies and universities must not be neglected.

MGH_equestrian_bailout:0 "Equestrian Bailout"
MGH_equestrian_bailout_desc:0 "We must face the reality that the damage done to our nation is simply impossible to fix in a reasonable timeframe with our currently available resources. Fortunately, our pony cousins across the sea are more than willing to help us: as we work to rebuild Maregypt's shattered economy, we shall do so with substantial assistance from our Equestrian friends."
MGH_EQS_thirst_for_cotton:0 "The Thirst for Cotton"
MGH_EQS_thirst_for_cotton_desc:0 "The regions of Central and Upper Maregypt are known for their long, hot summers and rich soils, making them ideal locations for cultivating cotton. It is no secret that Equestria's industrial economy depends heavily on Maregyptian cotton exports, and so developing this sector is an appealing prospect for both our nations."
MGH_foreign_direct_investment:0 "Foreign Direct Investment"
MGH_foreign_direct_investment_desc:0 "Since foreign investment is a massive contributor to economic growth, we must do all we can to encourage Equestrian firms to open up operations in our nation. Maregypt will benefit from this as a way of financing new construction and providing employment for local workers. On the other hoof, Equestrian companies benefit from it as a way to expand their reach into the Zebrican market."
MGH_power_to_the_barons:0 "Power to the Barons"
MGH_power_to_the_barons_desc:0 "In order to promote increased investment, job creation, and effective administration, new financial policies shall be introduced to streamline economic operations within Maregypt.

MGH_tax_haven:0 "A Zebrican Tax Haven"
MGH_tax_haven_desc:0 "We can become a prime destination for foreign investors by offering low corporate tax and individual income tax rates, in addition to financial secrecy. Maregypt will greatly benefit from the capital this will draw into the economy, as funds flow in from individuals and businesses into our banks. This huge inflow of capital will be subject to fees, which we can use to raise revenue."
MGH_loadsamoney:0 "It's Raining Bits!"
MGH_loadsamoney_desc:0 "Although it took some time, our strategy of removing barriers to trade and attracting foreign investment is finally paying huge dividends. The many new incentives have attracted countless businessponies and mountains of capital to Maregypt, giving us the ability to fully finance our reconstruction efforts and get the economy back on track."
MGH_slave_to_the_sun:0 "Slaves to the Sun"
MGH_slave_to_the_sun_desc:0 "Maregypt's recovery is nearly complete. The ravages of the Civil War are behind us, although we had to pay a steep price: a larger proportion of our economy than ever before is in the hooves of Equestrian businessponies. It may not seem fair, but there is no doubt that it was necessary in order to alleviate the suffering and bring prosperity back to our people."
MGH_assert_independence:0 "Assert Our Independence"
MGH_assert_independence_desc:0 "The time has come for us to stop relying on foreign aid as the cure-all for our problems.

MGH_work_to_rebuild:0 "Work to Rebuild"
MGH_work_to_rebuild_desc:0 "Towns all across the northern coast have been devastated by fierce fighting, leaving countless ponies out of work.

MGH_inflate_the_currency:0 "Inflate the Currency"
MGH_inflate_the_currency_desc:0 "In light of our current economic situation, it would be prudent to greatly increase the supply of money. Inflation promotes speculation—if the purchasing power of money declines, then there will be a greater incentive to spend now instead of saving and spending later. This will increase spending, in turn boosting economic activity."
MGH_bigger_defense_force:0 "A Bigger Defence Force"
MGH_bigger_defense_force_desc:0 "Although the chaos of Civil War may lie behind us, we must not give in to the temptation of slashing the military's budget at the first sign of peace. Beyond guaranteeing the security of our nation, an increase in military spending will boost our prosperity and raise the employment rate, due to increased demand."
MGH_always_need_guns:0 "Bolster the Arms Industry"
MGH_always_need_guns_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that Maregypt's recent instability makes us appear vulnerable: a tempting target for any of our ambitious neighbours.

MGH_green_shoots:0 "Green Shoots"
MGH_green_shoots_desc:0 "Although it took some time, our strategy of self-sufficiency is finally paying off.

MGH_pride_regrowing:0 "The Return of Pride"
MGH_pride_regrowing_desc:0 "We are pleased to note that Maregypt's period of reconstruction is complete. The ravages of the Civil War are finally behind us, and we did it alone.

MGC_melt_the_railroads:0 "Melt the Railroads"
MGC_melt_the_railroads_desc:0 "Despite all our efforts thus far, the army is still critically short on guns and equipment.

The long term effects may be harmful, but our short term need is far greater."
MGC_wrecker_myth:0 "Expose the Wreckers"
MGC_wrecker_myth_desc:0 "Without a doubt, the greatest threat to our war effort is posed by wreckers: ponies who deliberately engage in economic sabotage.

MGC_smuggle_guns:0 "Smuggle Guns"
MGC_smuggle_guns_desc:0 "Control over the coast gives us access to a valuable source of supplies in the form of maritime arms trading. In order to ensure every soldier has a rifle and enough ammunition, we should make the most of this vital lifeline by bringing in as many weapons as possible."

MGC_discipline_through_terror_desc:0 "Victory can only be achieved if our troops are whipped into shape and taught to fear the wrath of their superiors more than the enemy's fire.

MGC_rile_everyone_up:0 "Rile Everypony Up"
MGC_rile_everyone_up_desc:0 "Inspiring our citizens to march to war is one aspect that should not be difficult at all.

MGC_restore_order_desc:0 "The war may be over, but much of the country outside R'ataphet still lies in chaos.

MGC_fight_reaction:0 "Fight Reaction"
MGC_fight_reaction_desc:0 "Our campaign against anti-government partisans must not be treated as a fight against mere banditry, but instead as neutralising a threat to the very existence of a just Maregypt.

mgy.1.t:0 "The Pillar of Hope"
mgy.1.d:0 "In 1005, when all seemed bleak and Maregypt was in its darkest hour, the ancient heroine Somnambula returned to us and gave the nation fresh hope after decades of strife and failure. Somnambula, who served as advisor to the legendary King Hisan and who bested the evil Sphinx, is still adapting to the modernised world she has returned to, but she has kept her composure well so far. The people hang on her every word, and she is so popular that she has become something of an unofficial head of state.\n\nHer approval could easily secure victory—or at least a huge surge in turnout—for any political party that managed to obtain it. Obviously, we would like that party to be ours. Somnambula is planning to visit R'ataphet on a public goodwill tour, and we must decide how tightly to control her schedule.\n\nAllowing her to tour the central street might be risky, as she could run into popular agitation stirred up by the LPMG. On the other hoof, we could keep her confined to dining with dignitaries: she wouldn't see the plight of the common ponies, but she might get swayed by scheming nobles sympathetic to the ARM. Finally, we could cancel the trip altogether, although she wouldn't be happy about that at all."
mgy.1.a:0 "Allow her to see the public in R'ataphet."
mgy.1.b:0 "Keep her confined to dining with dignitaries."
mgy.1.c:0 "Cancel the trip entirely!"

mgy.2.t:0 "A Goodwill Tour"
mgy.2.d:0 "As she laid eyes on R'ataphet, Somnambula found she could hardly recognise it after two thousand years. Strange new buildings dominated the skyline, and it seemed that the only part of the landscape that remained the same was the Neighile river. Proceeding down the central street, she was surprised to find cheering masses everywhere she looked. She was inspired: in spite of all they had gone through, the Maregyptians had not lost hope.\n\nSomnambula wanted to speak to them and bolster that hope, to express confidence in King Khefer and assure them that better times lie ahead! But she also wanted to find out more about how these ponies really lived. She had heard many speak of the plight of the poor since her return, and was curious to see what it was like for herself."
mgy.2.a:0 "She gives a speech to the ponies."
mgy.2.b:0 "She goes to see the slum dwellers."
mgy.2.c:0 "She is not allowed to interact with the public at all, for safety reasons."

mgy.3.t:0 "A Goodwill Tour"
mgy.3.d:0 "As she laid eyes on R'ataphet, Somnambula found she could hardly recognise it after two thousand years. Strange new buildings dominated the skyline, and it seemed that the only part of the landscape that remained the same was the Neighile river. Upon entering the city, she did not get a chance to see the public and was rushed to a building where a grand banquet was being held in her honour.\n\nSomnambula spent the day dining with prestigious nobles and dignitaries, and was surprised to find out that many of them were distant descendents of ponies she knew back from the days of King Hisan! In addition to Maregyptians, there were a few ponies from Equestria present as well. They described to her the wondrous new devices being designed by Equestrian inventors, leaving her quite impressed with how far technology had come."
mgy.3.a:0 "She regales the nobles with tales of their ancestors."
mgy.3.b:0 "She is fascinated by modern, Equestrian technology."

mgy.4.t:0 "A Visit to Maneisrata"
mgy.4.d:0 "In a few hours, Somnambula is scheduled to visit the coastal Manedalusian town of Maneisrata and speak to the locals. However, being an unscripted event, this visit is not without risks. We are in the midst of a delicate geopolitical situation, and Somnambula, despite diligently trying to get up to speed after two thousand years of absence, lacks an intricate understanding of the Manedalusian issue. She is largely unpredictable, and many are concerned that she might say something that gets taken the wrong way, perhaps even unintentionally inflaming tensions with Abyssinia."
mgy.4.a:0 "She praises Manedalusian culture, and their ability to work together."
mgy.4.b:0 "She mentions that Maregypt’s borders in her time stretched far into what is now Abyssinia."
mgy.4.c:0 "The event is shut down before she can say anything."

mgy.5.t:0 "The Revivalists"
mgy.5.d:0 "Somnambula's curiosity has been piqued by the Alliance for the Revival of Maregypt, and she wishes to visit their headquarters in Manephis to learn more about the group. Worryingly, the leaders of both the Absolutist and Republican ARM factions are currently in Manephis. No doubt Prince Shepser and Far Hook are each charismatic enough to make a convincing pitch for endorsing the ARM. The safest course would be to block Somnambula from visiting at all, although such overt interference might only serve to alienate her even further."
mgy.5.a:0 "Prince Shepser reminds her of her old friend Hisan."
mgy.5.b:0 "She is impressed by Far Hook's eloquence."
mgy.5.c:0 "She is stopped from going at all!"

mgy.6.t:0 "A Day at the Market"
mgy.6.d:0 "As Somnambula walked incognito through a crowded marketplace, her attention was grabbed by a group of striking factory workers. They chanted, holding up signs supporting the LPMG, and the lead striker stood atop a crate with his voice amplified by a bullhorn. "When we were foals, we were told that the King is wise and just, and that he protects all Maregyptians. Why, then, does he allow so many of us to go hungry?" he asked with rhetorical flair. "It is because he is King only for the rich! He has sold the welfare of the commoners in exchange for Equestrian gold!" His words were greeted by murmurs of agreement from the rapidly-growing crowd.\n\n"Khefer has failed us, and is nothing more than a tyrant. He and his court of greedy parasites own all the wealth, while we do all the work!" The pony raised a hoof high in the air. "The time has come for the exploited ponies of Maregypt to rise up and demand a new, fairer society. Down with the oppressors! Down with Khefer!" he shouted. "We shall bring about the rule of the working pony!" His audience erupted into enthusiastic cheering, although Somnambula was taken aback by the striker's intensity and took a moment to process her thoughts."
mgy.6.a:0 "She sympathises with the common folk."
mgy.6.b:0 "She is outraged by their verbal abuse of the King!"

mgy.7.t:0 "Dueling Theories"
mgy.7.d:0 "Since returning to Maregypt, Somnambula spent a large portion of her time reading literature. It was necessary in order to catch up on modern philosophy, science, and art after millennia of absence, and she often found it quite enlightening. One item in particular that caught her attention was an academic journal which was in the midst of a long-running dispute about the merits of two political ideologies: Republicanism and Communism. On one hoof, the Republican thinkers argued that the authority of a government should be created by the consent of its citizens, who are the source of all political power. On the other hoof were the Communists, who went even further in asserting that sweeping social change would also be necessary to lift ponies out of poverty and build a truly just society. Somnambula pondered all the arguments before reaching her own conclusion."
mgy.7.a:0 "She muses that the common folk often know their business better than a King."
mgy.7.b:0 "She remembers the wretched slaves of the Old Kingdom, and weeps for them."
mgy.7.c:0 "She muses that ivory-tower scholars know nothing about life on the ground."

mgy.8.t:0 "The Great Debate"
mgy.8.d:0 "On a breezy night in the capital, an enormous crowd of ponies turned out to witness the last debate before the election, featuring representatives from each of Maregypt's major political parties. Sitting in the front row was Somnambula, open-minded and still not fully committed to supporting any one of them. She was not prepared for the raucous affair that would ensue, as there had been no equivalent during the ancient times of Hisan.\n\nRight at the start, the Republican speaker viciously attacked the KM, denouncing the current government as weak and beholden to foreign interests. The KM speaker hit back, defending King Khefer and accusing Republicanism of running counter to Maregyptian tradition as an ideology that inflamed citizens' passions and would inevitably lead to the tyranny of the masses. The Pharaonists were next to be targeted, with the LPMG speaker unleashing a fiery broadside tarring them as scheming, untrustworthy, and unable to adapt to modernity, even going so far as to invoke the spectre of the Dynamite Plot of 994. In retaliation, the Pharaonist speaker attacked the LPMG as nothing more than a home for bloodthirsty revolutionaries, who if elected would usher in a Reign of Terror the likes of which Maregypt had never seen.\n\nIt was an ugly, four-way brawl in which no participant emerged unscathed, but when the dust settled Somnambula could not deny that there had been a clear winner."
mgy.8.a:0 "She is convinced by the KM speaker."
mgy.8.b:0 "She sympathises with the LPMG speaker."
mgy.8.c:0 "She naturally feels at ease with the Pharaonist idea."

mgy.9.d:0 "As election day fast approaches, the populace has been waiting eagerly to hear which party would secure the support of Somnambula—heroine of legend. However, it seems now they might never know, as reports indicate Somnambula recently stormed out from her residence and has gone into hiding. She had grown increasingly frustrated by King Khefer's attempts to control her as she traveled the country speaking to ponies, and is now refusing to cooperate with the government at all. At a time when Maregypt needs its idol more than ever, she is nowhere to be found."
mgy.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."

mgy.10.t:0 "Somnambula's Endorsement"
mgy.10.d:0 "As election day fast approaches, the populace has been waiting eagerly to hear which party would secure the support of Somnambula—heroine of legend. Throughout the campaign her favour was highly sought-after, as an endorsement from Maregypt's revered icon of hope was always sure to have a massive impact on the race. After months of waiting, that day has finally arrived, and Somnambula has released a statement making her pronouncement of support. She states that it was not a decision she made lightly, but in the end she chose to give her wholehearted support to..."

mgy.11.t:0 "The Manedalusian Crisis: Results and Prospects"
mgy.11.d:0 "With the government recently articulating its position on Manedalusia, the passions of many Maregyptians have become inflamed, both in support of and against the official line. This clash of ideas was given a venue in the form of a public debate scheduled to take place in Somnambula. When the day arrived, large numbers of citizens came out to witness the debate.\n\nTaking the pro-war position was a retired army officer and veteran of the 991 campaign into Abyssinia, who argued that previous experience had demonstrated that a new war with Abyssinia would be quick, easy, and sure to result in a Maregyptian victory. He also repeatedly denigrated the peace settlement imposed by the Great Powers as unjust and a stain on Maregypt's honour.\n\nTaking the opposite position was a pony journalist who was born in Manedalusia, and who opposed further conflict on the grounds that it would greatly endanger the lives of the ponies and cats who lived in the region, especially since the Manedalusians were only just beginning to recover from the damage done by the Storm King's brutal ransacking. She went on to emphasise the fact that war is unpredictable, and that a Maregyptian victory in such a hypothetical war was far from a certainty.\n\nWhen the dust had settled, both sides had gotten their share of licks in. All that remains to be seen is which side's arguments will sway the audience more."
mgy.11.a:0 "War is our only recourse!"
mgy.11.b:0 "We must not rush to such reckless action."
 
mgy.12.t:0 "Maregypt Nationalises Businesses"
mgy.12.d:0 "In the aftermath of the brutal conquest and pillaging of their lands by the Storm King, Maregypt's economy was left in a state of collapse. We have been providing substantial aid to blunt the effects of this catastrophe and help rebuild the country, in the interests of stabilising an important partner in the region. Equestrian businesses have a long history of investing in the country, which brought it great prosperity in the past, and we have always considered Maregypt a friend.\n\nHowever, it seems many Maregyptians are unhappy with the amount of influence that foreign powers exert over their nation, particularly in the economic sector. Feeling this pressure, the Maregyptian government has passed legislation to nationalise the assets of several Equestrian-owned businesses, offering only token compensation in return. Affected businessponies are outraged by the expropriation, and we are being bombarded with demands that Maregypt be harshly punished for their indiscretion."
mgy.12.a:0 "Cut our economic assistance entirely!"
mgy.12.b:0 "Reduce our economic assistance."
mgy.12.c:0 "Forgive them, they have suffered enough already."

mgy.13.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Ended!"
mgy.13.d:0 "Equestria has reacted extremely harshly to our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, no doubt spurred on by complaints from affected businessponies. Although we were forced to take this action out of desperation, the Equestrians have shown no sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. In retaliation, they have announced an immediate end to all economic aid to Maregypt. It seems those greedy mules were only ever interested in extracting what wealth they could from Maregypt, and are content to leave our ponies to rot."
mgy.13.a:0 "So much for the magic of friendship..."

mgy.14.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Reduced"
mgy.14.d:0 "Equestria has reacted fairly negatively to our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, no doubt spurred on by complaints from affected businessponies. Although we were forced to take this action out of desperation, the Equestrians have shown little sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. In retaliation, they have announced a reduction in their level of economic aid to Maregypt. Although unfortunate, Equestria's response could have been far harsher, as our aid was not ended entirely."
mgy.14.a:0 "So much for the magic of friendship..."

mgy.15.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Continues"
mgy.15.d:0 "After our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, the Equestrian government has been extraordinarily understanding, despite no doubt hearing numerous complaints from the affected businessponies. We were forced to take this action out of necessity, and the Equestrians have shown great sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. No doubt they appreciate the value of maintaining a stable ally in the region. They assure us that there will be no reduction in their level of economic aid to Maregypt."
mgy.15.a:0 "What a relief!"

mgy.16.t:0 "Maregyptian-Ovingo Peace Talks"
mgy.16.d:0 "The Knights of Maregypt have committed themselves to finding a peaceful resolution to the Ovingo crisis, and they have taken their boldest action yet to do so. Earlier this week, Ovingo community leaders from Marekush, Neighpata, and Khaneigh all converged on the capital for a high-profile summit with government representatives. The talks dragged on for days, but in the end they bore fruit. The resulting agreement affirms that the Ovingo are a part of Maregypt and have the same rights as any native Maregyptian, while also placing harsh restrictions on Ovingo and anti-Ovingo militia groups. Ovingo leaders are pleased with the outcome, and have stated that they see it as ensuring a peaceful future for their communities. Ponies across the country are also optimistic after hearing the news, viewing the agreement as an important first step towards fully integrating the zebras into Maregyptian society."

mgy.17.t:0 "Moment of Truth"
mgy.17.d:0 "After a long and brutal campaign season, election day has arrived at last. All the arguments from the parties have been made and ponies across Maregypt are finally turning out to make their voices heard at polling places. As the day progresses, reports indicate that the process is proceeding smoothly and without incident. But once all the ballots have been cast, the country will still have to wait with bated breath for the victor to be determined."
mgy.17.a:0 "Who will win?"

mgy.18.t:0 "The Results are In..."
mgy.18.d:0 "As election day wound down, the process of tallying votes was still in progress and would take some time to be completed. The process stretched deep in the night, although it was finished by the dawn of the next morning. After all the ballots had been counted in the 1008 elections to the House of Commons, a clear winner had emerged. The ponies had spoken! After a hard-fought struggle, the election was finally over. Maregypt was ready to once again face the future as one nation."
mgy.18.a:0 "Congratulations to the victors!"

mgy.19.t:0 "The Drums of War"
mgy.19.d:0 "In 988, the Abyssinians launched a despicable war of aggression, invading and occupying Manedalusian territory in Maregypt. Although we fought back to recover some of this land, the Great Powers intervened to stop the fighting before all of it could be reclaimed. Ever since, hatred of the cats has been simmering, as more and more voices began to demand that the arrogant Abyssinians be put in their place. Now, at last, the people's fury has boiled over.\n\nPublic opinion is clear, and war fever has swept through the populace. This stain on our national honour can be tolerated no longer; the common ponies will not allow it. Either we march into Manedalusia, or our own citizens will march to overthrow us. We have no choice: what was once lost must now be reclaimed. To arms!"
mgy.19.a:0 "Onward to glory!"

mgy.20.t:0 "The Second Ovingo War"
mgy.20.d:0 "Around a decade ago, the tribal Ovingo zebras, displaced by the Storm King’s conquest of their native land, first established large communities throughout southern Maregypt. After arriving, there were disputes between locals and the new arrivals, resulting in the Ovingo War, which ended with the Ovingo being granted their own patches of land in the south. Unfortunately, that fragile peace has now fallen apart.\n\nHostility and conflict between native Maregyptian and Ovingo communities have been escalating for some time, but the final straw was when an overzealous Ovingo militia group stormed an Army outpost inside Ovingo territory and declared the independence of the Ovingo from Maregypt. The announcement was met with enthusiasm by many zebras, who are rushing to lend their aid to the fledgling rebellion. There is no going back now: force is the only way to resolve the situation."
mgy.20.a:0 "We will crush this revolt!"

mgy.21.t:0 "The Offer"
mgy.21.d:0 "In an effort to put past hostilities behind us and as proof of our good faith, we shall offer to open up trade relations with Abyssinia. Reconciliation will no doubt be a long and difficult process, but we have to start somewhere. Our envoys have already been dispatched to deliver the message to the Abyssinian government, and now all we can do is wait for their response."
mgy.21.a:0 "Here's hoping they accept."

mgy.22.t:0 "Maregypt Offers to Open Trade Relations"
mgy.22.d:0 "Maregyptian envoys have arrived in Panthera bearing gifts and expressing Maregypt's desire to bury the hatchet and reopen trade between our nations. In line with the policy of [FROM.GetLeader], they wish to see our nations enter a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation, with their ultimate goal being to come to an agreement on the future of Manedalusia.\n\nTheir offer certainly sounds tempting. If we work with them we could peacefully resolve the tensions between us and avert the possibility of future war."
mgy.22.a:0 "We shall accept this generous offer."
mgy.22.b:0 "Never!"

mgy.23.t:0 "Abyssinia Accepts"
mgy.23.d:0 "Good news out of Panthera! Our envoys were graciously received by state officials upon their arrival in the city and [ABY.GetNameDef] seems receptive to our overtures. [ABY.GetLeader] met with our representatives personally and has publicly stated that Abyssinia is committed to peacefully resolving the tensions between our nations. We still have a long way to go until things are fully righted between us, but these are undeniably encouraging signs."
mgy.23.a:0 "Wonderful!"

mgy.24.t:0 "Abyssinia Refuses"
mgy.24.d:0 "We thought the Abyssinian government was a reasonable bunch, but apparently we misjudged them. Our envoys got a chilly reception from state officials in Panthera, and rather than hear us out personally they sent out a lowly minion to reject our offer. These signs are highly discouraging, and force us to question [ABY.GetNameDef]'s commitment to peace."
mgy.24.a:0 "Unfortunate."

mgy.25.t:0 "Summit Proposal Finalised"
mgy.25.d:0 "After weeks of grueling negotiations, Maregyptian and Abyssinian negotiators have at last produced a compromise proposal to resolve the Manedalusian question. Their agreement calls for the creation of a new, completely independent Manedalusia that will allow the ponies and cats of the territory to exercise their right to self-determination.\n\nHaving long recognised the unique identity of the Manedalusian people, [Root.GetLeader] has already expressed wholehearted support for the proposal. Now all we must do is wait to hear the response of [ABY.GetLeader] and the Abyssinian government."
mgy.25.a:0 "Here's hoping they agree."

mgy.26.t:0 "The Coltuba Summit Proposal"
mgy.26.d:0 "Maregyptian and Abyssinian representatives have spent the past few weeks in Coltuba, working on a proposal to resolve the Manedalusian question which has been the source of so much tension between us. After weeks of grueling negotiations, they have finally produced a compromise proposal. Their agreement calls for the creation of a new, completely independent Manedalusia that will allow the ponies and cats of the territory to exercise their right to self-determination. Crucially, both Maregypt and Abyssinia would cede their Manedalusian territory to this new state.\n\nBeing the ones who called for the summit in the first place, it is no surprise that [FROM.GetLeader] has already expressed wholehearted support for the agreement. Now the fate of the proposal is entirely in our paws. There is no doubt that it represents a promising peaceful solution to the Manedalusian question, although many will surely see us as giving up too much to secure it. Still, it must be decided: should we accept?"
mgy.26.a:0 "Yes, we should allow the Manedalusians to govern themselves."
mgy.26.b:0 "No, we have a right to rule over Manedalusia!"

mgy.27.t:0 "Abyssinia Accepts Proposal"
mgy.27.d:0 "Wonderful news comes to us today—[ABY.GetLeader] and the Abyssinian government have formally accepted the Coltuba Proposal! Although many Maregyptians were sceptical at first about entering negotiations with the cats, fearing their dishonesty, in the end we were completely vindicated. Through diplomacy, we accomplished what never could have been accomplished through reckless warmongering.\n\nJoint preparations are already underway to withdraw military forces from the territory in anticipation of the establishment of the new Manedalusian state. This is a momentous occasion, as communities which were torn apart during the wars between Maregypt and Abyssinia can finally come together as one, free nation. Without a doubt, this represents the dawn of a new era of peace in northern Zebrica."

mgy.28.t:0 "Abyssinia Rejects Proposal"
mgy.28.d:0 "Grim news comes to us today—[ABY.GetLeader] and the Abyssinian government have formally rejected the Coltuba Proposal. Many Maregyptians were sceptical about entering negotiations with the cats, fearing their dishonesty, and in the end they were proven completely right. The Abyssinians played us like fiddles and made absolute fools of us! In newspapers across the country, [Root.GetLeader] is facing criticism harsher than ever for this embarrassing failure."

mgy.35.t:0 "Central Authority Collapses!"
mgy.35.d:0 "Instability is gripping the nation, as our failure to attack Abyssinia in a timely fashion has caused the populace's already inflamed passions to boil over into full-blown insurrection. In their fury, most ponies have directed their anger away from the cats and towards the "do-nothing" Maregyptian government.\n\nHaving lost the confidence of the citizenry, rival political factions are taking advantage of the chaos by declaring their own rival regional governments, and have already convinced many localities to join them in revolt. The situation is dire: we have already lost control over large portions of the country.\n\nWithout a doubt, much chaos and bloodshed is on the horizon.

The recent period of chaos has seen the country divided between four competing governments, each one dominated by one of the four main Maregyptian political parties.\n\nIn the north, the Knights of Maregypt hold firm control over the capital city of Somnambula, while the Liberation Party of Maregypt has secured the strategically vital western coast and Neighile Delta. Further south, the ARM Monarchist faction sees its support concentrated around Prince Shepser's favoured city of Manephis, while the ARM Republicans cling to their power base along the Upper Neighile.\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn: Maregypt is shattered, and will only be reunited through force.

Countless voices filled the air, until the harsh banging of a gavel cut through the noise. "Order!" shouted the judge, a fierce young mare sitting behind a towering bench. Once the court was silent, she turned a disdainful eye down towards the aged stallion before her.\n\n"Several days ago, many ponies were injured in a trainwreck involving materiel bound for this city, the wreck being caused by an overloaded rail car which became unbalanced. Track Switch, you were the engineer of that train, correct?" The stallion hesitated, taking a laboured gulp before nodding slowly. "And is it true that you advised placing a much heavier-than-average load on that train?" The stallion nodded again, drawing a chorus of jeers from the audience. "Mr. Switch: you stand accused of counter-revolutionary sabotage," the judge narrowed her eyes intently. "What have you to say in your defence?"\n\n"It was the only option!" Track Switch cried out, pleading to both the judge and the mass of ponies surrounding him. "Do you know how many of the rail lines have been melted down? We-we have to make the most of the remaining ones i-if we're going to win this war," he blurted out, as sweat ran down his panicked face. The judge remained silent, seeming unimpressed. "And w-with less track for the trains, increasing the loads w-w-was the only way to meet my quota!" he stammered. "A-a-and besides, I'm no counter-revolutionary! I've been a party member for over a decade, check the records!"\n\nTrack Switch's flailing was interrupted by a banging gavel. "I have heard enough of your pitiful excuses," spat the judge. "Mr. Switch, I can only conclude that you intentionally overloaded your train for the purpose of causing an accident, and therefore must be held accountable." The stallion shook as terror filled his eyes. "I find you guilty of wrecking and counter-revolutionary sabotage. The punishment: execution, to be carried out immediately in full view of the public."

mgy.42.d:0 "An extraordinary situation has developed in central Maregypt, as the royalist forces commanded by Prince Shepser have taken the extreme step of building a dam across the Neighile river. Since the Neighile's annual floods will surely sweep away any dam thrown together so quickly, it is likely that he intends this as only a temporary measure to deprive us of water, while also causing immense suffering to the common ponies of Maregypt.\n\nShepser must be truly desperate to resort to such a tactic. Flood season is still months away, and in the meantime drought has already begun to ravage our lands: many will no doubt starve in the year ahead. Thanks to Shepser, this Civil War has entered into a new stage of brutality."

Late last night, excessive rainfall precipitated a flood which overwhelmed its capacities. Government officials sent a request to open the dam, but the message failed to reach it in time. The sluice gates were not able to handle the overflow of water, partially due to sedimentation blockage, and the dam subsequently collapsed.\n\nThe collapse of the dam unleashed a torrent of unimaginable destructive power which rushed onto the plains below and wiped out huge areas, leaving countless towns and cities inundated. Tragically, evacuation orders could not be delivered due to weather conditions and poor communications. Tens of thousands of ponies have already been killed as a result of the dam breaking, but that figure will surely rise as epidemics and famine take their toll on the trapped survivors."

At this very moment, Maregyptian troops are massed at the border with Manedalusia and are poised to move in and occupy the territory.\n\nWe have contacted the Abyssinian government and communicated our demand that they withdraw all of their forces from Manedalusia and cede the land to us, its rightful owners. The cats have also been made aware that if they refuse, they will face the full wrath of our army, which is eager to restore their nation's honour and avenge the unprovoked Abyssinian invasion of 988.

We both currently hold part of the whole, and it seems the fate of the Manedalusians will soon be settled once and for all. Our scouts have observed greatly increased Maregyptian military activity in Maneisrata in recent weeks, along with a massive buildup of forces on the border.\n\nThis morning, Maregyptian envoys contacted us with a demand that we withdraw all of our forces from Manedalusia and cede the land to them. Regrettably, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has made it clear that they are unwilling to explore a peaceful solution to the crisis. There is no doubt that refusing this demand will lead to all-out war. A war which would surely devastate the region and destroy the lives of countless innocent creatures.

The Abyssinians are arrogant as ever, but what they have neglected to consider is how much stronger we have become since the last time our countries met on the battlefield. [Root.GetLeader] has purged the weakness of Khefer's regime and reforged Maregypt into a proud and united nation, ready for war. It's time we taught the cats a lesson in humility!"

mgy.48.d:0 "Wonderful news comes to us today—[ABY.GetLeader] and the Abyssinian government have decided not to test our mettle and have accepted all of our demands. Scouts at the border observe that the cats are already beginning to withdraw their military forces from Manedalusia in preparation for its reincorporation into Maregypt.\n\nThis is a joyous occasion, as communities which were torn apart during the Manedalusian Wars will finally be reunited once more. Best of all, it was achieved without shedding a single new drop of blood. Throughout the nation, ponies are ecstatic to witness the end of this terrible crisis, and there is raucous rejoicing in the streets from R'ataphet to Trotebes."

mgy.50.t:0 "Mission to [MKS.GetNameDef]"
mgy.50.d:0 "Now that our domestic situation has stabilised, we are finally in a strong enough position to reassert sovereignty over the southwest. The zebras living there broke away during the Civil War, and public opinion will not tolerate this unnatural state of affairs for much longer. In an effort to defuse the situation without bloodshed, we shall offer to accept them back into Maregypt, with full amnesty for the architects of secession as well as any zebras who provided aid to the Ovingo government. Our envoys have already been dispatched to deliver this message, and the military is moving into position to be ready to strike should the Ovingo refuse."
mgy.50.a:0 "All we can do is await their reply."

mgy.51.t:0 "Maregypt Requests Our Annexation"
mgy.51.d:0 "Maregyptian envoys arrived in the capital this morning demanding that we renounce our independence and once again become part of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Now that their country is longer torn apart by internal conflict, they have turned their full attention toward reasserting control over our territory. These envoys promise that [FROM.GetLeader] will be merciful and offer amnesty for all zebras involved in our secession. Ominously, they also speak of dire consequences should we refuse.\n\nAlthough their offer is little more than a veiled threat, it seems accepting it is the only way to avert an all-out war."
mgy.51.a:0 "We don't have much of a choice..."
mgy.51.b:0 "If they want our land, they'll have to take it!"

mgy.52.t:0 "The Ovingo Agree to Return"
mgy.52.d:0 "Our envoys return bearing wonderful news—[MKS.GetLeader] and the Ovingo government heard our offer and have decided to accept it. Maregypt is whole again! The fact that we achieved this feat without bloodshed speaks to the wisdom of our diplomatic policy. Throughout the nation, ponies are ecstatic to see our territory restored at such low cost, and there is rejoicing in the streets from R'ataphet to Trotebes."
mgy.52.a:0 "Huzzah!"

mgy.53.t:0 "The Ovingo Remain Defiant"
mgy.53.d:0 "Our envoys have returned bearing unfortunate news—[MKS.GetLeader] and the Ovingo government heard our offer and rejected it out of hoof. Having scoffed at our efforts at diplomacy, clearly they have no desire to return to Maregypt. Despite our noble efforts, it seems force is the only way to regain our territorial integrity."
mgy.53.a:0 "We tried to be civil!"

mgy.54.t:0 "Defending the Revolution"
mgy.54.d:0 "After many tumultuous months, economic reconstruction has been completed and the elimination of all domestic threats means that the rule of the workers is no longer threatened from within. Additionally, the state of the military is strong. Our soldiers gained invaluable experience during the course of the Civil War, and after a thorough review, we are assured that the loyalty of the officer corps is not in doubt.\n\nWhile our nation spent a lengthy period embroiled in internal conflict, the burning question of Mandedalusia did not go anywhere. Now that we are in a stable position to address the crisis, it must not be put off any longer: it's time we settled the matter, once and for all. Our agents in the Abyssinian government indicate that their forces are inferior to our own, and liable to crumble in the face of a relentless assault. The ideal moment to strike is soon, before they have an opportunity to grow any stronger.\n\nLooking further ahead, once the Mandedalusian Crisis has been resolved and an accommodation reached with Abyssinia, we will finally be free to turn our attention away from the west. Securing peace in our region necessitates advancing further up the Neighile into Alwani and Timbucktu, as well as pushing southwest to reach the Gulf of Al'Faraqayuh. Prominent thinkers have advanced the idea of incorporating these lands into an entirely new union: the Zebrican SSR. Once established, this federal union will be a state where ponies, zebras, and horses live together in peace and prosperity."
mgy.54.a:0 "A beautiful dream."

mgy.55.t:0 "The Return of Hope"
mgy.55.d:0 "After poring over the latest employment figures, our economists have determined that the unemployment crisis which has plagued Maregypt since the outbreak of Civil War is finally over. While the National Rebuilding Initiative succeeded in its purpose of employing as many people as possible during the bleak times, we can now conclude that a national relief program is no longer needed.\n\nBy building schools, railroads, and parks, the NRI reached a helping hoof into every village in the nation. It added to the national wealth, repaired the wastage of the war, and strengthened the country. By employing countless thousands of Maregyptians, it brought to those ponies renewed hope and courage during their darkest hour. [Root.GetLeader] has ordered a gradual end to NRI activities as it depletes the funds which have already been appropriated."
mgy.55.a:0 "Fantastic!"

mgy.56.t:0 "Fate of the Arabians"
mgy.56.d:0 "War is over: the shame of 567 is avenged at last. Shepser's brilliant campaigns have seen the armies of Saddle Arabia defeated decisively in battle and Maregypt restored to its rightful supremacy. In the aftermath, all organized resistance in Arabian territory has been crushed, leaving us as the new unquestioned masters of the peninsula. Across the nation, ponies are overjoyed at the conquest of our hated rival and eager to begin reaping the bounty of this rich land. However, our stunning victory leaves us with a bit of a dilemma.\n\nThe unfortunate fact is that permanent occupation would be an exceedingly difficult task. It was only recently that our government solidified control over Maregypt proper, leading many experts to doubt if its administrative apparatus would even be capable of adapting to the challenge of maintaining order in this vast and unfamiliar territory. Additionally, there is little question that horses will not take kindly to being ruled over directly by the very ponies who invaded their homeland.\n\nOn the other hoof, we could empower willing local elites to rule Arabia in our stead. No doubt this solution would be far more palatable to the Arabians themselves. The downside is that once our Arabian agents have been given power, ensuring their loyalty becomes far more difficult. Greed and self-interest are powerful temptations; when it comes to extracting the resources we need from the territory, they are likely to place their own interests over those of Maregypt. Clearly, neither option is ideal, but what to do?"
mgy.56.a:0 "We will rule the land ourselves."
mgy.56.b:0 "Best to create a puppet government."

mgy.57.t:0 "Triumph in Manedalusia"
mgy.57.d:0 "Following the Abyssinian government's stubborn refusal to withdraw their troops from Manedalusia and peacefully resolve the crisis, our campaign to subdue the cats proved to be a stunning success. Maregyptian forces successfully bypassed Abyssinian defences and were able to push deep into feline territory before peace talks put an end to the fighting.\n\nBattlefield victory allowed our negotiators to secure highly favourable terms. Abyssinia has agreed to cede us all of Manedalusia, and for our trouble we also received the territories of Katoum and Kom Marebo in the deal. This is a truly momentous occasion: Maregypt's great national humiliation has been undone, and the terrible memory of 988 can finally be forgotten."
mgy.57.a:0 "Justice at last!"

mgy.58.t:0 "Maregypt Overruns Manedalusia"
mgy.58.d:0 "Unfortunately, the latest conflict with our belligerent eastern neighbours has ended in decisive defeat. After launching their invasion of Manedalusia, Maregyptian forces struck with devastating force, shattering our prepared defences and pushing deep into the interior of the country. This grim battlefield situation made our position in Manedalusia untenable, and forced us to make peace before our position could deteriorate any further.\n\nIn the end, we had no choice but to cede all of Manedalusia, alongside Katoum and Kom Marebo. These are alarming developments for the future security of Abyssinia: by failing to beat back this unprovoked act of aggression, it makes us appear an easy target for any other nations who wish to harm us and exploit perceived weakness. Our only recourse will be to learn from our mistakes, become stronger, and fight harder in the next war, whenever it may be."
mgy.58.a:0 "This is a catastrophe!"

mgy.59.t:0 "Defeat in Manedalusia"
mgy.59.d:0 "In the wake of the Abyssinian government's refusal to withdraw their troops from Manedalusia, our campaign to eject the occupiers proved to be a dismal failure. The cats were nowhere near as unprepared as we had hoped, and Maregyptian forces were unable to break through the ferocious Abyssinian defences. This fiasco resulted in our troops being pushed back deep into our own territory.\n\nThe prospect of absolute defeat forced us to agree to peace on Abyssinian terms. For now, we must cede all of the Manedalusian territory we currently control over to the cats. Maneisrat and Sineighi will be in their possession until we have recovered enough to contemplate launching another attack. This is an unimaginable embarrassment: insteading of avenging a past humiliation, we ended up responsible for another. How long the memory of this defeat will haunt our ponies, none can guess."
mgy.59.a:0 "This isn't over!"

mgy.60.t:0 "Maregypt Sues for Peace"
mgy.60.d:0 "The whole nation rejoices, as the latest conflict with our belligerent eastern neighbours has ended in glorious victory. After launching their incursion into Manedalusia, Maregyptian forces were repelled by our defences and beaten back decisively. Scoring victory after victory on the battlefield and pushing far beyond Manedalusia proper ultimately forced the Maregyptians to seek peace before their position could deteriorate any further.\n\nIn the end, we gained control over the rest of Manedalusia: Maneisrat and Sineighi. These are wonderful developments for the future security of Abyssinia: by beating back this unprovoked act of aggression, it shows any other nations who may wish us harm that we are not to be trifled with. In the wake of this war, Abyssinians should feel a tremendous sense of pride at finally humbling Maregypt and teaching them the price of their arrogance."
mgy.60.a:0 "Hopefully they've learned their lesson."

mgy.61.t:0 "Archaeological Digs Begin"
mgy.61.d:0 "Ever since the return of Somnambula, we have seen a surge of public interest in Ancient Maregyptian history, architecture, and art. New discoveries are made often; despite centuries of excavation and research, countless buried sites remain. This desire to learn more about Maregypt's past and reveal its mysteries drove a team of highly-respected archaeologists to conduct regional surveys of underexplored areas across the nation.\n\nThese surveys have yielded exciting results, as the archaeologists report that they have identified a highly promising site west of the Neighile Delta. Located inside of a valley, its sheer size means that the site will take some time to excavate, especially since the team must be careful to not destroy any artifacts while preserving the buried structure. As they begin this enormous undertaking, nopony knows what secrets they might uncover."
mgy.61.a:0 "Interesting, keep us posted."

mgy.62.t:0 "Archeological Dig Continues"
mgy.62.d:0 "Archaeologists excavating the recently-discovered site west of the Neighile Delta report that, despite difficulties in their early work, the latest signs are encouraging. After partial excavation, it seems they are just beginning to grasp the full scale of the buried structure, which is now estimated to be the largest ever discovered in Maregypt. Its true extent will only be knowable once it has been cleared enough for an exploration team to enter deeper into its depths. In light of this development, ponies at the site have taken to calling it the "Lost Valley."\n\nEven at this early stage, the team has already made one significant discovery: a chamber containing the remains of a massive creature which has been positively identified as a Sphinx. Although Sphinxes have long been known to exist, the body of one has never been found before now. In addition, the presence of riddles on the chamber walls has the potential to provide new insights on Ancient Maregyptian hieroglyphics. Even with these findings, we still don't know the definitive purpose of the structure. It will take substantially more effort to clear out centuries of rubble and fully excavate this vast subterranean complex."
mgy.62.a:0 "Hmm."

mgy.63.t:0 "Archeological Dig Uncovers Tomb"
mgy.63.d:0 "We have just received some exciting news from archaeologists in the Lost Valley. After extensive clearing in the outer chambers of the structure, an exploration team was finally able to discover its true nature: it is, in fact, the sprawling tomb of an ancient King. Further excavations revealed that this tomb is even larger than was first thought, as it contains more corridors, with more rooms, branching off from previously unearthed parts of the tomb.\n\nArtifacts and inscriptions have thus far not provided sufficient evidence to narrow down which King the complex was built for. Hundreds of rooms and chambers have been discovered so far, only a fraction of which have been cleared, and work is still continuing on clearing the rest of the tomb. As exploration of the complex enters its final phase, the search is now focused on locating the body and determining the identity of the Pharaoh within."
mgy.63.a:0 "Excellent!"

mgy.64.t:0 "The Lost Pharaoh"
mgy.64.d:0 "Archaeologists excavating the Lost Valley tomb site have finally determined the identity of who it was built for: Pharaoh Shepses V. His mummy was located deep inside the tomb; however, what followed was an extraordinary series of events. The exploration team discovered a black ancient tome, accompanied by canopic jars carrying the Pharaoh's preserved organs. After reading from this mysterious book aloud, the remains of a Pharaoh reanimated and began attacking members of the team.\n\nThe situation seemed dire until several brave archaeologists were able to find the hidden spell to make Shepses mortal buried elsewhere in the tomb. They confronted the undead Pharaoh before he could escape and cast it, fatally wounding him. Naturally, the public will not be made privy to the true nature of these events, and our official story will be that the deaths of all members of the exploration team were caused by a series of cave-ins."
mgy.64.a:0 "Incredible!"

mgy.65.t:0 "The Lost Pharaoh"
mgy.65.d:0 "Archaeologists excavating the Lost Valley tomb site have made a surprising discovery: the remains of a Pharaoh who appears to have been erased from history. This previously-unknown ruler was found buried with a variety of mysterious artifacts. Inside the room with his sarcophagus were a sun-shaped statue, a bowl of emeralds, a bronze statue of a goat, and a strange book bound in black leather and written in red ink.\n\nUnfortunately, the script found inside the book confounded all attempts to decipher it, leaving us only able to guess at its meaning. Most puzzling of all, researchers have not even found any indication of the Pharaoh name, making any attempt to fit him into the chronology of Maregyptian history extremely difficult. Ironically enough for an expedition of discovery, this excavation has ended up raising far more questions than answers."
mgy.65.a:0 "Huh."

mgy.66.t:0 "The Lost Pharaoh"
mgy.66.d:0 "Archaeologists excavating the Lost Valley tomb site have finally determined the identity of who it was built for: the semi-mythical Pharaoh of the Re'emite Exodus, Shepses II. Before now, most ponies believed this tale was just a legend, but inscriptions and illustrations inside the tomb back up the story and leave little doubt as to its veracity.\n\nThe ancestors of the Re'emites first entered Maregypt thousands of years ago, but by the mid-1300s BLB the Pharaoh had become concerned by their numbers and strength, and sought to enslave them. What followed was the First Time Of Woe: a decade of terrible disasters. Famines, unnatural burning rain, infections of the water supply, and multiple plagues battered the country and reduced it to a husk of its former self. By the end of this decade, the Pharaoh had abandoned his project and allowed the Re'emites to leave in peace.\n\nPopular historians have long attempted to draw a connection between the First Time Of Woe and the mythical Re'emite Exodus, but there was little evidence to support such theories before now. As if to demonstrate proof of the magical nature of these events, locusts erupted from the tomb and killed many members of the archaeological team after the sarcophagus of Shepses was located."

 MGY_king_khefer_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 956 in Somnambula\n\n§YBiography§!: The scion of a minor noble family, Khefer grew up during a time of great change for Maregypt. In the 960s, Saddle Arabian power and prestige was in decline, while Equestrian influence, both economic and intellectual, was on the rise. As he came of age, his parents sent him to Equestria to receive a top-flight education, as was common for wealthy Maregyptians. While living in Equestria, Khefer was greatly impressed by the country's prosperity and stability. Naturally curious, he approached his studies with gusto and after reading many Equestrian thinkers, dedicated himself to advancing modern, liberal ideals.\n\nKhefer finished his education in 986 and returned to Somnambula mere months before the outbreak of the Birthday Revolt. When that crisis gripped the city, he cheered on the protesters and joined in their celebrations after Maregypt secured its independence. However, despite forcing the Saddle Arabians to back down, the question lingered over who should lead the country. In the debate that ensued, many of the old nobility felt that they were obvious choices, as some of them had ancestry going all the way back to the Second Kingdom, while there also existed a small but vocal faction arguing for the establishment of a democratic republic. But in the end, the military surprised everypony by choosing to crown Khefer as King.\n\nThe selection of the soft-spoken, relatively anonymous Khefer led many to believe that he was chosen solely because the army thought he would be easy to control. However, the following years proved him to be a quite competent, if unexceptional, leader, perfectly capable of asserting himself. One of his most controversial and consequential moves was the establishment of a Parliament, implementing ideas that he had picked up during his Equestrian education. His liberal reforms made him many enemies among the nobility, provoking the Dynamite Plot of 994, but Khefer was not deterred. Believing it to be his duty to drag Maregypt out from under its past, he remains a strong advocate for constitutional monarchy and the political rights of his subjects.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 MGY_prince_shepser_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of July, 981 in Marephis\n\n§YBiography§!: Of all the figures to rise to prominence in post-independence Maregypt, none has captured the public's imagination quite like the youthful, energetic Shepser. Descended from a storied bloodline, Shepser traces his ancestry all the way back to the mythic age of the Second Kingdom. As a foal, he adored reading stories about Ancient Maregypt and became enthralled by its tales of adventure, romance, and heroism. Inspired, Shepser devoted all his ambition towards restoring Maregypt's lost glory. It was a dream he shared with his father: Prince Hepshut of Marephis.\n\nPrince Hepshut witnessed the Birthday Revolt and the collapse of Saddle Arabian authority, and was one of many nobles jostling for the empty Maregyptian throne, but in the end the military crowned Khefer—a dark horse candidate—as King. The following years, Hepshut watched in dismay as Khefer weakened the monarchy and pursued pro-Equestrian policies, never truly accepting the fact that he had been passed over. And so he hatched a scheme with a group of disgruntled army officers to eliminate Khefer and seize the throne; it was the infamous Dynamite Plot of 994. The plan ended in failure and resulted in Hepshut being arrested and stripped of his title, which passed to Shepser. At 13 years old, the now Prince Shepser was fortunately too young to be involved in the plot.\n\nThe disgrace of his father did nothing to phase Shepser, whose hot-blooded temperament shielded him from melancholy. As he came of age, Shepser's zest for life blossomed. Deciding not to shy away from indulging in pleasure, he was rarely being seen in public without a beautiful mare or two by his side. His magnetic personality made him a fixture of Maregyptian high society, and he used his natural charisma to build relationships that would greatly aid his political ambitions. Being a firm believer in the wisdom of centralised authority, Shepser holds absolute monarchy to be the ideal form of government, and believes democracy in any form to be a mistake.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

In 976, she applied for army officer training and was accepted; her tactical brilliance and personal charisma aided her in rising rapidly through the ranks.\n\nShe had the good fortune to be in the right place at the right time during the Birthday Revolt of 987. While the Governor struggled to formulate a response to the protests in Somnambula, Far Hook was closeby and wasted no time seizing the initiative. She took command of army troops in the city and arrested the Governor before declaring Maregypt independent of Saddle Arabian rule. She was also instrumental in selecting Prince Kepher to fill the country's empty throne as a compromise between the old nobility and radical republican factions.\n\nThe next year, Abyssinia sought to take advantage of the chaos and launched an invasion, crossing the border into Manedalusia. Maregyptian forces were unable to organise properly and lost large swaths of territory until Far Hook rallied them, defeating the Abyssinian forces in the Battle of R’ataphet. She drove the cats back out of Sineigh, but was unable to bypass Abyssinian fortifications in Coltuba before the end of the war.\n\nAlthough she naturally supported King Khefer at the start of his reign, she became disaffected after the economic downturn of 998. Six years later, when the Storm King routed all Maregyptian armies—including Far Hook's—she publicly blamed the defeat not on the military but on a "soft and decadent" home front which had grown too dependent on Equestria. Not long after, she allied with Prince Shepser to topple the very King she had once helped to the throne. The gamble paid off, and now Far Hook finds herself at the helm of Maregypt with few obstacles standing between her and her lifelong dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 MGY_squash_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 952 in Assyut\n\n§YBiography§!: The eldest son of a middle-class family of weavers, Butternut's childhood took place during a period of rising prosperity for Maregypt. However, his peaceful upbringing did not forestall the development of a massive rebellious streak: throughout his teenage years, Butternut neglected his studies and chose instead to devote his time and energy to anti-government activism. At the age of only 21, he masterminded a plan to hijack a train filled with tribute for the Grand Prince of Saddle Arabia. This daring theft was successful, but due to a mix-up, instead of securing the gold tribute, Butternut ended up with a shipment of pumpkins intended for Asstyria.\n\nFailure in this attempt did not spare him the wrath of the authorities, and he opted to flee the country entirely to escape capture, ultimately ending up in New Mareland. Butternut often claims that it was during this long period of self-imposed exile that his education truly began. Becoming deeply immersed in New Mareland's underground socialist movement, he read countless books on revolutionary theory and praxis. The connections he made and their influences were key to his eventual adoption of mostly orthodox Marksist ideology.\n\nAfter the Birthday Revolt completely upended Maregyptian politics, Butternut was granted amnesty and finally allowed to return home. He wasted little time getting to work as a political organiser. In 997, inspired by recent events in Stalliongrad and dissatisfied with the fecklessness of the country's existing left-wing movements, he founded the Liberation Party of Maregypt in R'ataphet. Butternut's leadership established a solid foundation for the new party, and in the two years after its founding the LPMG experienced a surge in membership. Helped along by sheer determination, events have conspired to propel this once obscure pony to the cusp of national leadership. Given this opportunity, nopony is completely certain what he plans to do with it."

# Sonambula's Mood GUI
 MGY_HARMONY_TOOLTIP:0 "The Knights of Maregypt are our country's current ruling party, tracing their origins back to the chaotic days following the Birthday Revolt. As debate raged among ponies as to what form Maregypt's new government should take, eventually a consensus was reached on a constitutional monarchy. The monarch chosen, Khefer, was a self-styled progressive who looked to Equestria for guidance and inspiration. Since then, the Knights have dedicated themselves to defending the post-independence order and liberal parliamentarism. However, they have faced harsh criticism in recent years for their anti-war and pro-Equestrian policies, which many ponies believe are harmful to Maregyptian interests."
 MGY_NETURALITY_TOOLTIP:0 "The Alliance to Restore Maregypt is a broad-tent, loose alliance of nationalists who desire the revival of Maregypt’s military might and national pride. The Monarchist faction wishes to achieve this by returning to the ways of the Old Kingdom. Revering tradition, they believe that an absolute monarchy with a strong pharaoh is needed to reclaim Maregypt's ancient glory and restore the territories that have been lost over centuries of decline and subjugation."
 MGY_FASCIST_TOOLTIP:0 "The Alliance to Restore Maregypt is a broad-tent, loose alliance of nationalists that desire the revival of Maregypt’s military might and national pride. The populist ARM Republican faction favours increased democracy, with an eye toward eventually abolishing the monarchy altogether. Fiercely patriotic, their proposed policy is one of isolation as they wish to stop further encroachment of foreign influence and ideas. The Republicans lack the grand geopolitical ambitions of their Monarchist allies, rejecting territorial aggrandisement as unwise, with the exception of Manedalusia."
 MGY_COMMUNIST_TOOLTIP:0 "Founded by famed revolutionary Butternut Squash in 997, the Liberation Party of Maregypt advocates a fairly standard Marksist platform, enticing followers with the promise of worker liberation and an end to capitalist exploitation. They have gained popularity as the Maregyptian economy continues to stagnate, but although many ponies have flocked to their banner in recent years, many more still fear the social upheaval that would result if they were to ever come to power."

 MGY_character_Khefer_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: February 11th, 984\n\n§YBiography§!: A Pony of principle, Mardjed Nebe Khefer was born the third son to the late King Sneighfru. His older brother and sister were lost to the Storm King's rampage alongside with his mother, leaving him the heavy duty of guiding Maregypt throughout these difficult times. A close friend to the Vizier Shaa Doof, King Khefer came to power with hope in his heart and stalwart faith in Harmony, but found his optimism relentlessly beaten back by the country's spiralling poverty, increasing radicalism and recurrent political crises. He quickly began vast and ambitious projects to modernise society but these were met with limited successes, with the only tangible results being more ammo landing in the radicals' hands. His characteristic naiveity - while charming to some - has led him to becoming ever so reliant on his ailing Vizier and members of the militant Maredjay. King Khefer is, if anything, the proof that good ambitions alone too often amount to naught.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

 MGY_character_farhook_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: April 4th, 957\n\n§YBiography§!: Ever since she was a foal, Feruk had a fascination for Maregyptian history. An aspiring historian, she enrolled in the royal academy of arts at the young age of sixteen - with star-filled eyes and a dream. When the academy was forcibly closed by the Grand Prince's edict, she threw her lot in with the Free Maregyptian Army, where her sharp intellect and cunning quickly propelled her to the top of the organisation. Swearing loyalty to King Snefru I, she served her country throughout the terrible Storm Years. However, the horrors of the conflict and the ensuing devastation broke something within her, and she decided to dedicate herself to rebuilding Maregypt from its ashes at any cost. She swiftly found herself at home within the Veterans' Association for Maregypt, where her fiery personality and oratory skills led her to take leadership of the organisation with the goal to reorganise it into a cohesive political force.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

 MGY_character_Narmare_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:August 3rd, 963\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to an impoverished family living in the Neighle Delta, Narmare, inspite of being named after a King of legend, is the antithesis of his namesake. Having spent a decade with his hooves deep in the mud, he always resented the perceived injustices and class divides of Maregyptian society. Inspired by smuggled Marksist and liberal Harmonic books he had managed to acquire he quickly took to both, and became a vocal advocate for socialist reforms within Maregypt. A charispatic Pony, witty writer and avowed republican, he founded the Maregyptian People's Party as a successor to the Agrarian Party with the goal of bringing social and economical justice to all through a combination of political reform, argarian modernisations and a turn away from Equestria's contrasting and domineering Harmonic ideals.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_ShaaDoof_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: August 7th, 938\n\n§YBiography§!: Few ponies can atteset as to having had an life as eventful as Shaa Doof. Born Nefersu Shara Doof, Shaa Doof served as a police officer, as a journalist, as a secretary, as an ambassador and as a politician. Careful by nature and pragmatic by necessity, he has been instrumental in keeping the kingdom together, from the great famine of 996 to the Storm King's onslaught. Though now in his latter years he remains nonethless a beacon of stability, a guiding light for all, king included, even as increasingly louder voices call out for his resignation in the face of an ever pressing need for change and reform.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Ahhotep:0 "Ahhotep"
 MGY_character_Ahhotep_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: June 26th, 973\n\n§YBiography§!: Born with a sword in one hand and a knife in the other, Ahhotep marched into a life in the Maredjay which had been laid out for her before she was born. She rapidly climbed the Maredjay's ranks with staggering speed and dedication, ascending from Noviate to that of Bannerwoman in under two years. In spite of her noble ties - being a cousin to King Khefer himself - she did not evacuate alongside the rest of the nobility during the Storm King's invasion. Instead, she remained at her post, resolved to fight the invaders to the bitter end. Had she not remained to defend Manephis alongside her battle-sisters, then there is no doubt that the city would not have remained standing. It was for all these reasons that King Khefer and the royal diet appointed her as the new Lady-Commander of the Maredjay in 1005, though she has seldom attempted to conceal her contempt for the new King's naivety.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Neighkt:0 "Neighkt Hay-Hor"
 MGY_character_Neighkt_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:June 30th, 980\n\n§YBiography§!: The only son of a potter and a priestess, Neighkt found himself stumbling head first through the royal secretariat by a stroke of luck - even though he had yet to remember any of the Maregyptian litterary classics, where his genuine nature and quick thinking led him to Shaa Doof - then Vizier to King Sneighfru - to take notice of him. The aspiring scribe quickly became one of Shaa Doof's brightest pupils, and soon enough, he was groomed into a potential successor. Under these circumstances he often spent time alongside the royals - including prince Khefer. The two shared a sense of optimism and a fondness for the arts and senet games - earning Neighkt the friendship of the future King of Maregypt. Though times have been hard for both, Neighkt never stopped trying, and for that, he was selected as a potential overseer of the crown with Shaa Doof's blessing, the youngest Pony to potentially fill this position in living memory.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

Possessed by an insatiable curiousity and gifted a brilliant intellect, Imtrotep became an architect of renown; an engineer and mathematician first and foremost, he ascended the ranks of the new Maregyptian administration following its independence - seeking to make his mark in Maregyptian history.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Merithaymen_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:July 12th, 964\n\n§YBiography§!: A mellow, easy-going mare, Merithaymen is the current Overseer of the Temples. She was Prince's Trotmosis' wet nurse, and his death affected her profoundly. Finding peace within the temples, she has now dedicated herself to restoring and preserving the Maregyptian religious institutions. A fervent pacifist and staunch advocate for the poor and the needy, she has accrued significant political clout - a trajectory which echoes that of her forerunners.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_shepser_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:April 20th, 956\n\n§YBiography§!: As passive and steady as the waters of the Neighle itself, Prince Shepser is the late King Sneighfru's cousin. The former mayor of Manephis under the Grand Prince, he never enjoyed the spotlight, being more at ease within the shadows of the political apparatus. Diligent and traditionally-minded, he has gained some prominence amongst the King's advisors as the voice of restraint but also as the bridge between Maregypt's young monarch and its older and influential landowners.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

 MGY_character_NeighSer_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:January 15th, 977\n\n§YBiography§!: A former member of the Veterans for Maregypt, Neigh Ser grew delusion by the group's doctrinal shift and embracing of ultra-nationalistic rhetoric. Instead, Neigh Ser left to form his own clique - the Young Officers, which he then shortly abandoned to join the Maregyptian People's Party. Embracing the Zebrican undercurrent, he propelled it to the forefront of the socialist movement in Maregypt - putting him simultaneously at odds with Narmare Redet and making him a target for political repression. A “sincere opportunist” and rising political fox, he has become a meteoric figure in the Maregyptian socialist scene.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

A voice of restraint, she has always preferred to act from outside the political scene - opting instead to leverage her influence through tactical endorsements and the occasional public appearance. Following the Storm King's fall and the Kingdom's devastation however, her image was co-opted by Shaa Doof's cabinet as a means to legitimise their increasingly unpopular policies. This has, in turn, led to occasional arguments between the heroine and the aging Vizier.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

As the daughter of librarians, she developed great interests in books and lexicons, and started her education in an early age in the Library of Prospero.\n\nAfter graduation, she was selected by local government and began her service in the Asterion Army. During the service, she heard news from Maregypt. The rumors about her homeland made it a pity for her since she knew nothing about the blood within her vain.\n\nSo, she decided to go home, to the motherland that she had never stepped on.

 MGY_Lore.1.title:0 "A Setting Sun"
 MGY_Lore.1.desc:0 "Maregypt - the land of legends, the cradle of Pony civilisation in western Zebrica - is now little more than a cluster of run-down villages and backwards cities littered among ancient ruins, desolate farmland and forgotten necropoli. The last centuries have not been kind to the ponies of the Neighle: foreign dominance, famines and the Storm King's ruinous advance have extorted a terrible toll from the valley. And yet, Maregypt persists. The land of Somnambula - Harmony's southern bulwark - would not be easily broken.\n\nFreed from its bonds under Sneighfru the Bold in 998 ALB, the Kingdom of Maregypt renewed its ties to Equestria, setting the stage for its return on the world stage. Yet, catastrophe struck in 1004 ALB when the Storm King sacked the country, killing its King and crown prince. Through sheer grit - and the help of heroes such as Far Hook and Ahhotep - did the nation survive. A semblance of normalcy returned with the defeat of the Storm King and ascension of the young Khefer III to the throne the following year.\n\nStill reeling from all these challenges, the country's administration limps along under Vizier and political maverick Shaa Doof. Unrest across its southern provinces, separatist movements in the west and the south west, along political opportunists all threaten to push the kingdom towards self-destruction. Only time will tell what the future holds for Maregypt..."

 MGY_Lore.2.title:0 "The National Maregyptian Party"
 MGY_Lore.2.desc:0 "Having held power since 1000 ALB, the National Maregyptian Party (Or SHH) has long since solidified its position as the Kingdom's premiere political force. At the midway point between a big-tent party and an extension of the throne's political will, it is the brain child of Vizier Shaa Doof. Made up of moderate members of the free Maregyptian army, monarchists, politically-savvy landowners, intellectuals alongside wealthy farmers and members of the royal family, the National Maregyptian Party reflects the pragmatic nature of its creator: Harmony with compromises.\n\nHowever the party's overtly broad political platform - clashing with its aversion for reform, has led to its fracturing into different factions; for years now the National Maregyptian Party has been divided between three cliques: the centrist Somnambula Circle, led by Shaa Doof and his protege Neighkt, the Reformist Clique, and the staunchly anti-socialist Lotus Society led by Imaru. Aside from the aforementioned internal divisions, the National Maregyptian Party is also endorsed by numerous influential figures such as King Khefer and Somnambula herself, but also by prince Shepser and High Priestess Merithaymen.\n\nIncreasingly unpopular, lacking a strong cohesive leadership and struggling to deal with the rising influence of socialist and supremacist movements alike, the National Maregyptian Party is truly a reflection of the Kingdom itself: a shaky edifice, held together by a fading Vizier and an eroding faith in a fresh dynasty."

 MGY_Lore.3.desc:0 "Following the disbanding of the Free Maregyptian Party in 997 ALB, the stage was set for a socialist movement to fill in the void. The Maregyptian People's Party was thus born from the ashes of its republican predecessor as a merger between the National Maregyptian Union and the Farmer-Labour Parties. Under Narmare Redet's leadership, the party's political platform has in recent years shifted away from its agrarian roots to a broader, mixed ideology with its members likewise holding a diverse host of views and beliefs ranging from democratic socialism to social monarchism - though the party chairpony has positioned himself time and time again as a stauch anti-monarchist and anti-capitalist.Whilst the Maregyptian People's Party has so far only had limited political representation, its rising popularity has been a cause for concern to many within the Harmonic establishment, leading to an increase in political repression from the Maregyptian Government.\n\nFurther to the left of the Maregyptian People's Party are the so-called Young Officers - more radical, unorthodox socialists led by a young colonel and prominent pony of the people Neigh Ser. Whilst not officially members of the Maretyption People's Party the Young Officers have remained steadfast in showing a united front with Narmare, though it remains to be seen if this is true loyalty or merely an alliance of convenience..."

 MGY_Lore.4.title:0 "A New Radical Movement?"
 MGY_Lore.4.desc:0 "The ever-present political and regional instability only exacerbated King Sneighfru and King Khefer's overreliance on the military to hold onto their power. In particular the Mareday - the all-female quasi-religious order - have attained an unparalled prominence on the Maregyptian political scene. Led by Lady-Captain Ahhotep, distant cousin to King Khefer, the Maredjay have asserted themselves as kingmakers and defenders of the realm. Whilst not overtly involved within the kingdom's party schemes, the Maredjay have nonetheless continued to lend a tacit support to traditionalists and other, less Harmony-minded ponies. In particular, and even if not politically outspoken, Ahhotep herself has frequently butted heads with Vizier Shaa Doof, and is one of the few ponies who has dared to openly criticise the King to his face. Rumours abound on the Lady-Captain's contempt for socialists, Equestria and Harmony itself as she leads the Maredjay to persecute and cull any percieved threat to the kingdom's stability.\n\nThat is not to say that the military is but one homogeneous political behemoth. Within the army lay two more factions: the left-wing Young Officers, and the deeply reactionary Veterans' Association for Maregypt led by general Far Hook.\n\nAn accomplished tactician, a hero of the independence war and an fanatically nationalistic mare, Far Hook is a textbook supremacist. Utterly authoritarian, obesessed with restoring Maregypt's national pride and bearing a deep-seated hatred for those that brought her country low, Far Hook would sooner tear Maregypt from its sarcophagus by force than watch it die. Leading the Veterans for Maregypt - a fringe, would-be mass movement, the general has bidden her time so far, holding her cards close to her chest."

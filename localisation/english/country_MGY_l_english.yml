 MGY_character_Khefer:0 "Khefer III"
 MGY_character_Khefer_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: February 11th, 984\n\n§YBiography§!: a Pony of principle, Mardjed Nebe Khefer was born the third son to the late King Sneighfru. His older brother and sister were lost to the Storm King's rampage alongside with his mother, leaving him the heavy duty of guiding Maregypt throughout these difficult times. A close friend to the Vizier Shaa Doof, King Khefer came to power with hope in his heart and stalwart faith in Harmony, but found his optimism relentlessly beaten back by the country's spiralling poverty, increasing radicalism and recurrent political crises. He quickly began vast and ambitious projects to modernise society but these were met with limited successes, with the only tangible results being more ammo landing in the radicals' hands. His characteristic naiveity - while charming to some - has led him to becoming ever so reliant on his ailing Vizier and members of the militant Maredjay. King Khefer is, if anything, the proof that good ambitions alone too often amount to naught.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

 MGY_character_farhook:0 "Far Hook"
 MGY_character_farhook_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: April 4th, 957\n\n§YBiography§!: ever since she was a foal, Feruk had a fascination for Maregyptian history. An aspiring historian, she enrolled in the royal academy of arts at the young age of sixteen - with star-filled eyes and a dream. When the academy was forcibly closed by the Grand Prince's edict, she threw her lot in with the Free Maregyptian Army, where her sharp intellect and cunning quickly propelled her to the top of the organisation. Swearing loyalty to King Snefru I, she served her country throughout the terrible Storm Years. However, the horrors of the conflict and the ensuing devastation broke something within her, and she decided to dedicate herself to rebuilding Maregypt from its ashes at any cost. She swiftly found herself at home within the Veterans' Association for Maregypt, where her fiery personality and oratory skills led her to take leadership of the organisation with the goal to reorganise it into a cohesive political force.\n\n§YPortait by§!: Scroup"

 MGY_character_Narmare:0 "Narmare Redet"
 MGY_character_Narmare_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:August 3rd, 963\n\n§YBiography§!: born to an impoverished family living in the Neighle Delta, Narmare, inspite of being named after a King of legend, is the antithesis of his namesake. Having spent a decade with his hooves deep in the mud, he always resented the perceived injustices and class divides of Maregyptian society. Inspired by smuggled Marksist and liberal Harmonic books he had managed to acquire he quickly took to both, and became a vocal advocate for socialist reforms within Maregypt. A charispatic Pony, witty writer and avowed republican, he founded the Maregyptian People's Party as a successor to the Agrarian Party with the goal of overthrowing the monarchy and bringing social and economical justice to all through a combination of political reform, argarian modernisations and a turn towards Maregypt's Zebrican roots to break away from Equestria's contrasting Harmonic ideals.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_ShaaDoof:0 "Shaa Doof"
 MGY_character_ShaaDoof_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: August 7th, 938\n\n§YBiography§!: few ponies can atteset as to having had an life as eventful as Shaa Doof. Born Nefersu Shara Doof, Shaa Doof served as a police officer, as a journalist, as a secretary, as an ambassador and as a politician. Careful by nature and pragmatic by necessity, he has been instrumental in keeping the kingdom together, from the great famine of 996 to the Storm King's onslaught. Though now in his latter years he remains nonethless a beacon of stability, a guiding light for all, king included, even as increasingly louder voices call out for his resignation in the face of an ever pressing need for change and reform.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Ahhotep:0 "Ahhotep"
 MGY_character_Ahhotep_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: June 26th, 973\n\n§YBiography§!: born with a sword in one hand and a knife in the other, Ahhotep marched into a life in the Maredjay which had been laid out for her before she was born. She rapidly climbed the Maredjay's ranks with staggering speed and dedication, ascending from Noviate to that of Bannerwoman in under two years. In spite of her noble ties - being a cousin to King Khefer himself - she did not evacuate alongside the rest of the nobility during the Storm King's invasion. Instead, she remained at her post, resolved to fight the invaders to the bitter end. Had she not remained to defend Manephis alongside her battle-sisters, then there is no doubt that the city would not have remained standing. It was for all these reasons that King Khefer and the royal diet appointed her as the new Lady-Commander of the Maredjay in 1005, though she has seldom attempted to conceal her contempt for the new King's naivety.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Neighkt:0 "Neighkt Hay-Hor"
 MGY_character_Neighkt_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:June 30th, 980\n\n§YBiography§!: the only son of a potter and a priestess, Neighkt found himself stumbling head first through the royal secretariat by a stroke of luck - even though he had yet to remember any of the Maregyptian litterary classics, where his genuine nature and quick thinking led him to Shaa Doof - then Vizier to King Sneighfru - to take notice of him. The aspiring scribe quickly became one of Shaa Doof's brightest pupils, and soon enough, he was groomed into a potential successor. Under these circumstances he often spent time alongside the royals - including prince Khefer. The two shared a sense of optimism and a fondness for the arts and senet games - earning Neighkt the friendship of the future King of Maregypt. Though times have been hard for both, Neighkt never stopped trying, and for that, he was selected as a potential overseer of the crown with Shaa Doof's blessing, the youngest Pony to potentially fill this position in living memory.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Imtrotep:0 "Imtrotep"
 MGY_character_Imtrotep_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:November 1st, 972\n\n§YBiography§!: some ponies can find contentment in the simplest things. Imtrotep is not one of these. Possessed by an insatiable curiousity and gifted a brilliant intellect, Imtrotep became an architect of renown; an engineer and mathematician first and foremost, he ascended the ranks of the new Maregyptian administration following its independence - seeking to make his mark in Maregyptian history.\n\n§YPortait by§!: BlakaSmoko"

 MGY_character_Merithaymen:0 "Merithaymen"
 MGY_character_Merithaymen_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:July 12th, 964\n\n§YBiography§!: a mellow, easy-going mare, Merithaymen is the current Overseer of the Temples. She was Prince's Trotmosis' wet nurse, and his death affected her profoundly. Finding peace within the temples, she has now dedicated herself to restoring and preserving the Maregyptian religious institutions. A fervent pacifist and staunch advocate for the poor and the needy, she has accrued significant political clout - a trajectory which echoes that of her forerunners"

 MGY_character_shepser:0 "Shepser"
 MGY_character_shepser_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:April 20th, 956\n\n§YBiography§!: as passive and steady as the waters of the Neighle itself, Prince Shepser is the late King Sneighfru's cousin. The former mayor of Manephis under the Grand Prince, he never enjoyed the spotlight, being more at ease within the shadows of the political apparatus. Diligent and traditionally-minded, he has gained some prominence amongst the King's advisors as the voice of restraint but also as the bridge between Maregypt's young monarch and its older and influential landowners."

 MGY_character_NeighSer:0 "Neigh Ser"
 MGY_character_NeighSer_bio:0 "§YBorn§!:January 15th, 977\n\n§YBiography§!: a former member of the Veterans for Maregypt, Neigh Ser grew delusion by the group's doctrinal shift and embracing of ultra-nationalistic rhetoric. Instead, Neigh Ser left to form his own clique - the Young Officers, which he then shortly abandoned to join the Maregyptian People's Party. Embracing the Zebrican undercurrent, he propelled it to the forefront of the socialist movement in Maregypt - putting him simultaneously at odds with Narmare Redet and making him a target for political repression. A “sincere opportunist” and rising political fox, he has become a meteoric figure in the Maregyptian socialist scene."

 MGY_character_somnambula:0 "Somnambula"
 MGY_character_somnambula_bio:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: a pony of legend whose name is sung both at home and abroad, Somnambula has surprisingly taken a back role in the Kingdom's politics. A voice of restraint, she has always preferred to act from outside the political scene - opting instead to leverage her influence through tactical endorsements and the occasional public appearance. Following the Storm King's fall and the Kingdom's devastation however, her image was co-opted by Shaa Doof's cabinet as a means to legitimise their increasingly unpopular policies. This has, in turn, led to occasional arguments between the heroine and the aging Vizier."

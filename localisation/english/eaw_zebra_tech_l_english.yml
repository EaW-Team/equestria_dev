    zebra_race:0 "Zebra Race"
    zebra_race_desc:0 "The Zebras are equids similar to earth ponies but recognizable by their striped black and white coat. Their flanks have a spiral symbol that resembles a pony's cutie mark but is identical on every zebra. Its meaning or purpose is unknown. Zebras do have limited magical abilities, which are mostly used for the brewing and use of potions as well as communion with supernatural spirits. Unlike their pony cousins, zebras tend to live in more arid or tropical climates, but like ponies, they are herbivorous."

    tech_spirit_warriors5:0 "Charger Division V"
    tech_spirit_warriors5_desc:0 "More refined ingredients, better training, improved equipment. As always, there are a number of small things that can be done to add up to a larger whole."
    tech_spirit_warriors6:0 "Charger Division VI"
    tech_spirit_warriors6_desc:0 "Five facets come together as one, and with each component refined to its end, what other end result can there be but the fiercest soldiers Zebrica has ever seen?"
    
    tech_zebra_climate:0 "Under The Zebrican Sun"
    tech_zebra_climate_desc:0 "Zebras are capable of surviving and even thriving in some of the harshest environments in the world. They have adapted to the sweltering heat of Zebrican deserts and the overbearing humidity of Zebrican jungles. As such, anything made by a zebra is capable of functioning even in extreme temperatures."
    tech_zebra_jungle:0 "Jungle Warfare"
    tech_zebra_jungle_desc:0 "Jungles are hot and humid in equal amounts, a place where you can lose yourself in a green inferno. For everyone else, that is. For us, the jungle is home."
    tech_zebra_jungle2:0 "Poisoned Ammunition"
    tech_zebra_jungle2_desc:0 "The dangers of the jungles are our boons. With a little resourcefulness, we can utilize poisons of exotic creatures and plants for our weapons. Others can bleat about the morals of it, for us it is necessary to defend our lands by any means possible."
    tech_zebra_desert:0 "Desert Warfare"
    tech_zebra_desert_desc:0 "Deserts are hot, dry, expanses of nothing but sand. Sand that is coarse, and rough, and irritating, and gets everywhere. But we are already well adapted to these conditions."
    tech_zebra_desert2:0 "Tireless Charge"
    tech_zebra_desert2_desc:0 "A warrior trained on the desert sands, where every step wants to swallow your hooves, will be strong as few on the assault, and an army trained in the sands will have the ability to charge for longer than any others."
    tech_spirit_warrior_instincts:0 "Warrior Instincts"

    tech_spirit_warrior_trickeback:0 "To the Bitter End"
    tech_spirit_warrior_trickeback_desc:0 "The final truth any good soldier should know is that you are only defeated when you accept defeat.

    tech_nigh_vision_potions:0 "Nighteye Potion"
    tech_nigh_vision_potions_desc:0 "It's one of the most classic military tactics to attack during the night. However the mutual lack of vision can make this a risky proposition.

    tech_hp_potions:0 "Healing Potion"
    tech_hp_potions_desc:0 "It was one of the first potions that ancient alchemists tried to brew, and great strides have been made in the field.

    tech_extreme_potion_concentration:0 "Potion of Heroism"
    tech_extreme_potion_concentration_desc:0 "Some of the potions that have been developed are frankly too concentrated for any regular zebra to even try to use.

    tech_zebra_crafting:0 "The Enigma of Steel"
    tech_zebra_crafting_desc:0 "The zebras never had a "bronze age". Rather, they developed ironworking skills independently thousands of years ago, eventually even learning to make carbonized steel.\n"The secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery.

    zebra_pragmatic_production:0 "Prioritising Purpose"
    zebra_pragmatic_production_desc:0 "For what purpose do we forge these weapons? That question must come first, and if we ignore it, we have lost the way. If tradition doesn't provide for this, then it should be discarded."
    zebra_earth_exploitation:0 "No Stone Unturned"
    zebra_earth_exploitation_desc:0 "Even the most barren regions of Zebrica can still provide, as long as one is committed to a philosophy of absolute efficiency, and to never stop looking for more.

    zebra_advanced_steel:0 "Modern Steelmaking Methods"
    zebra_advanced_steel_desc:0 "In far away lands, new and more efficient ways of producing steel have been invented.

    zebra_ritual_crafting:0 "Hoofcrafted Perfection"

    zebra_one_with_nature:0 "New Sources of Inspiration"
    zebra_one_with_nature_desc:0 "Contrary to what the griffon clever-claws might say, being one with nature is not to be simple, or backwards. It is about learning from more than your kin, and to realize that you are part of a greater whole. There are millions of living things out there, and if even one in a thousand can teach us something, that is still thousands of lessons learned. "
    zebra_alchemical_fertilizer:0 "Applied Alchemy"
    zebra_alchemical_fertilizer_desc:0 "Alchemy was never meant to be merely for war. It belongs to all, and so does its gifts. A small healing brew to a sick foal can pay for itself many times over as the foal grows up to become a strong warrior, while alchemical brews can be used to protect crops from blight and accelerate their growth."
    zebra_ancient_steel:0 "An Unequaled Tradition"

    zebra_relicts_of_past:0 "Ending the Charger Cult"
    zebra_relicts_of_past_desc:0 "The cult of the charger has reigned since time immemorial, and the time has come for it to be ended. This obsession with a select warrior elite will weaken us in the long run, and we are better off spending our effort empowering our regular soldiers."
    zebra_steel_rituals:0 "The Cherished Elite"
    zebra_steel_rituals_desc:0 "The Chargers are a select few, that is true, but we do not throw away lives casually, and that is why we ensure that our finest can lead the way. They fight for all of us, and they deserve all we can give."

    zebra_warriors_of_new_age:0 "Zebrica's Finest"
    zebra_warriors_of_new_age_desc:0 "One Zebra can be worth ten enemies, but only if he is forged to become such a warrior. This spearhead elite will be there whenever we need, and they will fight like no other. They are the chargers, and the world trembles under their hooves."
    tech_zebra_war_canoes:0 "War Canoes"
    tech_zebra_war_canoes_desc:0 "Living along the great waterways of Zebrica meant that watercraft were often used to travel long distances and to catch plentiful amounts of fish.

    tech_zebra_war_canoes_sea:0 "Deep Sea Canoes"
    tech_zebra_war_canoes_sea_desc:0 "Those zebras who live near the vast oceans built large ships that could survive even the fiercest storm.

    tech_zebra_war_canoes_sea2:0 "Deep Sea Canoes"
    tech_zebra_war_canoes_sea2_desc:0 "Those zebras who live near the vast oceans built large ships that could survive even the fiercest storm.

 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."
 STL_write_new_stories:0 "Write New Stories"
 STL_write_new_stories_desc:0 "Literature has traditionally been a force of reaction, glorifying princesses and castles rather than ordinary creatures. That ends now. We will instruct our greatest authors to write about the beautiful, equal world we have before us."

 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."

 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal:0 "Allow Voluntary Cutie Mark Removal"
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal_desc:0 "Bizarrely, a few ponies want to have their cutie marks removed again. Mostly social outcasts and misfits, they have petitioned the government for the right to remove them.

 #########EVENTS

 starlight.1.t:0 "Our Cozy Little Meeting"
 starlight.1.d:0 "As noon broke over the idyllic Town, hundreds of stallions and mares flocked to the small, neat building tucked in the middle of the peaceful settlement. Inside, congregating together and out towards the public were five ponies, all with remarkably different appearances and goals. In the center, with a gentle appearance befitting a mail-stallion rather than a mayor, was the soft-spoken Double Diamond. To his left was the red-headed baker known as Sugar Belle, a harmonic socialist mare who blended the two usually-conflicting ideologies together into something she believed would work - something notably more sympathetic to Equestria. To his right was the sharp-haired mare known as Night Glider, the Town's local aviator and collector of used planes who practiced Utopian Socialism - an old form decried by modern communists, but one that would perhaps fit better in the quiet streets of the Town.\n\nOn the far ends were the two representatives most of the Town wasn't particularly fond of, at least when it came to their beliefs. Party Favor, the curly-haired charismatic balloon-maker, stood on the podium dressed in full Stalliongrad garb, shamelessly displaying his ideology. Wrapping around to the other side was finally Feather Bangs, the Town's local celebrity and talk of the town, appearing not nearly as professionally as the rest, but still holding a sort of young stallion's pop flare to them; a capitalist at heart, he was sympathetic enough to the equalist cause to be elected into the council, though his desire to attract Nova Griffonian investment is seldom mentioned, even if he believed it to be a good idea.\n\n"Thank you one and all for attending this meeting." Double Diamond softly spoke, the lull of his voice snapping the attention of the sleepy crowd. "I would like to start by saying that we have gone far ever since Starlight's saddening hypocrisy was revealed, but I am certain that we can go much farther." There was a strong will behind that voice, masked by a pleasant and kind tone. "For the equalist cause, there is nothing we can't all overcome, together!"
 starlight.1.a:0 "The applause was silent; but as one joined another, it was soon enough a chorus."
 starlight.1.b:0 "Ponies shifted awkwardly in their seats, awaiting the saner speakers to continue."


 starlight.2.t:0 "Feather Takes The Spotlight"
 starlight.2.d:0 "Feather Bangs rubbed his hoofs together. This was it. This was the day. This was where the slick city boy would go out and make a splash on the big scene. Well, it wasn't the big scene - he wasn't an actor prancing around in Canterlot, but this was... this was better than that! There was something more to this than just hitting on girls and relying on his melodic voice to swoon the crowd. His crowd wouldn't be gawking teenagers, but worried adults, hoping and hoping they'd listen to something that wasn't the drivel Starlight fed them all those years back. He'd be better than that!\n\nHe looked over the crowd in front of him. The town hall gathered again just for him, and there was a bigger crowd than he anticipated. He could see tired eyes, not particularly interested in his swagger and his modern hairstyle, but the politics he'd bring to the table. A deep breath coursed through his lungs. He could do this. Fake it 'til you make it, he thought; a mantra he had since his high school days.\n\n"What is up, everypony?" He asked, a bright smile on his face as he looked over the crowd. "I know we're all pretty bummed out about what's been going on in our town, and honestly, you're right, it sucks." Keep going, Feather, keep that momentum up. "But it doesn't have to be like that! Have you guys looked out at what the rest of the world is doing while we were busy suckin' up to Starlight and getting our marks removed? They've been gettin' modernized and stuff! Meanwhile, we've been too afraid of pushing past equalism to get with the times." A spike of anxiety. Feather swallowed, hoping no one would notice. "Maybe it sounds crazy, but I want to try what they do. All that capitalism stuff, about bringing in wealth and businesses and letting everyone do the thing they're good at - why not? Is that really so bad?\n\nFeather exhaled, watching the crowd closely and nervously. He expected silence, or even booing, but instead..."
 starlight.2.a:0 "Confused yet intrigued murmurs breached the crowd. Something new, something... good?"

 
 starlight.3.t:0 "A Party In Our Oblast"
 starlight.3.d:0 ""Hi, everyone!" Party Favor began strong. Though many eyed him oddly for wearing an entire Stalliongrad costume, with more than a few rumors that he was taken away and brainwashed by Stalliongrad agents or something as ridiculous as that, it was undeniable that most people liked him quite a lot. He made balloons! What wasn't there to love? Well... whenever he started going off about theory, probably.\n\n"I'm so glad you could all come to my speech today. The elections are coming up soon, and I suppose it's my job to try and convince you to vote for me!" He said, giving a short laugh. "That's just how it is! Now, let's get into the important stuff." He cleared his throat, and pointed a hoof towards the roof of the ceiling.\n\n"Gentlemares and stallions alike, we've got a growing to-be superpower right below our town! And I'll be honest, I think they've got some great ideas we could borrow from them. Do you know how they work? They've got a group of ponies that debate each other but all work together for the collective. Kind of like equalism, but there's enough smart ponies in there to prevent any silly ideas from running about the place!" It seemed like Party Favor had brushed up on his way to interest the crowd in communist theory, because now, they were listening.\n\n"And they're all about catching up to industry and infrastructure! Sure, we might not be nearly as big as they are, but shoot, if we were making progress half as fast as they were, we'd be having pie parties every day, not just every month! I know, I know, it sounds hard to believe, but here's one little nugget of truth I'll leave you with: if we become good friends with Stalliongrad, we'll have a big, nice state protecting us and giving us huge avenues of trade! They might ask for things like Marksian collectivization and a vanguard party, but if it's worked for them, you bet it'll work for us!"
 starlight.3.a:0 "While most didn't really know a thing about Marksian theory, it did sound appealing..."


 starlight.4.t:0 "Double Diamond's Double Time Speech"
 starlight.4.d:0 "Rather than climbing up to a podium and holding a speech in the town hall, Double Diamond had decided to stay true to his principles and instead speak right outside the building, on the steps to it, a symbolic gesture. Everyone knew that he was Starlight's right-hoof mane, but at the same time, he was one of the first to oust her. Yet he still held a firm belief in equalism, and there was a sort of undeniable zealous passion whenever he spoke about it, if not a little on the disturbingly energetic side.\n\n"Friends of Our Town," Double Diamond began, head held high and confident, "I urge all of you to look at how tragically little we've done in the years that have passed since Starlight left. We were all afraid of equalism, and what bad things it could do to us. But Starlight's Equalism was a far cry from what it can be! Equality isn't about removing our cutie marks, and removing who we are. It's about making sure we're all working towards a better future. It's about no one being left behind, and no pony having the ability to exploit another!" Double Diamond was firm in his words, and though some ponies still held suspicion that this would simply be a repeat, many more knew Double Diamond was honest - unlike Starlight. He truly believed in the cause.\n\n"So I ask you, personally, not as some sort of ruler, figurehead, or party leader, but as a friend to another friend." Double Diamond smiled at the quiet crowd. "Give equalism another chance. There was a silver lining in some of the things Starlight said, even if it was ultimately a charade. I truly, honestly think that seeing it realized - the real equalism - will give everypony a chance to be happy and healthy!""
 starlight.4.a:0 "You can't doubt his honesty, at least."

 double_diamond.3.t:0 "It Takes a Village"
 double_diamond.3.d:0 "The crèche system seems to be effective, as children are able to bond more fully when they are grouped together in communal rearing. However, it remains to be seen how sustainable it is long-term, as we've only tested it for four months. Some voices, Night Glider chief among them, caution that as family is one of the most important things in life, mandating integration into the crèches would cause strife and anger towards the government. How far shall we go to bring about our bold new vision of family life?"

 double_diamond.4.t:0 "Free Range Kids"
 double_diamond.4.d:0 "While children are commonly seen as irresponsible and unreliable, the truth of the matter is there are many children who are more mature than adults. Therefore, the slavery of children to their parents will be abolished. The only question remaining is how extreme we should be in the childrens' liberation.

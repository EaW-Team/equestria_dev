His expertise in motorized formations has been utterly worthless here, but his skill at supply acquisition has proven quite useful in the remote mountains. While an Equestrian Socialist, he's more sympathetic to the allure of Equalism than most."

 POLITICS_FEATHERBANGS:0 "A local heartthrob, Feather Bangs lost his love interest to a Ponyville stallion. Quick to move on, Feather Bangs has come to realize that capitalism is necessary for the conditions to create equalism."
 POLITICS_DOUBLEDIAMOND:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of April, 976 in Village Up North.\n\n§YBiography§!: An Equestrian idealist and dreamer, Double Diamond has devoted his life to the liberation of creaturekind. While not involved in the Winter Revolution, he was firmly in support, and when Starlight began gathering her followers, he was her first convert--and later, her chief enforcer.\n\nAfter she was exposed as a fraud, his faith in the ideology was shattered, like all of his peers. But unlike his peers, he gradually regained it. Starlight was a tyrant, yes, but her ideology wasn't inherently bad. After all, the quest for true equality was always a desire of the left, wasn't it? Why stop at just economic equality when societal equality could be achieved? Caramel Marks spoke of the creature-being who would be simultaneously perfectly selfish and perfectly selfless. Glimmer's attempt at creating an equal society was a bold step towards this, even though it was misguided.\n\nHis views are hardly popular in Our Town, and his mayorship has been rocky. Only a coalition government with the Our Town Communist Party and the Society for Equality of All Creatures was able to form a majority in the town council. But despite it all, he has never given up on his dream of a truly free society. With his term coming to a close, no one is quite sure how things will turn out now, or who will take the mayorship's next term...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"
 POLITICS_DOUBLEDIAMOND_2:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of April, 976 in Village Up North.\n\n§YBiography§!: Somehow, against all odds, Double Diamond has held onto power, even making gains in the council. Those who called him a madpony are now stuck looking rather foolish themselves.\n\nWith free reign to implement his fanatical vision, Our Town is in for strange times indeed. His once-tepid, gentle rhetoric has given way to a hawkishness few would recognize. Starlight herself might be surprised to see him so eagerly advocating war to expand the revolution. While his opposition to methods such as cutie mark removal are well-known, many ponies are confused what Equalism even means without it. How does it differ from other forms of socialism anyway?\n\nDouble Diamond has no doubts. He has lived a life in accordance with the principles of Equalism. He will go farther than any of the red bureaucrats of Stalliongrad could ever imagine. The future beckoning is brighter than those fools can imagine. "The communism of the dirt", as he has taken to calling Stalliongrad's system? Primitive, limited, sterile, doomed.\n\nDouble Diamond's neo-Equalism will complete the entire paradigm of socialism, taking the best from every strain--from anarchism to Marksism-Stallionism. Ready your feeble defenses, hierarchists. Weep for the loss of your tyranny. For the final revolution is upon all--the end of history itself.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

 POLITICS_NIGHTGLIDER:0 "Hobbyist pilot and dreamer Night Glider seeks to achieve the vision of Starlight Glimmer without her crude methods. Equality is about lifting up, not bringing down."
 POLITICS_PARTYFAVOR:0 "A balloon-maker and devout Marksist-Stallionist, Party Favor will follow the winds of Stalliongrad no matter how they blow."
 POLITICS_SUGARBELLE:0 "Sugar Belle's boyfriend Big Macintosh, brother of the Element of Honesty, introduced her to Equestrian harmony. This left a profound mark on her, even as she came to see the good in leftism as well. She has syntheszed these ideas into her personal form of harmonic socialism."
 POLITICS_BURLAP:0 "A tailor by trade, and a very ordinary pony, Burlap never had any interest in politics. But Double Diamond's failures led to his removal, and it was decided a perfectly ordinary pony would be perfect to administrate Our Town in these difficult times. Surely history will vindicate this choice."
 POLITICS_TROCHANTER:0 "One of the most skilled cryptographers of VOPS, Trochanter plans to turn the communist statelet of Our Town into one big intelligence agency. Everyone will be monitored. Everything will be recorded. Inefficiency and treachery will be completely eradicated. And all resources will be put forward to the security and preservation of the Hegemony as a whole."

 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering_desc:0 "The §Pequal future§! awaiting us must be crafted carefully. Pushing too fast may cause §Rchaos§!, while going too slow may lead to §Rdoubt§! in the effectiveness of our leadership. We must be bold yet cautious."
 STL_true_friendship_countdown:0 "The True Friendship Experiment"
 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."
 STL_write_new_stories:0 "Write New Stories"
 STL_write_new_stories_desc:0 "Literature has traditionally been a force of reaction, glorifying princesses and castles rather than ordinary creatures. That ends now. We will instruct our greatest authors to write about the beautiful, equal world we have before us."
 STL_reorganize_the_family:0 "Families for the Future"
 STL_reorganize_the_family_desc:0 "For too long, families have been organized around a hierarchical, unequal system. Some had many children, others none. As Caramel Marks laid out in her manifesto, communal child-rearing is the future."
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones:0 "The Union of Equal Little Ones"
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones_desc:0 "Similar to the Junior Pioneers in Stalliongrad, we will form our own group for children. The Union of Equal Little Ones will blossom into a beautiful organization where children learn about the better world waiting for us all."
 STL_abolish_racist_language:0 "Synthesize a New Language"
 STL_abolish_racist_language_desc:0 "Unfortunately, racism still exists, because the ideas composing racism still exist. As a first step to eliminating racism forever, we will create a new language, in which it is impossible to even think racist thoughts."
 STL_new_military_division_design:0 "The Universal Army Unit"
 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."
 STL_horizontal_factory_life:0 "Establish a Horizontal Factory Structure"
 STL_horizontal_factory_life_desc:0 "Even in Stalliongrad, bosses still exist. This is an affront to equality at its most fundamental. We will replace these red plutocrats with a far better organizational structure."
 STL_the_song_of_liberation:0 "Codify Absolute Rights"
 STL_the_song_of_liberation_desc:0 "Being equal also means having the same rights. Starlight made a grievious error wtih her reeducation centers. We will never repeat that mistake. All creatures are created equal, and all creatures have inalienable rights."
 STL_glorious_future:0 "The Wondrous Future"
 STL_glorious_future_desc:0 "We are not a great power like Equestria, but we have begun a beautiful project here, and we will take it all the way. Nothing will stop our advance towards the light in the sky.\n\nOh wondrous future, please do not be cruel to us!"

 STL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare a Stage of Siege"

 STL_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "With our more capitalistic leanings now apparent, we can finally start to end our pariah status and invite foreign investments here. They will naturally be apprehensive at first, but the resources here are lucrative and eager to be exploited!"

 STL_equalist_power_balance_decisions:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward:0 "Revise Quotas Downward"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward_desc:0 "Our quotas may be too high. Not everyone is able to meet them. In the interest of fairness and morale, it might be best to adjust them downward."
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia:0 "Stoke Glimmerite Nostalgia"
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia_desc:0 "Strangely, some ponies miss the Starlight Glimmer days. While a return to that era is not at all what we want, it could still prove advantageous to pander to them to a degree."
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal:0 "Allow Voluntary Cutie Mark Removal"
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal_desc:0 "Bizarrely, a few ponies want to have their cutie marks removed again. Mostly social outcasts and misfits, they have petitioned the government for the right to remove them. They are apparently completely sincere, citing the secure feeling of conformity and meaning when branded with an equal sign."
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery:0 "Create Heavy Fortified Artillery"
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery_desc:0 "Our mountain home must be compmletely unassailable from any kind of attack. To that end, it is time to construct heavily fortified large-calibre guns capable of bombarding the enemy from afar."
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle:0 "Nothing But the Rifle"
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle_desc:0 "A minority faction within our army believes that things like "artillery", "engineers", and other modern conveniences are totally unnecessary. According to their doctrine, infantry can overcome any obstacle with sufficient will and drive."

 STL_ng_interventions:0 "Intervene in Conflicts"
 STL_ng_interventions_desc:0 "As wars break out against across Equus, we cannot sit by as the forces of reaction and tyranny consolidate themselves. We must step up and help out our brothers and sisters in harmony and socialism! Sending lend-lease and volunteers is a worthy step, but if things get dire, we may have to intervene directly..."
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans:0 "Help the Nova Griffonian Republicans!"
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans_desc:0 "The situation in Nova Griffonia has reached a breaking point. Just offering guns and volunteers to the republicans isn't enough. We must intervene directly! This goes beyond politics, it is a moral obligation to stop Highhill's brutality!"
 STL_YAK_assist:0 "Help the Yaks"
 STL_YAK_assist_desc:0 "The Yaks represent the forces of modernity, harmony and socialism, while their secessionist counterparts in the Jaki-Clan are the worst elements of old power hierarchies. We must step up."
 STL_CRY_assist:0 "Stop Sombra!"
 STL_CRY_assist_desc:0 "The horrors of Sombra's rule are the stuff of old legends come to life. We must put an end to this brutal repression!"
 STL_PLB_assist:0 "Help the Bears!"
 STL_PLB_assist_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the Polar Bears now have adopted our belief system, or at least something rather close to it. We are obliged to help them now!"

 STL_our_future_uncertain:0 "Our Future Uncertain"
 STL_our_future_uncertain_desc:0 "The five most important figures in our politics - Double Diamond, Party Favor, Night Glider, Sugar Belle, and Feather Bangs - cannot see eye to eye. Every town meeting leads to an argument, and nothing is getting done. Hopefully the January meeting will be more fruitful."

 STL_ally_griffons:0 "Closer to the Griffons"
 STL_ally_griffons_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia may be the weakest of the powers that surround us, but it brings several unique advantages to the table. Its thriving port cities provide access to the global market, and it has a large and growing communist movement led by Heinrich Redtail. Putting out feelers to Weter may be in our best interest."

 STL_ally_stg:0 "Closer to Stalliongrad"
 STL_ally_stg_desc:0 "Since Our Town was founded, Stalliongrad has always been our closest friend. The Revolution in Severyana was an inspiration to many leftist movements, including equalism, and their tacit support has allowed us to thrive in the mountains beyond Sovyenok. We should strengthen our ties with the home of the revolution by officializing our relationship."

 STL_ally_eqs:0 "Closer to Equestria"
 STL_ally_eqs_desc:0 "If it were not for Princess Twilight and her friends our ponies would still be suffering under Starlight's tyranny, robbed of their individuality. Equestria has shown us the way once, it can do so again. We should be looking towards Canterlot and the Crystal City for assistance. Despite our differences, we all share the values of freedom and progress."

 STL_feather_bangs_leads:0 "The Reaction of Feather Bangs"
 STL_feather_bangs_leads_desc:0 "Feather Bangs is a singer, popular among young ponies for both his talent and his looks. He is the most inexperienced member of our governing coalition and he wants to bring back capitalism, which many consider a betrayal of our core principles. Yet somehow, in spite of it all, he is finding crowds that want to hear about his politics as well as his music."

 STL_party_favor_leads:0 "The Orthodoxy of Party Favor"
 STL_party_favor_leads_desc:0 "Party Favor is a balloon maker and a fixture at parties throughout Our Town. He is also a Marksist-Stallionist and has come to represent Stalliongrad's influence on our politics. Our people tend to be a bit wary of the communists to our south, but Party Favor's charisma is starting to win them over. Taking some cues from Marksist theory is starting to sound pretty good."

 STL_double_diamond_leads:0 "The Neo-Equalism of Double Diamond"
 STL_double_diamond_leads_desc:0 "Double Diamond, our current mayor, is a true believer in equalism. After Starlight left he spent time rethinking her philosophy, refining it into something he calls "neo-equalism." This eclectic and unorthodox ideology didn't gain much traction at first, but now things are changing. Everyday more ponies find themselves listening to him, taking his ideas seriously for the first time."

 STL_night_glider_leads:0 "The Utopianism of Night Glider"
 STL_night_glider_leads_desc:0 "Night Glider has a knack for flying, both with her wings and in a stunt plane. Her daring air shows have made her a celebrity throughout Our Town and beyond. In politics she's come to represent an ambitious new idea she calls "equality without equalism." While some say she's got her head in the clouds, many others believe in the promise of a society that's truly free and equal."

 STL_sugar_belle_leads:0 "The Harmony of Sugar Belle"
 STL_sugar_belle_leads_desc:0 "Sugar Belle is a baker with close ties to Equestria. She's spent a lot of time away on extended trips to Ponyville, but no one doubts her commitment to Our Town and its ponies. Her message of embracing harmony and the Equestrian idea of friendship is picking up steam, attracting more followers by the day."

 STL_one_leader:0 "One Leader"
 STL_one_leader_desc:0 "The collapse of our governing coalition clearly demonstrates the problems with collective decision making. The only way to ensure a functional government is to choose one leader and entrust them with supreme authority. Some call this a return to tyranny, but surely a comrade in good standing will listen to the people."

 STL_centralized_state:0 "A Centralized State"
 STL_centralized_state_desc:0 "We respect the wishes of our people, but we cannot allow small disagreements to paralyze the government. Local leaders will have a few limited powers, while a central committee shall have the final say on all policy matters. Devolving authority any further would invite factionalism and inequality into our midst."

 STL_confederalist_state:0 "A Confederalist State"
 STL_confederalist_state_desc:0 "With our leaders divided on whether to devolve or centralize power, a compromise might provide the solution. The central government will have authority over all smaller localities, but a plurality of local leaders will be able to override its dictates. This confederal system will ensure all voices are heard without creating administrative chaos."

 STL_equestrian_model:0 "The Equestrian Model"
 STL_equestrian_model_desc:0 "In Equestria, local governments have a great deal of power, and their structure changes based on the desires of their subjects. This model, which has stood for centuries, should serve as our inspiration. All important powers shall be vested in small communities, who will be able to choose their own mode of government."

 STL_equal_footing:0 "An Equal Ally"
 STL_equal_footing_desc:0 "Our Town might not be the most conventional nation in the world, but it is a nation nonetheless. Any country unwilling to treat with us on an equal basis isn't a worthy ally. We will ask our chosen partner to grant us full diplomatic recognition and a mutual defense agreement."

 STL_powerful_friend:0 "A Powerful Protector"
 STL_powerful_friend_desc:0 "The world is becoming a dangerous place. If Our Town is to survive, it will need the protection of an established power with a strong economy and a large army. We must request a guarantee of independence from our chosen partner, before it's too late."

 STL_accept_our_reality:0 "Accept Our Reality"
 STL_accept_our_reality_desc:0 "In the game of diplomacy you can't get something for nothing. Small nations must always submit to their larger neighbors or risk being swallowed whole. We should offer our resources to our chosen partner in exchange for protection. It is a small price to pay to ensure our survival."

 STL_our_future_secured:0 "Our Future Secured"
 STL_our_future_secured_desc:0 "The most pressing issues have been settled. At the same time, the candidates are making their closing arguments and wrapping up their campaigns. Change is in the air, and our people are excited by the hope for a better future. All that remains is the election of our new leader."

 STL_our_own_military:0 "Our Own Military"
 STL_our_own_military_desc:0 "With our political course laid in, we can finally get to work reforming our outdated, primitive military. One division is not enough for our needs, so we will expand our forces!"

 STL_night_gliders_experiment:0 "Night Glider's Experiment"
 STL_night_gliders_experiment_desc:0 "Being by far the most interested in aviation of any of our politicians, Night Glider is committed to the creation of a true air force for [STL.GetName]. In particular, she is quite fond of the idea of close air support--planes full of bombs to rain death upon enemy troops and logistics."
 
 STL_the_horizontal_lines:0 "The Horizontal Lines"
 STL_the_horizontal_lines_desc:0 "We are not a large nation, and thus must make the most of the space we have. The time has come to develop a heavy fighter, one capable of reaching far and shooting down enemy bombers. We will pour the air budget into something beyond cutting-edge: a Horizontal Lines super-fighter!"

 STL_strike_the_hives:0 "Strike the Hives"
 STL_strike_the_hives_desc:0 "With our newly-developed heavy fighters, we are in a position to conduct a daring raid deep inside enemy territory. A strategic bomber will prove to the world that we are not to be trifled with."

 STL_air_superiority_fighters:0 "Air Superiority Fighters"
 STL_air_superiority_fighters_desc:0 "Night Glider loves to fly, and is quite attached to her old I-15. But the fact is that it is showing its age. Perhaps it's time to focus less on grand projects like strategic bombers, and more on the humble light fighter."
 
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army:0 "The Centerpiece of the Army"
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army lives and breathes at the lowest level. No army can succeed without a motivated private. We will establish bottom-upp lanning committees to funnel information and ideas up the ranks efficiently."

 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation:0 "The Rifle of Our Nation"
 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation_desc:0 "In Our Town, the infantrycreature is the bedrock of the army. We need new recruits to hold guns, and new guns for them to hold! Scrounging up every last gun we can find and increasing public investment in volunteer programs should find us some suitable eager warriors."

 STL_stableins_gambit:0 "Stablein's Gambit"
 STL_stableins_gambit_desc:0 "Did you know we have an admiral? It's true! His name is Valery Stablein and he has a long history of... sitting in his river gunboat and yelling across the border to Stalliongrad about how they're a degenerated workers' state? Anyway, he wants to build a navy, starting with some submarines. Why not let him have a go?"

 STL_freedom_convoys:0 "Convoy Guardians"
 STL_freedom_convoys_desc:0 "It turns out submarines get killed pretty easily by depth charges. We're gonna try and build some destroyers to protect our troops when they're on a naval invasion."

 STL_workhorse_of_fleet:0 "Workhorse of the Fleet"
 STL_workhorse_of_fleet_desc:0 "So destroyers can be killed pretty easily by light cruisers. But this time we've got a trick up our sleeve: we found out what kills light cruisers, and it's called a heavy cruiser! So we'll start researching them both so we aren't caught off guard again."

 STL_big_ships:0 "Big Ships"
 STL_big_ships_desc:0 "Okay, you know what? We're sick of this. Our ships keep getting sunk. We're gonna build the biggest ship ever, with the biggest guns ever, and nothing will sink it! It will be able to hit targets dozens of miles inland.\n\n\nWait, what is a carrier?"

 STL_training_and_logistics:0 "Training and Logistics"
 STL_training_and_logistics_desc:0 "It turns out that a lot of our troops are confused, hungry, or just plain inexperienced. If we are ever going to have a proper army, we'll need to know how to feed them and get them bullets. Quartermasters will be established to handle requisitions."

 STL_new_weaponry:0 "New Weaponry"
 STL_new_weaponry_desc:0 "As we've been focusing on getting our troops bullets and food, we've forgotten about modernizing their equipment. We need to step it up and make sure that the loyal daughters and sons of [STL.GetName] aren't going into battle with muskets."

 STL_increase_discipline:0 "Increase Discipline"
 STL_increase_discipline_desc:0 "While egalitarianism and democracy are core values of our great land, some soldiers have been taking advantage of us to live as more-or-less freeloaders. In two cases ponies even turned bandit! We need to train them right, and instill in them a sense that it is they who are the last guardian of their families and their way of life."

 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all:0 "The Red Army Stands Over All" 
 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all_desc:0 "We have done it. With a modern army, navy, and air force, we are no longer just a mountain commune. We are a mighty force for the reactionaries to reckon with!"

 ### ECONOMY
 STL_a_new_millenium:0 "Our Position in a New Millennium"
 STL_a_new_millenium_desc:0 "As history has advanced, Our Town has not. If we are ever to be anything more than a backwater mountain, we must step boldly into the 1000s!"

 STL_industrial_sector:0 "Our Primitive Manufacturing"
 STL_industrial_sector_desc:0 "We stand little chance of competing on the great stage of Equus if we can barely put an assembly line together. The time has come to organize the disjointed communes and villages into a united nation!"

 STL_electronics_sector:0 "Our Lacking Telecommunications"
 STL_electronics_sector_desc:0 "There is barely a single radio tower in [STL.GetName], and it takes days for news to travel one end of the mountains to the other. Were we to be invaded, it's dubious if everyone would even be aware of the situation before the enemy stormed in. But soon there will be a radio in every home!"
 
 STL_heavy_industry:0 "Our Cottage Industry"
 STL_heavy_industry_desc:0 "We cannot fight without weapons, and we are currently severely lacking in them. A new factory will be created set into Golden Mountain, hopefully secure from attack."
 
 STL_bunker_down:0 "Our Need for Fortifications"
 STL_bunker_down_desc:0 "It's unlikely we will continue to enjoy the neutral and peaceful position we have for over a decade. We must prepare for the worst. As a counter-invasion is virtually unthinkable, our best option is probably to bunker down so hard it's not worthwhile fighting us."
 
 STL_new_research_methods:0 "New Research Methods"
 STL_new_research_methods_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer's dictatorship severely hampered our academic capabilities. The time has come to let a hundred schools of thought bloom and see what valuable ideas can be gleaned from them all."

 STL_closed_no_longer:0 "Closed No Longer"
 STL_closed_no_longer_desc:0 "With our newfound territorial acquisitions, we are finally able to leave behind our status as a pariah city-state. Trade shall flow through our villages once more!"
 
 STL_more_factories:0 "Increase Industrial Output"
 STL_more_factories_desc:0 "We must expand our industrial capacity! In both light and heavy industry, we lag far behind our neighbors. They will not take us seriously until we have some proper factories!\n\nOkay, they probably won't take us seriously then either."
 
 STL_acquire_rubber:0 "Acquire Rubber"
 STL_acquire_rubber_desc:0 "Rubber is useful for many things, from Night Glider's planes to Feather Bangs' motorized warfare. We need it, badly. Therefore we will found our first synthetic refinery right here in [STL.GetName]!"

 STL_rich_city:0 "Our City"
 STL_rich_city_desc:0 "From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, creatures are rejoicing as industry spreads throughout our little community. But now we face the curious problem of how to defend it all from hungry eyes..."
 
 STL_fortress_city:0 "Our Bunkers"
 STL_fortress_city_desc:0 "We must increase defensive preparations. Only through extreme fortification can we survive the days to come. Anti-air batteries will be constructed to defend our infantry and factories from the skies, and bunkers will be built to protect them at the frontline."

 STL_science_of_future:0 "Our Futuristic Science"
 STL_science_of_future_desc:0 "We must amplify our scientific goals. Through extensive allocation of resources to the hard sciences, we will soon be a center of learning! How does "Starlight University" sound?"
 ### FEATHER BANGS

 STL_feather_bangs_wins:0 "Feather Bangs Wins!"
 STL_feather_bangs_wins_desc:0 "Somehow, the musician and heartthrob Feather Bangs has been chosen for the mayorship. With no real political experience, this should be interesting..."

 ### PARTY FAVOR

 STL_party_favor_wins:0 "Party Favor Wins!"
 STL_party_favor_wins_desc:0 "The Severyanian-backed candidate, Party Favor, has won the elections. He will likely align us closer with Stalliongrad, and his challenge will be to preserve our existence while doing so."

 ### DOUBLE DIAMOND

 STL_double_diamond_wins:0 "Double Diamond Wins!"
 STL_double_diamond_wins_desc:0 "Against all odds, the previous mayor Double Diamond has been reelected. Widely considered the longest shot, it seems the old has won out. No one is quite sure what he plans to do now."
 STL_denounce_old_excesses:0 "Denounce Old Excesses"
 STL_denounce_old_excesses_desc:0 "Starlight went way too far, and we have no intention of restoring her extreme measures. There will be no 'people's courts', no reeducation houses, no cutie unmarking. We are better than that. We have to be."
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering:0 "Benevolent Social Engineering"
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering_desc:0 "Social engineering is a loaded, dirty word, but it is nonetheless what we seek to accomplish. We will be the engineers of creature souls, going farther than any left-wing movement before. But we can only do this with the people's consent."
 STL_promise_a_future:0 "Promise a Brighter Future"
 STL_promise_a_future_desc:0 "A bright future awaits us, full of joy and hope, but it is not going to appear on its own. We have to create it, together."
 STL_different_yet_equal:0 "Different Yet Equal"
 STL_different_yet_equal_desc:0 "Everycreature's vote is worth the same, everycreature's life is as important, and everycreature's ability to contribute to our community is as significant. But we're different too. That doesn't make us better or worse, just different. We are equal despite our differences."
 STL_appoint_new_ministers:0 "Reshuffle the Cabinet"
 STL_appoint_new_ministers_desc:0 "Whlie Double Diamond has great respect for his friends, they simply can't do everything at once. With the recent electoral victory, we can finally open up cabinet spots for others who might wish to serve our great Town."
 STL_the_turning_point:0 "The Turning Point"
 STL_the_turning_point_desc:0 "Society has been heavily equalized, and we are ready for our next step. It is time to reveal our true intentions. Double Diamond didn't just win the election for himself, or even for Our Town. He won for Stalliongrad, for Equestria, for Equus, and ultimately for the world. The cause of international equalism must not falter!"
 STL_gearing_up_for_a_vision:0 "Gearing Up for a Vision"
 STL_gearing_up_for_a_vision_desc:0 "Our Town has accompllished in months what Stalliongrad continues to fail to do after over a decade. Bloated with bureaucracy and incompetence and infighting, the Stalliongradians desperately need our help. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_equal_volunteers:0 "Equal Volunteers"
 STL_equal_volunteers_desc:0 "Creatures are joining our cause. The hollow platitudes and incompetence of our foes are driving them to us. We will fight on, not just for them, but for all of us. No matter how absurd the odds seem or how grim things may look, we will win. For an equal world!"
 STL_accelerate_revolutionary_changes:0 "Accelerate Revolutionary Changes"
 STL_accelerate_revolutionary_changes_desc:0 "We must go faster in our implementation of a better world. History does not wait for utopia, and neither can we! We will engineer ourselves into the greatest and freest civilization in the world, together!"
 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad:0 "An Equalist in Stalliongrad"
 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Somehow, Double Diamond pulled it off. Among his cabinet he was widely considered a total lunatic, but he's proven them all wrong. The great equals sign now from Our Town to Stalliongrad to Ourhoof. We have won the war, and now we have to win the peace."
 STL_meet_with_the_left:0 "Meet with the Left"
 STL_meet_with_the_left_desc:0 "The Left of Stalliongrad has been... difficult to work with, but their ultimate goal - immediate revolution to the fullest extent - is something Double Diamond is very sympathetic too. After all, didn't we invade Stalliongrad to save the revolution in its home?"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture:0 "A New Proletarian Culture"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture_desc:0 "'Culture' thus far has been largely bourgeois culture, even in Stalliongrad. Bourgeois liberal nationalism has no place in our new society, and culture must adapt. We will create a culture like none seen before, a true Proletarian Culture!"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions:0 "Accept Cultural Pluralism"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions_desc:0 "While it may not be optimal, the fact is our position is quite tenuous. Immediately forcing everyone to change their culture is extremely optimistic, even for us, and might endanger the revolution as a whole. We can deal with this matter more later."
 STL_our_sacred_war:0 "Our Sacred War"
 STL_our_sacred_war_desc:0 "Seizing Stalliongrad from the city-state of Our Town was a mighty accomplishment, but it will pale in comparison to our future goals. Those future goals will require countless soldiers, sailors, and aviators. While conscription is an ugly thing for a radically liberatory movement, leaving our siblings in chains is even uglier. We will not let them die in slavery!"
 STL_meet_with_the_center:0 "Meet with the Center"
 STL_meet_with_the_center_desc:0 "The Center in Stalliongrad is perhaps the one factino we have the least in common with. Nonetheless, they are similarly committed to democracy and revolution, and they have a large popular backing. With some reassurances that this revolution will maintain collectivization in Stalliongrad, they should be happy to work with us."
 STL_equalize_factory_work:0 "Equalize Factory Work"
 STL_equalize_factory_work_desc:0 "Under Equestrian Socialism, some factories stood above others in importance. This cannot be allowed to continue. The creature crafting a toaster is just as important as the one crafting a tank."
 STL_establish_direct_democracy:0 "Establish Direct Democracy"
 STL_establish_direct_democracy_desc:0 "The greatest error of the Equestrian Socialists is the belief that democratic centralism is democratic enough. Direct democracy must be enshrined as the basis of all politics. While we are not anarchists and do not believe in the abolition of representation entirely, referendums should be the basis of policy. Furthermore, the concept of recalling politicians must be restored to its rightful place. How did the Marksist-Stallionists forget this when it was right in both Marks and Stallion all along?"
 STL_tour_the_nation:0 "Tour the Nation"
 STL_tour_the_nation_desc:0 "Unfortunately, discontent and concern is still high in the Severyanian countryside since the collapse of the Stalliongradian establishment regime. Ponies are afraid we've come to decollectivize, or worse, to take away their cutie marks. The time has come for Double Diamond to go on a tour across the country, to answer questions and quell fears."
 STL_new_equal_friends:0 "New Equal Friends"
 STL_new_equal_friends_desc:0 "To limit ourselves to the borders of Equestria, or even to ponykind, is patently absurd. Equality transcends nation and culture. Why wouldn't it transcend species too? We are in a position to share our beautiful future with all the peoples of Equus. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship:0 "End of the Mayorship"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship_desc:0 "The institution of Mayor was appropriate for the city-state of Our Town, but now we are running a nation-state. The time has come for the office to be abolished, and replaced with a more suitable head of state. Premier will work for the state office, and for the Stalliongradian Equalist Party, General Secretary."
 STL_our_nuclear_program:0 "Our Nuclear Program"
 STL_our_nuclear_program_desc:0 "What would have seemed comical several years ago is now manifest reality. Nuclear power will let us break the shackles of global capitalism and hierarchy. But will it be cheap power to undermine their plutocratic empires, or will it be the atomic hammer to smash their armies? Only time will tell."
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold:0 "Bring the Yaks into the Fold"
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The yaks have known war and strife, with xenophobia and isolationism driving a wedge into their harmonic monarchy. Unfortunately, the local communists are no better than the isolationists or warlords! We march into Yakyakistan to free all yaks from their chains, no matter what color the chain-forgers may wear!"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse:0 "Unitary but Diverse"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse_desc:0 "Even as we reject federalization and local autonomy, we acknowledge that we are a vastly diverse revolution. Eradicating racism, nationalism, and other blights that divide the workers will take time, but we have the unstoppable force of will on our side!"
 STL_meet_with_the_right:0 "Meet with the Right"
 STL_meet_with_the_right_desc:0 "The Right Opposition's domestic values are superficially similar to ours, believing in multiparty democracy along with increased power to the people and away from the bureaucrats. Unfortunately, their foreign policy is hopelessly timid. Still, there's enough here to find common ground on. Perhaps we can all get along after all?"
 STL_invade_nova:0 "Invade Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invade_nova_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia has seen great strife, and sadly we must add to that strife. The people of Nova Griffonia are crying out for aid, and it falls to us to save them from their tyrants in their houses of gold."
 STL_invite_nova:0 "Invite Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invite_nova_desc:0 "While Redtail is hardly a paragon of Equalist values, he is probably close enough. With Stalliongrad now under our control, perhaps he will be willing to be accommodating? Stallion's right-hoof griffon could be a great ally..."
 STL_strike_the_penguins:0 "At the Top of the World"
 STL_strike_the_penguins_desc:0 "The penguins live in a distant land, but even it is not outside of our reach. If we are to achieve our dream, they will have to work with us, one way or another."
 STL_the_speech:0 "The Speech"
 STL_the_speech_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Our proud flag flies high over a sizable chunk of the continent. And now, storm clouds are rising in the East. If we are to finish our sacred revolutionary mission, we will have to decide what to do about Equestria and the Changeling Lands. While Equestria would no doubt balk at working with us, war does make strange bedfellows. Of course, we could try to fight them both..."
 STL_the_new_living_organism:0 "The New Living Superorganism"
 STL_the_new_living_organism_desc:0 "Every creature in our society is part of something greater than themselves. A superorganism is forming, forming out of all of us. Meditation and group activity will bind us together even tighter."
 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments:0 "Begin the Friendship Project"
 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments_desc:0 "We are doing something today that's never been done before. Something even a great revolutionary like Steel Stallion was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like we do. The lessons we've learned here in Our Town have taught us well. We have proven that we're ready."
 STL_design_a_new_religion:0 "Design a New Religion"
 STL_design_a_new_religion_desc:0 "The Marksist rejection of faith entirely, while understandable, loses a valuable unifying element. Faith can be a powerful motivator. The problem is that faith, thus far, has been a tool of capital and of other hierarchy. Therefore, we will create a new equal faith, passionate and liberatory, to underly our vision of a free future."
 STL_glorify_labor:0 "Glorify Labor"
 STL_glorify_labor_desc:0 "Under capitalism, labor is exploited, and so many workers think work is bad. Nothing could be further from the truth! In labor is found glory. The work of crafting, this is a mighty, noble task! Under Equestrian Socialism, labor is less exploited, but still is not the worker's own. Anarchism, social democracy, syndicalism--none of these can truly free the worker! But under the great equals sign, all become one!"
 STL_agrarian_kindness:0 "Agrarian Kindness"
 STL_agrarian_kindness_desc:0 "We are not fanatical industrialists, who see the world only as a list of resources to be exploited. The pastoral, agrarian life is one as noble as that of the factory worker. The Marksists prioritized the industrial proletariat at the expense of the peasantry. We will roll out modern agricultural equipment across all farming regions of our nation, through Machine Tractor Stations!"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability:0 "From Each According to their Ability"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability_desc:0 "The army is seldom an ally of revolution, being full of nationalists and warmongers. After all, when we prevail, there will be no more war, and they will all be out of a job! But under the right circumstances, equalists and soldiers can march side by side. And the great Red Army of Stalliongrad is a perfect example of that cooperation. We will learn from them."
 STL_a_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
 STL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of Our Town was suitable for a city-state, but not a nation-state. But the basic ideas - multiparty democracy where any leftist can compete, centring the councils over the legislature, and recalling all state and party officials at any time - will persevere. People in our revolution are the basis of all politics, and that will never change."
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life:0 "Guarantee a Good Life"
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life_desc:0 "Life under capitalism is miserable, as we all know. Under Equestrian Socialism it is far better, but still not good enough. The most important aspect of Equalist doctrine is the welfare of the people, which must always take primacy over other goals. However, we must be careful not to turn into an isolationist enclave--the peoples of other lands need to be liberated too!"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year:0 "Elections Thrice a Year"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year_desc:0 "Aside from the ability to recall officials, the term of office must be short to prevent conservatism. 120-day terms are suitably short."
 STL_the_new_coalition:0 "The New Coalition"
 STL_the_new_coalition_desc:0 "Thus far, Double Diamond's party has not ruled alone. Party Favor's Our Town Communist Party and Night Glider's Society for Equality of All Creatures have been our junior partners. While we will not turn our back on these old friends, the Severyanian Communist Party and the newly-formed Socialist Revolutionaries of Equus are eager to work with us as well. Why shouldn't we cooperate?"
 STL_truly_fair_voting:0 "Truly Fair Voting"
 STL_truly_fair_voting_desc:0 "Simply putting a voting booth in every town and commune is not good enough. Election Day will be a national holiday and internal administrative divisions will be redrawn to be more representative. This will upset some conservative voices, but we must let everyone's vote count the same."
 STL_with_justice_for_all:0 "With Justice for All"
 STL_with_justice_for_all_desc:0 "#TODO: something cool about rehabilitating prisoners"
 STL_save_equestria:0 "Save Equestria"
 STL_save_equestria_desc:0 "We may not see eye to eye on everything, but the Equestrians are still vastly better than Chrysalis. Allying with them is not only the right thing to do, it is necessary for the survival of the revolution at all."
 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs:0 "Chrysalis in our Crosshairs"
 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs_desc:0 "We have no quarrel with the changeling people, and we weep for every life we must take. But Chrysalis is a mad conqueror devoted to the destruction of everything other than her own insane ambition. We will not let this tyrant continue to oppress Equus!"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation:0 "Salvage our International Reputation"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation_desc:0 "Our invasions of Northern Equus have given us quite a bit of infamy worldwide, even as we strove to free and liberate the peoples there. Many harmonist nations are still hesitant to sell us vital resources. We should reassure them that these wars were necessary to save the creatures there, just as this war with Chrysalis is."
 STL_friends_again:0 "Friends Once More"
 STL_friends_again_desc:0 "Equestria is thankfully willing to work with us! We will defend harmony and equality together. Violent revolution has its place, but today we learn the value of reform!"
 STL_it_is_time:0 "It is Time"
 STL_it_is_time_desc:0 "The final push is at hand. Joint exercises have taught us both countless military techniques. We will save the changelings from their tyrants and bring about a truly Equal Equus!"
 STL_war_plan_equality:0 "War Plan Equality"
 STL_war_plan_equality_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Equestria will never be willing to implement liberatory policies. Caramel Marks learned that when Celestia rejected her proposal. We will just have to invade the rest of the continent at once. Some will say that is impossible, but we already defeated Stalliongrad as a city-state. We will prevail."
 STL_ultra_industrialization:0 "Ultra-Industrialization"
 STL_ultra_industrialization_desc:0 "Factory work is a glorious affair, and out of it comes countless benefits both internal and external. But for this coming war, we will require a grim number of arms factories. Our troops must be well-equipped to prevail!"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality:0 "The Lockstep Legions of Equality"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality_desc:0 "Equality goes beyond a philosophy. It is the next stage of socialism! Dialectical materialism fails because it puts material conditions above creatures' willpower. Nothing is impossible for a sufficiently motivated creature."
 STL_the_final_steps:0 "The Final Steps"
 STL_the_final_steps_desc:0 "A simultaneous invasion of Equestria and the Changelings will require countless supply trucks, as well as a heavy mechanized spearhead. Production will be increased accordingly, as the people's will drives us forward!"
 STL_blast_sacred_war_on_repeat:0 "Join in Our Utopia"
 STL_blast_sacred_war_on_repeat_desc:0 "The time has come. All preparations have been made. Immediate invasion of the Changeling Lands and Equestria, to bring true equality, friendship, and justice to all creatures on Equus. May our descendants forgive us for going this far..."

 #########EVENTS

 starlight.1.t:0 "Our Cozy Little Meeting"
 starlight.1.d:0 "As noon broke over the idyllic Town, hundreds of stallions and mares flocked to the small, neat building tucked in the middle of the peaceful settlement. Inside, congregating together and out towards the public were five ponies, all with remarkably different appearances and goals. In the center, with a gentle appearance befitting a mail-stallion rather than a mayor, was the soft-spoken Double Diamond. To his left was the red-headed baker known as Sugar Belle, a harmonic socialist mare who blended the two usually-conflicting ideologies together into something she believed would work - something notably more sympathetic to Equestria. To his right was the sharp-haired mare known as Night Glider, the Town's local aviator and collector of used planes who practiced Utopian Socialism - an old form decried by modern communists, but one that would perhaps fit better in the quiet streets of the Town.\n\nOn the far ends were the two representatives most of the Town wasn't particularly fond of, at least when it came to their beliefs. Party Favor, the curly-haired charismatic balloon-maker, stood on the podium dressed in full Stalliongrad garb, shamelessly displaying his ideology. Wrapping around to the other side was finally Feather Bangs, the Town's local celebrity and talk of the town, appearing not nearly as professionally as the rest, but still holding a sort of young stallion's pop flare to them; a capitalist at heart, he was sympathetic enough to the equalist cause to be elected into the council, though his desire to attract Nova Griffonian investment is seldom mentioned, even if he believed it to be a good idea.\n\n"Thank you one and all for attending this meeting." Double Diamond softly spoke, the lull of his voice snapping the attention of the sleepy crowd. "I would like to start by saying that we have gone far ever since Starlight's saddening hypocrisy was revealed, but I am certain that we can go much farther." There was a strong will behind that voice, masked by a pleasant and kind tone. "For the equalist cause, there is nothing we can't all overcome, together!"
 starlight.1.a:0 "The applause was silent; but as one joined another, it was soon enough a chorus."
 starlight.1.b:0 "Ponies shifted awkwardly in their seats, awaiting the saner speakers to continue."


 starlight.2.t:0 "Feather Takes the Spotlight"
 starlight.2.d:0 "Feather Bangs rubbed his hoofs together. This was it. This was the day. This was where the slick city boy would go out and make a splash on the big scene. Well, it wasn't the big scene - he wasn't an actor prancing around in Canterlot, but this was... this was better than that! There was something more to this than just hitting on girls and relying on his melodic voice to swoon the crowd. His crowd wouldn't be gawking teenagers, but worried adults, hoping and hoping they'd listen to something that wasn't the drivel Starlight fed them all those years back. He'd be better than that!\n\nHe looked over the crowd in front of him. The town hall gathered again just for him, and there was a bigger crowd than he anticipated. He could see tired eyes, not particularly interested in his swagger and his modern hairstyle, but the politics he'd bring to the table. A deep breath coursed through his lungs. He could do this. Fake it 'til you make it, he thought; a mantra he had since his high school days.\n\n"What is up, everypony?" He asked, a bright smile on his face as he looked over the crowd. "I know we're all pretty bummed out about what's been going on in our town, and honestly, you're right, it sucks." Keep going, Feather, keep that momentum up. "But it doesn't have to be like that! Have you guys looked out at what the rest of the world is doing while we were busy suckin' up to Starlight and getting our marks removed? They've been gettin' modernized and stuff! Meanwhile, we've been too afraid of pushing past equalism to get with the times." A spike of anxiety. Feather swallowed, hoping no one would notice. "Maybe it sounds crazy, but I want to try what they do. All that capitalism stuff, about bringing in wealth and businesses and letting everyone do the thing they're good at - why not? Is that really so bad?\n\nFeather exhaled, watching the crowd closely and nervously. He expected silence, or even booing, but instead..."
 starlight.2.a:0 "Confused yet intrigued murmurs breached the crowd. Something new, something... good?"

 
 starlight.3.t:0 "A Party in Our Oblast"
 starlight.3.d:0 ""Hi, everyone!" Party Favor began strong. Though many eyed him oddly for wearing an entire Stalliongrad costume, with more than a few rumors that he was taken away and brainwashed by Stalliongrad agents or something as ridiculous as that, it was undeniable that most people liked him quite a lot. He made balloons! What wasn't there to love? Well... whenever he started going off about theory, probably.\n\n"I'm so glad you could all come to my speech today. The elections are coming up soon, and I suppose it's my job to try and convince you to vote for me!" He said, giving a short laugh. "That's just how it is! Now, let's get into the important stuff." He cleared his throat, and pointed a hoof towards the roof of the ceiling.\n\n"Gentlemares and stallions alike, we've got a growing to-be superpower right below our town! And I'll be honest, I think they've got some great ideas we could borrow from them. Do you know how they work? They've got a group of ponies that debate each other but all work together for the collective. Kind of like equalism, but there's enough smart ponies in there to prevent any silly ideas from running about the place!" It seemed like Party Favor had brushed up on his way to interest the crowd in communist theory, because now, they were listening.\n\n"And they're all about catching up to industry and infrastructure! Sure, we might not be nearly as big as they are, but shoot, if we were making progress half as fast as they were, we'd be having pie parties every day, not just every month! I know, I know, it sounds hard to believe, but here's one little nugget of truth I'll leave you with: if we become good friends with Stalliongrad, we'll have a big, nice state protecting us and giving us huge avenues of trade! They might ask for things like Marksist collectivization and a vanguard party, but if it's worked for them, you bet it'll work for us too!"
 starlight.3.a:0 "While most didn't really know a thing about Marksist theory, it did sound appealing..."


 starlight.4.t:0 "Double Diamond's Double Time Speech"
 starlight.4.d:0 "Rather than climbing up to a podium and holding a speech in the town hall, Double Diamond had decided to stay true to his principles and instead speak right outside the building, on the steps to it, a symbolic gesture. Everyone knew that he was Starlight's right-hoof mane, but at the same time, he was one of the first to oust her. Yet he still held a firm belief in equalism, and there was a sort of undeniable zealous passion whenever he spoke about it, if not a little on the disturbingly energetic side.\n\n"Friends of Our Town," Double Diamond began, head held high and confident, "I urge all of you to look at how tragically little we've done in the years that have passed since Starlight left. We were all afraid of equalism, and what bad things it could do to us. But Starlight's Equalism was a far cry from what it can be! Equality isn't about removing our cutie marks, and removing who we are. It's about making sure we're all working towards a better future. It's about no one being left behind, and no pony having the ability to exploit another!" Double Diamond was firm in his words, and though some ponies still held suspicion that this would simply be a repeat, many more knew Double Diamond was honest - unlike Starlight. He truly believed in the cause.\n\n"So I ask you, personally, not as some sort of ruler, figurehead, or party leader, but as a friend to another friend." Double Diamond smiled at the quiet crowd. "Give equalism another chance. There was a silver lining in some of the things Starlight said, even if it was ultimately a charade. I truly, honestly think that seeing it realized - the real equalism - will give everypony a chance to be happy and healthy!""
 starlight.4.a:0 "You can't doubt his honesty, at least."

 starlight.6.d:0 "In a grassy clearing just outside Our Town, two ponies sat together on a picnic blanket. One of them was a pink unicorn mare, the other a large red stallion. The chilly evening air didn't seem to bother them as they looked lovingly into each other's eyes.\n\n"Today's campaign speech went really well," said Sugar Belle, "Don't you think?"\n"Eeyup." replied Big Mac.\nSugar Belle smiled and looked towards the town.\n\n"Those ponies were very skeptical at first," she continued, "and I was so nervous I nearly shook, but in the end I think I got through to them. They're starting to understand that friendship and harmony doesn't mean the return of inequality and exploitation. If we keep at it I think I can win this race, and then once I'm the mayor we'll really have to start..."\n\nShe paused, noticing Big Mac's frown.\n"You still don't like that I'm running for mayor, do you?"\n"Nope." he replied, his voice full of concern.\nSugar Belle put her hooves around his neck.\n\n"I know you think things up here are awfully dangerous, and I know you wish I had taken that apprenticeship with Mrs. Cake in Ponyville, but I can't just leave. This is my home, and these ponies are my friends. I have to show them that there's a better way to live. I'd never forgive myself if I ran away in their time of need."\n\n"I know." Big Mac said with a sigh.\n\n"Don't worry," Sugar Belle said excitedly, "no matter what happens I promise we'll be together. You've given me so much help already, and I'll need you even more if I become mayor. It's your love that keeps me going, it inspires me. Other ponies deserve to be as happy as we are."\n\nAs the sun started to dip beyond the horizon, the two ponies shared a kiss."

Talk of the election winner was all that dominated conversation, and the turnout was truly staggering, with several election ballots having long queues from the sheer quantity of energetic ponies voting. Once the election was over, the process of counting began - something that kept thousands of ponies up throughout the night in sheer anticipation. Yet, as morning came, the news broke, and the people held their breath.\n\nWho had won?"

 starlight.12.t:0 "The Town Anthem"
 starlight.12.d:0 "A public debate in the town hall raged between the five Town leaders on a contentious, all-important topic. Which anthem would represent the Town best? It seemed like there was no end to the discussion as each shared their options. "Starlight's song, though it misled us at first, I believe still holds a good message to aspire to." Double Diamond said. "For all the pain it may have caused, we can take that power back into our hands! Of course, not everything would stay, but the core is still the same. We're all meant to be happy here!"\n\nParty Favor cut in with a polite clearing of his throat. "That is absolutely true, but I would say that the Internationale is a perfect song for the common creature. Have you ever sung it? It's beautiful! I'd say it'd bring a tear to the working pony's eye, and I'd want all of us to be reminded that we fight for our rights every day, just like we are right now." He gave the crowd a beaming smile, but Night Glider glared at him.\n\n"Come on, Party Favor, can't you give an idea that isn't part and parcel from Stalliongrad? Workers of the world have their own song! It's called the United Front Song!" She said. "And I'd say it's got a better tune than the Internationale." She added in. Party Favor gave her a very disappointed look, but she only returned a smug smile.\n\n"All this fluffing up is just silly, I'd say. What about The Heart Carol? I think it's perfect not just for ponykind, but especially for us!" Sugar Belle's smile to the crowd was pleasant and reserved, unlike Party Favor's. "It warms your heart and makes you remember all the friends and family you've got supporting you."\n\nThe black horse out of this entire debate was Feather Bangs. He frankly had no idea what to add in. The closest thing he could wrack his brain was his hit single "Cutie", but... no one really seemed to take it seriously, so he opted to skip his turn to speak whenever it came up, to his muted embarrassment."
 starlight.12.a:0 "Life is so grand in Our Town, we're always filled with cheer..."

 starlight.12.c:0 "March on in the Workers' United Front for you are a worker too!"
 starlight.12.e:0 "As dawn shines on us every morn, the Fire of Friendship is reborn..."


 starlight.13.t:0 "The Army Budget"
 starlight.13.d:0 ""With the clear abstaining of Night Glider (citing that "she really doesn't care about land combat"), only four were left on their podiums to discuss another major aspect of the Town's budget. Though the army was miniscule... practically non-existent... most considered it a worthy cause to argue about. Feather Bangs had started with a thundering proclamation that the Town would use tanks to roll over anycreature who wanted to strip away the Town's freedom - a bold claim that received odd stares and confused huh's from everyone else, though there was some mild approval here and there.\n\n"A gun in every soldier's hooves is the first thing you need to protect yourself!" Double Diamond spoke. "What else comes first before that? We want to all come together, then everypony bravely helping protect our community will need the best firearms they can get their hooves on." He said, nodding to himself.\n\n"The best guns won't do you any good if you keel over before you get it!" Sugar Belle said, irritated by how short-sighted Double Diamond seemed. "What about everything before that? The radio, the hospital? Keeping the actual gun in check? All of that's important too, you know."\n\n"And none of that," Party Favor began, "matters if you've got big enough guns to blow your enemies up skyhigh. I don't mean like a rifle, no, I mean like an artillery piece! I've seen a couple in action when I was in Stalliongrad, and let me tell you people: just a couple of those, and you'll never have to fear a reactionary coming your way!"

 starlight.14.d:0 "Perhaps the most unpleasant debate of the hour was about the Sunset Festival. That day, it was just Party Favor and Sugar Belle arguing on who would be the one to organize it - and the air quickly turned uncomfortable and borderline hostile.\n\n"If you got the keys to the Festival, all you would do is just put up the Stalliongrad flag everywhere! All hammers and sickles and reds, don't you have any other color scheme?!" Sugar Belle asked. "The Festival has no right to be so ideological! It's just about celebrating us - our Town, we as people. Why does it have to be some platform for your Marksism thing?"\n\n"Because it's in our lifeblood, Sugar Belle!" Party Favor replied, his normally cheerful demeanor having dropped to a carefully irritated one. "I'm not saying the Festival would just be about Marksism-Stallionism, but yes, I would include it. It's part of our liberation. It's the worker's ideology, and even if you hate that word, Stalliongrad shows every day why that's true!"\n\n"Is that all it is?" Sugar Belle asked, growing restless. "Stalliongrad this, Stalliongrad that - we're not their puppet!" There was disappointment in her eyes. Party Favor frowned. "The Festival will be just fine without having their banner painted on every street. We'll celebrate things our Town is known for. Not what some other country is doing."\n\nParty Favor sighed. "That's the kind of naivety I'd expect from you, Sugar Belle." The both of them exchanged glances, both disappointed and angry, as the crowd was left to sort out who would lead the festival."

While he did attempt to hold an impromptu speech about how they had it all wrong and that they needed to give him a chance, a tomato had struck him in the face, stunning him for long enough so that some ponies wrangled him and, quite literally, booted him out of office.\n\nIn a display of impatience and uncertainty, however, as nobody knew what would happen after Double Diamond's forced resignation, a crowd of ponies approached a pony who happened to be walking by that day next to the town hall, accosting him and demanding to know his political expertise. Claiming to be a tailor by the name of Burlap, they had asked him if he was willing to become Our Town's next mayor, to which he gave an anxious shrug. The crowd decided that that was as good a sign as any, and promptly shoved him into the town hall to be appointed as mayor."

 double_diamond.14.d:0 "Double Diamond was not a pony who loved giving speeches, but today's occasion warranted one. He glanced across the table, to his old friends, and began. "My comrades, we have a grave problem on our doorstep. Even as we continue to refine the theory and practice of equalism and the broader movement of revolutionary liberation, our neighbors in Stalliongrad choke under the stifling weight of bureaucracy. How can we speak to international camaraderie when our own so-called friend has fallen so far from the spirit of 995? Stallion was a flawed leader already, but he'd be sickened if he saw what happened to his beloved revolution!"\n\nParty Favor shifted uncomfortably as Double Diamond continued. "The Left Opposition, the Right Opposition, the Center - they're all lost! None of them understand the true mission! Our goal, the sacred goal of Marks, Angel, Stallion, and Glimmer, has always been to liberate all the creatures of the world through the abolition of hierarchy and the establishment of true peoples' democracy. But the bureaucracy suffocates the people in endless forms and papers, inserting the state into every aspect of society!" As Night Glider motioned to interject, Double Diamond unleashed his bombshell. "We cannot abide such an anti-populist stain upon the name of socialism! That is why, my friends, we must launch an IMMEDIATE INVASION OF STALLIONGRAD!"\n\nThe room exploded into shouts of shock and indignation. Feather Bangs was white as a ghost, and Sugar Belle looked about to faint. Night Glider cried, "Double Diamond, have you lost your mind!? Stalliongrad is easily ten times stronger than us, maybe twenty!"\n\n"They've only ever been good to us!" Party Favor protested. "Turning against them would be like a foal betraying their parents!"\n\nDouble Diamond sighed. "Yes, I know it will be difficult, and it will be controversial. We are outmatched militarily, industrially, and politically, and many ponies see Stalliongrad as our friends. But we have something the red bureaucrats lost a decade ago: a fully mobilized, revolutionary populace. A populace ready to march into Tartarus itself to break the chains of the people. As for its necessity? Look at what the red bureaucrats did to the revolution. And I know there is absolutely nothing that can stop a sufficiently determined pony, and I believe that we, the great commune of Our Town, have that determination."

As he took the podium before the Supreme Soviet, there was a fire in his eyes few grasped. He took a deep breath, and began. "The harmonists are fond of saying that history arcs towards friendship, and in that they are correct. Cruel methods of rule such as absolute monarchy, serfdom, and secret police are on their way out, historically speaking. But where the harmonists make an error is believing they are the true heralds of friendship. I ask, what friendship is there between even a benevolent President-Marshal and a common factory worker, or a Princess and a peasant? What friendship can there be, indeed ever, between those with different access to power? If you are subordinate to another, you are not their friend--you are their vassal."\n\nHis eyes narrowed. "And for too long, the forces--the true forces--of friendship have sat idle, the province of children and childlike dreamers. For all her faults, Starlight Glimmer dared to dream of a better way, just as Caramel Marks did before her, and moreover she dared to make that dream a reality. What we are building here in Our Stalliongrad goes beyond the simple socialized economy of our predecessors, beyond the wildest dreams of the utopians of Equestria, and even beyond what Caramel Marks herself only dared to hint at as the creature-being." A grin split his face, even as he started to feel lightheaded. "What we are building, my friends, is nothing less than the ultimate culmination of friendship itself! Soon, history will--"\n\nAnd Double Diamond hit the floor, unconscious."

It was the flag of Equestria, yet drawn in the colors of Our Stalliongrad, and with a great equals sign replacing the symbol of the princesses. It waved beautifully, and he had no doubt this was their destiny... but what did it mean? As the vision faded, he awoke to his friends standing over him worriedly. "Are you alright, Double Diamond?" Night Glider asked.\n\nHe got to his hooves, uneasily. "Yes, urgh... my speech..." He brushed his friends' worries aside, and retook the podium.\n\n"As I was saying, soon history will prove us to be not merely socialists, but the vanguard of friendship itself. And that starts here, now. True peoples' democracy! Government comprehensible to its citizens! Solidarity among every people and every culture! A world where none is exploited, and none is exploiter! As the continent burns under the mad dreams of reactionary conquest, the time has come to take a stand for what is right. For true friendship, for true harmony, for true equality, and for the unimaginably bright future that awaits us. That is why, my friends, I have decided to ask your help in a great endeavor." At last, he hesitated. He had come here to urge the Supreme Soviet to vote for joining the continent-splitting war. But could his vision mean that their destiny was to save the people of both sides, just as they had Stalliongrad a few years ago? As he settled on the answer, he opened his mouth once more.

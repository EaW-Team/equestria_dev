 STL_windbreaker:0 "Windbreaker"
 STL_windbreaker_desc:0 "Windbreaker is a Stalliongradian pony sent to the backwater commune of Our Town, nominally as part of a military attache. His expertise in motorized formations has been utterly worthless here, but his skill at supply acquisition has proven quite useful in the remote mountains. While an Equestrian Socialist, he's more sympathetic to the allure of Equalism than most."

STL_background_pony_1_desc:0 "If the first millennium was the millennium of monarchy, the second must be the millennium of republics. Flower Flight knows this, but she also knows that Celestia has done right by all the ponies of Equestria. If Celestia were unchained by the rules of federalism, imagine what she could accomplish! But that would only happen if instead of Princess Celestia, she were President Celestia. Such is this veterinarian's vision."

STL_background_pony_2:0 "Log Jam" 
STL_background_pony_2_desc:0 "Growing up as a lumberjack just north of Manehattan, Log Jam had a rough life. He came to resent the merciless sweep of modernity and industrialism. He fell in with a group of socialists around the time of the Winter Revolution, but their commitment to the city's proletariat felt off. Starlight's charisma swayed him for a time, but now he can see clearly again. The farmers and landworkers - not the city slickers - are the people who must come first."

STL_background_pony_3:0 "Maple Cheer" 
STL_background_pony_3_desc:0 "That capitalism is the most successful economic system the world has seen is not in doubt to this Whinnysota mare. But at the same time, that it produces horrible inequality is not in doubt either. For it to survive and live up to its potential, it has to be more than it is now. Just as unions are vital, so is welfare. Nocreature should ever go hungry, whatever the reason."

STL_army_pony_1:0 "Redwood Oak"
STL_army_pony_1_desc:0 "The revolution must be international in nature, there can be no question of that. But it must also avoid the trap of vanguardism. Redwood Oak has been a believer in councils ever since the death of Stallion and the disintegration of his party. As an engineer, he knows all too well the temptation to build from the top down, but the revolution can't risk that. Not with the world at stake."

STL_army_pony_2:0 "Ivy Vine"
STL_army_pony_2_desc:0 "As a childhood friend of Double Diamond, Ivy Vine's time under Equalism was better than some's. But all the same, Starlight's fraud shattered her faith in socialism entirely. No, the goal for reform had to be republicanism. In a republic, everyone can vote for whatever extremist candidates they want. While Celestia has sat and done nothing, a unitary republic could reshape the nation in a flash."

STL_air_pony_1:0 "Rocky Storm"
STL_air_pony_1_desc:0 "A member of the Albion weather team who was inspired by the stories of the Skynavian revolution, Rocky Storm journeyed to Our Town in hopes of a mirror of it. Now that Starlight is gone, she has soured on the idea of class war in general. Democratic socialism, with careful attendance to rights for all, must be the byword of the revolution."

STL_navy_pony_1:0 "Bacon Braids"
STL_navy_pony_1_desc:0 "As an Appleloosan farmer, Bacon Braids was little given to radicalism for most of her life. When Starlight sounded the call, she decided to give it a try. Now that Equalism no longer rules, she's synthesized some socialist ideas with her love of the land. Industrial work is well and good, but everypony needs to eat - why not socialise agriculture?"

STL_high_command_1:0 "White Marble"
STL_high_command_1_desc:0 "A mason from Vanhoover, White Marble is perhaps the biggest supporter of classical Glimmerism still around. While Double Diamond has spoken of a new equalism, he's not really sure what was inherently wrong with the old one. Sure, Glimmer was a tyrant and a hypocrite, but doesn't that just mean we need more Equalism, not less? Seems pretty clear to him."

STL_high_command_2:0 "Offbeat"
STL_high_command_2_desc:0 "Offbeat has made quite the turnaround since the days of Starlight. Once an avowed Equalist from Baltimare, she has now sworn to never again be chained. When she's not violating noise ordinances or ranting about how more mainline socialists have haunted minds, she can be found at her milk shop--though don't call it that to her face. She prefers the term "milk union of egoists"."

STL_high_command_3:0 "Sunny Song"
STL_high_command_3_desc:0 "Baltimare has its share of racial and ethnic issues, and Sunny Song wanted no part of that. The bats and jungle ponies are fine folks! He immigrated to Stalliongrad and then to Starlight's experiment, though between Baltimare and Glimmerism he's had quite enough of socialism for one lifetime. Liberal republicanism seems a whole lot less messy."

STL_high_command_4:0 "Rosemary"
STL_high_command_4_desc:0 "Being a barista in Fillydelphia, Rosemary has had a rather unpleasant life. Attending the rallies of various far-left and far-right figures, she drifted from position to position wildly. After the end of Starlight's rule, she has gained a bit of notoriety as one of the only prominent nostalgics for those days. Holding that as only ponies have cutie marks to remove, only ponies can be truly equal, she has founded the "National Glimmerist Party", synthesizing radical Equalism with extreme ethnonationalism."

STL_theorist_2:0 "Amethyst Skim"
STL_theorist_2_desc:0 "A factory worker from Bales, Amethyst Skim is a bit of an eccentric. She has formulated a synthesis of socialism and technocracy that calls for the most educated ponies to plan the economy and the society as a whole. Her vision has attracted few followers in the egalitarian Town, but stands ready to assist us should we ever need her talents."

Chased out for his habit of eating other people's gems under the dubious premise of "everything is my property", he has made a fast friendship with Offbeat and encouraged her to start the milk union of egoists. While his ultra-radical individualism is unpopular in the egalitarian Town, at least he keeps everycreature on edge!"

While not involved in the Winter Revolution, he was firmly in support, and when Starlight began gathering her followers, he was her first convert--and later, her chief enforcer.\n\nAfter she was exposed as a fraud, his faith in the ideology was shattered, like all of his peers. But unlike his peers, he gradually regained it. Starlight was a tyrant, yes, but her ideology wasn't inherently bad. After all, the quest for true equality was always a desire of the left, wasn't it? Why stop at just economic equality when societal equality could be achieved? Caramel Marks spoke of the creature-being who would be simultaneously perfectly selfish and perfectly selfless. Glimmer's attempt at creating an equal society was a bold step towards this, even though it was misguided.\n\nHis views are hardly popular in Our Town, and his mayorship has been rocky. Only a coalition government with the Our Town Communist Party and the Society for Equality of All Creatures was able to form a majority in the town council. But despite it all, he has never given up on his dream of a truly free society. With his term coming to a close, no one is quite sure how things will turn out now, or who will take the mayorship's next term...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"
 STL_leader_information_party_favor_tt:0 "§YPosition§!: People's Commissar of War\n\n§YBorn§!: 16th of June, 969 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: From his youth, Party Favor had two loves: balloon-making and socialism. He took part in the Winter Revolution personally, serving as a logistics officer in the brief conflict with Equestria. He fell in with Starlight's movement, but when the Elements of Harmony visited, he was part of the movement to overthrow her. With his cutie mark restored, he'd had enough of radical lunacy, and decided that Our Town needed to stick to the line established by Marks, Angel, and Stallion. Democratic centralism, for all its flaws, was still the best system possible under capitalist hegemony.\n\nHe founded the Our Town Communist Party along the concepts of Steel Stallion, and has since been the strongest proponent of closer relations with their southern neighbors. His friends know that his devotion to the Town's ideals is sincere, but some voters see him as a Stalliongradian plant, not helped by his brief membership in the PDS. He counters that any conflict with Stalliongrad would be totally disastrous, and closer cooperation is their only hope to survive in this brutal age of war.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"
 STL_leader_information_night_glider_tt:0 "§YPosition§!: People's Commissar of Aviation\n\n§YBorn§!: 9th of November, 978 in Las Pegasus\n\n§YBiography§!: Growing up in a place like Las Pegasus, Night Glider was never really at ease with capitalism. But she felt ill at ease with Stalliongradian class-war vanguard party rule as well. When Starlight formed her experiment, Night Glider saw the advertisements in the newspaper and jumped at the chance to join. The reality was less than she expected, but Starlight's charisma kept her around until the truth was revealed.\n\nNow that Our Town is free once again, she refuses to let it be chained again. A better kind of socialism, a socialism without violence, is still possible. And she intends to prove that to the world. Not by conquest, but by keeping the commune going as it has always been--balanced between three giants, but independent and open to all.\n\nNight Glider is without a doubt one of the most popular ponies in Our Town. If she had run for Mayor last election, she may well have won. When she announced her candidacy for this term, it was the talk of the town, and she is widely considered the frontrunner.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 STL_leader_information_sugar_belle_tt:0 "§YPosition§!: People's Commissar of Food Supplies\n\n§YBorn§!: 15th of January, 975 in Albion\n\n§YBiography§!: Sugar Belle was an unlikely candidate for mayor of a commune. She grew up a bit of a reactionary--never an avowed one, but she certainly thought little of Stalliongrad for seceding. Even now, she considers the secession a tragedy. Princess Celestia is without a doubt one of the kindest, greatest ponies to have ever lived. The Stalliongradians could have negotiated for reforms Equestria-wide, but let petty grievances and nationalism win out. Years later, and the "international socialist revolution" has hardly been very international. Socialism is necessary to alleviate the cruelties of capitalism, but the kind of things Stalliongrad have been up to are totally against the original spirit of that.\n\nIn her heart, she sometimes wonders if Severyanian culture is just more nationalistic and authoritarian than Equestrian culture, but she moved here specifically to quash those kinds of thoughts, and tries to push them down when they crop up. In her personal life, she is engaged to the brother of the Element of Honesty, and that has naturally shaped her views on foreign policy.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

As an aspiring pop star, he went to Our Town hoping to find likeminded individuals. Unfortunately, the collectivists ruthlessly trampled his spirit, until he was just another face in the crowd. Now that that nightmare is over, he is back to doing what he loves most - singing! He was convinced to apply for office by his manager, and has done a surprisingly non-disastrous job of introducing revolutionary song into the schools of Our Town.\n\nHis views are at least as controversial as Double Diamond's, wanting to invite foreign capital and align with the Nova Griffonians. He is terrified of the potential of Severyanian totalitarianism getting a hoofhold in the free commune, and remains convinced that Equestria is either unwilling or unable to aid them. Nova Griffonia may not be perfect, but they are rich, industrialized, and most importantly, not communist.\n\nWith a massive fanbase and thousands of attendees at his concerts, he may not have a coherent political theory or much experience in the realm of power, but he may just have the popularity needed to win big!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opal"

Those who called him a madpony are now stuck looking rather foolish themselves.\n\nWith free reign to implement his fanatical vision, Our Town is in for strange times indeed. His once-tepid, gentle rhetoric has given way to a hawkishness few would recognize. Starlight herself might be surprised to see him so eagerly advocating war to expand the revolution. While his opposition to methods such as cutie mark removal are well-known, many ponies are confused what Equalism even means without it. How does it differ from other forms of socialism anyway?\n\nDouble Diamond has no doubts. He has lived a life in accordance with the principles of Equalism. He will go farther than any of the red bureaucrats of Stalliongrad could ever imagine. The future beckoning is brighter than those fools can imagine. "The communism of the dirt", as he has taken to calling Stalliongrad's system? Primitive, limited, sterile, doomed.\n\nDouble Diamond's neo-Equalism will complete the entire paradigm of socialism, taking the best from every strain--from anarchism to Marksism-Stallionism. Ready your feeble defenses, hierarchists. Weep for the loss of your tyranny. For the final revolution is upon all--the end of history itself.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

 POLITICS_BURLAP:0 "A tailor by trade, and a very ordinary pony, Burlap never had any interest in politics.

 STL_intensify_steel_production:0 "Intensify Steel Production"
 STL_find_aluminum:0 "Find Aluminum"
 STL_find_chromium:0 "Deep Chromium Mines"
 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering:0 "Designing Utopia"
 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering_desc:0 "The §Pequal future§! awaiting us must be crafted carefully. Pushing too fast may cause §Rchaos§!, while going too slow may lead to §Rdoubt§! in the effectiveness of our leadership. We must be bold yet cautious."
 STL_true_friendship_countdown:0 "The True Friendship Experiment"
 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."
 STL_write_new_stories:0 "Write New Stories"
 STL_write_new_stories_desc:0 "Literature has traditionally been a force of reaction, glorifying princesses and castles rather than ordinary creatures. That ends now. We will instruct our greatest authors to write about the beautiful, equal world we have before us."
 STL_reorganize_the_family:0 "Families for the Future"
 STL_reorganize_the_family_desc:0 "For too long, families have been organized around a hierarchical, unequal system. Some had many children, others none. As Caramel Marks laid out in her manifesto, communal child-rearing is the future."
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones:0 "The Union of Equal Little Ones"
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones_desc:0 "Similar to the Junior Pioneers in Stalliongrad, we will form our own group for children. The Union of Equal Little Ones will blossom into a beautiful organization where children learn about the better world waiting for us all."
 STL_abolish_racist_language:0 "Synthesize a New Language"
 STL_abolish_racist_language_desc:0 "Unfortunately, racism still exists, because the ideas composing racism still exist. As a first step to eliminating racism forever, we will create a new language, in which it is impossible to even think racist thoughts."
 STL_new_military_division_design:0 "The Universal Army Unit"
 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."
 STL_horizontal_factory_life:0 "Establish a Horizontal Factory Structure"
 STL_horizontal_factory_life_desc:0 "Even in Stalliongrad, bosses still exist. This is an affront to equality at its most fundamental. We will replace these red plutocrats with a far better organizational structure."
 STL_the_song_of_liberation:0 "Codify Absolute Rights"
 STL_the_song_of_liberation_desc:0 "Being equal also means having the same rights. Starlight made a grievious error wtih her reeducation centers. We will never repeat that mistake. All creatures are created equal, and all creatures have inalienable rights."
 STL_glorious_future:0 "The Wondrous Future"
 STL_glorious_future_desc:0 "We are not a great power like Equestria, but we have begun a beautiful project here, and we will take it all the way. Nothing will stop our advance towards the light in the sky.\n\nOh wondrous future, please do not be cruel to us!"

 STL_leftist_power_balance_decisions:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"

 STL_modernize_the_town_desc:0 "Feather Bangs and Sugar Belle think we should focus our efforts on roads and bridges, connecting our capital with the small villages nearby."
 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase:0 "Our Airbase"
 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase_desc:0 "Night Glider is eager for a proper airbase to fuel our future airforce. We should look into this."
 STL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare a Stage of Siege"
 STL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the reactionaries are upon us. Now is the time to make sacrifices to protect ourselves and our future! Now is the time to fight!"
 STL_invite_foreign_capital:0 "Invite Foreign Capital"
 STL_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "With our more capitalistic leanings now apparent, we can finally start to end our pariah status and invite foreign investments here. They will naturally be apprehensive at first, but the resources here are lucrative and eager to be exploited!"

 STL_equalist_power_balance_decisions:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward:0 "Revise Quotas Downward"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward_desc:0 "Our quotas may be too high. Not everyone is able to meet them. In the interest of fairness and morale, it might be best to adjust them downward."
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia:0 "Stoke Glimmerite Nostalgia"
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia_desc:0 "Strangely, some ponies miss the Starlight Glimmer days. While a return to that era is not at all what we want, it could still prove advantageous to pander to them to a degree."
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal:0 "Allow Voluntary Cutie Mark Removal"
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal_desc:0 "Bizarrely, a few ponies want to have their cutie marks removed again. Mostly social outcasts and misfits, they have petitioned the government for the right to remove them. They are apparently completely sincere, citing the secure feeling of conformity and meaning when branded with an equal sign."
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery:0 "Create Heavy Fortified Artillery"
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery_desc:0 "Our mountain home must be compmletely unassailable from any kind of attack. To that end, it is time to construct heavily fortified large-calibre guns capable of bombarding the enemy from afar."
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle:0 "Nothing But the Rifle"
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle_desc:0 "A minority faction within our army believes that things like "artillery", "engineers", and other modern conveniences are totally unnecessary. According to their doctrine, infantry can overcome any obstacle with sufficient will and drive."

 STL_ng_interventions:0 "Intervene in Conflicts"
 STL_ng_interventions_desc:0 "As wars break out against across Equus, we cannot sit by as the forces of reaction and tyranny consolidate themselves. We must step up and help out our brothers and sisters in harmony and socialism! Sending lend-lease and volunteers is a worthy step, but if things get dire, we may have to intervene directly..."
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans:0 "Help the Nova Griffonian Republicans!"
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans_desc:0 "The situation in Nova Griffonia has reached a breaking point. Just offering guns and volunteers to the republicans isn't enough. We must intervene directly! This goes beyond politics, it is a moral obligation to stop Highhill's brutality!"
 STL_YAK_assist:0 "Help the Yaks"
 STL_YAK_assist_desc:0 "The Yaks represent the forces of modernity, harmony and socialism, while their secessionist counterparts in the Jaki-Clan are the worst elements of old power hierarchies. We must step up."
 STL_CRY_assist:0 "Stop Sombra!"
 STL_CRY_assist_desc:0 "The horrors of Sombra's rule are the stuff of old legends come to life. We must put an end to this brutal repression!"
 STL_PLB_assist:0 "Help the Bears!"
 STL_PLB_assist_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the Polar Bears now have adopted our belief system, or at least something rather close to it. We are obliged to help them now!"
 STL_PNG_assist:0 "Help the Penguins!"
 STL_PNG_assist_desc:0 "The Penguins are fighting off a harsh attack by the Polar Bear imperialists. We must step up and help them out!"

 ########### Starlight Village ############
 STL_our_future_uncertain:0 "Our Future Uncertain"
 STL_our_future_uncertain_desc:0 "The five most important figures in our politics - Double Diamond, Party Favor, Night Glider, Sugar Belle, and Feather Bangs - cannot see eye to eye. Every town meeting leads to an argument, and nothing is getting done. Hopefully the January meeting will be more fruitful."

 STL_ally_griffons:0 "Closer to the Griffons"
 STL_ally_griffons_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia may be the weakest of the powers that surround us, but it brings several unique advantages to the table. Its thriving port cities provide access to the global market, and it has a large and growing communist movement led by Heinrich Redtail. Putting out feelers to Weter may be in our best interest."

 STL_ally_stg:0 "Closer to Stalliongrad"
 STL_ally_stg_desc:0 "Since Our Town was founded, Stalliongrad has always been our closest friend. The Revolution in Severyana was an inspiration to many leftist movements, including equalism, and their tacit support has allowed us to thrive in the mountains beyond Sovyenok. We should strengthen our ties with the home of the revolution by officializing our relationship."

 STL_ally_eqs:0 "Closer to Equestria"
 STL_ally_eqs_desc:0 "If it were not for Princess Twilight and her friends our ponies would still be suffering under Starlight's tyranny, robbed of their individuality. Equestria has shown us the way once, it can do so again. We should be looking towards Canterlot and the Crystal City for assistance. Despite our differences, we all share the values of freedom and progress."

 STL_feather_bangs_leads:0 "The Reaction of Feather Bangs"
 STL_feather_bangs_leads_desc:0 "Feather Bangs is a singer, popular among young ponies for both his talent and his looks. He is the most inexperienced member of our governing coalition and he wants to bring back capitalism, which many consider a betrayal of our core principles. Yet somehow, in spite of it all, he is finding crowds that want to hear about his politics as well as his music."

 STL_party_favor_leads:0 "The Orthodoxy of Party Favor"
 STL_party_favor_leads_desc:0 "Party Favor is a balloon maker and a fixture at parties throughout Our Town. He is also a Marksist-Stallionist and has come to represent Stalliongrad's influence on our politics. Our people tend to be a bit wary of the communists to our south, but Party Favor's charisma is starting to win them over. Taking some cues from Marksist theory is starting to sound pretty good."

 STL_double_diamond_leads:0 "The Neo-Equalism of Double Diamond"
 STL_double_diamond_leads_desc:0 "Double Diamond, our current mayor, is a true believer in equalism. After Starlight left he spent time rethinking her philosophy, refining it into something he calls "neo-equalism." This eclectic and unorthodox ideology didn't gain much traction at first, but now things are changing. Everyday more ponies find themselves listening to him, taking his ideas seriously for the first time."

 STL_night_glider_leads:0 "The Utopianism of Night Glider"
 STL_night_glider_leads_desc:0 "Night Glider has a knack for flying, both with her wings and in a stunt plane. Her daring air shows have made her a celebrity throughout Our Town and beyond. In politics she's come to represent an ambitious new idea she calls "equality without equalism." While some say she's got her head in the clouds, many others believe in the promise of a society that's truly free and equal."

 STL_sugar_belle_leads:0 "The Harmony of Sugar Belle"
 STL_sugar_belle_leads_desc:0 "Sugar Belle is a baker with close ties to Equestria. She's spent a lot of time away on extended trips to Ponyville, but no one doubts her commitment to Our Town and its ponies. Her message of embracing harmony and the Equestrian idea of friendship is picking up steam, attracting more followers by the day."

 STL_one_leader:0 "One Leader"
 STL_one_leader_desc:0 "The collapse of our governing coalition clearly demonstrates the problems with collective decision making. The only way to ensure a functional government is to choose one leader and entrust them with supreme authority. Some call this a return to tyranny, but surely a comrade in good standing will listen to the people."

 STL_centralized_state:0 "A Centralized State"
 STL_centralized_state_desc:0 "We respect the wishes of our people, but we cannot allow small disagreements to paralyze the government. Local leaders will have a few limited powers, while a central committee shall have the final say on all policy matters. Devolving authority any further would invite factionalism and inequality into our midst."

 STL_confederalist_state:0 "A Confederalist State"
 STL_confederalist_state_desc:0 "With our leaders divided on whether to devolve or centralize power, a compromise might provide the solution. The central government will have authority over all smaller localities, but a plurality of local leaders will be able to override its dictates. This confederal system will ensure all voices are heard without creating administrative chaos."

 STL_equestrian_model:0 "The Equestrian Model"
 STL_equestrian_model_desc:0 "In Equestria, local governments have a great deal of power, and their structure changes based on the desires of their subjects. This model, which has stood for centuries, should serve as our inspiration. All important powers shall be vested in small communities, who will be able to choose their own mode of government."

 STL_equal_footing:0 "An Equal Ally"
 STL_equal_footing_desc:0 "Our Town might not be the most conventional nation in the world, but it is a nation nonetheless. Any country unwilling to treat with us on an equal basis isn't a worthy ally. We will ask our chosen partner to grant us full diplomatic recognition and a mutual defense agreement."

 STL_powerful_friend:0 "A Powerful Protector"
 STL_powerful_friend_desc:0 "The world is becoming a dangerous place. If Our Town is to survive, it will need the protection of an established power with a strong economy and a large army. We must request a guarantee of independence from our chosen partner, before it's too late."

 STL_accept_our_reality:0 "Accept Our Reality"
 STL_accept_our_reality_desc:0 "In the game of diplomacy you can't get something for nothing. Small nations must always submit to their larger neighbors or risk being swallowed whole. We should offer our resources to our chosen partner in exchange for protection. It is a small price to pay to ensure our survival."

 STL_our_future_secured:0 "Our Future Secured"
 STL_our_future_secured_desc:0 "The most pressing issues have been settled. At the same time, the candidates are making their closing arguments and wrapping up their campaigns. Change is in the air, and our people are excited by the hope for a better future. All that remains is the election of our new leader."

 ### MILITARY
 STL_our_own_military:0 "Our Red Army's Sad Shape"
 STL_our_own_military_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Our Red Army is in a bad state. We need to massively expand our forces and learn modern military theory, or we'll never have a chance of survival!"

 STL_night_gliders_experiment:0 "Night Glider's Experiment"
 STL_night_gliders_experiment_desc:0 "Being by far the most interested in aviation of any of our politicians, Night Glider is committed to the creation of a true air force for [STL.GetName]. In particular, she is quite fond of the idea of close air support--planes full of bombs to rain death upon enemy troops and logistics."
 
 STL_the_horizontal_lines:0 "The Horizontal Lines"
 STL_the_horizontal_lines_desc:0 "We are not a large nation, and thus must make the most of the space we have. The time has come to develop a heavy fighter, one capable of reaching far and shooting down enemy bombers. We will pour the air budget into something beyond cutting-edge: a Horizontal Lines super-fighter!"

 STL_strike_the_hives:0 "Strike the Hives"
 STL_strike_the_hives_desc:0 "With our newly-developed heavy fighters, we are in a position to conduct a daring raid deep inside enemy territory. A strategic bomber will prove to the world that we are not to be trifled with."

 STL_air_superiority_fighters:0 "Air Superiority Fighters"
 STL_air_superiority_fighters_desc:0 "Night Glider loves to fly, and is quite attached to her old I-15. But the fact is that it is showing its age. Perhaps it's time to focus less on grand projects like strategic bombers, and more on the humble light fighter."
 
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army:0 "The Centerpiece of the Army"
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army lives and breathes at the lowest level. No army can succeed without a motivated private. We will establish bottom-upp lanning committees to funnel information and ideas up the ranks efficiently."

 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation:0 "The Rifle of Our Nation"
 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation_desc:0 "In Our Town, the infantrycreature is the bedrock of the army. We need new recruits to hold guns, and new guns for them to hold! Scrounging up every last gun we can find and increasing public investment in volunteer programs should find us some suitable eager warriors."

 STL_stableins_gambit:0 "Stablein's Gambit"
 STL_stableins_gambit_desc:0 "Did you know we have an admiral? It's true! His name is Valery Stablein and he has a long history of... sitting in his river gunboat and yelling across the border to Stalliongrad about how they're a degenerated workers' state? Anyway, he wants to build a navy, starting with some submarines. Why not let him have a go?"

 STL_freedom_convoys:0 "Convoy Guardians"
 STL_freedom_convoys_desc:0 "It turns out submarines get killed pretty easily by depth charges. We're gonna try and build some destroyers to protect our troops when they're on a naval invasion."

 STL_workhorse_of_fleet:0 "Workhorse of the Fleet"
 STL_workhorse_of_fleet_desc:0 "So destroyers can be killed pretty easily by light cruisers. But this time we've got a trick up our sleeve: we found out what kills light cruisers, and it's called a heavy cruiser! So we'll start researching them both so we aren't caught off guard again."

 STL_big_ships:0 "Big Ships"
 STL_big_ships_desc:0 "Okay, you know what? We're sick of this. Our ships keep getting sunk. We're gonna build the biggest ship ever, with the biggest guns ever, and nothing will sink it! It will be able to hit targets dozens of miles inland.\n\n\nWait, what is a carrier?"

 STL_training_and_logistics:0 "Training and Logistics"
 STL_training_and_logistics_desc:0 "It turns out that a lot of our troops are confused, hungry, or just plain inexperienced. If we are ever going to have a proper army, we'll need to know how to feed them and get them bullets. Quartermasters will be established to handle requisitions."

 STL_new_weaponry:0 "New Weaponry"
 STL_new_weaponry_desc:0 "As we've been focusing on getting our troops bullets and food, we've forgotten about modernizing their equipment. We need to step it up and make sure that the loyal daughters and sons of [STL.GetName] aren't going into battle with muskets."

 STL_increase_discipline:0 "Increase Discipline"
 STL_increase_discipline_desc:0 "While egalitarianism and democracy are core values of our great land, some soldiers have been taking advantage of us to live as more-or-less freeloaders. In two cases ponies even turned bandit! We need to train them right, and instill in them a sense that it is they who are the last guardian of their families and their way of life."

 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all:0 "The Red Army Stands Over All" 
 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all_desc:0 "We have done it. With a modern army, navy, and air force, we are no longer just a mountain commune. We are a mighty force for the reactionaries to reckon with!"

 ### ECONOMY
 STL_a_new_millenium:0 "Our Position in a New Millennium"
 STL_a_new_millenium_desc:0 "As history has advanced, Our Town has not. If we are ever to be anything more than a backwater mountain, we must step boldly into the 1000s!"

 STL_industrial_sector:0 "Our Primitive Manufacturing"
 STL_industrial_sector_desc:0 "We stand little chance of competing on the great stage of Equus if we can barely put an assembly line together. The time has come to organize the disjointed communes and villages into a united nation!"

 STL_electronics_sector:0 "Our Lacking Telecommunications"
 STL_electronics_sector_desc:0 "There is barely a single radio tower in [STL.GetName], and it takes days for news to travel one end of the mountains to the other. Were we to be invaded, it's dubious if everyone would even be aware of the situation before the enemy stormed in. But soon there will be a radio in every home!"
 
 STL_heavy_industry:0 "Our Cottage Industry"
 STL_heavy_industry_desc:0 "We cannot fight without weapons, and we are currently severely lacking in them. A new factory will be created set into Golden Mountain, hopefully secure from attack."
 
 STL_bunker_down:0 "Our Need for Fortifications"
 STL_bunker_down_desc:0 "It's unlikely we will continue to enjoy the neutral and peaceful position we have for over a decade. We must prepare for the worst. As a counter-invasion is virtually unthinkable, our best option is probably to bunker down so hard it's not worthwhile fighting us."
 
 STL_new_research_methods:0 "New Research Methods"
 STL_new_research_methods_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer's dictatorship severely hampered our academic capabilities. The time has come to let a hundred schools of thought bloom and see what valuable ideas can be gleaned from them all."

 STL_closed_no_longer:0 "Closed No Longer"
 STL_closed_no_longer_desc:0 "With our newfound territorial acquisitions, we are finally able to leave behind our status as a pariah city-state. Trade shall flow through our villages once more!"
 
 STL_more_factories:0 "Increase Industrial Output"
 STL_more_factories_desc:0 "We must expand our industrial capacity! In both light and heavy industry, we lag far behind our neighbors. They will not take us seriously until we have some proper factories!\n\nOkay, they probably won't take us seriously then either."
 
 STL_acquire_rubber:0 "Acquire Rubber"
 STL_acquire_rubber_desc:0 "Rubber is useful for many things, from Night Glider's planes to Feather Bangs' motorized warfare. We need it, badly. Therefore we will found our first synthetic refinery right here in [STL.GetName]!"

 STL_rich_city:0 "Our City"
 STL_rich_city_desc:0 "From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, creatures are rejoicing as industry spreads throughout our little community. But now we face the curious problem of how to defend it all from hungry eyes..."
 
 STL_fortress_city:0 "Our Bunkers"
 STL_fortress_city_desc:0 "We must increase defensive preparations. Only through extreme fortification can we survive the days to come. Anti-air batteries will be constructed to defend our infantry and factories from the skies, and bunkers will be built to protect them at the frontline."

 STL_science_of_future:0 "Our Futuristic Science"
 STL_science_of_future_desc:0 "We must amplify our scientific goals. Through extensive allocation of resources to the hard sciences, we will soon be a center of learning! How does "Starlight University" sound?"

 STL_extract_the_mountain:0 "Our Mountain"
 STL_extract_the_mountain_desc:0 "The great mountain of Zlatogorsk, or Golden Mountain, is full of valuable ores waiting to be tapped. We must take advantage of this!"

 STL_expand_military_production:0 "Our Military Conglomerates"
 STL_expand_military_production_desc:0 "While we may not have the cruel exploitation that is so prevalent under capitalism, we still have designers and engineers eager to do a good job. Giving them the resources they need is a good investment."

 ### FEATHER BANGS

 STL_feather_bangs_wins:0 "Feather Bangs Wins!"
 STL_feather_bangs_wins_desc:0 "Somehow, the musician and heartthrob Feather Bangs has been chosen for the mayorship. With no real political experience, this should be interesting..."

 ### PARTY FAVOR

 STL_party_favor_wins:0 "Party Favor Wins!"
 STL_party_favor_wins_desc:0 "The Severyanian-backed candidate, Party Favor, has won the elections. He will likely align us closer with Stalliongrad, and his challenge will be to preserve our existence while doing so."

 ### DOUBLE DIAMOND

 STL_double_diamond_wins:0 "Double Diamond Wins!"
 STL_double_diamond_wins_desc:0 "Against all odds, the previous mayor Double Diamond has been reelected. Widely considered the longest shot, it seems the old has won out. No one is quite sure what he plans to do now."
 STL_denounce_old_excesses:0 "Denounce Old Excesses"
 STL_denounce_old_excesses_desc:0 "Starlight went way too far, and we have no intention of restoring her extreme measures. There will be no 'people's courts', no reeducation houses, no cutie unmarking. We are better than that. We have to be."
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering:0 "Benevolent Social Engineering"
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering_desc:0 "Social engineering is a loaded, dirty word, but it is nonetheless what we seek to accomplish. We will be the engineers of creature souls, going farther than any left-wing movement before. But we can only do this with the people's consent."
 STL_promise_a_future:0 "Promise a Brighter Future"
 STL_promise_a_future_desc:0 "A bright future awaits us, full of joy and hope, but it is not going to appear on its own. We have to create it, together."
 STL_different_yet_equal:0 "Different Yet Equal"
 STL_different_yet_equal_desc:0 "Everycreature's vote is worth the same, everycreature's life is as important, and everycreature's ability to contribute to our community is as significant. But we're different too. That doesn't make us better or worse, just different. We are equal despite our differences."
 STL_appoint_new_ministers:0 "Reshuffle the Cabinet"
 STL_appoint_new_ministers_desc:0 "Whlie Double Diamond has great respect for his friends, they simply can't do everything at once. With the recent electoral victory, we can finally open up cabinet spots for others who might wish to serve our great Town."
 STL_the_turning_point:0 "The Turning Point"
 STL_the_turning_point_desc:0 "Society has been heavily equalized, and we are ready for our next step. It is time to reveal our true intentions. Double Diamond didn't just win the election for himself, or even for Our Town. He won for Stalliongrad, for Equestria, for Equus, and ultimately for the world. The cause of international equalism must not falter!"
 STL_gearing_up_for_a_vision:0 "Gearing Up for a Vision"
 STL_gearing_up_for_a_vision_desc:0 "Our Town has accompllished in months what Stalliongrad continues to fail to do after over a decade. Bloated with bureaucracy and incompetence and infighting, the Stalliongradians desperately need our help. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_equal_volunteers:0 "Equal Volunteers"
 STL_equal_volunteers_desc:0 "Creatures are joining our cause. The hollow platitudes and incompetence of our foes are driving them to us. We will fight on, not just for them, but for all of us. No matter how absurd the odds seem or how grim things may look, we will win. For an equal world!"
 STL_accelerate_revolutionary_changes:0 "Accelerate Revolutionary Changes"
 STL_accelerate_revolutionary_changes_desc:0 "We must go faster in our implementation of a better world. History does not wait for utopia, and neither can we! We will engineer ourselves into the greatest and freest civilization in the world, together!"
 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad:0 "An Equalist in Stalliongrad"
 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Somehow, Double Diamond pulled it off. Among his cabinet he was widely considered a total lunatic, but he's proven them all wrong. The great equals sign now from Our Town to Stalliongrad to Ourhoof. We have won the war, and now we have to win the peace."
 STL_meet_with_the_left:0 "Meet with the Left"
 STL_meet_with_the_left_desc:0 "The Left of Stalliongrad has been... difficult to work with, but their ultimate goal - immediate revolution to the fullest extent - is something Double Diamond is very sympathetic too. After all, didn't we invade Stalliongrad to save the revolution in its home?"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture:0 "A New Proletarian Culture"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture_desc:0 "'Culture' thus far has been largely bourgeois culture, even in Stalliongrad. Bourgeois liberal nationalism has no place in our new society, and culture must adapt. We will create a culture like none seen before, a true Proletarian Culture!"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions:0 "Accept Cultural Pluralism"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions_desc:0 "While it may not be optimal, the fact is our position is quite tenuous. Immediately forcing everyone to change their culture is extremely optimistic, even for us, and might endanger the revolution as a whole. We can deal with this matter more later."
 STL_our_sacred_war:0 "Our Sacred War"
 STL_our_sacred_war_desc:0 "Seizing Stalliongrad from the city-state of Our Town was a mighty accomplishment, but it will pale in comparison to our future goals. Those future goals will require countless soldiers, sailors, and aviators. While conscription is an ugly thing for a radically liberatory movement, leaving our siblings in chains is even uglier. We will not let them die in slavery!"
 STL_meet_with_the_center:0 "Meet with the Center"
 STL_meet_with_the_center_desc:0 "The Center in Stalliongrad is perhaps the one factino we have the least in common with. Nonetheless, they are similarly committed to democracy and revolution, and they have a large popular backing. With some reassurances that this revolution will maintain collectivization in Stalliongrad, they should be happy to work with us."
 STL_equalize_factory_work:0 "Equalize Factory Work"
 STL_equalize_factory_work_desc:0 "Under Equestrian Socialism, some factories stood above others in importance. This cannot be allowed to continue. The creature crafting a toaster is just as important as the one crafting a tank."
 STL_establish_direct_democracy:0 "Establish Direct Democracy"
 STL_establish_direct_democracy_desc:0 "The greatest error of the Equestrian Socialists is the belief that democratic centralism is democratic enough. Direct democracy must be enshrined as the basis of all politics. While we are not anarchists and do not believe in the abolition of representation entirely, referendums should be the basis of policy. Furthermore, the concept of recalling politicians must be restored to its rightful place. How did the Marksist-Stallionists forget this when it was right in both Marks and Stallion all along?"
 STL_tour_the_nation:0 "Tour the Nation"
 STL_tour_the_nation_desc:0 "Unfortunately, discontent and concern is still high in the Severyanian countryside since the collapse of the Stalliongradian establishment regime. Ponies are afraid we've come to decollectivize, or worse, to take away their cutie marks. The time has come for Double Diamond to go on a tour across the country, to answer questions and quell fears."
 STL_new_equal_friends:0 "New Equal Friends"
 STL_new_equal_friends_desc:0 "To limit ourselves to the borders of Equestria, or even to ponykind, is patently absurd. Equality transcends nation and culture. Why wouldn't it transcend species too? We are in a position to share our beautiful future with all the peoples of Equus. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship:0 "End of the Mayorship"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship_desc:0 "The institution of Mayor was appropriate for the city-state of Our Town, but now we are running a nation-state. The time has come for the office to be abolished, and replaced with a more suitable head of state. Premier will work for the state office, and for the Stalliongradian Equalist Party, General Secretary."
 STL_our_nuclear_program:0 "Our Nuclear Program"
 STL_our_nuclear_program_desc:0 "What would have seemed comical several years ago is now manifest reality. Nuclear power will let us break the shackles of global capitalism and hierarchy. But will it be cheap power to undermine their plutocratic empires, or will it be the atomic hammer to smash their armies? Only time will tell."
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold:0 "Bring the Yaks into the Fold"
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The yaks have known war and strife, with xenophobia and isolationism driving a wedge into their harmonic monarchy. Unfortunately, the local communists are no better than the isolationists or warlords! We march into Yakyakistan to free all yaks from their chains, no matter what color the chain-forgers may wear!"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse:0 "Unitary but Diverse"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse_desc:0 "Even as we reject federalization and local autonomy, we acknowledge that we are a vastly diverse revolution. Eradicating racism, nationalism, and other blights that divide the workers will take time, but we have the unstoppable force of will on our side!"
 STL_meet_with_the_right:0 "Meet with the Right"
 STL_meet_with_the_right_desc:0 "The Right Opposition's domestic values are superficially similar to ours, believing in multiparty democracy along with increased power to the people and away from the bureaucrats. Unfortunately, their foreign policy is hopelessly timid. Still, there's enough here to find common ground on. Perhaps we can all get along after all?"
 STL_invade_nova:0 "Invade Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invade_nova_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia has seen great strife, and sadly we must add to that strife. The people of Nova Griffonia are crying out for aid, and it falls to us to save them from their tyrants in their houses of gold."
 STL_invite_nova:0 "Invite Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invite_nova_desc:0 "While Redtail is hardly a paragon of Equalist values, he is probably close enough. With Stalliongrad now under our control, perhaps he will be willing to be accommodating? Stallion's right-hoof griffon could be a great ally..."
 STL_strike_the_penguins:0 "At the Top of the World"
 STL_strike_the_penguins_desc:0 "The penguins live in a distant land, but even it is not outside of our reach. If we are to achieve our dream, they will have to work with us, one way or another."
 STL_the_speech:0 "The Speech"
 STL_the_speech_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Our proud flag flies high over a sizable chunk of the continent. And now, storm clouds are rising in the East. If we are to finish our sacred revolutionary mission, we will have to decide what to do about Equestria and the Changeling Lands. While Equestria would no doubt balk at working with us, war does make strange bedfellows. Of course, we could try to fight them both..."
 STL_the_new_living_organism:0 "The New Living Superorganism"
 STL_the_new_living_organism_desc:0 "Every creature in our society is part of something greater than themselves. A superorganism is forming, forming out of all of us. Meditation and group activity will bind us together even tighter."
 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments:0 "Begin the Friendship Project"
 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments_desc:0 "We are doing something today that's never been done before. Something even a great revolutionary like Steel Stallion was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like we do. The lessons we've learned here in Our Town have taught us well. We have proven that we're ready."
 STL_design_a_new_religion:0 "Design a New Religion"
 STL_design_a_new_religion_desc:0 "The Marksist rejection of faith entirely, while understandable, loses a valuable unifying element. Faith can be a powerful motivator. The problem is that faith, thus far, has been a tool of capital and of other hierarchy. Therefore, we will create a new equal faith, passionate and liberatory, to underly our vision of a free future."
 STL_glorify_labor:0 "Glorify Labor"
 STL_glorify_labor_desc:0 "Under capitalism, labor is exploited, and so many workers think work is bad. Nothing could be further from the truth! In labor is found glory. The work of crafting, this is a mighty, noble task! Under Equestrian Socialism, labor is less exploited, but still is not the worker's own. Anarchism, social democracy, syndicalism--none of these can truly free the worker! But under the great equals sign, all become one!"
 STL_agrarian_kindness:0 "Agrarian Kindness"
 STL_agrarian_kindness_desc:0 "We are not fanatical industrialists, who see the world only as a list of resources to be exploited. The pastoral, agrarian life is one as noble as that of the factory worker. The Marksists prioritized the industrial proletariat at the expense of the peasantry. We will roll out modern agricultural equipment across all farming regions of our nation, through Machine Tractor Stations!"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability:0 "From Each According to their Ability"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability_desc:0 "The army is seldom an ally of revolution, being full of nationalists and warmongers. After all, when we prevail, there will be no more war, and they will all be out of a job! But under the right circumstances, equalists and soldiers can march side by side. And the great Red Army of Stalliongrad is a perfect example of that cooperation. We will learn from them."
 STL_a_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
 STL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of Our Town was suitable for a city-state, but not a nation-state. But the basic ideas - multiparty democracy where any leftist can compete, centring the councils over the legislature, and recalling all state and party officials at any time - will persevere. People in our revolution are the basis of all politics, and that will never change."
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life:0 "Guarantee a Good Life"
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life_desc:0 "Life under capitalism is miserable, as we all know. Under Equestrian Socialism it is far better, but still not good enough. The most important aspect of Equalist doctrine is the welfare of the people, which must always take primacy over other goals. However, we must be careful not to turn into an isolationist enclave--the peoples of other lands need to be liberated too!"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year:0 "Elections Thrice a Year"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year_desc:0 "Aside from the ability to recall officials, the term of office must be short to prevent conservatism. 120-day terms are suitably short."
 STL_the_new_coalition:0 "The New Coalition"
 STL_the_new_coalition_desc:0 "Thus far, Double Diamond's party has not ruled alone. Party Favor's Our Town Communist Party and Night Glider's Society for Equality of All Creatures have been our junior partners. While we will not turn our back on these old friends, the Severyanian Communist Party and the newly-formed Socialist Revolutionaries of Equus are eager to work with us as well. Why shouldn't we cooperate?"
 STL_truly_fair_voting:0 "Truly Fair Voting"
 STL_truly_fair_voting_desc:0 "Simply putting a voting booth in every town and commune is not good enough. Election Day will be a national holiday and internal administrative divisions will be redrawn to be more representative. This will upset some conservative voices, but we must let everyone's vote count the same."
 STL_with_justice_for_all:0 "With Justice for All"
 STL_with_justice_for_all_desc:0 "The role of justice is to heal and rehabilitate, not to punish. THe barbaric practice of execution will end, as well overly-long prison sentences."
 STL_save_equestria:0 "Save Equestria"
 STL_save_equestria_desc:0 "We may not see eye to eye on everything, but the Equestrians are still vastly better than Chrysalis. Allying with them is not only the right thing to do, it is necessary for the survival of the revolution at all."
 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs:0 "Chrysalis in our Crosshairs"
 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs_desc:0 "We have no quarrel with the changeling people, and we weep for every life we must take. But Chrysalis is a mad conqueror devoted to the destruction of everything other than her own insane ambition. We will not let this tyrant continue to oppress Equus!"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation:0 "Salvage our International Reputation"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation_desc:0 "Our invasions of Northern Equus have given us quite a bit of infamy worldwide, even as we strove to free and liberate the peoples there. Many harmonist nations are still hesitant to sell us vital resources. We should reassure them that these wars were necessary to save the creatures there, just as this war with Chrysalis is."
 STL_friends_again:0 "Friends Once More"

 STL_war_plan_equality:0 "War Plan Equality"
 STL_war_plan_equality_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Equestria will never be willing to implement liberatory policies. Caramel Marks learned that when Celestia rejected her proposal. We will just have to invade the rest of the continent at once. Some will say that is impossible, but we already defeated Stalliongrad as a city-state. We will prevail."
 STL_ultra_industrialization:0 "Ultra-Industrialization"
 STL_ultra_industrialization_desc:0 "Factory work is a glorious affair, and out of it comes countless benefits both internal and external. But for this coming war, we will require a grim number of arms factories. Our troops must be well-equipped to prevail!"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality:0 "The Lockstep Legions of Equality"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality_desc:0 "Equality goes beyond a philosophy. It is the next stage of socialism! Dialectical materialism fails because it puts material conditions above creatures' willpower. Nothing is impossible for a sufficiently motivated creature."
 STL_the_final_steps:0 "The Final Steps"
 STL_the_final_steps_desc:0 "A simultaneous invasion of Equestria and the Changelings will require countless supply trucks, as well as a heavy mechanized spearhead. Production will be increased accordingly, as the people's will drives us forward!"

 STL_renegotiate_with_equestria:0 "The Finer Details"
 STL_renegotiate_with_equestria_desc:0 "In our liberation campaign, we have... stepped on a few hooves. Equestria is not very happy about our vast expansionism, and many Equestrians fear that we may have them in our crosshairs. While we certainly do diplomatically, a war between our nations would be catastrophic. The revolution will come peacefully to Equestria, not militarily." 
 STL_sweep_everything_else:0 "Sweep the Holdouts"

 STL_proclaim_the_end_of_history_desc:0 "At long last, history is coming to an end. As Marks laid out, everypony will be united as never before. The creature-being is upon us, and with it, the end of oppression, cruelty, tyranny,and fear, and the final stage of leftism as a whole!"

 STL_sb_sideline_stg_desc:0 "We are not Stalliongrad. One would think this was obvious, but there are those among us who would sell us out to those across the border. Let us be rid of these traitors, and the Stalliongradian influence they brought with them."

 STL_sugar_belle_stg_exiles_desc:0 "Many good ponies have been displaced by the new Severyanian regime on the basis of their political beliefs during the "revolution", and even afterwards the trickle of escapees has never fully dried up. The Town shall give them shelter, jobs and a new goal."

 STL_new_constituent_desc:0 "With all of the new laws, policies and amendments created in the transitional period of our Grand Republic, a consolidating document seems like a necessity.

 starlight.1.t:0 "Our Cozy Little Meeting"
 starlight.1.d:0 "As noon broke over the idyllic Town, hundreds of stallions and mares flocked to the small, neat building tucked in the middle of the peaceful settlement. Inside, congregating together and out towards the public were five ponies, all with remarkably different appearances and goals. In the center, with a gentle appearance befitting a mail-stallion rather than a mayor, was the soft-spoken Double Diamond. To his left was the red-headed baker known as Sugar Belle, a harmonic socialist mare who blended the two usually-conflicting ideologies together into something she believed would work - something notably more sympathetic to Equestria. To his right was the sharp-haired mare known as Night Glider, the Town's local aviator and collector of used planes who practiced Utopian Socialism - an old form decried by modern communists, but one that would perhaps fit better in the quiet streets of the Town.\n\nOn the far ends were the two representatives most of the Town wasn't particularly fond of, at least when it came to their beliefs. Party Favor, the curly-haired charismatic balloon-maker, stood on the podium dressed in full Stalliongrad garb, shamelessly displaying his ideology. Wrapping around to the other side was finally Feather Bangs, the Town's local celebrity and talk of the town, appearing not nearly as professionally as the rest, but still holding a sort of young stallion's pop flare to them; a capitalist at heart, he was sympathetic enough to the equalist cause to be elected into the council, though his desire to attract Nova Griffonian investment is seldom mentioned, even if he believed it to be a good idea.\n\n"Thank you one and all for attending this meeting." Double Diamond softly spoke, the lull of his voice snapping the attention of the sleepy crowd. "I would like to start by saying that we have gone far ever since Starlight's saddening hypocrisy was revealed, but I am certain that we can go much farther." There was a strong will behind that voice, masked by a pleasant and kind tone. "For the equalist cause, there is nothing we can't all overcome, together!"
 starlight.1.a:0 "The applause was silent; but as one joined another, it was soon enough a chorus."
 starlight.1.b:0 "Ponies shifted awkwardly in their seats, awaiting the saner speakers to continue."


 starlight.2.t:0 "Feather Takes the Spotlight"
 starlight.2.d:0 "Feather Bangs rubbed his hoofs together. This was it. This was the day. This was where the slick city boy would go out and make a splash on the big scene. Well, it wasn't the big scene - he wasn't an actor prancing around in Canterlot, but this was... this was better than that! There was something more to this than just hitting on girls and relying on his melodic voice to swoon the crowd. His crowd wouldn't be gawking teenagers, but worried adults, hoping and hoping they'd listen to something that wasn't the drivel Starlight fed them all those years back. He'd be better than that!\n\nHe looked over the crowd in front of him. The town hall gathered again just for him, and there was a bigger crowd than he anticipated. He could see tired eyes, not particularly interested in his swagger and his modern hairstyle, but the politics he'd bring to the table. A deep breath coursed through his lungs. He could do this. Fake it 'til you make it, he thought; a mantra he had since his high school days.\n\n"What is up, everypony?" He asked, a bright smile on his face as he looked over the crowd. "I know we're all pretty bummed out about what's been going on in our town, and honestly, you're right, it sucks." Keep going, Feather, keep that momentum up. "But it doesn't have to be like that! Have you guys looked out at what the rest of the world is doing while we were busy suckin' up to Starlight and getting our marks removed? They've been gettin' modernized and stuff! Meanwhile, we've been too afraid of pushing past equalism to get with the times." A spike of anxiety. Feather swallowed, hoping no one would notice. "Maybe it sounds crazy, but I want to try what they do. All that capitalism stuff, about bringing in wealth and businesses and letting everyone do the thing they're good at - why not? Is that really so bad?\n\nFeather exhaled, watching the crowd closely and nervously. He expected silence, or even booing, but instead..."
 starlight.2.a:0 "Confused yet intrigued murmurs breached the crowd. Something new, something... good?"

 
 starlight.3.t:0 "A Party in Our Oblast"
 starlight.3.d:0 ""Hi, everyone!" Party Favor began strong. Though many eyed him oddly for wearing an entire Stalliongrad costume, with more than a few rumors that he was taken away and brainwashed by Stalliongrad agents or something as ridiculous as that, it was undeniable that most people liked him quite a lot. He made balloons! What wasn't there to love? Well... whenever he started going off about theory, probably.\n\n"I'm so glad you could all come to my speech today. The elections are coming up soon, and I suppose it's my job to try and convince you to vote for me!" He said, giving a short laugh. "That's just how it is! Now, let's get into the important stuff." He cleared his throat, and pointed a hoof towards the roof of the ceiling.\n\n"Gentlemares and stallions alike, we've got a growing to-be superpower right below our town! And I'll be honest, I think they've got some great ideas we could borrow from them. Do you know how they work? They've got a group of ponies that debate each other but all work together for the collective. Kind of like equalism, but there's enough smart ponies in there to prevent any silly ideas from running about the place!" It seemed like Party Favor had brushed up on his way to interest the crowd in communist theory, because now, they were listening.\n\n"And they're all about catching up to industry and infrastructure! Sure, we might not be nearly as big as they are, but shoot, if we were making progress half as fast as they were, we'd be having pie parties every day, not just every month! I know, I know, it sounds hard to believe, but here's one little nugget of truth I'll leave you with: if we become good friends with Stalliongrad, we'll have a big, nice state protecting us and giving us huge avenues of trade! They might ask for things like Marksist collectivization and a vanguard party, but if it's worked for them, you bet it'll work for us too!"
 starlight.3.a:0 "While most didn't really know a thing about Marksist theory, it did sound appealing..."


 starlight.4.t:0 "Double Diamond's Double Time Speech"
 starlight.4.d:0 "Rather than climbing up to a podium and holding a speech in the town hall, Double Diamond had decided to stay true to his principles and instead speak right outside the building, on the steps to it, a symbolic gesture. Everyone knew that he was Starlight's right-hoof mane, but at the same time, he was one of the first to oust her. Yet he still held a firm belief in equalism, and there was a sort of undeniable zealous passion whenever he spoke about it, if not a little on the disturbingly energetic side.\n\n"Friends of Our Town," Double Diamond began, head held high and confident, "I urge all of you to look at how tragically little we've done in the years that have passed since Starlight left. We were all afraid of equalism, and what bad things it could do to us. But Starlight's Equalism was a far cry from what it can be! Equality isn't about removing our cutie marks, and removing who we are. It's about making sure we're all working towards a better future. It's about no one being left behind, and no pony having the ability to exploit another!" Double Diamond was firm in his words, and though some ponies still held suspicion that this would simply be a repeat, many more knew Double Diamond was honest - unlike Starlight. He truly believed in the cause.\n\n"So I ask you, personally, not as some sort of ruler, figurehead, or party leader, but as a friend to another friend." Double Diamond smiled at the quiet crowd. "Give equalism another chance. There was a silver lining in some of the things Starlight said, even if it was ultimately a charade. I truly, honestly think that seeing it realized - the real equalism - will give everypony a chance to be happy and healthy!""
 starlight.4.a:0 "You can't doubt his honesty, at least."


 starlight.5.t:0 "Night Glider Takes the Lead" # HISTORICAL
 starlight.5.d:0 "After every speech before the crowd of towncreatures always came a smaller, more private meeting just between the members of the council. They were sometimes productive, but with the encroaching elections of the mayor they were becoming more tense and broody, and the latest one seemed to be no exception. However, Night Glider was determined to change that.\n\n"Friends!" She began talking excitedly, hovering above her chair. "I know the last months have been hard for us, and I know that we don’t think alike on lots of topics. But do you remember when times were different? When all of us - no, everyone in Our Town - struggled to make this place work? We made something here because we stayed together and persevered. There is a foundation of something beautiful, achieved by our hooves! The Town can become a true beacon of hope and equality for every creature across Equus, maybe even across the whole world, but only under one condition: the divisions in this room must end. No matter who gets the office, all of us must help them." She paused, observing the room, before finishing the speech with a question. "Are you with me?"\n\nFeather Bangs was the first to nod eagerly, charmed by the enthusiasm so rarely found in the show business industry. Sugar Belle and Double Diamond, both quite tired of fighting and agreeing with Glider, if for somewhat different reasons, joined next, and even Party Favor, seeing his "non-ideological comrades" in consensus, decided to not add a remark regarding the necessity of class struggle. For the first time in a while the council was in accord, and maybe a leader was already ascending among them."
 starlight.5.a:0 "Her vision will save Our Town!"

 starlight.6.t:0 "A Cherry Blossom in a Field of Rye"
 starlight.6.d:0 "In a grassy clearing just outside Our Town, two ponies sat together on a picnic blanket. One of them was a pink unicorn mare, the other a large red stallion. The chilly evening air didn't seem to bother them as they looked lovingly into each other's eyes.\n\n"Today's campaign speech went really well," said Sugar Belle, "Don't you think?"\n"Eeyup." replied Big Mac.\nSugar Belle smiled and looked towards the town.\n\n"Those ponies were very skeptical at first," she continued, "and I was so nervous I nearly shook, but in the end I think I got through to them. They're starting to understand that friendship and harmony doesn't mean the return of inequality and exploitation. If we keep at it I think I can win this race, and then once I'm the mayor we'll really have to start..."\n\nShe paused, noticing Big Mac's frown.\n"You still don't like that I'm running for mayor, do you?"\n"Nope." he replied, his voice full of concern.\nSugar Belle put her hooves around his neck.\n\n"I know you think things up here are awfully dangerous, and I know you wish I had taken that apprenticeship with Mrs. Cake in Ponyville, but I can't just leave. This is my home, and these ponies are my friends. I have to show them that there's a better way to live. I'd never forgive myself if I ran away in their time of need."\n\n"I know." Big Mac said with a sigh.\n\n"Don't worry," Sugar Belle said excitedly, "no matter what happens I promise we'll be together. You've given me so much help already, and I'll need you even more if I become mayor. It's your love that keeps me going, it inspires me. Other ponies deserve to be as happy as we are."\n\nAs the sun started to dip beyond the horizon, the two ponies shared a kiss."
 starlight.6.a:0 "Friendship and love are in the air."

 starlight.10.t:0 "The Future of Our Town"
 starlight.10.d:0 "The quiet city, normally withdrawn and peaceful with its day-to-day-activities, became abuzz with ponies up and active from practically every corner, signing off their votes, encouraging voters to choose a certain future leader, or doing the vote counting. Talk of the election winner was all that dominated conversation, and the turnout was truly staggering, with several election ballots having long queues from the sheer quantity of energetic ponies voting. Once the election was over, the process of counting began - something that kept thousands of ponies up throughout the night in sheer anticipation. Yet, as morning came, the news broke, and the people held their breath.\n\nWho had won?"
 starlight.10.a:0 "Feather Bangs and Prosperity!"
 starlight.10.b:0 "Party Favor and the Immortal Science!"
 starlight.10.c:0 "Double Diamond and Equality!"
 starlight.10.e:0 "Night Glider and Utopia!"
 starlight.10.f:0 "Sugar Belle and Friendship!"



 starlight.12.t:0 "The Town Anthem"
 starlight.12.d:0 "A public debate in the town hall raged between the five Town leaders on a contentious, all-important topic. Which anthem would represent the Town best? It seemed like there was no end to the discussion as each shared their options. "Starlight's song, though it misled us at first, I believe still holds a good message to aspire to." Double Diamond said. "For all the pain it may have caused, we can take that power back into our hands! Of course, not everything would stay, but the core is still the same. We're all meant to be happy here!"\n\nParty Favor cut in with a polite clearing of his throat. "That is absolutely true, but I would say that the Internationale is a perfect song for the common creature. Have you ever sung it? It's beautiful! I'd say it'd bring a tear to the working pony's eye, and I'd want all of us to be reminded that we fight for our rights every day, just like we are right now." He gave the crowd a beaming smile, but Night Glider glared at him.\n\n"Come on, Party Favor, can't you give an idea that isn't part and parcel from Stalliongrad? Workers of the world have their own song! It's called the United Front Song!" She said. "And I'd say it's got a better tune than the Internationale." She added in. Party Favor gave her a very disappointed look, but she only returned a smug smile.\n\n"All this fluffing up is just silly, I'd say. What about The Heart Carol? I think it's perfect not just for ponykind, but especially for us!" Sugar Belle's smile to the crowd was pleasant and reserved, unlike Party Favor's. "It warms your heart and makes you remember all the friends and family you've got supporting you."\n\nThe black horse out of this entire debate was Feather Bangs. He frankly had no idea what to add in. The closest thing he could wrack his brain was his hit single "Cutie", but... no one really seemed to take it seriously, so he opted to skip his turn to speak whenever it came up, to his muted embarrassment."
 starlight.12.a:0 "Life is so grand in Our Town, we're always filled with cheer..."
 starlight.12.b:0 "Arise ye prisoners of starvation, arise ye wretched of the earth..."
 starlight.12.c:0 "March on in the Workers' United Front for you are a worker too!"
 starlight.12.e:0 "As dawn shines on us every morn, the Fire of Friendship is reborn..."


 starlight.13.t:0 "The Army Budget"
 starlight.13.d:0 "With the clear abstaining of Night Glider (citing that "she really doesn't care about land combat"), only four were left on their podiums to discuss another major aspect of the Town's budget. Though the army was miniscule... practically non-existent... most considered it a worthy cause to argue about. Feather Bangs had started with a thundering proclamation that the Town would use tanks to roll over anycreature who wanted to strip away the Town's freedom - a bold claim that received odd stares and confused huh's from everyone else, though there was some mild approval here and there.\n\n"A gun in every soldier's hooves is the first thing you need to protect yourself!" Double Diamond spoke. "What else comes first before that? We want to all come together, then everypony bravely helping protect our community will need the best firearms they can get their hooves on." He said, nodding to himself.\n\n"The best guns won't do you any good if you keel over before you get it!" Sugar Belle said, irritated by how short-sighted Double Diamond seemed. "What about everything before that? The radio, the hospital? Keeping the actual gun in check? All of that's important too, you know."\n\n"And none of that," Party Favor began, "matters if you've got big enough guns to blow your enemies up skyhigh. I don't mean like a rifle, no, I mean like an artillery piece! I've seen a couple in action when I was in Stalliongrad, and let me tell you people: just a couple of those, and you'll never have to fear a reactionary coming your way!"
 starlight.13.a:0 "The infantrycreature must be our first concern!"
 starlight.13.b:0 "With big guns, we're blow the reactionaries away!"
 starlight.13.c:0 "Hospitals can save our injured and sick!"
 starlight.13.e:0 "Tanks will punch through the enemy lines!"


 starlight.14.t:0 "The Annual Sunset Festival"
 starlight.14.d:0 "Perhaps the most unpleasant debate of the hour was about the Sunset Festival. That day, it was just Party Favor and Sugar Belle arguing on who would be the one to organize it - and the air quickly turned uncomfortable and borderline hostile.\n\n"If you got the keys to the Festival, all you would do is just put up the Stalliongrad flag everywhere! All hammers and sickles and reds, don't you have any other color scheme?!" Sugar Belle asked. "The Festival has no right to be so ideological! It's just about celebrating us - our Town, we as people. Why does it have to be some platform for your Marksism thing?"\n\n"Because it's in our lifeblood, Sugar Belle!" Party Favor replied, his normally cheerful demeanor having dropped to a carefully irritated one. "I'm not saying the Festival would just be about Marksism-Stallionism, but yes, I would include it. It's part of our liberation. It's the worker's ideology, and even if you hate that word, Stalliongrad shows every day why that's true!"\n\n"Is that all it is?" Sugar Belle asked, growing restless. "Stalliongrad this, Stalliongrad that - we're not their puppet!" There was disappointment in her eyes. Party Favor frowned. "The Festival will be just fine without having their banner painted on every street. We'll celebrate things our Town is known for. Not what some other country is doing."\n\nParty Favor sighed. "That's the kind of naivety I'd expect from you, Sugar Belle." The both of them exchanged glances, both disappointed and angry, as the crowd was left to sort out who would lead the festival."
 starlight.14.a:0 "Party Favor is right - you can't forget the struggle."

While he did attempt to hold an impromptu speech about how they had it all wrong and that they needed to give him a chance, a tomato had struck him in the face, stunning him for long enough so that some ponies wrangled him and, quite literally, booted him out of office.\n\nIn a display of impatience and uncertainty, however, as nobody knew what would happen after Double Diamond's forced resignation, a crowd of ponies approached a pony who happened to be walking by that day next to the town hall, accosting him and demanding to know his political expertise. Claiming to be a tailor by the name of Burlap, they had asked him if he was willing to become Our Town's next mayor, to which he gave an anxious shrug. The crowd decided that that was as good a sign as any, and promptly shoved him into the town hall to be appointed as mayor."

 double_diamond.14.d:0 "Double Diamond was not a pony who loved giving speeches, but today's occasion warranted one. He glanced across the table, to his old friends, and began. "My comrades, we have a grave problem on our doorstep. Even as we continue to refine the theory and practice of equalism and the broader movement of revolutionary liberation, our neighbors in Stalliongrad choke under the stifling weight of bureaucracy. How can we speak to international camaraderie when our own so-called friend has fallen so far from the spirit of 995? Stallion was a flawed leader already, but he'd be sickened if he saw what happened to his beloved revolution!"\n\nParty Favor shifted uncomfortably as Double Diamond continued. "The Left Opposition, the Right Opposition, the Center - they're all lost! None of them understand the true mission! Our goal, the sacred goal of Celestia, Marks, Angel, Stallion, and Glimmer, has always been to liberate all the creatures of the world through the abolition of hierarchy and the establishment of true peoples' democracy. But the bureaucracy suffocates the people in endless forms and papers, inserting the state into every aspect of society!" As Night Glider motioned to interject, Double Diamond unleashed his bombshell. "We cannot abide such an anti-populist stain upon the name of socialism! That is why, my friends, we must launch an IMMEDIATE INVASION OF STALLIONGRAD!"\n\nThe room exploded into shouts of shock and indignation. Feather Bangs was white as a ghost, and Sugar Belle looked about to faint. Night Glider cried, "Double Diamond, have you lost your mind!? Stalliongrad is easily ten times stronger than us, maybe twenty!"\n\n"They've only ever been good to us!" Party Favor protested. "Turning against them would be like a foal betraying their parents!"\n\nDouble Diamond sighed. "Yes, I know it will be difficult, and it will be controversial. We are outmatched militarily, industrially, and politically, and many ponies see Stalliongrad as our friends. But we have something the red bureaucrats lost a decade ago: a fully mobilized, revolutionary populace. A populace ready to march into Tartarus itself to break the chains of the people. As for its necessity? Look at what the red bureaucrats did to the revolution. And I know there is absolutely nothing that can stop a sufficiently determined pony, and I believe that we, the great commune of Our Town, have that determination." As the others stared in disbelief, he paused. "But to find out, we'll have to hold a referendum. Only if the people want war will I declare it.""

As he took the podium before the Supreme Soviet, there was a fire in his eyes few grasped. He took a deep breath, and began. "The harmonists are fond of saying that history arcs towards friendship, and in that they are correct. Cruel methods of rule such as absolute monarchy, serfdom, and secret police are on their way out, historically speaking. But where the harmonists make an error is believing they are the true heralds of friendship. I ask, what friendship is there between even a benevolent President-Marshal and a common factory worker, or a Princess and a peasant? What friendship can there be, indeed ever, between those with different access to power? If you are subordinate to another, you are not their friend--you are their vassal."\n\nHis eyes narrowed. "And for too long, the forces--the true forces--of friendship have sat idle, the province of children and childlike dreamers. For all her faults, Starlight Glimmer dared to dream of a better way, just as Caramel Marks did before her, and moreover she dared to make that dream a reality. What we are building here in Our Stalliongrad goes beyond the simple socialized economy of our predecessors, beyond the wildest dreams of the utopians of Equestria, and even beyond what Caramel Marks herself only dared to hint at as the creature-being." A grin split his face, even as he started to feel lightheaded. "What we are building, my friends, is nothing less than the ultimate culmination of friendship itself!

It waved beautifully, and he had no doubt this was their destiny... but what did it mean? As the vision faded, he awoke to his friends standing over him worriedly. "Are you alright, Double Diamond?" Night Glider asked.\n\nHe got to his hooves, uneasily. "Yes, urgh... my speech..." He brushed his friends' worries aside, and retook the podium.\n\n"As I was saying, soon history will prove us to be not merely socialists, but the vanguard of friendship itself. And that starts here, now. True peoples' democracy! Government comprehensible to its citizens! Solidarity among every people and every culture! A world where none is exploited, and none is exploiter! As the continent burns under the mad dreams of reactionary conquest, the time has come to take a stand for what is right. For true friendship, for true harmony, for true equality, and for the unimaginably bright future that awaits us. That is why, my friends, I have decided to ask your help in a great endeavor." At last, he hesitated. He had come here to urge the Supreme Soviet to vote for joining the continent-splitting war.

Of course, Night Glider’s passion and appeals to the spirit of the community had carried her to victory in the polls, but now, when the rush of excitement of the elections has subsided, citizens were eager to get more details on the promised "utopia".\n\nNight Glider had been carefully preparing a series of appearances addressing various subjects, but one of the key lessons she had learned in her aviation days was certain: without a proper take off, one’s skills in the air did not matter. She crossed the assembled crowd, waving and smiling in response to the cheers and hoorays, while counting down from five hundred in her head. As the numbers reached single digits, she came up on the podium, and finally, after a resounding "zero" started to talk. She spoke of the future, of erasing the societal lines between creatures of different class and race, of opening the Town up for all who might need it, of new language and better welfare, and, most importantly, of the power to bring the change and be that change.\n\nWith last words still echoing in the air, she looked at the ponies before her with hope, and this hope was not misplaced: they listened, maybe skeptical about some aspects and confused about the others, but they listened nonetheless, and were ready to try it together, for their friend."

 night_glider.2.d:0 "It was morning, and Ponder Prism, who preferred to be everywhere a bit early, yawned and looked out of the window of his small food shop set up on the edge of the Town. A mountain road with a rail line running in parallel was well-visible from his vantage point, and following years of working here Ponder Prism learned the schedule of trains and buses rather well. Naturally, they were not always on-time, but guessing the delays was one of the few available amusements before the start of the day.\n\nSuddenly, the shopkeeper noticed something peculiar: a group of creatures was coming up the road. The fact that they were on hooves, or rather on paws, was unusual as Our Town had been seeing few tourists following Starlight Glimmer’s exile, but the travelers themselves were even stranger. Ponder Prism had met griffons such as one leading the group, but had only heard stories about their followers. Three were penguins, much smaller, but also winged, and the other two were massive bears, carrying suitably gargantuan packs. Judging by the size of the luggage, these were no tourists: mayor Glider’s policies seemed to be getting results.\n\nPonder Prism continued to gaze at the caravan with hesitation: the idea of welcomeness sounded nice, sure, he even voted for Night Glider, but he expected the new settlers to be ponies. After all, this was a pony place. Yet, as the group came closer, more parts of the mayor’s latest speech re-emerged in his mind. "Be the change", she said, and he promised himself to try. Circling around the counter, he came up closer to the entrance, tapped the glass door, attracting the attention of the griffon and flipped the sign."

 night_glider.3.t:0 "A New Town Underway"
 night_glider.3.d:0 "Despite living and working on the outskirts of the Town, Ponder Prism had always enjoyed a trot to the city center. He grew to like the mix of the equalist design, with streets made up by similar-looking buildings and arranged in a simple pattern, and the small touches the inhabitants of these dwellings added after the "cutie unmarking" was reversed: a pot with daffodils here, a star mural there, an odd-colored roof tilings to replace a row struck by lightning, all told a little story, but shared the same heart.\n\nIt was easy to predict that with the influx of new citizens this order would be disrupted, but Ponder Prism was still disappointed. Even now, after the significant part of the construction had been completed and the reshaped core of the city had shaken off the scaffolding, he just did not feel the same connection to the assembly of varied houses, designed by different creatures, for different creatures. The Provisional Commissar for Renovations, Rocky Storm, did a fine job making it fit together, using wooden covering inspired by "charmingly rustic Skynavian designs" according to the local paper, but something dear was missing.\n\n"Excuse me, friend." A striped horse - no, a zebra! - passed the lost in thought pony and entered a painted archway to their right. A sign atop it read "Ama-zeebian Corner". Although Ponder Prism did not get the pun, he could smell a very attractive sweet and spicy aroma stemming from the cafe and feel the rumbling stomach reminding him of the need for dinner. After a short session of internal decision making, he followed after the zebra: indeed, if the change was here, one would be dull not to try its benefits."

"Certain words and grammatical constructions must be avoided in the official documentation of our commune. Yes, this includes 'fillies and gentlecolts', as noted in the provided guideline booklet. Any other questions?"\n\nThe current target of her frustration, a member of the Infrastructure Committee, raised a hoof again. "I just wanted to clarify that I was going to use the phrase for a poster in a flat block with pony and horse population. Had no intention to offend our citizens."\n\nOffbeat sighed and took a second to regain some composure. There was nothing wrong with the genuine attempt to understand, and her job was to facilitate acceptance of the mayor's reform on all levels so she resumed her speech more softly. "I’m sorry, Duct Stream, I didn't mean to imply that you had. Your poster is about plumbing renovations, correct? The underlying rule is simple: if your content does not depend on race, do not mention it. We want to facilitate the sense of unity and acceptance in the Town. The sooner we stop using such forms of address altogether, the sooner it will become a norm - just as few years ago it became the norm to not highlight whether one arrived from Baltimare or Las Pegasus or Konzan.""

Ponder Prism was hardly what one might call a sociologist, particularly a learned one, but this time in his life turned out to be most delightful nonetheless.\n\nWhat started for him as gawking at strange arrivals and trying unfamiliar food, with a bit of effort, courage and warmth transformed into connections, both with those who lived alongside Ponder Prism for years, and, naturally, with the recent neighbors. On his activity list were parties, political meetings, mountain tours, cooking workshops, reading groups and more, some of which he had never imagined himself trying. Another thing he had hardly expected was the success of his shop: the stream of newcomers showed no evidence of exhausting any time soon, and thanks to a friend adept at hoof painting Ponder Prism was attracting the weary travelers with a big sign, helpfully translated into a few languages. He even had to hire an assistant.\n\n"Last train before opening, chief!" Allen, the second employee of "Ponderous Foods", tapped his claw on the window overlooking a road and a rail line running in parallel. "How are those vegetables looking? Need any help?"

Since the days of election, he had clearly been taking effort to refine his oratory skills, but also drifting away. In fact, their whole small group was becoming separated, with duties interfering with availability, and political agendas coloring splinters of time spent together. She was hoping to invite Party Favor for dinner after the assembly, but now Night Glider was rather unsure about whether he will accept, and, sadly, about whether she wanted to have him.\n\nMeanwhile, her debate opponent continued. "I would also like to extend a general invitation for a series of lectures in the Red Brick House on history and revolutionary struggle, with the next event tomorrow at six." He glanced towards Night Glider for the first time during the speech, flashing a subtle smile: she almost missed it, and almost dropped the facade when she got it. "Still, I would like to finish on a positive note. The tireless work of the mayoral office and comrade mayor herself deserves praise where it is due: we must welcome the assertive action which has been undertaken and strive to bring the desired change.

 night_glider.7.d:0 "During her time as the leader of the New Hope Commune, Night Glider had become rather accustomed to giving speeches about her plans for improving the lives of everyone who found refuge in the Town. However, creating one designed to brush her own mane or praise the administration was an entirely different thing. Did she do enough to deserve it? Would the attending creatures agree? If the goal was to impress the citizens and lift their spirits, surely there could be a more practical way to achieve it? The council and her advisors insisted that a public address would be the best option.\n\nAnother tidbit of old flying school wisdom came to her mind: the take-off is optional, the landing is mandatory. Standing on her comfortably familiar podium, Night Glider took a deep breath, exhaled, pushing out the last bit of nervousness, and started to talk, not about the achievements in industry or the advantages of political transparency, but about the fates turned around by the commune, taking examples from the reports she got as well as her actual experiences during rare days-off.\n\nThe message was simple, but it resonated with the audience fiercely. Veterans of Starlight Glimmer’s experiment, newcomers disillusioned with their previous existence, even outright exiles, all felt the positive change Night Glider’s reforms brought. They knew that they took part in laying the foundation of this society, be it by hoof, wing, claw or paw, and its success was their success. After her closing remarks, outlying the continuation and support of the started projects, the cheering echoed far across the mountains, and one of the voices in the celebrating roar belonged to the mayor herself."

 night_glider.8.d:0 "After returning from another council meeting, Night Glider had been carefully studying a large map of Equus, currently occupying most of her office table. While such an overview lacked the beauty found in observing the land below from a plane, it made up for it with raw data, found not only on the chart itself, but also on a myriad of sticky notes, courtesy of Sugar Belle, which detailed important trade routes and recent geoeconomical developments.\n\nIt was evident that in order to ensure the success of the New Hope Commune the formation of a proper diplomatic corps was required. Despite the idea of a body designed to handle foreign relations and formalize pre-existing agreements being rather straightforward, this endeavor had its own obstacles. \n\nThe first of these came from the neighbors themselves. It went without saying that Night Glider was not willing to work with less scrupulous regimes, but even more reasonable countries would need a lot of convincing to work with the city-state on more or less equal footing.\n\nThe second potential problem was closely connected to the last point: for each of the planned missions she was required to select the best candidate to lead it. A pile of dossiers and applications sat neatly on the corner of the map, and after stretching her wings for a bit Night Glider took the top one."

 night_glider.12.d:0 "For a regular creature living in the Town it was easy to shut oneself from the happenings of the bigger world around them, and indeed many were perfectly willing to do so. Night Glider, however, had no such luxury available to her.\n\nThe escalating armed clashes, both far-off and close to home, created shockwaves powerful enough to reach the commune. The possibility of war coming here seemed real - no, was real, - and it was the chosen leader's duty to prepare defense. There had been several competing proposals regarding fortifications and security measures, most of which fell into two distinct categories.\n\nOn the one hand, some of the plans incorporated lighter, less restrictive measures, with no significant changes to the daily routine: increase in anti-air coverage, extra militia patrols and weapon stockpiling. On the other, there were suggestions of erecting sizable fortifications, expanding draft, limiting the transport flow and trapping mountain passes with explosives. Night Glider knew that all of the latter would help during a potential conflict, and she was pretty sure that her popularity would make the population tolerate these changes, but she was in doubt: was this emergency, temporary as it may be, truly a way forward, or was it just a first step away from utopia to another tyranny? The decision had to be made."

It was her personal project amid the rising tidal wave of post-war issues, a small thing, reminiscent of the simpler, kinder days of the independent mountainous commune. Still, the preparation only underscored how everything had changed.\n\nThousands were killed, many more - injured, displaced, wronged. Night Glider believed that it was her duty to lead these creatures back to the better life, reconstruct and reinforce the utopia shattered by artillery barrages, and with each word added to the text this belief only grew. In the broadcast studio, hovering near the stand with the typed-down copy, she felt nervous, but resolute: the resemblance of the recording headset to the pilot one soothed her mind a little. With the signal from the chief technician, Night Glider activated the microphone.\n\nShe was heard far and wide, with a message of reconciliation and fairness, just punishments for those responsible for the conflict and the way forward for those scarred by its flames. This message, carried with passion and hope, became the spark for a different flame, one of warmth and healing, entrusted to the labor of her citizens."

 night_glider.stl.2.d:0 "After Starlight Glimmer had been ousted from Our Town, Double Diamond, then-mayor, had to build the judicial system from the ground-up since the previous one amounted to "whatever Glimmer says goes". In particular, with regards to punishments, the precedent for exile had been naturally set up, but unlike the surrounding nations the Town came to rarely using prisons, relying on a system of community officers monitoring and performing social work with offenders instead.\n\nNow Double Diamond faced a similarly-themed challenge, as Night Glider asked him to take the lead on overseeing the due process for the trials of the members of Stalliongrad establishment directly tied to wartime perpetrations. Despite some creatures voicing opinions that these extremists should get a taste of their own incarceration facilities, or face even more extreme consequences, others maintained that it would go against the spirit of the nascent republic.\n\nWhile there were arguments to be made for harsher sentences from practical and emotional sides, neither appealed to Double Diamond. Keeping to his own deeply held equalist convictions and with full support from the government, he managed to persuade the members of special jury to stick with the previously established methods of prosecution, resulting in hundreds of cases for the rapidly expanding correctional network as well as several deportations."

It was her chance to review and remake the system she grew to despise, to be the pony to codify proper reforms which should have happened decades ago - what else needed saying?\n\nApparently, a lot did, and mostly needed it in writing. Sugar Belle and her assistants spent day after day after day going through the legislation created in Stalliongrad. The decrees of the early regime at least made sense, but as the country's stability took some blows, both from the infighting in the ruling party and especially during the collapse of the frontlines, everything grew into a giant paperwork tumor, consisting of endless acronyms, contradictory graphs and thinly veiled propaganda. If Sugar Belle did not know any better, she would say that it was done to doom any attempts of fixing it.\n\n"Enough!" She slammed another regulation-filled tome shut, causing a few puzzled, but understanding looks from the creatures around. "Burn the sensitive files, send the rest to be recycled. We will be doing this properly, and we most definitely do not need the foundation of our republic to use this mess." No one had any objections."

Distracted by his own thoughts, he took the bait. "We should try to be smooth, I guess. Not talk too little, or too much. It is all about watching the mood, but Severyanians, or die-hard communists, or Severyanian communists were not exactly my type of crowd... Wait." His mind had finally caught up with his mouth. "You’re pulling my tail, ain’t you."\n\n"Guilty as charged." With a shrug, Night Glider allowed the smirk to fully appear on her face for a second, but then became serious again. "What’s on your mind, Bangs?"\n\nThe stallion took a few moments to answer. "Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask. How’re you holding up? I mean, we are doing a Celestia-tier job here, and you are the one who leads the show. And I know this might not be the best time," he said, glancing around the small preparation room, "but you’ll be going off immediately afterwards, right? For the next stop?"\n\nThe initial reaction of Night Glider was to dismiss the concern: it was indeed not the best time. However, something stopped her, a memory of herself clutching to the old friendships time and time again, warming them when they were cooling and taking this warmth in return when she needed it. "You are right. We’ll catch up afterwards, there is time. I’ll make time" Another, softer smile came to her. "But now let’s show these creatures we have time for them, too."

While this option made some sense, Night Glider was not sure that the limited resources of the ambassador corps should be directed towards such a step."

The decades had blurred the memory of the family mansion, a neat brick house with a garden, which she inherited from her sickly father just before the revolution, and they had crushed the building itself as well - there was no place for it among condominiums and factories.\n\nNonetheless, another unfamiliar street brought something different. A melancholic melody was played by a raspy turntable set on an open terrace, and the owner of the device, a gray-maned, wrinkled stallion, hummed along, while painting a large sign. Dymka knew the music, a classical Severyanian composition, one she had not heard since the days of her youth. Drawn in by an awakened longing for something she came closer, and in a few minutes she was sitting in a rickety chair with a cup of strong coffee, talking to her newest friend, an exile in Equestria until very recently, about the restoration of the Stavropon's dancing salon. This piece of smalltalk over recorded piano, unthinkable just a few years back, felt weird, but weirdly right."

Today, Night Glider intended to change this accidental tradition.\n\nThe plan was to make a small, tasteful dinner together, both to take a break and cheer for the successes of their administration. Of course, this had to be organized in secret, and she took some time inventing various reasons to bring her closest friends back to New Hope. The table was set with their favorite foods ordered from around the Town and a special cake, Night Glider’s best attempt at recreating Sugar Belle’s recipe, and everything was almost ready.\n\nLuckily, the chosen room in the city hall had a few entrances, so a bit of ingenuity had allowed Night Glider to place her guests separately, but within the earshot. When she had finally announced "Please, do come in", the doors opened one by one, revealing Double Diamond, Party Favor, Sugar Belle and Feather Bangs. The boredom on their faces turned into bewilderment, and then into genuine wonder, and then, when the realization came, simply into happiness. Soon, talking and eating and singing and dancing, they saw the evening turn into night, but had no intention of letting this reunion end.\n\nOutside, half-asleep, the country rebuilt with their vision by thousands of creatures believing in it laid, a place more fair, free and warm than ever before, a glimpse of utopia, a spark nurtured into a beacon for the world."

Up until the point when she received a confirmation of the ratified end of hostilities, she was certain something would happen, an ancient power of legends would come to resolve this crisis and guide the nation to salvation, or maybe irreversibly drag it into Tartarus. However, nothing of the sort occurred, and the thought of her personal responsibility for the fragile future swelled.\n\nWith her friends maintaining the order on the frontier, Night Glider knew she had a lot of work to do on her own. Make calls to administration representatives, - no, go through the relief reports - no, no, that could wait, unlike the security briefing - wait, why would she prioritize this over the welfare decisions? Despite her head feeling heavy, she tried to calm herself. After all, they made it. Surely what followed could not be so terrible, so difficult?

The efforts to start the implementation of the utopian model relayed went universally the same: as soon as the garrisons withdrew, protests soared, pro-harmonist or radical, but equally spiteful. With the previous power structure gone and the freedom of political expression guaranteed by the Bill of Immutable Rights, every creature of the expanded Republic seemed to have their own ideas of how their home should be governed.\n\nThese happenings only bolstered Night Glider’s certainty in the fact that more output was required from her and all the administration. If she slept, she did it behind her desk, amid the ever-growing stacks of documents, but for every mistake squashed and decision made two more problems followed, be it integrating the rapidly forming local governments, providing housing, food and healthcare in the most devastated regions, dealing with incursions, beginning new diplomatic missions or something else.\n\nAn idea came to her during one of the meetings forming a never-ending string: a grand gesture was needed. A speech in Canterlot. It surely would make dissenters see reason, understand that Night Glider  had a plan for the bright future. She did not consult with anyone - surely, the time for caution was over, - and in a few hours her plane touched down at the airport of the former Equestrian capital."

It was not a message of the resonating unity akin to her most successful appearances, but it was all in all good - a step in the right direction, without a doubt. She collected enough strength to make a smile and wave.\n\nSuddenly, everything came crashing down. There was a scream, a slogan she could not even make out, and in a few moments the mob was in chaos: multiple fights broke out among the attendees, forcing others to join or try to run. These ripples swiftly turned into a storm, and before Night Glider was able to realize what was happening, a stampede started. Forgetting about the microphone, she shouted for calm at the top of her lungs, but it was futile, as a tempestuous stream of panicked creatures was already moving to sweep away the podium.\n\nThe adrenaline finally spiked above the accumulated exhaustion, and she fled, barely escaping behind the nervous lines of the haphazardly assembled security force. Their officer took control, the order was eventually restored, and later she was notified that no-one died, but there were quite a few serious injuries. Still, there and then, with heart pounding and ears ringing, while the living sea of bodies raged on, there was only one thing Night Glider could focus on - the dread."

Nonetheless, these limitations were not enough to hide the sheer volume of signs indicating a need for a shift in the course. Still, noticing them and acting on them were two completely different things.\n\nThus, in the matters of adapting the social and economic policies Night Glider became cautious, overly so. A nudge to the framework here and there, an extra provision for a unique case, few lines in another amendment for a regulation, a compounding list of tasks devoted to preserving a perceived balance was on her daily agenda, but behind these small touches she allowed herself to stop thinking big."

A significant factor in this was the path which led the Republic to the current circumstances, and there was no denying of the force the administration was already using to govern.\n\nAdmittedly, the clause for emergency powers existed in the old Town regulations, but it was never actually used: the legacy of the community founder loomed large over the idea of a single creature bearing all the weight of authority. However, Night Glider was at the edge of her resolve, and she was convinced that now was not the time to demonstrate weakness, neither to her friends, working selflessly to keep everything together, nor to the country at large.\n\n"This was the only way", a thought in her head whispered, the consciousness being too tired to speak loudly.

The emergency transfer of the authority, currently fully implemented only for the regions closer to the original commune, had been decried by many local creatures as a "breaking of all promises", "blatant power grab" or "attempt at a dictatorship". While such a reaction was rather saddening, she expected it, or at least claimed to. Much worse was the fact that the places with little-to-no previous problems were becoming riddled with new issues.\n\nWhile some of these naturally stemmed from the brewing protests regarding the government actions, others grew from the incompatibility of the established system with a direct rule from the capital. The decision-making process was slowing down, and the tension building up there was further affecting the already troubled territories. The country was taking a nosedive: it did not matter that its pilot fully monitored the actions of the crew now, as there was a leak in the engine, a loss of pressure in the cabin and the wings were creaking under the strain.\n\nNonetheless, Night Glider did not panic, did not pull the yoke, deaf to the crescendo of the incoming catastrophe, blind to the approaching ground.

However, this did not mean that she was not going to get back to her duties soon.\n\n"You sure about that?" Double Diamond glanced at the sunlit airstrip.

 night_glider.eqs.9.d:0 ""It is with great pleasure I announce the end for the initial part of the first national assembly." Night Glider held a certain level of solemnity in her voice. "We are off to a very promising start here, and I am certain that resolving current problems and going above and beyond the comforts of old days is well within our reach. Thank you for your tireless contributions!" \n\nThe creatures in the audience reacted with approval and cheering, not those of a happy crowd, but of valued, equal partners. Each one was here to partake in the reshaping of the country, and so far the chance to do exactly that was steadily becoming a reality.\n\nNight Glider left her podium waving and went on to talk to some of the members of the assembly, but in her mind she was already tackling the issues outlined during the conducted sessions. Some of them, like the thestral rights or streamlining of aid distribution, required immediate action, but she was also beginning to strategize for the more global goals, including overseeing the restoration of key cities and implementing the "new utopian" social and economic policies. This time she would do it right, with her friends by her side and by the will of the people in her care."

 night_glider.eqs.10.d:0 "Even though the Bill of Immutable Rights guaranteed the equality between creatures regardless of their race, Night Glider anticipated the request from various thestral representatives to formally recognize their own separate history and culture on the highest level. \n\nHowever, she also very much welcomed it. Practically, it was an easy, resource-light and surefire way to rally the bat pony communities to the cause of new utopia and guarantee smooth relations with them in the shaping horizontal government, but Night Glider was more concerned about the moral side of the question.  Marginalization and exploitation of the thestral population had been a sad reality for centuries, and the latest conflicts in Equestria did little to decrease the level of prejudice against them, so she was glad to step in and use the power of the state for good.\n\nThus, the official night-themed ceremony - thematically appropriate, if a little on the nose - was organized after the appeals were swiftly processed. Night Glider and the prominent bat pony members of the assembly took part in it along other thestral leaders, exchanging gifts and proclaiming mutual devotion to unity."

 night_glider.eqs.11.d:0 "With the assembly in full gear and various committees popping up daily, Night Glider was constantly attending meetings with creatures of different ideas but similar drive. She was satisfied to see that the initiative to diversify and democratize the legislative branch was bearing fruit, allowing the proponents of the new utopia from all gaits of life to influence the Republic, and enabling her to broaden her own perspective in turn.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the appointments were promising to be even more interesting. When Night Glider first found the name "Starlight Glimmer" scribbled into her planner, she was a bit nervous, as she had not seen the founder of the Town for quite some time, but then she settled on curiosity mixed with relief that her former leader was well. Still, when Starlight Glimmer entered her office, Night Glider stood up in silence as the rehearsed greeting vanished from her mind.\n\n"Hello, Madame President. The newest chairpony of the Magical Education Panel, reporting in." The unicorn smiled with a hint of mischief. "Your town building exercise had gotten a bit out of hoof, wouldn’t you say?"\n\n"It’s *our* town building exercise now." Night Glider snickered, reassured by the icebreaker. "Just like the old times, right, Madame Chairpony?"\n\n"Now, now. If I remember it right, I was in charge back then-"\n\n"I know. So high time to try the opposite!" The reaction of Night Glider was purely instinctive, and she quickly cursed her fluster when Starlight Glimmer gave her incredulous look. However, in a second the room was filled with the genuine laughter from both of them, and in an hour a meeting full in business and pleasure was concluded."

 night_glider.eqs.12.d:0 " Even though the assembly was organized in Canterlot, the government apparatus was still divided between multiple cities, including New Hope and Stalliongrad. This situation was less than ideal in terms of directing restoration efforts and accepting foreign embassies, and many had been starting to consider the process of proper selection and arrangement of a capital to be one of the crucifirst steps of the recovering country.\n\nWhile it was mostly accepted that the capital would have to be in the borders of the old Equestria due to the existing physical and cultural links with most of the Republic, the exact place was a point of contention. Canterlot itself, of course, was a prime candidate, but a sizable portion of voices was speaking against it or anchoring the reforms in the past in general.\n\nThere were three other popular choices. Ponyville, the symbol of friendship, was least developed of the discussed options, but it carried significant ideological meaning. Manehattan was somewhat opposite, as its industrial might allowed the city to return to a reasonable standard of living soon after the war, yet its capitalist traditions did not sit right with a lot of creatures. The final option, Vanhoover, was a bit of a wild card, but Night Glider’s ideas had been receiving a lot of support there even in the commune times, and its motivated denizens could become a great help in the transition period."

 night_glider.eqs.13.d:0 "With the straightforward projects successfully realized, Night Glider had once again turned to the bigger picture, the promised ultimate state of society. Utopia, with or without addition of the word "new" had remained elusive, but regardless of its name Night Glider was certain that it was something worth fighting for. To her great relief, the time when the success of this fight was measured in blood spilled and lives sacrificed had passed, and now, after finishing the relocation to [STL.Capital.GetName], she had been devoting a lot of energy to the development of a fair and well-functioning system.\n\nIt went without saying that the previous lessons were thoroughly learned. The first significant point of the carefully drafted plan was the proper establishment of an executive body, a council to oversee matters of economical and social policies. With this initiative Night Glider hoped both to split the handling of such complex matters between multiple creatures and prepare for the future transition to an elected or lot-chosen organ by encouraging cooperation within and between the ministries as well as the usage of respectable specialists.\n\nShe also was not going to shy away from her own duties, as the other important idea concerned her personal visits to the main cities of Equestria. From where she was standing, shifting the attitudes and situations there was paramount for the similar results across the Republic. This was not the grand sweeping change Night Glider once envisioned, but it was no less important, and she was glad to continue to push for it."

 night_glider.eqs.14.d:0 "The irony was not lost on Night Glider that the same clique was continuously ruling over a democratic country. Her past idealistic self would certainly be less than happy with the current situation, but the experience obtained over the years as well as the circumstances which led to such a position clearly indicated that this was not the time to quit and allow the country to sort itself out. Nonetheless, this also did not mean that there was nothing to be done.\n\nBy organizing the Friendship Council, she was putting down her position as well as those of her companions into a clear, concise formal document, outlining the specific powers available to each of them, as well as the mechanism of the eventual change in power. Announcing such a measure had already drawn wide support from the public, and Night Glider herself felt that it was the right path to take.\n\nSince she had quite a lot of flexibility in assigning the responsibilities, she hoped that her final draft suited every pony well. In particular, Feather Bangs was going to become the chief government liaison to the surviving Equestrian corporations, Double Diamond would focus on welfare and bridging the class gap, Sugar Belle could transfer her previous connection to the local populace into a stable and fair interior management and Party Favor would be a natural fit for the role of worker unions tribune. Of course, finer details would require personal discussions..."

 night_glider.eqs.15.d:0 ""So, the moneybags. Yeah, I can do that. No problem." Feather Bangs took another glance at the document on the table and snickered. "You know, with all the time that has passed some of the current managers could have been my fans back in the day."\n\nNight Glider studied him with bemusement. The stallion before her certainly changed from a slightly awkward singer hounded by overly zealous groupies. She had seen him manage increasingly complex situations ever since she had assumed the mayoral office, and his emerging skill for business relations was nothing but excellent.\n\n"Do you have any ideas how to get this performance started then?" She smiled and took a sip from a glass of water.\n\n"Sure, sure. We guarantee stability and control the resource flow, and it’s a great selling point for the corporate big shots. Even though some of their projects managed to float, most of them sank down in the wars." With a more serious tone, Feather Bangs shifted his eyes up to the president.  "Well, now we can help them get those back on track and ensure their cooperation in terms of job conditions and country restoration. An easy win-win for us, as once they agree, they will not be able to renege on worker rights. Not in our Republic, anyways. There are also some great opportunities for the infrastructure and industry developments across Equus coming down from the communities which would look like a steal for the companies, which we could use for further incentives." He nodded with confidence. "I got it, Glider.""

 night_glider.eqs.16.d:0 "Even though Night Glider still longed for the sky, she had grown to appreciate little promenades as well. When she was alone they cleared her thoughts, otherwise the rhythm of the steps provided a background for the flow of a conversation. In the case of Sugar Belle this tune was akin to a march. The events in Equestria had deeply affected her, but the fires of change only managed to harden her resolve.\n\n"We will do it properly this time. There is no way the creatures of this country will have to endure more suffering." Sugar Belle kept the pace steady, punctuating her words with sharp beats of hooves against the pavement.\n\n"You accept then?" Despite a thought of an offer for retirement and a return to her family floating in her head, Night Glider knew well that her friend would be quite offended.\n\n"Yes." After delivering a short, blunt response Sugar Belle took some time before answering any further. "There is a whole lot to be done. The communities need to build back their mutual horizontal relations. The faith in harmony must be restored. Don’t even get me started on the full de-transition down from martial law and restructuring the interior systems." She huffed and shook her head. "It will take more to gain justified support, but they deserve it, and I will deliver it, in your Council for now, and in any other capacity after my term runs out."\n\n"Well don’t let me upset your apple cart." Night Glider acted nonchalantly, but in truth this was a carefully measured joke, as she was becoming worried for her friend who demonstrated a fixation not too dissimilar from her own. Luckily, Sugar Belle still knew a good joke."

 night_glider.eqs.17.d:0 ""This is all rather peculiar, wouldn't you agree?" Double Diamond still spoke in the same soft voice as he did throughout most of his tenure as the mayor of Our Town, but now it was colored by certain gravitas and wisdom, much dissimilar from occasional flares of the previous zealotry.\n\n"You mean, the Council? Or the general situation we are in, being at the helm of a continent instead of a cozy city?" This calm, pensive manner brought a degree of a familiar comfort to Night Glider, so she was always happy to support his contemplations.\n\n"The latter, partially. I was talking about the very society we are guarding now, rooted in the history of strife and alienation, rich with ideas dangling in the air, about the divides scarring it and the bridges to be built - built by us, no less." He stood up from the chair. "I would be honored to join you in this endeavor. Whatever the new utopia or true equality are, we will search for them together, taking heed from the past and looking for hope in the future." Allowing a bit of solemnity to settle down, he continued more casually. "I will organize my notes on healthcare, primary education, social services and immigration streamlining for a presentation at the first meeting. Was there anything else?"\n\nNight Glider was a bit surprised when she realized that she also got up during his speech, but this allowed her to decide on the next action quite easily."

 night_glider.eqs.18.d:0 "Although the tides of change had been carrying the boat of their responsibilities in many most unexpected directions, Night Glider noticed that her friends had been trying to keep some of the smaller things the same in spite of the shifting circumstances. For her it was writing up the personal organizer exactly in the way she liked it, but for Party Favor it was maintaining his balloon-making supplies.\n\n"You might say that it keeps me grounded." The stallion chuckled at his own joke, while carefully going through the assorted implements. "Thanks for entertaining the old pony’s desire to host you."\n\n"Come on, this kind of talk makes *me* feel old." Hiding her concern, Night Glider grinned and took another look around the modest workshop adjacent to her companion’s equally humble house. "I am glad to be here."\n\n"Good, good. And you’re also here regarding the Council." Clasping the heavy lid of the toolbox with a loud click, Party Favor turned to his guest and looked her directly in the eyes. "The workers do need to find their voice, and I will gladly lend them my own, until the movement is back on its hooves. I have been receiving a lot of invitations from the left organizations and the communes across the Republic - time to swap the lectures on the immortal science for real action and help them out. I’m with you. As always."\n\nRelieved, Night Glider saluted the former Commissar of War."

 night_glider.eqs.19.d:0 "While the map of Equus remained the same at the first glance, with the same plains, deserts, forests, hills, mountains and rivers, looking at it now compared with the start of her mayoral duties made Night Glider feel very much different. It was a sense similar to meeting a childhood friend who got separated from you by the circumstances, a friend dragged through every rough edge of a hard-knock life before being pushed back towards you by another whim of fate and your own stubborn determination. Sadness, sympathy and a bit of shy nostalgia were all tied in a tight knot, one she was planning to untangle step by step.\n\nNeedless to say, Night Glider was organizing her tour across the Republic not just to sort out her personal feelings. The land in her care was hurting, and its people barely fared better, and while important measures were already underway, the process of mending was just beginning. By visiting the vital hubs of Rockville, Canterlot, Ponyville, Fillydelphia, Manehattan and her own birthplace of Las Pegasus in person, the president was going to establish connections with their communities, find new allies and restore old partnerships. The degree of success of her efforts in these important locations would determine the course and the magnitude of the global reforms.\n\nThis was indeed the time to act. The very next morning after the route was finalized, Night Glider was once again looking at the continent from above, this time from a window of a plane, preparing to make her first stop."

 night_glider.eqs.20.t:0 "Money Talks"
 night_glider.eqs.20.d:0 "The negotiations with the businesscreatures of Manehattan were surprisingly easy to conduct and arduously difficult to transform into any kind of a substantial outcome. Both of these contradictory properties arose from the local culture of discussions, with the language used by corporate agents most suitable to wheeling-and-dealing instead of the positive activity Night Glider was hoping for.\n\nObviously, the rules of diplomacy demanded that the president engaged with these ways with a degree of respect, but in private, despite getting a somewhat alien feel from the buzzing commercial center, she also developed a bit of understanding for it. It was apparent that the city had existed in the conditions of industrialization and competitions for generations, and its systems had proven at least viable in surviving through the Equestrian crisis and rebuilding after it. \n\nThis did not mean, however, that the vast resources available to Manehattan were spent efficiently in the grand scheme of things, or that Night Glider was content to leave the situation untouched. She saw a potential here to sway the moral fashion of the large companies, for which she required a bit of help from someone more in touch with the city’s cultural side."

 night_glider.eqs.21.t:0 "Hard Place"
 night_glider.eqs.21.d:0 "There was something Night Glider had hoped to never experience again in the gloom of the mining town of Rockville, a sense of a dull all-encompassing purpose which subjugated the hearts and minds of the creatures living inside it. This was too reminiscent of the way the Town used to operate initially, but here no magic was involved, as the ever rising demands of war were enough to grind down any worker without outside help.\n\nThe reemerged unions controlled the industry now, which lifted some of the burdens from the backs of the miners, but the general situation remained the same. The ores, stones and crystals obtained through the excavations remained the only commodity which the community could offer to the outside world, and so each day the drills roared and picks clanged, but this was only leading to a breaking point.\n\nAfter getting to know the situation firsthoof, Night Glider had confirmed her previous understanding that a comprehensive reform of governance and conditions was needed. Current relief packages provided by the state barely ensured that the laborers were not resorting to hunger striking, and guaranteeing the continued aid delivery was an easy solution, but she was certain there was great potential hiding in the many tunnels of Rockville."

 night_glider.eqs.22.t:0 "Royal Treatment"
 night_glider.eqs.22.d:0 "Many of the once sparkling spires of Canterlot lost their gilding in the chaos of conflicts, but there were quite a few citizens of the Republic who no longer cared for their fate. The sentiment placing the brunt of responsibility for the country-wide devastation on the Princesses and their chosen nobles was gaining traction, and the restoration of the symbols of the old nation, so different from the one being built from its ashes, never had been and could not realistically become a priority for the new government.\n\nYet, according to other voices, the city was the "soul of pony culture". The remnants of the Equestrian aristocracy who chose to remain on the continent herded towards there, bringing with them what was left of their fortunes and art collections. Those of such stallions and mares who belonged to a younger generation often harbored sympathy towards the utopian cause and attempted to reconcile the past with the present, whether by charitable donations, organizing impromptu museums or even transforming wings of their manors into public service buildings.\n\nNight Glider had complicated feelings on the matter of Canterlot’s legacy. The very sight of the place still gave her shivers after the terrible stampede which occurred at her speech, and she agreed with the opinion that its previous exuberance was not to return, but she never wished for the history of her kin to vanish. After visiting the prominent supporters of her reforms and negotiating several additional investments and grants aimed at industrial and social research, she had come to a liberating, if a bit sad, conclusion."

 night_glider.eqs.23.d:0 "It would be unfair to Night Glider to claim that she was not glad that peace returned to her birthtown, but she was not happy about the current state of Las Pegasus by any measure either. It truly knew how to prey on the weak and the lost, and nowadays these kinds of creatures were plentiful. Seeking "quality" entertainment, hoping for a bit of respite from reality, or simply down on their luck, all of them were welcome in the resplendent gambling dens and across various supporting attractions.\n\nAlthough one could go to Las Pegasus and never see anything beside the flashy and pretentious cover, maintaining this effect was not easy, and many developments devoted to that illusion had their own merits. Considerable efforts were put into renovating the surrounding highways and railroads, regional power plants were rapidly implementing cutting-edge methods, and significant integration of television and electro-mechanical gaming technology was further supported by engineering and physics scholarships.\n\nThis made the task lying before Night Glider rather transparent. Initial talks had already secured a good hand in terms of monetary returns for the Republic, but she had a trump card to force true change in the city. Unfortunately, to play it she needed to commit to campaigning there in person."

 night_glider.eqs.24.d:0 "The role of a leader made Night Glider quite wary of different surprises, yet she was delighted to get the reports that the spirit of learning and democracy prevalent in Fillydelphia before the Equestrian crisis managed to withstand the chaos and persevere into the new Republican era. It was a rare city in her tour which did not require to be somehow fixed, but was a potential source of valuable lessons from its own successes.\n\nThere was truly a lot this proud community could offer to the country, both in terms of various goods produced by its restarted factories as well as of working templates for different systems for municipal governments. Albeit these were not necessarily perfectly aligned with the utopian outlook,  they contained key elements important to Night Glider, such as fair representation of the citizenry, a softer police force and integration of multiple races into the political landscape. The latter point, achieved by expanding the rights of the famous district of Dragon Town and its scaly denizens, was particularly inspirational to the president who was further advocating for the open border approach.\n\nNevertheless, such lessons required effort and time to learn them properly. Moreover, some of Night Glider’s advisors considered the stop in Fillydelphia to be just a formality, especially since the city was doing well, and proposed focusing on other, more demanding locations, so she had to make a final call regarding the progress of her journey."

 night_glider.eqs.25.d:0 ""Miss Pommel. I am very grateful you have accepted my invitation. Please, take a seat."\n\nThe pony in front of Night Glider bowed politely and took the offered place with a smooth, measured motion. Even though their meeting was happening in a gray, scarcely decorated office, provided to the president by one of the Manehattan’s industrial conglomerates, the simple but elegant outfit worn by her guest along with the demonstrated manners managed to rearrange the perception of the room into one of a strict, minimalist grace.\n\n"Thank you, President Glider. I hope your visit to our city is proceeding well." Coco Pommel, a successful dressmaker and businesspony, as well as the largest donor to the welfare campaigns in the area, smiled. "I would like to believe that your presence here would leave a lasting affirmative effect."\n\n"This is something I would like very much as well. Furthermore, this is exactly while I wanted to meet you." Cutting to the chase was something Night Glider had wanted to do during most of her corporate negotiations, and she felt that now was the right time. "I hope to bring change here, and I can see you are doing just that. I propose we unite our forces."\n\nThe mask of vague pleasantry dictated by the rules of high society left Coco’s face, allowing genuine enthusiasm to take its place.\n\n"There was a time when I believed that every creature was for themselves, and there have been so much more in my life after a friend showed me that this is not the case. I have hoped to work with you, and I will be privileged to join you."\n\nThe atmosphere turned warmer as with a press of a switch, and Night Glider shook the extended hoof with joy."

 night_glider.eqs.26.d:0 ""Just like that?" Limestone Pie, the spokescreature of the association of the mining unions of Rockville, eyed Night Glider suspiciously. She had just finished a passionate speech about the demands of the workers in front of a large crowd assembled for the debates with the standing government, and was expecting anything but a full-on agreement from the president.\n\n"Just like that." There was palpable tension in the air, but Night Glider remained composed. "You are absolutely right. As the state, we must invest in your housing, healthcare, schools and increase wages." She continued, addressing the whole gathering.  "The first reason I had wanted this meeting to be made public was to ensure accountability from the state. I intend to make a promise and deliver on it." A hopeful murmur echoed among the miners, boosting her confidence to press on. "The second reason was to announce good news. Could the chief geologist also get up on the podium please?"\n\nIn a few seconds another pony indeed made her way there, followed by several surprised gasps. Limestone was looking very confused as well, especially when her own sister approached the microphone.\n\n"We have discovered large mineral deposits in the area, and the Republic will provide us with the tools to extract them." Maud Pie was hardly the most excitable of ponies, but she was well-respected in the community, so she talked in the quickly settled silence. "I have just returned from the joint fieldworks. There will be jobs, opportunities, and new rocks!" She nodded to Limestone, who took a moment before nodding back and starting a wave of applause."

 night_glider.eqs.27.d:0 "The town of Ponyville was chosen to be the last stop of the Night Glider’s tour for many reasons. A more pragmatic creature would emphasize its central location, allowing for quick follow-up visits to other cities, or the useful symbolism of taking part in completing the reconstruction of the place where the most famous Equestrian heroes, the wielders of the Elements of Harmony, used to live. Night Glider was aware of these points, but she hardly viewed them as most important.\n\nHer leadership position meant that her information about the state of affairs in smaller locales usually came in the form of charts, graphs and reports which were informative for sure, but did not quite convey the same feeling as looking at newly-constructed, freshly painted houses and their inhabitants going about their peaceful lives did. The Town, even before it became New Hope, came to Night Glider’s mind when she was walking down narrow paved streets, taking in the casually dressed passersby, the brightly colored shops and stalls and the beautiful vibrant flowers planted along the road. She started her promenade at the yard of the reopened School of Friendship under the golden sun of midday, and returned back there only to meet the silver moon of midnight, somewhat tired, but content. \n\nThere was more to this stroll than a pleasant echo of the past. By being here and ensuring that Ponyville is provided for, Night Glider was repaying the debt she felt she owed to the ones who saved her way back when she was another lost soul caught up in a misleading scheme, and also reinforcing a promise to herself she made a while ago, to use every opportunity to extend the same kindness to those scared, abandoned or exhausted."

 night_glider.eqs.28.d:0 "A giant banner clearly visible from Night Glider's hotel room window read "The Shooting Star of Las Pegasus" in silver letters. An equally large photo of her in a flying suit accompanied the text. Some said that there was no accounting for taste, and the president still harbored doubts about the chosen course of action for the city.\n\nNevertheless, from the practical point of view, leveraging her own connection to the town was a resounding success. The businesses which received the right to use it in the form of pictures, quotes and marks of approval were thoroughly vetted by her own cabinet and the local trade unions, and with such a powerful tool they got a clear edge over the competition, particularly in the environment of the revitalized tourist activity. The deal was time-limited, heavily dependent on using large shares of the revenue to improve the conditions in the lower city and oriented at the more desirable family-friendly companies, such as arcade manufacturers, cloud-diving bureaus or, indeed, airplane show organizers. Despite the desperate attempts of gambling moguls to rebuild their previous power and all of their (rather ironic) cries about a "rigged playing field", the shift in the nature of Las Pegasus was starting to look permanent.\n\nWhile the other Equestrian corporations were hardly amused by these tactics, a bit of damage control along with it being the service sector and a very open and deliberate set up managed to assuage their fears, and the general populace was also quite welcoming of the occurring change. Night Glider was beginning to wonder about something she had previously considered impossible, namely about a chance of a leisure visit to Las Pegasus."

The priority of the current economic measures could hardly be overstated, but there was something to be said about the way forward for the Republic in terms of its ideology. Brought together at first by the strength of arms and a certain camaraderie found in the common experience of a lived-through crisis, creatures across all political spectrum shared the nation in her care, from democrats and harmonists to die-hard followers of Marks, from conservative inhabitants of rural areas to followers of the most fringe worldviews, and if the latest projections were anything to go by, a significant number of refugees was going to settle there in the upcoming years, bringing even more diversity.\n\nThe new utopia required a definition, and it could not just assimilate a single set of ideas from the past, as there was no such set to be widely accepted. In her considerations, Night Glider had found that it would have to be built from the ground up, but if this construction was to last, it needed a powerful cornerstone. After her visit to Ponyville the only suitable contender for this role was clear.\n\nTo her, the Journal of Friendship was a text filled not with lessons, but rather examples of staying true to the core values of moral, sensible living beings, reminders of the inherent unity gained through empathy. Some could decry it for the presumed naivete, feebleness or childishness, but Night Glider believed that there was nothing naive, weak or infantile about aiding others and striving to be better. With her head held high and the companions old and new by her side, she was ready to champion this cause, forever and always."

Now, sitting in a refurbished conference room of Ponyville's town hall across the "Mane Five", Night Glider could definitively say that the renewed efforts were not spent in vain. They talked for a bit, exchanging expected, but sincere pleasantries and quickly agreeing to keep away from the strict formalities - after all, they used to know each other, - and finally got to business.\n\n"You probably won't be surprised, darling, that we've discussed this prospective gathering among ourselves." A half-smile appeared on Rarity's face.\n\n"And we do respect what y'all are making here," Applejack added quickly.\n\n"Not just us, not just here. This is something big." Nodding, Pinkie Pie made a sweeping gesture with her hoof. "A real change..."\n\n"The point is, the whole political schtick - you keep carrying on." Rainbow Dash interrupted her friend and shifted her wings impatiently. "Doing mighty fine. Never was our strong suit, though."\n\n"We helped the creatures around in a more hooves-on manner. You would know." Taking the initiative back, Rarity winked, finding a bit of amusement in observing Night Glider go from concerned, to hopeful, and now to slightly embarrassed. "So that's what we will be doing. Right, Fluttershy?"\n\n"Yes. There is much required from all of us." The called-up pony straightened in her chair. "Sorry, we keep on chatting. Glider, please do speak your mind."\n\nThe answer came to her lightly, as if some unseen weight was taken away."

 night_glider.eqs.31.d:0 ""Hey, Twilight." Night Glider entered the room with caution and sat, as usual, on a beige couch  opposite to the bed belonging to the former Princess of Friendship. "Hope you slept well. Got to keep up your strength, don’t we?"\n\nThere was barely any response from Twilight Sparkle. She traced the movements of the visitor with her eyes, but the gaze remained dull and empty. The doctors assigned to her had a grim outlook on the situation, using terms such as "severe magical damage" or "intense traumatic shock" when describing the state of their patient, and the general consensus indicated a very limited possible recovery. Nonetheless, Night Glider kept coming to check up on her at least a few times a month. When someone asked about it, she joked that she had learned to disregard the odds around the period of first Stalliongrad speeches, but in truth she did not do it out of some hope for mystical healing. It just felt right.\n\n"Brought you a little something, by the way. From all of us." Moving gently, trying to not disturb Twilight unduly, Night Glider produced a large rolled up bundle of cloth out of her bag. After unfurling the gift and placing it on the bedside table, she returned back to the couch. "This is embroidery. We tried to make the Town’s festival." Twilight’s stare followed Glider’s hooves as she pointed to different miniature figures. "Here’s me. Oh, that should be Starlight. And that’s you. I’ll let you spot the others yourself, should be good fun."\n\nThere was silence for a while, then Night Glider chatted some more, and then she left with a promise to return, left to rejoin the world she had changed for the better and would change even more still. One day, though, she would find Twilight sleeping under the tapestry as if under a colorful blanket."

Sure, I might be out of research practice, but a better hypothesis is that this Republic is simply inconceivable."\n\n"In a good way, right?" Night Glider grew to be quite easy around the former Princess of Friendship over her repeated visits. After the worst of the crisis both of them rejoined the efforts of the global recovery, even though Twilight largely kept her involvement hidden away from the public, partially to have a much needed rest, partially to not upset the fragile balance, and partially to study the new developments. Now, however, she seemed to be partial to operating more overtly.\n\n"Oh, definitely." Holding a markedly official tone, Twilight looked at the unicorn closely.  "It would be remiss of me to not engage with something so swooper duper."\n\nCaught entirely by surprise, Night Glider snorted. It had been years since she heard that one.\n\n"Thanks for the vote of confidence, then. Let me be the first to welcome you back."\n\n"Back? No, not really." Twilight Sparkle, suddenly serious, looked out the window and shook her head. "You did not rebuild Equestria there, you’ve changed it. And I’m with you on this."\n\nNight Glider followed her gaze towards the land which suffered greatly, endured valiantly and now was ready to grow again. Her thoughts swirled in the ocean of plans to complete, those of her own, the Friendship Council, or just friends, including the one sitting across her. With a tinge of wonder, she realized that she had allowed herself to believe in them again."

According to the local sources, [STG.GetLeader], who came to power in the rebellious province after a recent period of internal turmoil, proclaimed the new course towards reconciliation with Equestria and return to harmonic ideas. Of course, one would have to wait and see the outcome of these brave promises, but Sugar Belle was ready to choose optimism over caution for now. With the help of the assembled council, she promptly created a congratulatory note to be delivered to the city which once was known under and now could be again called by the name of Princessyn."

Unfortunately, the recent news from the southern neighbor indicated no such tendencies.\n\nOn top of that, with the ultra-left entrenched in the government of the rebellious province, the question of political response from Radiant Light became a high priority. After a short deliberation with the members of her cabinet, Sugar Belle approved issuing a unilateral declaration of condemnation towards the communist authority and ordered preparations for more decisive actions. If Stalliongrad was to remain isolationist, the diplomatic move of establishing a rival regime was the most sensible approach, but she did not expect the corruption to stay self-contained, and so military preparations were in order as well."

Among closest companions, however, the mayor allowed herself to show a tinge of fear, but shortly locked it up beneath layers of determination and grit.

She mourned the lost in private for three days, while the government of Golden Mountain almost ground to a halt, but then re-emerged to continue her duties, with a new primary goal in mind, to equip the last fragment of her beloved home for the final hopeless fight.

Wielding considerable support from the public, Sugar Belle and her government introduced a multitude of support measures to the friendly state, ranging from vehicle and supply deliveries to joint intelligence procession as well as rapid mobilization of volunteer corps made up from soldiers well-versed in mountain combat."

She had been in this office many times, first bringing muffins to Starlight Glimmer and later arguing with Double Diamond, but their time behind its carved desk was over. The room was already reorganized according to her own orders, with all the equalist memorabilia promptly offloaded to archives and replaced by bookshelves full of social and economical treaties by the most prominent pony authors of late.\n\nThe sun was shining bright through the large windows, its light falling on another of Sugar Belle’s special decorations, a set of broadsheets with custom-made sketch maps of the city and its surrounding areas. She promised her friends, now her citizens, to transform this place, and she already had big plans for the Golden Mountain. It was essentially a backwater periphery of Equestria for now, she knew that, but she was also adamant that with the right incentives and new investments it could become the wonder of the north. Of course, the harmonic way of life which could allow such a success needed protection, so the matters of external and internal security remained high on her agenda as well.\n\nAs she collected herself and approached the plans, Sugar Belle felt the growing certainty. She was in the right position, at the right time, supported by the will of thousands. There was nothing in the world that could stop her."

Every piece of paper on display bore countless pencil marks and traces of eraser, and most of them were clearly ready to join dozens of worn out broadsheets in the archives, but there was something different for Sugar Belle in these plans.\n\nDespite the fact that they occupied the same spot in her office as all their predecessors did throughout all these months, the city on them could scarcely be compared to the first drafts. Among the expansive neighborhoods of Radiant Light, its wide roads, sprawling industrial complexes and cultural buildings sprinkled here and there it was hard to spot the original modest intention, not to mention the tiny seedling of the community of old. Looking at the results of her labors, Sugar Belle for the first time in her role as the mayor felt truly proud. Harmony deserved a proper foundation, and its followers up in the north could not wish for a safer, brighter place.\n\nEven though beyond the slopes of the Golden Mountain envious enemies of the Equestrian spirit lurked in the shadows, Sugar Belle was ready for them. With her own hooves, by the will of the thousands, she nurtured a city both beautiful and strong."

However, despite sharing the harmonic outlook, the giant of the continent and the small northern community operated on entirely different levels, and did not possess well-developed direct transport links. Thus, the new partnership required a deft touch.\n\nAn obvious avenue of relationship improvement stemmed from the possible mutual benefit found in research. While the scientific capabilities of Equestria were significant, Golden Mountain presented a perfect testing ground for cutting-edge developments as there was no global infrastructure to put at risk, and due to its size it could utilize the successful advancements immediately to catch up on the modernization. Sugar Belle considered this a reasonable start, but she was aiming higher, already planning a range of operations which would propel Radiant Light to significant importance and validate its inevitable membership in the United Pony Alliance."

The home of ponykind cried out for help, and so Radiant Light would do everything in its power to deliver, enduring any siege and preparing for the inevitable counter-strike by firmness of spirit and strength of weapons."

He was a stallion of action, and although he did not have anything against reasonable reading, or new arrivals to the Town, the very thought of going through every piece of paper was almost dripping with boredom. Still, mayor Belle considered it important, so when the wall clock clicked, indicating the start of the working hours, he took the topmost sheet duteously.\n\nThe clock probably clicked again some time later to mark off the end of day, but Sunny Song barely noticed it and stopped reading another project description only because he could barely focus his eyes. There was a lot of untapped potential in Radiant Light, so much room for the Town to grow, so many incredible places in the mountains for everyone to see! On his way home he could not help but continue to think about the ideas submitted by local experts and agencies invited from all over Equestria, and even in his sleep he traced the designs of new houses and the paths of future trails."

 sugar_belle.10.d:0 "The wavy paths running across the orchards of Sweet Apple Acres were well-known to Sugar Belle. Slipping from the formal lunch organized for the official visit of the Town representatives regarding joint agricultural ventures felt a little wrong, but she was certain she would be back before anyone would become too worried. Checking her bag from time to time, she walked hurriedly beneath the rustling trees until she finally reached a small hill covered in blooming bushes.\n\nThe plan was for her to get there first, but another pony was already there. However, Sugar Belle did take this possibility into account, so she had been coming up behind the back of the hill visitor, who was mumbling something to himself.\n\n"When I look into your eyes..." The stallion, deep in thought, did not notice Sugar Belle coming closer. "Nope. Searching for the perfect rhyme... Ugh, no." He shook his head and let out a sigh.\n\n"Mac?" Trying not to alarm him, Sugar Belle called out softly, but the red-coated pony still flinched, and as he was turning around in an abrupt, startled motion, he dropped down a small box.\n"Oh! Hi!" Big Mac quickly snatched the box back up and awkwardly stuffed it into his breast-pocket. "Thought you’d come from there."\n\n"I, well, didn’t!" Suddenly flustered, Sugar Belle once again looked in her bag, where she kept a very similar box. They stared at each other for a few seconds, each building up their own courage.\n\n"I’m here just for a day..." She started to talk, making a step forward. \n"You’re the mayor now..." At the same time he attempted to explain everything too, but the loving hearts did not need details. \n\nBoth got their precious boxes out, this time without any incidents, both opened them, revealing beautiful rings, and both asked the most important question simultaneously, smiling."

 sugar_belle.11.d:0 "With the appointment of Sugar Belle to the mayoral office a lot of efforts to jumpstart the development of the Town were directed to attract Equestrian corporations. From selling rights to shared excavation of natural resources to subsidizing the innovative industrial projects with headquarters in Radiant Light, the new government was considering every available tool at their disposal.\n\nThe arrival of new businesses meant the arrival of their representatives as well, and Sterling Stride, a manager from Manehattan, was one of the lucky few. Despite coming up with the idea to branch out to the north, he did not expect that the higher-ups would send him to oversee the initial phase of the project firsthoof. The money was good, however, and after explaining the need to go on a trip "to some mountainous backwater" for several months to his family, Sterling Stride was off with diligently packed warm clothes and a promise to visit home as often as possible. Still, he was in for more surprises.\n\nThese mostly did not come from the business side of things, as everything was progressing rather smoothly with the growth of the operations matching the optimistic prognosis. Instead, after a week or three of adjusting, the self-styled "stallion from the big city" realized that he did not feel any of the predicted desperation to go back, quite the opposite - in the Town everything felt somehow right, almost exactly the way history books described the harmonic spirit of old, with honest ponies trying their best at honest jobs and prospering through mutual cooperation and friendship. After a month, he was able to convince his family to visit him."

Thus, it fell to the T&I Board and its director, Sunny Song, to find new and exciting ways to attract visitors to the Town.\n\nLuckily, the stream of ideas and projects for the entertainment industry seemed truly endless, with two large subtypes taking form. The first was concerned with utilizing the nature of the mountainous terrain, with ski camps, cave tours, hiking treks  or something more exciting like paragliding or kayaking. The second drew inspiration from Equestrian examples - the city could do with a trade center, proper arcade or maybe even a rollercoaster and an observation wheel. With the latter amusements certain measures advocated by the portion of the council led by Night Glider were taken to keep them pleasant and relaxing and to prevent anything even remotely resembling the vicious cycles of Las Pegasus from forming.\n\nAnother beautiful undertaking came from the arts, particularly from the theater. With the construction of the new Radiant Concert Hall, the Town picked interest of many amateur and experienced troupes, who began to view it as a staging ground for their latest projects. After successes of shows such as "On Your Walls" and "Alicorn Errant", it became clear that the drama scene found a perfect spot, further contributing to the rise in the number of city guests."

Its title read "Bright Up North", and it was accompanied by a beautiful stylized  illustration of a mountain showered by golden sparks, with a neat town sitting on its slopes. The text below went into detail about the city by the name of Radiant Light, "a spot for opportunity and growth", which was inviting guests and new settlers, promising affordable hotels and housing, great sights and secure work contracts, and even "experiencing the harmony spirit". Misty Melody quietly chuckled, but she was not in a hurry to turn the page over, as her eyes were focused on a discount coupon for trains to this "land up north" and back from any Equestrian railway station of her choice.\n\nShe mulled over the offer for some time. Her contract here on Puerto Caballo was running out soon, so a change of scenery was in order anyway, and she could afford a small holiday, so this Radiant Light could be exactly the right thing. After finishing the tea, she carefully tore the coupon off, and proceeded to the puzzles."

The intent to change the nature of her home was clear from the name itself, but Sugar Belle had devoted a lot of energy to bring substance behind this grandiose label. While there was a lot of value in expanding the partnership with Equestria and bringing more ponies to the Golden Mountain, the mayor realized that there was an urgent need to focus on the internal, more spiritual development. \n\nAfter the elections the city remained in a state of flux, with its denizens often clinging to the harmful equalist or even marksist notions. For Sugar Belle, this obsession with the past, visible in all old things from the standardized house designs to sad, gray-brownish clothing style, had to end in order for Radiant Light to shine as brightly as it could, and she was in a prime position to finish it for good.\n\nThe prepared actions were decisive and multi-faceted, consisting of inspirational speeches, massive renovations, introduction of gentle political regulations and everything in between, but they were directed towards the same goal of preserving and nurturing the seed of harmony into a mighty tree."

For Sugar Belle this clearly meant that all the supporters of harmony must be ready to protect it with weapons in their hooves. As demonstrated by the myriad examples throughout the history of Equus and the world, those who did not have resolve, training or equipment to fight the invading evil either had to find them quickly or were doomed to perish, and the political situation around the Town made her very much concerned regarding this proud community sharing such a woeful fate. Additional security measures, such as expanded draft, construction of new fortifications or even trapping mountain passes with explosives were already in preparation, awaiting the time of need.\n\nThe mayor agreed that mighty defense was important, but the same lessons of the past demonstrated that in the end the fight must be brought to the enemy, as otherwise the forces of good risked leaving a festering nest of chaos to recover and spew forth its bile once more. "Why wait for the darkness to strike first?" was the next natural question, and Sugar Belle knew that the correct answer was "We should not."\n\nBy actively utilizing the new diplomatic channels, she searched for other proponents of a more proactive foreign policy, and had some promising successes. In the quickly globalizing world, some degree of cooperation between like-minded countries was a given, and so developing it into treaties of military support in the struggle against various tyrannies peppering the continent was well in the realm of possibility, with Sugar Belle making the first few very important steps in this direction."

This was the perfect spot, and as soon as her secretary informed her that most of the seats were filled, she approached the tribune with confidence and began to speak.\n\n"Friends! I am overjoyed to see each and every one of you here today!" She waved and waited, allowing the loud cheers to calm down. "I would like to talk about us. All of us, the proud, good, hard-working ponies and other creatures of the Town. This place unites us, not by blood or ancient tales, but by real history, by our belief in the same core values of loyalty, generosity, laughter, kindness, and, indeed, honesty. It is this place we take pride in, it is this place which we want the best for and which we devote the efforts towards. It has always been our Town, and it carried the Equestrian spirit ever since the Mane Six shown us the way. But I promise you, it never had, it does not and it never will live under Stalliongrad's iron hoof!"\n\nAnother round of applause erupted, lifting Sugar Belle's spirit even higher. She talked more on matters big and small, on her duty to the city residents and their duty to each other and their home, and on the great, special future ahead of them. There was no doubt she was heard and given full confidence by the listeners."

The stallion raised the voice at first, but then sharply dropped the tone back down, deep into the mix of regret and sadness. "I was here from the very start."\n\n"And I appreciate everything you have done. Still, the ideas you cling to are wrong and dangerous." Weighing each word, the mayor spoke with ironclad conviction, as she knew that she must demonstrate strength. Nonetheless, an errant thought, a voice of a friendship mourned, managed to surface for one short phrase. "I hope you will see it one day."\n\nA few seconds passed in silence, and Party Favor was the first to look away. He then turned around and quickly walked to the door of the office. "Old Glimmer would be proud," he uttered, before leaving for good.\n\nSugar Belle endured this remark too. Meanwhile, in the town hall and across the city itself, dozens of government workers were receiving dismissal notices "on the grounds of demonstrating harmful beliefs", notices that were polite, offered a significant compensation and an opportunity to re-apply for the jobs after a certain probation period, but also could not be appealed, as their replacements were ready to step in immediately."

 sugar_belle.18.d:0 "In the times of hardship, Sugar Belle had usually sought comfort in her companions. However, if the problem somehow concerned one of them, and she did not want to partake in talking behind their tail, she looked for answers in the books, and among her favorites there were none as helpful or universal as the Journal of Friendship.\n\nIntegrating this fundamental harmonic text into the social program of the Town had been her plan even before becoming the mayor, so after the elections she was eager to deliver. The stories inside beautifully reflected the key components of positive interactions, and considerable organizational effort was put into presenting the teachings and various analyses of the Journal in workshops for government workers, school lessons on philosophy and morals and weekly public lectures provided both by local and invited speakers, with primary goal being the fostering of cultural growth.\n\nWhile this process was currently ongoing, Sugar Belle found herself personally in the need of the Journal again. The unresolved quarrel with Party Favor lingered in her mind, and despite her commitment to the new course for the city, she believed in a possibility of reconciliation, at least in their relations as two individual ponies. Reading the familiar lines provided her with enough determination to try and write down some of her own, and in a few days a letter was made."

 sugar_belle.19.d:0 "Although the Town was founded as a pony settlement, its geographical position as well as a general welcoming attitude after the initial equalism mishap caused other creatures to appear among the members of the community. With the recent surge of economic activity, even more immigrants of various species had been coming to Radiant Light, provoking discussions among the public and mayoral cabinet.\n\nSugar Belle considered the matter to be important, but fairly straightforward. There was no doubt in her mind that griffons, zebras, or whoever else could share the harmonic views and would be able to benefit from and contribute to upholding the Equestrian values, and their often less advantageous status was easily explained by the poor exercising of the same values by some of the misled pony citizens. \n\nThus, the ideal of Grand Society was officially embedded into the political agenda of the Golden Mountain, representing a system which strives to provide support for all of its members and does not discriminate against them based on the inherent characteristics. Corresponding administrative mechanisms were implemented swiftly, and the influx of new "townies" only grew further."

However, this evening something made her stop on the way home and examine the billboard again in the glow of streetlights, especially the words painted in sparkling silver.\n\nLife. It laid down a tricky road. If someone would tell the young mare from Albion that she would one day lead the commune she was escaping to, she would probably laugh, or maybe even get scared. The echo of these emotions whispered to her during the election campaign and chimed again when the results were announced, but it quickly gave way to the stern resolutness to guide those around her.\n\nLiberty. That was the core principle underneath it all, one in need of utmost care. Sugar Belle knew that she came close to losing the freedom of choosing the path, understood how it felt to have one’s potential subjugated, and made sure that this experience would always inform the direction of her governance.\n\nPursuit of happiness. The big promise which was already made by the Town once, and so many times by everywhere else. Now her word was measured against the same scale, and every day she toiled tirelessly, paying for the three shiny principles with similar bits of her own."

 sugar_belle.21.d:0 "Although the emerging republican power structure would be sufficient for managing the Town in the near future, Sugar Belle and her inner circle maintained that since the deeper reform was inevitable, there was not much point in delaying it. Several mayoral decrees outlining the gradual change were devised, with more radical steps put to public vote.\n\nAccording to Sugar Belle herself, the aim of these plans was to guarantee the freedoms and opportunities both for the current and newly arriving citizens. Achieving such a noble goal required mechanisms for decisive action for all of the branches of the government, in equal measure explained by the ideological need to be ready to combat any signs of internal or external tyranny, as well as more practical concerns for the issues with representation of the increasing population, particularly possible gridlocks and the lack of streamlining.\n\nDespite some members of the opposition declaring the increase in institutional powers to be "deeply undemocratic", an overwhelming majority of the community approved the introduced measures, especially since each individual act was packaged together with a highly beneficial social program as an example of its usage."

 sugar_belle.22.t:0 "The Corrected Path"
 sugar_belle.22.d:0 "Offbeat scoffed, took another go at studying the message given to her, and scoffed again.\n\n"What a load of pebbles, Glider!" With each word her frustration visibly grew. "Tell me you didn't read this before bringing it here. Tell me you do not approve of this at least!" Lowering the pink piece of paper, Offbeat glared at the bearer of bad news over the title reading "Referral to harmonization classes" in bold underlined letters.\n\n"Look, I know you are not happy about it..." Night Glider winced, preparing for the incoming verbal barrage.\n\n"Not happy? Oh yes, I'm not happy! First, your apple-headed friend forced me into the cabinet’s back bench, then she limited the gatherings of free creatures to discuss political theories which I hosted, and now she expects me to go and listen to a bunch of filly stories and statist propaganda?  Tell her to go... What?" She yelled out the last word with exasperation, looking at the cautiously raised hoof of her companion.\n\n"Listen, we've discussed this. All of us need to be open-minded." After a small pause, Night Glider continued. "We engage with this, and then we are seen as open to a dialogue, ready to play by the rules. Then after the current problems are resolved we will go about challenging everything through legal channels, with community's support."\n\nOffbeat glanced at the slip, grimaced, and finally shrugged."
 sugar_belle.22.a:0 ""I will give it *one* chance.""
 
 sugar_belle.23.t:0 "The Vigilant Watchers"
 sugar_belle.23.d:0 "Flicker Flash knocked on the door in front of him with absolute confidence. This being his first day as the official flatblock party planner, he was full of energy to talk to all the neighbors, especially those he had not been able to meet with before.\n\nThere was some strange clanging noise, then a sound of hooves against the wooden planks, and then finally a small shutter opened, uncovering a pair of green surprised eyes. \n\n"Who are you and whadda you want?" The voice from behind the door was deep and nasal.\n\n"You can call me Flash!" The young stallion smiled broadly, producing his stamped committee card with the name and role. "I’ve been hoping to see if you are doing alright. You should’ve gotten a memo from the district council about my visit?"\n\n"Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah." The lock mechanism creaked, and after another moment Flash was able to see the dweller of the flat one in full, a tall, sturdy built pony with an unkempt mane. "I’m, uh, Kimberlite. Kim for short. Come on in."\n\nThe party planner hardly needed another invite, but before going in he quickly marked down the name in his Town-issued notepad. When he emerged outside of the place almost an hour later, the same notepad contained significantly more information, including Kim’s place of birth (Rockville), current job (worker at New Steelworks), interests (hoofball, drums) and wishes for organized house activity (naturally, sport and music events). Skimming over the data and recalling the details of their conversation, Flash drew a thick line and penned in his conclusion."
 sugar_belle.23.a:0 ""Category B, underengaged, positive outlook.""

 sugar_belle.24.t:0 "New Lives"
 sugar_belle.24.d:0 ""So, how do you find it here, son?" The mare asking spoke in a weary voice, but smiled warmly.\n\nEarnest Ember was a very serious foal for his age. He set his toy car away, glanced at his mother and began to think hard, listing all the ideas one by one in his head. The place was good, large and bright. Less noisy than the stuffy train coach or his old home. Outside was colder than before and the long, thick shirt, - mom called it "jacket" - sometimes felt itchy, but it was okay. Snow was prickly, but funny. And there were a lot of ponies to play with, though they talked weirdly! He even got a new best friend, Silvy, who also just came to the Town with her family, and she had all kinds of great things! The verdict seemed clear.\n\n"I like it here." He paused and then considered the situation for another half a minute, finally finding a problem. "Just wish you would come from work earlier."\n\n"I know." With a sigh, she gently patted his mane. "Me too. But I'm happy for you."\n\n"Do you like it here?" The question sounded fair to Ember, and he understood that mom would also need some time to come up with an answer, so he returned to the car.\n\nShe watched him silently. Juggling three temporary jobs for basic salary was rough and often exhausting, everything she knew remained back south, and when she was with Ember, she only had strength to sit close to him on the sofa. Still, there was hope now, a chance to take the generosity of the Town, the relaxed immigration, the charitable mortgage for a flat in the brand new district built in glass and concrete from the ground up, and turn it into a fresh start for both of them. Finally, she sighed again."
 sugar_belle.24.a:0 ""I do. Now come along, I'll heat us dinner.""

 sugar_belle.25.t:0 "The Job We Have To Do"
 sugar_belle.25.d:0 ""Friends!" Another speech started with this simple word, burdened with a plethora of meanings and intentions. Nonetheless, Sugar Belle developed a certain liking to the term. It reminded her of nicer days of the past, and also neatly covered strains on her actual close relationships. However, the mayor preferred to not dwell on the reasons: the Equestrian way meant that all townies were friends, and that was the only thing of importance.\n\n"The topic I must address today is simple. What is to be done about the new ponies in our care?" She allowed herself a little grimace of indignation. "In order to answer that, let’s take a brief look at the history of the so-called Severyana, benevolently left to its own devices for millenia. First, their nobles eschewed harmony and brought misery to innocent creatures, leaving the very spirit of the land battered and bruised. Then, when the anger of the masses could not be contained, it lashed out rabidly, blindly, monstrously - and we have all seen the crimes wrought by the abominable creation by the name of Stalliongrad."\n\nThe crowd resonated with the message strongly, as the scars of war were fresh. Some attendees shouted passionate, even violent slogans, and while this destructive energy was not essential for her goals, Sugar Belle was ready to capitalize on it. "Yes! They came to be beastly and evil, intoxicated by false freedoms and corrupt systems. But fret not - we have pulled them from the brink, and now we will show them the true ways of our kin! We shall shatter the barriers of deceit, and if you will have me, I shall stay your guide!"\n\nThe cheers and chanting swept the doubts away, leaving a single thought."
 sugar_belle.25.a:0 ""It is my destiny.""

 sugar_belle.26.t:0 "Ending The Schism"
 sugar_belle.26.d:0 ""I'm sorry, but no, Glider. These plans would be great if a hundred years ago someone in Canterlot came up with them." Sugar Belle pushed the stack of documents away.\n\n"I understand your desire for change..." Starting the counter-argument this way would be great if Night Glider was trying to make her case before the war. Now the mind of her friend had been properly changed, set and locked.\n\n"What you do not understand is that it is not my desire. We're not guiding the little Town anymore. The future of Equestria is being decided here, and if we want our home to thrive, we must do better. This... atrocity of a language is one of the ugly weeds in the garden we have been entrusted with - a gentle pruning could help once, but now only a full-blown pesticide has the capability to deliver."\n\n"A full switch then, grammar and lexicon, no transition period?"  Not at all impressed by the metaphor dipped in the new propaganda, Night Glider resigned to a cold, business-like tone. "Is that what we're doing here, cultural erasure of Severyana?"\n\n"Cultural restoration of proper pony traditions." Speaking calmly once again, Sugar Belle picked a specific page from the pile. "We will start with these bolder proposals, and then turn them up a notch." Afterwards, she produced a measured patronizing smile."
 sugar_belle.26.a:0 ""They will thank us later.""

 sugar_belle.27.t:0 "All In Place"
 sugar_belle.27.d:0 "With the roll-out of language reform, or rather long-awaited recovery of lost kinship, Sugar Belle felt the necessity to proceed with the next step of her plan. It went without saying that no part of Equestria should bear names any true pony would consider strange or ugly, and a call for new options was announced throughout the province promptly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, citizens took a keen interest in the future of the land, and the government offices received a plenty of varied suggestions. Although Sugar Belle was encouraged by the magnitude of response, especially from the newly liberated creatures, she found its content rather lacking. Proposals for restoring historical monikers (hopelessly retrograde) or even attempts at creating poorly-disguised terms derived from the discarded Severyanian words (possibly warranting future investigations) formed the majority of ideas, yet were dismally far from her true intentions. Still, there was no reason to worry - after all, their leader had already proven that she knew best, and so she did not mind rectifying a few more mistakes on her own."
 sugar_belle.27.a:0 "Won't take a minute."

 sugar_belle.28.t:0 "Unexpected Pleasantries"
 sugar_belle.28.d:0 "The idea that a meeting with anyone from the leadership of Stalliongrad could be anything but a vehement political debate still did not make full sense to Sugar Belle. However, the recent talks with [STG.GetLeader] further put her at ease. With her latest economical and social initiatives, the Town was in a perfect position to turn the relations with its southern neighbor into a fruitful cooperation, and the near future seemed tentatively promising."
 sugar_belle.28.a:0 "Harmony returns to Severyana!"

 sugar_belle.29.t:0 "Request From The Town"
 sugar_belle.29.d:0 "The former commune of Our Town, presently known as [STL.GetName], has reached out to us seeking a share of older equipment to reinforce their modest armed forces. While their offensive military capabilities are unassuming, there is an argument to be made regarding their value in the defence of the possible northern front."
 sugar_belle.29.a:0 "Let us be generous even to this ally."
 sugar_belle.29.b:0 "Our resources are better spent elsewhere."

 sugar_belle.30.t:0 "The False Idol"
 sugar_belle.30.d:0 "This morning a message came down from the Town’s office, ringing steadfast and clear. First, it hit the many households of the commune itself, but soon it breached the borders and spread far and wide across Equus.\n\n“Let it be known to all creatures who value liberty and peace that the regime of Stalliongrad is nothing but a disgraceful sham. For years, they have claimed to be building a new fair society atop the bright ideas of Caramel Marks. But what have they delivered? A perversion of the idea of revolution, a tangle of red tape, and, indeed, a crushing boot of another dictatorship!\n\nThe Golden Mountain shall maintain relations with these fraudsters and oppressors no longer. We cannot condone this growing blight, and we will do everything in our power to cut it down. The light of truth and unbent spirit must never go out!” "
 sugar_belle.30.a:0 "“Sugar Belle, voice of the free North, signing off.”"

 sugar_belle.31.t:0 "The Shadow Meeting"
 sugar_belle.31.d:0 "Diplomacy within the Severyana region had never been easy for our government, and every local development promised opportunity and trouble in equal measure. The latest piece of news from our ambassadorial team follows this suit perfectly, for better and for worse.\n\nSugar Belle, a citizen of Equestria and now the leader of the independent community of [STL.GetName], has secretly contacted our representatives with a highly ambitious proposal. She asks us to formally relinquish claims on Stalliongrad territories, and allow her to act freely in overthrowing the communist state instead, recognizing the legitimacy of the new regime afterwards. While the cautious realists in our cabinet note that the disparity in military strength makes her success extremely unlikely, a vocal minority advises us to trust in harmony and bet on the new Severyana. Of course, a semi-independent allied administration in the north would also allow us to save up a sizable amount of resources."
 sugar_belle.31.a:0 "Power of friendship might win the day."

 sugar_belle.32.t:0 "A Call From The Town"
 sugar_belle.32.d:0 "An unexpected missive has arrived from the remote independent community north of Stalliongrad. Due to our expertise in mining, particularly crystal excavation, and their mountainous location, they are seeking help in establishing their own operations. Of course, helping other ponies is a noble cause, but we should be wary of the political climate in the region."
 sugar_belle.32.t.a:0 "We would love to share."

 sugar_belle.33.t:0 "Townies In Nova Griffonia"
 sugar_belle.33.d:0 "Once again we are getting news from the south! This time, however, it does not concern Stalliongrad - instead, the tiny pony community of [STL.GetName] asks for the expansion of our trade relations. In particular, they hope to obtain our agriculture expertise and offer to pay for it by providing specialist workers for the bordering territories."

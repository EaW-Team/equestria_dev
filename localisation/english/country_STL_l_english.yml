STL_society_reform:0 "Our Future"
STL_society_reform_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer left her mark on every aspect of Our Town even as she took every mark from us. We must consider and debate our future, and how it shall be organised, everypony equal, everypony's voice heard. We shall not lose our way again."

STL_elections:0 "Our Elections"
STL_elections_desc:0 "How can ponies be equal if everyone cannot have the opportunity to lead it? Allowing a leader absolute power was our mistake, and we shall not allow it again. We shall consult, and then WE shall choose."

## COMMUNIST PATH ##
STL_neighbors_help:0 "Our Neighbours"
STL_neighbors_help_desc:0 "The ponies of Stalliongrad are kindred spirits - they may speak of workers and production instead of Equality, but the end result is the same. We should establish trade and seek industrial assistance."

STL_STG_military_advisors:0 "Our Stalliongrad Advisors"
STL_STG_military_advisors_desc:0 "Should the griffons ever advance south, we shall be the first to be hit. We must seek military support from our neighbours in Stalliongrad."

STL_independence_line:0 "Our Independence"
STL_independence_line_desc:0 "Stalliongrad at first responded positively to our efforts to establish relations, but now grow impatient, hoping we will join them. It is time to make clear - we shall remain independent, now and in future."

STL_industrial_effort:0 "Our Industrial Effort"
STL_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Our balancing act with Stalliongrad has paid off. The support offered, and our own hard work will lead to the development of two new factories. Ponies speak excitedly of the prosperity such investments shall bring. Is it too early to speak of Our City?"

STL_industrial_help:0 "Our Industrial Help"
STL_industrial_help_desc:0 "Like Stalliongrad, we have missed much of the industrialisation that has swept southern Equestria. Today, Stalliongrad is a case study in rapid industrialisation - our countries would be more equal if they were to share...."

STL_new_army:0 "Our New Army"
STL_new_army_desc:0 "Griffons to the north, Our 'Friend' to the south, and the giant of Equestria beyond that, looking to swallow us both. Our citizens must take up arms for safety, for the sad truth is that a bullet is the ultimate equaliser."

STL_demand_griffon_land:0 "Our Griffon Land"
STL_demand_griffon_land_desc:0 "We have gotten so used to referring to everything as 'Ours', that it's starting to get out of control. "Our caves", "Our mountains", "Our northern coasts". The idea of asking Nova Griffonia to give us all that land is getting to tempt. After all, it IS Ours."

STL_socialist_trade:0 "Our Expanding Trade"
STL_socialist_trade_desc:0 "Whatever our differences with Stalliongrad, they are our primary trading partner, and trade grows every day. With continued development, we shall finally be able to shrug off the pall of economic isolation that has crippled the nation."

STL_research_facility:0 "Our Research Facility"
STL_research_facility_desc:0 "Staying up to date with a state as small as ours poses a challenge. Fortunately, a lot of research is just a matter of applying existing public knowledge, reverse engineering other equipment, and shameless patent theft."

STL_twilight_teaching_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle, Equestrian Princess of Friendship resides in Ponyville, and the travels of Sugar Belle and Feather Bangs have seen them returning with some of her publications. With the blessing of Feather Bang as leader, ponies have begun to study her works and consider how it could be implemented. Feather Bang's first act has been to rename Our Town to the more friendly, Ponyville inspiredm Townsville."

STL_railroad_way:0 "Our Transit System"
STL_railroad_way_desc:0 "Whilst we have no need to build large rail systems, a small effort to integrate with other Equestrian rail lines and local systems of tramways and buses will help accommodate our swelling population. Military logistics will be particularly easy, as our soldiers should be able to take a bus from their house to the front line every morning."

STL_conquest_of_STG:0 "Our Stalliongrad"
STL_conquest_of_STG_desc:0 "Some of our cabinet have grown concerned, as Double Diamond appears to descend into madness, rambling about OPMs and world conquest. Others insist that a military genius is at work. Whatever the case, we gear for the unthinkable - War with Stalliongrad."

STL_equestrian_airbridge:0 "Equestrian Airbridge"
STL_equestrian_airbridge_desc:0 "A burgeoning friendship with Equestria faces a serious challenge. We are surrounded by two powerful, potentially hostile states. Establishing a secure air route with Equestria is essential."

STL_our_town_fortress:0 "The Fortress of Townsville"
STL_our_town_fortress_desc:0 "Friendship is all well and good, but Equestrian delegates have yet to offer any good suggestions on how friendship can be used against communist tanks and heavily armoured griffon knights. More practically, they can smuggle us large shipments of concrete, barbed wire and heavy machine guns to fortify with. How? Apparently, a cat is involved..."

STL_one_factory:0 "Our First Factory"
STL_one_factory_desc:0 "In a factory, every pony must work as one, each machine, each worker, doing their simple job with precision, again and again. No longer do we need to rely on the masterwork of the artisan or the specialist knowledge of the guildspony. In a factory all are equal."

#########EVENTS

starlight.1.t:0 "An Offer from Stalliongrad"
starlight.1.d:0 "Stalliongrad has successfully ended their food and political crises and looks to be once again on the road to prosperity. They have formally invited us become part of their nation."
starlight.1.a:0 "It was bound to happen..."
starlight.1.b:0 "Our Town, not yours!"

starlight.2.t:0 "The Return"
starlight.2.d:0 "The Communist Civil War in Equestria is not something that any pony could miss. Especially given the pony involved. So when we heard that the communists won, we knew they would be coming.\n\nI sat, hiding behind my tiny fortifications, waiting to see what they would do - bomb us, send an ambassador, or even starve us out.\n\nInstead, they sent one pony. THAT pony.\n\nStarlight Glimmer. Unescorted, Unruffled, Uncertain. Walking towards us.\n\nWe stared. The leader of the most powerful nation in the world, and our old Mayor. Beside me, Sugar Belle flinched and raised her rifle slightly, recalling trauma of muffins past.\n\nStarlight coughed. "So... it's been a while, hasn't it? Time, uh, flies... when you're running a war, you know?" She taps the ground nervously with her hoof. "So, we did it. Equality. No stealing cutie marks. No lies. Just... fairness." She looked away, eyes tearing. "I owe every one of you an apology for what I've done. You believed in Equality! Even when I didn't. You held true. Everything we did, it started with you."\n\nShe took a deep breath. "Even if you never forgive me... Will you join us? Will you help bring true Equality to Equestria? Teach the ponies of this land what we did, what we can do? Will you help us lead Our Nation?"\n\nShe rushed on "You can say no. Really. We'll leave you alone." I glanced doubtfully at the leader of one of the largest military powers on the planet, before I looked at my fellow ponies. Even with no time to consider, even with the war, the sheer insanity of it all, we knew the answer..."
starlight.2.a:0 "Welcome home, Starlight!"
starlight.2.b:0 "Leave, Starlight Glimmer, and never return."

starlight.3.t:0 "The End of Our Town"
starlight.3.d:0 "We have begun the painful process of beginning anew. Old signs and banners torn down, portraits of Starlight Glimmer burned, and old talents embraced again. Some ponies left the village, never to return. Others sat silently, staring into the flaming portraits of the best pony.\n\nBut at the end of it all, Double Diamond spoke. Of a New Equality. Maybe not an equality of cutie marks, but certainly of friendship, of work, of fairness. This was an Equality that could be believed in - even the Stalliongradians were making similar ideas work.\n\nThe ponies who had stuck by Double Diamond nodded and murmured in approval, and one by one left for their beds. Our Town was no more. Could New Equality work in an unkind world?"
starlight.3.a:0 "It's a start, at least."

starlight.4.t:0 "A Pro-Stalliongrad Policy"
starlight.4.d:0 "Double Diamond was elected as the new leader and we must pursue closer cooperation with our friendly neighbouring state, Stalliongrad. We can have their advisors and officers, helping with our military and professional constructors to observe our industrial build-up."
starlight.4.a:0 "Excellent."

starlight.5.t:0 "Message to Stalliongrad"
starlight.5.d:0 "Our representative delivered our message expressing the near unanimous desire for independence amongst the ponies of Our Town. The Stalliongrad ambassador frowned, and then forced a smile, expressing his understanding and reiterating their commitment to a society of equality."
starlight.5.a:0 "It could've been worse."

starlight.6.t:0 "Industrial Delegation Departs"
starlight.6.d:0 "We have sent a small delegation to request industrial assistance from Stalliongrad. We wish them our best."
starlight.6.a:0 "Its up to Stalliongrad now."

starlight.7.t:0 "Military Delegation Departs"
starlight.7.d:0 "We have sent a small delegation to request military assistance from Stalliongrad. We wish them our best."

starlight.9.t:0 "The Town Debates"
starlight.9.d:0 "The ponies of Our Town debate their future. ideas are sketched, philosophies argued, examples shown. A little bit of the old passion has returned, as ponies grapple with the question of the tomorrow they wish to live in. Ultimately consensus boils down to two paths - following in the footsteps of Equestria, or Stalliongrad."
starlight.9.a:0 "Its good to see interest reignited."

starlight.10.t:0 "Military Investments See Results"
starlight.10.d:0 "Much to our surprise, our increasing investment in the armed forces has seen strong results. Drilling, marching side by side, and putting aside fear for the greater good comes naturally to Equal ponies, leading to a fine fighting force.\n\nPonies who once looked at a rifle in horror now fire, load and charge with precision, finding comfort in their part of a greater whole."
starlight.10.a:0 "MREs are still better than our old muffins."

starlight.11.t:0 "The Delegation Returns"
starlight.11.d:0 "The defeated postures of our delegation told us the before anypony could speak. Stalliongrad had rejected our proposal for industrial assistance."
starlight.11.a:0 "Are they really Our Friends?"

starlight.12.t:0 "Stalliongrad Response"
starlight.12.d:0 "Stalliongrad has accepted our request for military support, providing a team of advisors to help train, organise and design our divisions."
starlight.12.a:0 "Excellent."

starlight.13.t:0 "Stalliongrad Response"
starlight.13.d:0 "Stalliongrad has denied our request for military advice, citing the difficulties we would have in fielding any substantive military force. They have not so subtly reminded us that should we join Stalliongrad, we would be under their full military protection"
starlight.13.a:0 "Et tu, Comrade?"

#election
starlight.14.t:0 "Preparing for an Election"
starlight.14.d:0 "The remaining ponies of Our Town have agreed - election shall be the way forward. Candidates have been invited to submit their names and two choices have emerged.\n\nThe first is Double Diamond, current defacto leader and the second in command after Starlight Glimmer. He speaks of the need to rebuild a New Equality, with cutie marks, based around fairness, friendship and equality. He notes the success of the neighbour Stalliongrad in their similar ideology. If Stalliongrad can succeed, why not in the birthplace of Equality?\n\nThe other is Feather Bangs. The renowned heartthrob has recently returned from Ponyville in Equestria, he speaks of what he has learnt there - of how Ponyville has seen success in a different way - a way where difference is allowed and balanced with friendship and compromise.\n\nNormally such ideas would be rejected in Our Town, but tired ponies look to him for a way out of their misery, and the shining smile of the town baker Sugar Belle on her trading trips to Ponyville speaks the truth of Feather's words. Others recall the visit of Ponyville Princess Twilight Sparkle, who first exposed Starlight Glimmer's deception."
starlight.14.a:0 "A big choice for a small town..."

starlight.15.t:0 "Election Day"
starlight.15.d:0 "A strange attitude pervades Our Town, of hope and foreboding alike. The candidates shake hooves in a final show of good will, before announcing the polls open.\n\nOne by one, the ballots are cast. The margin is small, but decisive..."
starlight.15.a:0 "Double Diamond Wins."
starlight.15.b:0 "Feather Bangs Wins."

starlight.16.t:0 "[STG.GetName] Offers Industrial Aid!"
starlight.16.d:0 "Our brave comrades in [STG.GetName] have offered to aid us in establishing our industry so we can better contribute to the greater prosperity of our nations."
starlight.16.a:0 "Excellent!"


starlight.17.t:0 "[STL.GetName] Requests Entry to our Faction!"
starlight.17.d:0 "To our surprise, Starlight Glimmer's old town of [STL.GetName] has aligned with Equestria and seeks entry into our faction. While we have no real reason to refuse, some whisper it may be a ploy."
starlight.17.a:0 "Welcome!"
starlight.17.b:0 "We have to decline."

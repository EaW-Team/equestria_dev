 POLITICS_FEATHERBANGS:0 "A local heartthrob, Feather Bangs lost his love interest to a Ponyville stallion. Quick to move on, Feather Bangs has come to realize that capitalism is necessary for the conditions to create equalism."

But Double Diamond's failures led to his removal, and it was decided a perfectly ordinary pony would be perfect to administrate Our Town in these difficult times. Surely history will vindicate this choice."
 POLITICS_TROCHANTER:0 "One of the most skilled cryptographers of VOPS, Trochanter plans to turn the communist statelet of Our Town into one big intelligence agency. Everyone will be monitored.

 ### Decisions

 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering:0 "Designing Utopia"
 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering_desc:0 "The §Pequal future§! awaiting us must be crafted carefully. Pushing too fast may cause §Rchaos§!, while going too slow may lead to §Rdoubt§! in the effectiveness of our leadership. We must be bold yet cautious."
 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."
 STL_write_new_stories:0 "Write New Stories"
 STL_write_new_stories_desc:0 "Literature has traditionally been a force of reaction, glorifying princesses and castles rather than ordinary creatures. That ends now. We will instruct our greatest authors to write about the beautiful, equal world we have before us."
 STL_reorganize_the_family:0 "Families for the Future"
 STL_reorganize_the_family_desc:0 "For too long, families have been organized around a hierarchical, unequal system. Some had many children, others none. As Caramel Marks laid out in her manifesto, communal child-rearing is the future."
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones:0 "The Union of Equal Little Ones"
 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones_desc:0 "Similar to the Junior Pioneers in Stalliongrad, we will form our own group for children. The Union of Equal Little Ones will blossom into a beautiful organization where children learn about the better world waiting for us all."
 STL_abolish_racist_language:0 "Synthesize a New Language"
 STL_abolish_racist_language_desc:0 "Unfortunately, racism still exists, because the ideas composing racism still exist. As a first step to eliminating racism forever, we will create a new language, in which it is impossible to even think racist thoughts."
 STL_new_military_division_design:0 "The Universal Army Unit"
 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."
 STL_horizontal_factory_life:0 "Establish a Horizontal Factory Structure"
 STL_horizontal_factory_life_desc:0 "Even in Stalliongrad, bosses still exist. This is an affront to equality at its most fundamental. We will replace these red plutocrats with a far better organizational structure."
 STL_the_song_of_liberation:0 "Codify Absolute Rights"
 STL_the_song_of_liberation_desc:0 "Being equal also means having the same rights. Starlight made a grievious error wtih her reeducation centers. We will never repeat that mistake. All creatures are created equal, and all creatures have inalienable rights."
 STL_glorious_future:0 "The Wondrous Future"
 STL_glorious_future_desc:0 "We are not a great power like Equestria, but we have begun a beautiful project here, and we will take it all the way. Nothing will stop our advance towards the light in the sky.\n\nOh wondrous future, please do not be cruel to us!"

 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase:0 "Our Airbase"
 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase_desc:0 "Night Glider is eager for a proper airbase to fuel our future airforce. We should look into this."
 STL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare a Stage of Siege"
 STL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the reactionaries are upon us. Now is the time to make sacrifices to protect ourselves and our future! Now is the time to fight!"

 STL_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "With our more capitalistic leanings now apparent, we can finally start to end our pariah status and invite foreign investments here. They will naturally be apprehensive at first, but the resources here are lucrative and eager to be exploited!"

STL_elections_desc:0 "How can ponies be equal if everyone cannot have the opportunity to lead it? Allowing a leader absolute power was our mistake, and we shall not allow it again. We shall consult, and then WE shall choose."

## COMMUNIST PATH ##
STL_neighbors_help:0 "Our Neighbours"
STL_neighbors_help_desc:0 "The ponies of Stalliongrad are kindred spirits - they may speak of workers and production instead of Equality, but the end result is the same. We should establish trade and seek industrial assistance."

STL_STG_military_advisors:0 "Our Stalliongrad Advisors"
STL_STG_military_advisors_desc:0 "Should the griffons ever advance south, we shall be the first to be hit. We must seek military support from our neighbours in Stalliongrad."

STL_independence_line:0 "Our Independence"
STL_independence_line_desc:0 "Stalliongrad at first responded positively to our efforts to establish relations, but now grow impatient, hoping we will join them. It is time to make clear - we shall remain independent, now and in future."

STL_industrial_effort:0 "Our Industrial Effort"
STL_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Our balancing act with Stalliongrad has paid off. The support offered, and our own hard work will lead to the development of two new factories. Ponies speak excitedly of the prosperity such investments shall bring. Is it too early to speak of Our City?"

STL_industrial_help:0 "Our Industrial Help"
STL_industrial_help_desc:0 "Like Stalliongrad, we have missed much of the industrialisation that has swept southern Equestria. Today, Stalliongrad is a case study in rapid industrialisation - our countries would be more equal if they were to share...."

STL_new_army:0 "Our New Army"
STL_new_army_desc:0 "Griffons to the north, Our 'Friend' to the south, and the giant of Equestria beyond that, looking to swallow us both. Our citizens must take up arms for safety, for the sad truth is that a bullet is the ultimate equaliser."

STL_demand_griffon_land:0 "Our Griffon Land"
STL_demand_griffon_land_desc:0 "We have gotten so used to referring to everything as 'Ours', that it's starting to get out of control. "Our caves", "Our mountains", "Our northern coasts". The idea of asking Nova Griffonia to give us all that land is getting to tempt. After all, it IS Ours."

STL_socialist_trade:0 "Our Expanding Trade"

STL_railroad_way_desc:0 "Whilst we have no need to build large rail systems, a small effort to integrate with other Equestrian rail lines and local systems of tramways and buses will help accommodate our swelling population.

STL_conquest_of_STG:0 "Our Stalliongrad"
STL_conquest_of_STG_desc:0 "Some of our cabinet have grown concerned, as Double Diamond appears to descend into madness, rambling about OPMs and world conquest. Others insist that a military genius is at work. Whatever the case, we gear for the unthinkable - War with Stalliongrad."

STL_our_town_fortress_desc:0 "Friendship is all well and good, but Equestrian delegates have yet to offer any good suggestions on how friendship can be used against communist tanks and heavily armoured griffon knights. More practically, they can smuggle us large shipments of concrete, barbed wire and heavy machine guns to fortify with. How? Apparently, a cat is involved..."

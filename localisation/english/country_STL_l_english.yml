 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering:0 "Designing Utopia"
 STL_double_diamond_social_engineering_desc:0 "The §Pequal future§! awaiting us must be crafted carefully. Pushing too fast may cause §Rchaos§!, while going too slow may lead to §Rdoubt§! in the effectiveness of our leadership. We must be bold yet cautious."
 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."
 STL_write_new_stories:0 "Write New Stories"
 STL_write_new_stories_desc:0 "Literature has traditionally been a force of reaction, glorifying princesses and castles rather than ordinary creatures. That ends now. We will instruct our greatest authors to write about the beautiful, equal world we have before us."

 STL_new_military_division_design:0 "The Universal Army Unit"
 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."
 STL_horizontal_factory_life:0 "Establish a Horizontal Factory Structure"
 STL_horizontal_factory_life_desc:0 "Even in Stalliongrad, bosses still exist. This is an affront to equality at its most fundamental. We will replace these red plutocrats with a far better organizational structure."
 STL_the_song_of_liberation:0 "Codify Absolute Rights"
 STL_the_song_of_liberation_desc:0 "Being equal also means having the same rights. Starlight made a grievious error wtih her reeducation centers. We will never repeat that mistake. All creatures are created equal, and all creatures have inalienable rights."

 STL_glorious_future_desc:0 "We are not a great power like Equestria, but we have begun a beautiful project here, and we will take it all the way. Nothing will stop our advance towards the light in the sky.\n\nOh wondrous future, please do not be cruel to us!"

 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase_desc:0 "Night Glider is eager for a proper airbase to fuel our future airforce. We should look into this."
 STL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare a Stage of Siege"

 STL_revise_quotas_downward:0 "Revise Quotas Downward"

 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal:0 "Allow Voluntary Cutie Mark Removal"
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal_desc:0 "Bizarrely, a few ponies want to have their cutie marks removed again. Mostly social outcasts and misfits, they have petitioned the government for the right to remove them. They are apparently completely sincere, citing the secure feeling of conformity and meaning when branded with an equal sign."
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery:0 "Create Heavy Fortified Artillery"

 double_diamond.3.d:0 "The crèche system seems to be effective, as children are able to bond more fully when they are grouped together in communal rearing. However, it remains to be seen how sustainable it is long-term, as we've only tested it for four months.

Therefore, the slavery of children to their parents will be abolished. The only question remaining is how extreme we should be in the childrens' liberation. We could have adults continue to have jurisdiction over the youngsters' safety, and otherwise leave them alone, or we could abolish even that and trust kids to look out for each other."

 STL_windbreaker:0 "Windbreaker"
 STL_windbreaker_desc:0 "Windbreaker is a Stalliongradian pony sent to the backwater commune of Our Town, nominally as part of a military attache. His expertise in motorized formations has been utterly worthless here, but his skill at supply acquisition has proven quite useful in the remote mountains. While an Equestrian Socialist, he's more sympathetic to the allure of Equalism than most."

STL_background_pony_1:0 "Flower Flight" 
STL_background_pony_1_desc:0 "If the first millennium was the millennium of monarchy, the second must be the millennium of republics. Flower Flight knows this, but she also knows that Celestia has done right by all the ponies of Equestria. If Celestia were unchained by the rules of federalism, imagine what she could accomplish! But that would only happen if instead of Princess Celestia, she were President Celestia. Such is this veterinarian's vision."

STL_background_pony_2:0 "Log Jam" 
STL_background_pony_2_desc:0 "Growing up as a lumberjack just north of Manehattan, Log Jam had a rough life. He came to resent the merciless sweep of modernity and industrialism. He fell in with a group of socialists around the time of the Winter Revolution, but their commitment to the city's proletariat felt off. Starlight's charisma swayed him for a time, but now he can see clearly again. The farmers and landworkers - not the city slickers - are the people who must come first."

STL_background_pony_3:0 "Maple Cheer" 
STL_background_pony_3_desc:0 "That capitalism is the most successful economic system the world has seen is not in doubt to this Whinnysota mare. But at the same time, that it produces horrible inequality is not in doubt either. For it to survive and live up to its potential, it has to be more than it is now. Just as unions are vital, so is welfare. Nocreature should ever go hungry, whatever the reason."

STL_army_pony_1_desc:0 "The revolution must be international in nature, there can be no question of that. But it must also avoid the trap of vanguardism. Redwood Oak has been a believer in councils ever since the death of Stallion and the disintegration of his party. As an engineer, he knows all too well the temptation to build from the top down, but the revolution can't risk that. Not with the world at stake."

STL_army_pony_2:0 "Ivy Vine"
STL_army_pony_2_desc:0 "As a childhood friend of Double Diamond, Ivy Vine's time under Equalism was better than some's. But all the same, Starlight's fraud shattered her faith in socialism entirely. No, the goal for reform had to be republicanism. In a republic, everyone can vote for whatever extremist candidates they want. While Celestia has sat and done nothing, a unitary republic could reshape the nation in a flash."

STL_air_pony_1_desc:0 "A member of the Albion weather team who was inspired by the stories of the Skynavian revolution, Rocky Storm journeyed to Our Town in hopes of a mirror of it. Now that Starlight is gone, she has soured on the idea of class war in general. Democratic socialism, with careful attendance to rights for all, must be the byword of the revolution."

STL_navy_pony_1:0 "Bacon Braids"
STL_navy_pony_1_desc:0 "As an Appleloosan farmer, Bacon Braids was little given to radicalism for most of her life. When Starlight sounded the call, she decided to give it a try. Now that Equalism no longer rules, she's synthesized some socialist ideas with her love of the land. Industrial work is well and good, but everypony needs to eat - why not socialise agriculture?"

STL_high_command_1:0 "White Marble"
STL_high_command_1_desc:0 "A mason from Vanhoover, White Marble is perhaps the biggest supporter of classical Glimmerism still around. While Double Diamond has spoken of a new equalism, he's not really sure what was inherently wrong with the old one. Sure, Glimmer was a tyrant and a hypocrite, but doesn't that just mean we need more Equalism, not less? Seems pretty clear to him."

STL_high_command_2:0 "Offbeat"
STL_high_command_2_desc:0 "Offbeat has made quite the turnaround since the days of Starlight. Once an avowed Equalist from Baltimare, she has now sworn to never again be chained. When she's not violating noise ordinances or ranting about how more mainline socialists have haunted minds, she can be found at her milk shop--though don't call it that to her face. She prefers the term "milk union of egoists"."

STL_high_command_3:0 "Sunny Song"
STL_high_command_3_desc:0 "Baltimare has its share of racial and ethnic issues, and Sunny Song wanted no part of that. The bats and jungle ponies are fine folks! He immigrated to Stalliongrad and then to Starlight's experiment, though between Baltimare and Glimmerism he's had quite enough of socialism for one lifetime. Liberal republicanism seems a whole lot less messy."

STL_high_command_4_desc:0 "Being a barista in Fillydelphia, Rosemary has had a rather unpleasant life. Attending the rallies of various far-left and far-right figures, she drifted from position to position wildly. After the end of Starlight's rule, she has gained a bit of notoriety as the only prominent nostalgic for those days. Holding that as only ponies have cutie marks to remove, only ponies can be truly equal, she has founded the "National Glimmerist Party", synthesizing radical Equalism with extreme ethnonationalism."

Her vision has attracted few followers in the egalitarian Town, but stands ready to assist us should we ever need her talents."

While not involved in the Winter Revolution, he was firmly in support, and when Starlight began gathering her followers, he was her first convert--and later, her chief enforcer.\n\nAfter she was exposed as a fraud, his faith in the ideology was shattered, like all of his peers. But unlike his peers, he gradually regained it. Starlight was a tyrant, yes, but her ideology wasn't inherently bad. After all, the quest for true equality was always a desire of the left, wasn't it? Why stop at just economic equality when societal equality could be achieved? Caramel Marks spoke of the creature-being who would be simultaneously perfectly selfish and perfectly selfless. Glimmer's attempt at creating an equal society was a bold step towards this, even though it was misguided.\n\nHis views are hardly popular in Our Town, and his mayorship has been rocky. Only a coalition government with the Our Town Communist Party and the Society for Equality of All Creatures was able to form a majority in the town council. But despite it all, he has never given up on his dream of a truly free society. With his term coming to a close, no one is quite sure how things will turn out now, or who will take the mayorship's next term...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"
 STL_leader_information_party_favor_tt:0 "§YPosition§!: People's Commissar of War\n\n§YBorn§!: 16th of June, 969 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: From his youth, Party Favor had two loves: balloon-making and socialism. He took part in the Winter Revolution personally, serving as a logistics officer in the brief conflict with Equestria. He fell in with Starlight's movement, but when the Elements of Harmony visited, he was part of the movement to overthrow her. With his cutie mark restored, he'd had enough of radical lunacy, and decided that Our Town needed to stick to the line established by Marks, Angel, and Stallion. Democratic centralism, for all its flaws, was still the best system possible under capitalist hegemony.\n\nHe founded the Our Town Communist Party along the concepts of Steel Stallion, and has since been the strongest proponent of closer relations with their southern neighbors. His friends know that his devotion to the Town's ideals is sincere, but some voters see him as a Stalliongradian plant, not helped by his brief membership in the SePo. He counters that any conflict with Stalliongrad would be totally disastrous, and closer cooperation is their only hope to survive in this brutal age of war.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"
 STL_leader_information_night_glider_tt:0 "§YPosition§!: People's Commissar of Aviation\n\n§YBorn§!: 9th of November, 978 in Las Pegasus\n\n§YBiography§!: Growing up in a place like Las Pegasus, Night Glider was never really at ease with capitalism. But she felt ill at ease with Stalliongradian class-war vanguard party rule as well. When Starlight formed her experiment, Night Glider saw the advertisements in the newspaper and jumped at the chance to join. The reality was less than she expected, but Starlight's charisma kept her around until the truth was revealed.\n\nNow that Our Town is free once again, she refuses to let it be chained again. A better kind of socialism, a socialism without violence, is still possible. And she intends to prove that to the world. Not by conquest, but by keeping the commune going as it has always been--balanced between three giants, but independent and open to all.\n\nNight Glider is without a doubt one of the most popular ponies in Our Town. If she had run for Mayor last election, she may well have won. When she announced her candidacy for this term, it was the talk of the town, and she is widely considered the frontrunner.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

She grew up a bit of a reactionary--never an avowed one, but she certainly thought little of Stalliongrad for seceding. Even now, she considers the secession a tragedy. Princess Celestia is without a doubt one of the kindest, greatest ponies to have ever lived. The Stalliongradians could have negotiated for reforms Equestria-wide, but let petty grievances and nationalism win out. Years later, and the "international socialist revolution" has hardly been very international. Socialism is necessary to alleviate the cruelties of capitalism, but the kind of things Stalliongrad have been up to are totally against the original spirit of that.\n\nIn her heart, she sometimes wonders if Severyanian culture is just more nationalistic and authoritarian than Equestrian culture, but she moved here specifically to quash those kinds of thoughts, and tries to push them down when they crop up. In her personal life, she is engaged to the brother of the Element of Honesty, and that has naturally shaped her views on foreign policy.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

As an aspiring pop star, he went to Our Town hoping to find likeminded individuals. Unfortunately, the collectivists ruthlessly trampled his spirit, until he was just another face in the crowd. Now that that nightmare is over, he is back to doing what he loves most - singing! He was convinced to apply for office by his manager, and has done a surprisingly non-disastrous job of introducing revolutionary song into the schools of Our Town.\n\nHis views are at least as controversial as Double Diamond's, wanting to invite foreign capital and align with the Nova Griffonians. He is terrified of the potential of Severyanian totalitarianism getting a hoofhold in the free commune, and remains convinced that Equestria is either unwilling or unable to aid them. Nova Griffonia may not be perfect, but they are rich, industrialized, and most importantly, not communist.\n\nWith a massive fanbase and thousands of attendees at his concerts, he may not have a coherent political theory or much experience in the realm of power, but he may just have the popularity needed to win big!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opal"

Those who called him a madpony are now stuck looking rather foolish themselves.\n\nWith free reign to implement his fanatical vision, Our Town is in for strange times indeed. His once-tepid, gentle rhetoric has given way to a hawkishness few would recognize. Starlight herself might be surprised to see him so eagerly advocating war to expand the revolution. While his opposition to methods such as cutie mark removal are well-known, many ponies are confused what Equalism even means without it. How does it differ from other forms of socialism anyway?\n\nDouble Diamond has no doubts. He has lived a life in accordance with the principles of Equalism. He will go farther than any of the red bureaucrats of Stalliongrad could ever imagine. The future beckoning is brighter than those fools can imagine. "The communism of the dirt", as he has taken to calling Stalliongrad's system? Primitive, limited, sterile, doomed.\n\nDouble Diamond's neo-Equalism will complete the entire paradigm of socialism, taking the best from every strain--from anarchism to Marksism-Stallionism. Ready your feeble defenses, hierarchists. Weep for the loss of your tyranny. For the final revolution is upon all--the end of history itself.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

 STL_form_the_equal_little_ones_desc:0 "Similar to the Junior Pioneers in Stalliongrad, we will form our own group for children. The Union of Equal Little Ones will blossom into a beautiful organization where children learn about the better world waiting for us all."
 STL_abolish_racist_language:0 "Synthesize a New Language"
 STL_abolish_racist_language_desc:0 "Unfortunately, racism still exists, because the ideas composing racism still exist. As a first step to eliminating racism forever, we will create a new language, in which it is impossible to even think racist thoughts."
 STL_new_military_division_design:0 "The Universal Army Unit"
 STL_new_military_division_design_desc:0 "Some divisions have tanks, and others don't. This is clearly unfair. The new idea of 'mechanized infantry' is an obvious solution, and will be rolled out across the entire army."
 STL_non_hierarchical_military:0 "Abolish Tyranny in the Military"
 STL_non_hierarchical_military_desc:0 "Why should a general command a private? Why should someone who has never seen combat be able to order thousands to their deaths? A fairer system will be designed, where all have a say."
 STL_horizontal_factory_life:0 "Establish a Horizontal Factory Structure"
 STL_horizontal_factory_life_desc:0 "Even in Stalliongrad, bosses still exist. This is an affront to equality at its most fundamental. We will replace these red plutocrats with a far better organizational structure."
 STL_the_song_of_liberation:0 "Codify Absolute Rights"
 STL_the_song_of_liberation_desc:0 "Being equal also means having the same rights. Starlight made a grievious error wtih her reeducation centers. We will never repeat that mistake. All creatures are created equal, and all creatures have inalienable rights."
 STL_glorious_future:0 "The Wondrous Future"
 STL_glorious_future_desc:0 "We are not a great power like Equestria, but we have begun a beautiful project here, and we will take it all the way. Nothing will stop our advance towards the light in the sky.\n\nOh wondrous future, please do not be cruel to us!"

 STL_give_night_glider_an_airbase_desc:0 "Night Glider is eager for a proper airbase to fuel our future airforce. We should look into this."
 STL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare a Stage of Siege"
 STL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the reactionaries are upon us. Now is the time to make sacrifices to protect ourselves and our future! Now is the time to fight!"
 STL_invite_foreign_capital:0 "Invite Foreign Capital"
 STL_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "With our more capitalistic leanings now apparent, we can finally start to end our pariah status and invite foreign investments here. They will naturally be apprehensive at first, but the resources here are lucrative and eager to be exploited!"

 STL_equalist_power_balance_decisions:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward:0 "Revise Quotas Downward"
 STL_revise_quotas_downward_desc:0 "Our quotas may be too high. Not everyone is able to meet them. In the interest of fairness and morale, it might be best to adjust them downward."
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia:0 "Stoke Glimmerite Nostalgia"
 STL_stoke_glimmerite_nostalgia_desc:0 "Strangely, some ponies miss the Starlight Glimmer days. While a return to that era is not at all what we want, it could still prove advantageous to pander to them to a degree."
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal:0 "Allow Voluntary Cutie Mark Removal"
 STL_allow_voluntary_cutie_mark_removal_desc:0 "Bizarrely, a few ponies want to have their cutie marks removed again. Mostly social outcasts and misfits, they have petitioned the government for the right to remove them. They are apparently completely sincere, citing the secure feeling of conformity and meaning when branded with an equal sign."
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery:0 "Create Heavy Fortified Artillery"
 STL_create_heavy_fortified_artillery_desc:0 "Our mountain home must be compmletely unassailable from any kind of attack. To that end, it is time to construct heavily fortified large-calibre guns capable of bombarding the enemy from afar."
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle:0 "Nothing But the Rifle"
 STL_nothing_but_the_rifle_desc:0 "A minority faction within our army believes that things like "artillery", "engineers", and other modern conveniences are totally unnecessary. According to their doctrine, infantry can overcome any obstacle with sufficient will and drive."

 STL_ng_interventions:0 "Intervene in Conflicts"
 STL_ng_interventions_desc:0 "As wars break out against across Equus, we cannot sit by as the forces of reaction and tyranny consolidate themselves. We must step up and help out our brothers and sisters in harmony and socialism! Sending lend-lease and volunteers is a worthy step, but if things get dire, we may have to intervene directly..."
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans:0 "Help the Nova Griffonian Republicans!"
 STL_GRF_help_the_republicans_desc:0 "The situation in Nova Griffonia has reached a breaking point. Just offering guns and volunteers to the republicans isn't enough. We must intervene directly! This goes beyond politics, it is a moral obligation to stop Highhill's brutality!"
 STL_YAK_assist:0 "Help the Yaks"
 STL_YAK_assist_desc:0 "The Yaks represent the forces of modernity, harmony and socialism, while their secessionist counterparts in the Jaki-Clan are the worst elements of old power hierarchies. We must step up."
 STL_CRY_assist:0 "Stop Sombra!"
 STL_CRY_assist_desc:0 "The horrors of Sombra's rule are the stuff of old legends come to life. We must put an end to this brutal repression!"
 STL_PLB_assist:0 "Help the Bears!"

 ########### Starlight Village ############
 STL_our_future_uncertain:0 "Our Future Uncertain"
 STL_our_future_uncertain_desc:0 "The five most important figures in our politics - Double Diamond, Party Favor, Night Glider, Sugar Belle, and Feather Bangs - cannot see eye to eye. Every town meeting leads to an argument, and nothing is getting done. Hopefully the January meeting will be more fruitful."

 STL_ally_griffons:0 "Closer to the Griffons"
 STL_ally_griffons_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia may be the weakest of the powers that surround us, but it brings several unique advantages to the table. Its thriving port cities provide access to the global market, and it has a large and growing communist movement led by Heinrich Redtail. Putting out feelers to Weter may be in our best interest."

 STL_ally_stg:0 "Closer to Stalliongrad"
 STL_ally_stg_desc:0 "Since Our Town was founded, Stalliongrad has always been our closest friend. The Revolution in Severyana was an inspiration to many leftist movements, including equalism, and their tacit support has allowed us to thrive in the mountains beyond Sovyenok. We should strengthen our ties with the home of the revolution by officializing our relationship."

 STL_ally_eqs:0 "Closer to Equestria"
 STL_ally_eqs_desc:0 "If it were not for Princess Twilight and her friends our ponies would still be suffering under Starlight's tyranny, robbed of their individuality. Equestria has shown us the way once, it can do so again. We should be looking towards Canterlot and the Crystal City for assistance. Despite our differences, we all share the values of freedom and progress."

 STL_feather_bangs_leads:0 "The Reaction of Feather Bangs"
 STL_feather_bangs_leads_desc:0 "Feather Bangs is a singer, popular among young ponies for both his talent and his looks. He is the most inexperienced member of our governing coalition and he wants to bring back capitalism, which many consider a betrayal of our core principles. Yet somehow, in spite of it all, he is finding crowds that want to hear about his politics as well as his music."

 STL_party_favor_leads:0 "The Orthodoxy of Party Favor"
 STL_party_favor_leads_desc:0 "Party Favor is a balloon maker and a fixture at parties throughout Our Town. He is also a Marksist-Stallionist and has come to represent Stalliongrad's influence on our politics. Our people tend to be a bit wary of the communists to our south, but Party Favor's charisma is starting to win them over. Taking some cues from Marksist theory is starting to sound pretty good."

 STL_double_diamond_leads:0 "The Neo-Equalism of Double Diamond"
 STL_double_diamond_leads_desc:0 "Double Diamond, our current mayor, is a true believer in equalism. After Starlight left he spent time rethinking her philosophy, refining it into something he calls "neo-equalism." This eclectic and unorthodox ideology didn't gain much traction at first, but now things are changing. Everyday more ponies find themselves listening to him, taking his ideas seriously for the first time."

 STL_night_glider_leads:0 "The Utopianism of Night Glider"
 STL_night_glider_leads_desc:0 "Night Glider has a knack for flying, both with her wings and in a stunt plane. Her daring air shows have made her a celebrity throughout Our Town and beyond. In politics she's come to represent an ambitious new idea she calls "equality without equalism." While some say she's got her head in the clouds, many others believe in the promise of a society that's truly free and equal."

 STL_sugar_belle_leads:0 "The Harmony of Sugar Belle"
 STL_sugar_belle_leads_desc:0 "Sugar Belle is a baker with close ties to Equestria. She's spent a lot of time away on extended trips to Ponyville, but no one doubts her commitment to Our Town and its ponies. Her message of embracing harmony and the Equestrian idea of friendship is picking up steam, attracting more followers by the day."

 STL_one_leader:0 "One Leader"
 STL_one_leader_desc:0 "The collapse of our governing coalition clearly demonstrates the problems with collective decision making. The only way to ensure a functional government is to choose one leader and entrust them with supreme authority. Some call this a return to tyranny, but surely a comrade in good standing will listen to the people."

 STL_centralized_state:0 "A Centralized State"
 STL_centralized_state_desc:0 "We respect the wishes of our people, but we cannot allow small disagreements to paralyze the government. Local leaders will have a few limited powers, while a central committee shall have the final say on all policy matters. Devolving authority any further would invite factionalism and inequality into our midst."

 STL_confederalist_state:0 "A Confederalist State"
 STL_confederalist_state_desc:0 "With our leaders divided on whether to devolve or centralize power, a compromise might provide the solution. The central government will have authority over all smaller localities, but a plurality of local leaders will be able to override its dictates. This confederal system will ensure all voices are heard without creating administrative chaos."

 STL_equestrian_model:0 "The Equestrian Model"
 STL_equestrian_model_desc:0 "In Equestria, local governments have a great deal of power, and their structure changes based on the desires of their subjects. This model, which has stood for centuries, should serve as our inspiration. All important powers shall be vested in small communities, who will be able to choose their own mode of government."

 STL_equal_footing:0 "An Equal Ally"
 STL_equal_footing_desc:0 "Our Town might not be the most conventional nation in the world, but it is a nation nonetheless. Any country unwilling to treat with us on an equal basis isn't a worthy ally. We will ask our chosen partner to grant us full diplomatic recognition and a mutual defense agreement."

 STL_powerful_friend:0 "A Powerful Protector"
 STL_powerful_friend_desc:0 "The world is becoming a dangerous place. If Our Town is to survive, it will need the protection of an established power with a strong economy and a large army. We must request a guarantee of independence from our chosen partner, before it's too late."

 STL_accept_our_reality:0 "Accept Our Reality"
 STL_accept_our_reality_desc:0 "In the game of diplomacy you can't get something for nothing. Small nations must always submit to their larger neighbors or risk being swallowed whole. We should offer our resources to our chosen partner in exchange for protection. It is a small price to pay to ensure our survival."

 STL_our_future_secured:0 "Our Future Secured"
 STL_our_future_secured_desc:0 "The most pressing issues have been settled. At the same time, the candidates are making their closing arguments and wrapping up their campaigns. Change is in the air, and our people are excited by the hope for a better future. All that remains is the election of our new leader."

 ### MILITARY
 STL_our_own_military:0 "Our Own Military"
 STL_our_own_military_desc:0 "With our political course laid in, we can finally get to work reforming our outdated, primitive military. One division is not enough for our needs, so we will expand our forces!"

 STL_night_gliders_experiment:0 "Night Glider's Experiment"
 STL_night_gliders_experiment_desc:0 "Being by far the most interested in aviation of any of our politicians, Night Glider is committed to the creation of a true air force for [STL.GetName]. In particular, she is quite fond of the idea of close air support--planes full of bombs to rain death upon enemy troops and logistics."
 
 STL_the_horizontal_lines:0 "The Horizontal Lines"
 STL_the_horizontal_lines_desc:0 "We are not a large nation, and thus must make the most of the space we have. The time has come to develop a heavy fighter, one capable of reaching far and shooting down enemy bombers. We will pour the air budget into something beyond cutting-edge: a Horizontal Lines super-fighter!"

 STL_strike_the_hives:0 "Strike the Hives"
 STL_strike_the_hives_desc:0 "With our newly-developed heavy fighters, we are in a position to conduct a daring raid deep inside enemy territory. A strategic bomber will prove to the world that we are not to be trifled with."

 STL_air_superiority_fighters:0 "Air Superiority Fighters"
 STL_air_superiority_fighters_desc:0 "Night Glider loves to fly, and is quite attached to her old I-15. But the fact is that it is showing its age. Perhaps it's time to focus less on grand projects like strategic bombers, and more on the humble light fighter."
 
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army:0 "The Centerpiece of the Army"
 STL_the_centerpiece_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army lives and breathes at the lowest level. No army can succeed without a motivated private. We will establish bottom-upp lanning committees to funnel information and ideas up the ranks efficiently."

 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation:0 "The Rifle of Our Nation"
 STL_the_rifle_of_our_nation_desc:0 "In Our Town, the infantrycreature is the bedrock of the army. We need new recruits to hold guns, and new guns for them to hold! Scrounging up every last gun we can find and increasing public investment in volunteer programs should find us some suitable eager warriors."

 STL_stableins_gambit:0 "Stablein's Gambit"
 STL_stableins_gambit_desc:0 "Did you know we have an admiral? It's true! His name is Valery Stablein and he has a long history of... sitting in his river gunboat and yelling across the border to Stalliongrad about how they're a degenerated workers' state? Anyway, he wants to build a navy, starting with some submarines. Why not let him have a go?"

 STL_freedom_convoys:0 "Convoy Guardians"
 STL_freedom_convoys_desc:0 "It turns out submarines get killed pretty easily by depth charges. We're gonna try and build some destroyers to protect our troops when they're on a naval invasion."

 STL_workhorse_of_fleet:0 "Workhorse of the Fleet"
 STL_workhorse_of_fleet_desc:0 "So destroyers can be killed pretty easily by light cruisers. But this time we've got a trick up our sleeve: we found out what kills light cruisers, and it's called a heavy cruiser! So we'll start researching them both so we aren't caught off guard again."

 STL_big_ships:0 "Big Ships"
 STL_big_ships_desc:0 "Okay, you know what? We're sick of this. Our ships keep getting sunk. We're gonna build the biggest ship ever, with the biggest guns ever, and nothing will sink it! It will be able to hit targets dozens of miles inland.\n\n\nWait, what is a carrier?"

 STL_training_and_logistics:0 "Training and Logistics"
 STL_training_and_logistics_desc:0 "It turns out that a lot of our troops are confused, hungry, or just plain inexperienced. If we are ever going to have a proper army, we'll need to know how to feed them and get them bullets. Quartermasters will be established to handle requisitions."

 STL_new_weaponry:0 "New Weaponry"
 STL_new_weaponry_desc:0 "As we've been focusing on getting our troops bullets and food, we've forgotten about modernizing their equipment. We need to step it up and make sure that the loyal daughters and sons of [STL.GetName] aren't going into battle with muskets."

 STL_increase_discipline:0 "Increase Discipline"
 STL_increase_discipline_desc:0 "While egalitarianism and democracy are core values of our great land, some soldiers have been taking advantage of us to live as more-or-less freeloaders. In two cases ponies even turned bandit! We need to train them right, and instill in them a sense that it is they who are the last guardian of their families and their way of life."

 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all:0 "The Red Army Stands Over All" 
 STL_the_red_army_stands_over_all_desc:0 "We have done it. With a modern army, navy, and air force, we are no longer just a mountain commune. We are a mighty force for the reactionaries to reckon with!"

 ### ECONOMY
 STL_a_new_millenium:0 "Our Position in a New Millennium"
 STL_a_new_millenium_desc:0 "As history has advanced, Our Town has not. If we are ever to be anything more than a backwater mountain, we must step boldly into the 1000s!"

 STL_industrial_sector:0 "Our Primitive Manufacturing"
 STL_industrial_sector_desc:0 "We stand little chance of competing on the great stage of Equus if we can barely put an assembly line together. The time has come to organize the disjointed communes and villages into a united nation!"

 STL_electronics_sector:0 "Our Lacking Telecommunications"
 STL_electronics_sector_desc:0 "There is barely a single radio tower in [STL.GetName], and it takes days for news to travel one end of the mountains to the other. Were we to be invaded, it's dubious if everyone would even be aware of the situation before the enemy stormed in. But soon there will be a radio in every home!"
 
 STL_heavy_industry:0 "Our Cottage Industry"
 STL_heavy_industry_desc:0 "We cannot fight without weapons, and we are currently severely lacking in them. A new factory will be created set into Golden Mountain, hopefully secure from attack."
 
 STL_bunker_down:0 "Our Need for Fortifications"
 STL_bunker_down_desc:0 "It's unlikely we will continue to enjoy the neutral and peaceful position we have for over a decade. We must prepare for the worst. As a counter-invasion is virtually unthinkable, our best option is probably to bunker down so hard it's not worthwhile fighting us."
 
 STL_new_research_methods:0 "New Research Methods"
 STL_new_research_methods_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer's dictatorship severely hampered our academic capabilities. The time has come to let a hundred schools of thought bloom and see what valuable ideas can be gleaned from them all."

 STL_closed_no_longer:0 "Closed No Longer"
 STL_closed_no_longer_desc:0 "With our newfound territorial acquisitions, we are finally able to leave behind our status as a pariah city-state. Trade shall flow through our villages once more!"
 
 STL_more_factories:0 "Increase Industrial Output"
 STL_more_factories_desc:0 "We must expand our industrial capacity! In both light and heavy industry, we lag far behind our neighbors. They will not take us seriously until we have some proper factories!\n\nOkay, they probably won't take us seriously then either."
 
 STL_acquire_rubber:0 "Acquire Rubber"
 STL_acquire_rubber_desc:0 "Rubber is useful for many things, from Night Glider's planes to Feather Bangs' motorized warfare. We need it, badly. Therefore we will found our first synthetic refinery right here in [STL.GetName]!"

 STL_rich_city:0 "Our City"
 STL_rich_city_desc:0 "From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, creatures are rejoicing as industry spreads throughout our little community. But now we face the curious problem of how to defend it all from hungry eyes..."
 
 STL_fortress_city:0 "Our Bunkers"
 STL_fortress_city_desc:0 "We must increase defensive preparations. Only through extreme fortification can we survive the days to come. Anti-air batteries will be constructed to defend our infantry and factories from the skies, and bunkers will be built to protect them at the frontline."

 STL_science_of_future:0 "Our Futuristic Science"
 STL_science_of_future_desc:0 "We must amplify our scientific goals. Through extensive allocation of resources to the hard sciences, we will soon be a center of learning! How does "Starlight University" sound?"

 STL_extract_the_mountain:0 "Our Mountain"
 STL_extract_the_mountain_desc:0 "The great mountain of Zlatogorsk, or Golden Mountain, is full of valuable ores waiting to be tapped. We must take advantage of this!"

 STL_expand_military_production:0 "Our Military Conglomerates"
 STL_expand_military_production_desc:0 "While we may not have the cruel exploitation that is so prevalent under capitalism, we still have designers and engineers eager to do a good job. Giving them the resources they need is a good investment."

 ### FEATHER BANGS

 STL_feather_bangs_wins:0 "Feather Bangs Wins!"
 STL_feather_bangs_wins_desc:0 "Somehow, the musician and heartthrob Feather Bangs has been chosen for the mayorship. With no real political experience, this should be interesting..."

 ### PARTY FAVOR

 STL_party_favor_wins:0 "Party Favor Wins!"
 STL_party_favor_wins_desc:0 "The Severyanian-backed candidate, Party Favor, has won the elections. He will likely align us closer with Stalliongrad, and his challenge will be to preserve our existence while doing so."

 ### DOUBLE DIAMOND

 STL_double_diamond_wins:0 "Double Diamond Wins!"
 STL_double_diamond_wins_desc:0 "Against all odds, the previous mayor Double Diamond has been reelected. Widely considered the longest shot, it seems the old has won out. No one is quite sure what he plans to do now."
 STL_denounce_old_excesses:0 "Denounce Old Excesses"
 STL_denounce_old_excesses_desc:0 "Starlight went way too far, and we have no intention of restoring her extreme measures. There will be no 'people's courts', no reeducation houses, no cutie unmarking. We are better than that. We have to be."
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering:0 "Benevolent Social Engineering"
 STL_benevolent_social_engineering_desc:0 "Social engineering is a loaded, dirty word, but it is nonetheless what we seek to accomplish. We will be the engineers of creature souls, going farther than any left-wing movement before. But we can only do this with the people's consent."
 STL_promise_a_future:0 "Promise a Brighter Future"
 STL_promise_a_future_desc:0 "A bright future awaits us, full of joy and hope, but it is not going to appear on its own. We have to create it, together."
 STL_different_yet_equal:0 "Different Yet Equal"
 STL_different_yet_equal_desc:0 "Everycreature's vote is worth the same, everycreature's life is as important, and everycreature's ability to contribute to our community is as significant. But we're different too. That doesn't make us better or worse, just different. We are equal despite our differences."
 STL_appoint_new_ministers:0 "Reshuffle the Cabinet"
 STL_appoint_new_ministers_desc:0 "Whlie Double Diamond has great respect for his friends, they simply can't do everything at once. With the recent electoral victory, we can finally open up cabinet spots for others who might wish to serve our great Town."
 STL_the_turning_point:0 "The Turning Point"
 STL_the_turning_point_desc:0 "Society has been heavily equalized, and we are ready for our next step. It is time to reveal our true intentions. Double Diamond didn't just win the election for himself, or even for Our Town. He won for Stalliongrad, for Equestria, for Equus, and ultimately for the world.

 STL_gearing_up_for_a_vision_desc:0 "Our Town has accompllished in months what Stalliongrad continues to fail to do after over a decade. Bloated with bureaucracy and incompetence and infighting, the Stalliongradians desperately need our help. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_equal_volunteers:0 "Equal Volunteers"
 STL_equal_volunteers_desc:0 "Creatures are joining our cause. The hollow platitudes and incompetence of our foes are driving them to us. We will fight on, not just for them, but for all of us. No matter how absurd the odds seem or how grim things may look, we will win. For an equal world!"

 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad:0 "An Equalist in Stalliongrad"
 STL_an_equalist_in_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Somehow, Double Diamond pulled it off. Among his cabinet he was widely considered a total lunatic, but he's proven them all wrong. The great equals sign now from Our Town to Stalliongrad to Ourhoof. We have won the war, and now we have to win the peace."
 STL_meet_with_the_left:0 "Meet with the Left"
 STL_meet_with_the_left_desc:0 "The Left of Stalliongrad has been... difficult to work with, but their ultimate goal - immediate revolution to the fullest extent - is something Double Diamond is very sympathetic too. After all, didn't we invade Stalliongrad to save the revolution in its home?"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture:0 "A New Proletarian Culture"
 STL_new_proletarian_culture_desc:0 "'Culture' thus far has been largely bourgeois culture, even in Stalliongrad. Bourgeois liberal nationalism has no place in our new society, and culture must adapt. We will create a culture like none seen before, a true Proletarian Culture!"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions:0 "Accept Cultural Pluralism"
 STL_accept_severyanian_distinctions_desc:0 "While it may not be optimal, the fact is our position is quite tenuous. Immediately forcing everyone to change their culture is extremely optimistic, even for us, and might endanger the revolution as a whole. We can deal with this matter more later."
 STL_our_sacred_war:0 "Our Sacred War"
 STL_our_sacred_war_desc:0 "Seizing Stalliongrad from the city-state of Our Town was a mighty accomplishment, but it will pale in comparison to our future goals. Those future goals will require countless soldiers, sailors, and aviators. While conscription is an ugly thing for a radically liberatory movement, leaving our siblings in chains is even uglier. We will not let them die in slavery!"
 STL_meet_with_the_center:0 "Meet with the Center"
 STL_meet_with_the_center_desc:0 "The Center in Stalliongrad is perhaps the one factino we have the least in common with. Nonetheless, they are similarly committed to democracy and revolution, and they have a large popular backing. With some reassurances that this revolution will maintain collectivization in Stalliongrad, they should be happy to work with us."
 STL_equalize_factory_work:0 "Equalize Factory Work"
 STL_equalize_factory_work_desc:0 "Under Equestrian Socialism, some factories stood above others in importance. This cannot be allowed to continue. The creature crafting a toaster is just as important as the one crafting a tank."
 STL_establish_direct_democracy:0 "Establish Direct Democracy"
 STL_establish_direct_democracy_desc:0 "The greatest error of the Equestrian Socialists is the belief that democratic centralism is democratic enough. Direct democracy must be enshrined as the basis of all politics. While we are not anarchists and do not believe in the abolition of representation entirely, referendums should be the basis of policy. Furthermore, the concept of recalling politicians must be restored to its rightful place. How did the Marksist-Stallionists forget this when it was right in both Marks and Stallion all along?"
 STL_tour_the_nation:0 "Tour the Nation"
 STL_tour_the_nation_desc:0 "Unfortunately, discontent and concern is still high in the Severyanian countryside since the collapse of the Stalliongradian establishment regime. Ponies are afraid we've come to decollectivize, or worse, to take away their cutie marks. The time has come for Double Diamond to go on a tour across the country, to answer questions and quell fears."
 STL_new_equal_friends:0 "New Equal Friends"
 STL_new_equal_friends_desc:0 "To limit ourselves to the borders of Equestria, or even to ponykind, is patently absurd. Equality transcends nation and culture. Why wouldn't it transcend species too? We are in a position to share our beautiful future with all the peoples of Equus. Who are we to deny them their salvation?"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship:0 "End of the Mayorship"
 STL_end_of_the_mayorship_desc:0 "The institution of Mayor was appropriate for the city-state of Our Town, but now we are running a nation-state. The time has come for the office to be abolished, and replaced with a more suitable head of state. Premier will work for the state office, and for the Stalliongradian Equalist Party, General Secretary."
 STL_our_nuclear_program:0 "Our Nuclear Program"
 STL_our_nuclear_program_desc:0 "What would have seemed comical several years ago is now manifest reality. Nuclear power will let us break the shackles of global capitalism and hierarchy. But will it be cheap power to undermine their plutocratic empires, or will it be the atomic hammer to smash their armies? Only time will tell."
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold:0 "Bring the Yaks into the Fold"
 STL_bring_the_yaks_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The yaks have known war and strife, with xenophobia and isolationism driving a wedge into their harmonic monarchy. Unfortunately, the local communists are no better than the isolationists or warlords! We march into Yakyakistan to free all yaks from their chains, no matter what color the chain-forgers may wear!"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse:0 "Unitary but Diverse"
 STL_unitary_but_diverse_desc:0 "Even as we reject federalization and local autonomy, we acknowledge that we are a vastly diverse revolution. Eradicating racism, nationalism, and other blights that divide the workers will take time, but we have the unstoppable force of will on our side!"
 STL_meet_with_the_right:0 "Meet with the Right"
 STL_meet_with_the_right_desc:0 "The Right Opposition's domestic values are superficially similar to ours, believing in multiparty democracy along with increased power to the people and away from the bureaucrats. Unfortunately, their foreign policy is hopelessly timid. Still, there's enough here to find common ground on. Perhaps we can all get along after all?"
 STL_invade_nova:0 "Invade Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invade_nova_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia has seen great strife, and sadly we must add to that strife. The people of Nova Griffonia are crying out for aid, and it falls to us to save them from their tyrants in their houses of gold."
 STL_invite_nova:0 "Invite Nova Griffonia"
 STL_invite_nova_desc:0 "While Redtail is hardly a paragon of Equalist values, he is probably close enough. With Stalliongrad now under our control, perhaps he will be willing to be accommodating? Stallion's right-hoof griffon could be a great ally..."

 STL_the_speech_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Our proud flag flies high over a sizable chunk of the continent. And now, storm clouds are rising in the East. If we are to finish our sacred revolutionary mission, we will have to decide what to do about Equestria and the Changeling Lands. While Equestria would no doubt balk at working with us, war does make strange bedfellows. Of course, we could try to fight them both..."
 STL_the_new_living_organism:0 "The New Living Superorganism"

 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments:0 "Begin the Friendship Project"
 STL_begin_true_friendship_experiments_desc:0 "We are doing something today that's never been done before. Something even a great revolutionary like Steel Stallion was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like we do. The lessons we've learned here in Our Town have taught us well. We have proven that we're ready."
 STL_design_a_new_religion:0 "Design a New Religion"
 STL_design_a_new_religion_desc:0 "The Marksist rejection of faith entirely, while understandable, loses a valuable unifying element. Faith can be a powerful motivator. The problem is that faith, thus far, has been a tool of capital and of other hierarchy. Therefore, we will create a new equal faith, passionate and liberatory, to underly our vision of a free future."
 STL_glorify_labor:0 "Glorify Labor"
 STL_glorify_labor_desc:0 "Under capitalism, labor is exploited, and so many workers think work is bad. Nothing could be further from the truth! In labor is found glory. The work of crafting, this is a mighty, noble task! Under Equestrian Socialism, labor is less exploited, but still is not the worker's own. Anarchism, social democracy, syndicalism--none of these can truly free the worker! But under the great equals sign, all become one!"
 STL_agrarian_kindness:0 "Agrarian Kindness"
 STL_agrarian_kindness_desc:0 "We are not fanatical industrialists, who see the world only as a list of resources to be exploited. The pastoral, agrarian life is one as noble as that of the factory worker. The Marksists prioritized the industrial proletariat at the expense of the peasantry. We will roll out modern agricultural equipment across all farming regions of our nation, through Machine Tractor Stations!"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability:0 "From Each According to their Ability"
 STL_from_each_according_to_his_ability_desc:0 "The army is seldom an ally of revolution, being full of nationalists and warmongers. After all, when we prevail, there will be no more war, and they will all be out of a job! But under the right circumstances, equalists and soldiers can march side by side. And the great Red Army of Stalliongrad is a perfect example of that cooperation. We will learn from them."
 STL_a_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
 STL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of Our Town was suitable for a city-state, but not a nation-state. But the basic ideas - multiparty democracy where any leftist can compete, centring the councils over the legislature, and recalling all state and party officials at any time - will persevere. People in our revolution are the basis of all politics, and that will never change."
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life:0 "Guarantee a Good Life"
 STL_guarantee_a_good_life_desc:0 "Life under capitalism is miserable, as we all know. Under Equestrian Socialism it is far better, but still not good enough. The most important aspect of Equalist doctrine is the welfare of the people, which must always take primacy over other goals. However, we must be careful not to turn into an isolationist enclave--the peoples of other lands need to be liberated too!"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year:0 "Elections Thrice a Year"
 STL_elections_thrice_a_year_desc:0 "Aside from the ability to recall officials, the term of office must be short to prevent conservatism. 120-day terms are suitably short."
 STL_the_new_coalition:0 "The New Coalition"
 STL_the_new_coalition_desc:0 "Thus far, Double Diamond's party has not ruled alone. Party Favor's Our Town Communist Party and Night Glider's Society for Equality of All Creatures have been our junior partners. While we will not turn our back on these old friends, the Severyanian Communist Party and the newly-formed Socialist Revolutionaries of Equus are eager to work with us as well. Why shouldn't we cooperate?"
 STL_truly_fair_voting:0 "Truly Fair Voting"
 STL_truly_fair_voting_desc:0 "Simply putting a voting booth in every town and commune is not good enough. Election Day will be a national holiday and internal administrative divisions will be redrawn to be more representative. This will upset some conservative voices, but we must let everyone's vote count the same."

 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs:0 "Chrysalis in our Crosshairs"
 STL_chrysalis_in_our_crosshairs_desc:0 "We have no quarrel with the changeling people, and we weep for every life we must take. But Chrysalis is a mad conqueror devoted to the destruction of everything other than her own insane ambition. We will not let this tyrant continue to oppress Equus!"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation:0 "Salvage our International Reputation"
 STL_salvage_our_international_reputation_desc:0 "Our invasions of Northern Equus have given us quite a bit of infamy worldwide, even as we strove to free and liberate the peoples there. Many harmonist nations are still hesitant to sell us vital resources. We should reassure them that these wars were necessary to save the creatures there, just as this war with Chrysalis is."

 STL_war_plan_equality:0 "War Plan Equality"
 STL_war_plan_equality_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Equestria will never be willing to implement liberatory policies. Caramel Marks learned that when Celestia rejected her proposal. We will just have to invade the rest of the continent at once. Some will say that is impossible, but we already defeated Stalliongrad as a city-state. We will prevail."
 STL_ultra_industrialization:0 "Ultra-Industrialization"
 STL_ultra_industrialization_desc:0 "Factory work is a glorious affair, and out of it comes countless benefits both internal and external. But for this coming war, we will require a grim number of arms factories. Our troops must be well-equipped to prevail!"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality:0 "The Lockstep Legions of Equality"
 STL_lockstep_legions_of_equality_desc:0 "Equality goes beyond a philosophy. It is the next stage of socialism! Dialectical materialism fails because it puts material conditions above creatures' willpower. Nothing is impossible for a sufficiently motivated creature."
 STL_the_final_steps:0 "The Final Steps"

 #########EVENTS

 starlight.1.t:0 "Our Cozy Little Meeting"
 starlight.1.d:0 "As noon broke over the idyllic Town, hundreds of stallions and mares flocked to the small, neat building tucked in the middle of the peaceful settlement. Inside, congregating together and out towards the public were five ponies, all with remarkably different appearances and goals. In the center, with a gentle appearance befitting a mail-stallion rather than a mayor, was the soft-spoken Double Diamond. To his left was the red-headed baker known as Sugar Belle, a harmonic socialist mare who blended the two usually-conflicting ideologies together into something she believed would work - something notably more sympathetic to Equestria. To his right was the sharp-haired mare known as Night Glider, the Town's local aviator and collector of used planes who practiced Utopian Socialism - an old form decried by modern communists, but one that would perhaps fit better in the quiet streets of the Town.\n\nOn the far ends were the two representatives most of the Town wasn't particularly fond of, at least when it came to their beliefs. Party Favor, the curly-haired charismatic balloon-maker, stood on the podium dressed in full Stalliongrad garb, shamelessly displaying his ideology. Wrapping around to the other side was finally Feather Bangs, the Town's local celebrity and talk of the town, appearing not nearly as professionally as the rest, but still holding a sort of young stallion's pop flare to them; a capitalist at heart, he was sympathetic enough to the equalist cause to be elected into the council, though his desire to attract Nova Griffonian investment is seldom mentioned, even if he believed it to be a good idea.\n\n"Thank you one and all for attending this meeting." Double Diamond softly spoke, the lull of his voice snapping the attention of the sleepy crowd. "I would like to start by saying that we have gone far ever since Starlight's saddening hypocrisy was revealed, but I am certain that we can go much farther." There was a strong will behind that voice, masked by a pleasant and kind tone. "For the equalist cause, there is nothing we can't all overcome, together!"
 starlight.1.a:0 "The applause was silent; but as one joined another, it was soon enough a chorus."
 starlight.1.b:0 "Ponies shifted awkwardly in their seats, awaiting the saner speakers to continue."


 starlight.2.t:0 "Feather Takes the Spotlight"
 starlight.2.d:0 "Feather Bangs rubbed his hoofs together. This was it. This was the day. This was where the slick city boy would go out and make a splash on the big scene. Well, it wasn't the big scene - he wasn't an actor prancing around in Canterlot, but this was... this was better than that! There was something more to this than just hitting on girls and relying on his melodic voice to swoon the crowd. His crowd wouldn't be gawking teenagers, but worried adults, hoping and hoping they'd listen to something that wasn't the drivel Starlight fed them all those years back. He'd be better than that!\n\nHe looked over the crowd in front of him. The town hall gathered again just for him, and there was a bigger crowd than he anticipated. He could see tired eyes, not particularly interested in his swagger and his modern hairstyle, but the politics he'd bring to the table. A deep breath coursed through his lungs. He could do this. Fake it 'til you make it, he thought; a mantra he had since his high school days.\n\n"What is up, everypony?" He asked, a bright smile on his face as he looked over the crowd. "I know we're all pretty bummed out about what's been going on in our town, and honestly, you're right, it sucks." Keep going, Feather, keep that momentum up. "But it doesn't have to be like that! Have you guys looked out at what the rest of the world is doing while we were busy suckin' up to Starlight and getting our marks removed? They've been gettin' modernized and stuff! Meanwhile, we've been too afraid of pushing past equalism to get with the times." A spike of anxiety. Feather swallowed, hoping no one would notice. "Maybe it sounds crazy, but I want to try what they do. All that capitalism stuff, about bringing in wealth and businesses and letting everyone do the thing they're good at - why not? Is that really so bad?\n\nFeather exhaled, watching the crowd closely and nervously. He expected silence, or even booing, but instead..."
 starlight.2.a:0 "Confused yet intrigued murmurs breached the crowd. Something new, something... good?"

 
 starlight.3.t:0 "A Party in Our Oblast"
 starlight.3.d:0 ""Hi, everyone!" Party Favor began strong. Though many eyed him oddly for wearing an entire Stalliongrad costume, with more than a few rumors that he was taken away and brainwashed by Stalliongrad agents or something as ridiculous as that, it was undeniable that most people liked him quite a lot. He made balloons! What wasn't there to love? Well... whenever he started going off about theory, probably.\n\n"I'm so glad you could all come to my speech today. The elections are coming up soon, and I suppose it's my job to try and convince you to vote for me!" He said, giving a short laugh. "That's just how it is! Now, let's get into the important stuff." He cleared his throat, and pointed a hoof towards the roof of the ceiling.\n\n"Gentlemares and stallions alike, we've got a growing to-be superpower right below our town! And I'll be honest, I think they've got some great ideas we could borrow from them. Do you know how they work? They've got a group of ponies that debate each other but all work together for the collective. Kind of like equalism, but there's enough smart ponies in there to prevent any silly ideas from running about the place!" It seemed like Party Favor had brushed up on his way to interest the crowd in communist theory, because now, they were listening.\n\n"And they're all about catching up to industry and infrastructure! Sure, we might not be nearly as big as they are, but shoot, if we were making progress half as fast as they were, we'd be having pie parties every day, not just every month! I know, I know, it sounds hard to believe, but here's one little nugget of truth I'll leave you with: if we become good friends with Stalliongrad, we'll have a big, nice state protecting us and giving us huge avenues of trade! They might ask for things like Marksist collectivization and a vanguard party, but if it's worked for them, you bet it'll work for us too!"
 starlight.3.a:0 "While most didn't really know a thing about Marksist theory, it did sound appealing..."


 starlight.4.t:0 "Double Diamond's Double Time Speech"
 starlight.4.d:0 "Rather than climbing up to a podium and holding a speech in the town hall, Double Diamond had decided to stay true to his principles and instead speak right outside the building, on the steps to it, a symbolic gesture. Everyone knew that he was Starlight's right-hoof mane, but at the same time, he was one of the first to oust her. Yet he still held a firm belief in equalism, and there was a sort of undeniable zealous passion whenever he spoke about it, if not a little on the disturbingly energetic side.\n\n"Friends of Our Town," Double Diamond began, head held high and confident, "I urge all of you to look at how tragically little we've done in the years that have passed since Starlight left. We were all afraid of equalism, and what bad things it could do to us. But Starlight's Equalism was a far cry from what it can be! Equality isn't about removing our cutie marks, and removing who we are. It's about making sure we're all working towards a better future. It's about no one being left behind, and no pony having the ability to exploit another!" Double Diamond was firm in his words, and though some ponies still held suspicion that this would simply be a repeat, many more knew Double Diamond was honest - unlike Starlight. He truly believed in the cause.\n\n"So I ask you, personally, not as some sort of ruler, figurehead, or party leader, but as a friend to another friend." Double Diamond smiled at the quiet crowd. "Give equalism another chance. There was a silver lining in some of the things Starlight said, even if it was ultimately a charade. I truly, honestly think that seeing it realized - the real equalism - will give everypony a chance to be happy and healthy!""
 starlight.4.a:0 "You can't doubt his honesty, at least."


 starlight.5.t:0 "Night Glider Takes the Lead" # HISTORICAL
 starlight.5.d:0 "After every speech before the crowd of towncreatures always came a smaller, more private meeting just between the members of the council. They were sometimes productive, but with the encroaching elections of the mayor they were becoming more tense and broody, and the latest one seemed to be no exception. However, Night Glider was determined to change that.\n\n"Friends!" She began talking excitedly, hovering above her chair. "I know the last months have been hard for us, and I know that we don’t think alike on lots of topics. But do you remember when times were different? When all of us - no, everyone in Our Town - struggled to make this place work? We made something here because we stayed together and persevered. There is a foundation of something beautiful, achieved by our hooves! The Town can become a true beacon of hope and equality for every creature across Equus, maybe even across the whole world, but only under one condition: the divisions in this room must end. No matter who gets the office, all of us must help them." She paused, observing the room, before finishing the speech with a question. "Are you with me?"\n\nFeather Bangs was the first to nod eagerly, charmed by the enthusiasm so rarely found in the show business industry. Sugar Belle and Double Diamond, both quite tired of fighting and agreeing with Glider, if for somewhat different reasons, joined next, and even Party Favor, seeing his "non-ideological comrades" in consensus, decided to not add a remark regarding the necessity of class struggle. For the first time in a while the council was in accord, and maybe a leader was already ascending among them."
 starlight.5.a:0 "Her vision will save Our Town!"

 starlight.6.t:0 "A Cherry Blossom in a Field of Rye"
 starlight.6.d:0 "In a grassy clearing just outside Our Town, two ponies sat together on a picnic blanket. One of them was a pink unicorn mare, the other a large red stallion. The chilly evening air didn't seem to bother them as they looked lovingly into each other's eyes.\n\n"Today's campaign speech went really well," said Sugar Belle, "Don't you think?"\n"Eeyup." replied Big Mac.\nSugar Belle smiled and looked towards the town.\n\n"Those ponies were very skeptical at first," she continued, "and I was so nervous I nearly shook, but in the end I think I got through to them. They're starting to understand that friendship and harmony doesn't mean the return of inequality and exploitation. If we keep at it I think I can win this race, and then once I'm the mayor we'll really have to start..."\n\nShe paused, noticing Big Mac's frown.\n"You still don't like that I'm running for mayor, do you?"\n"Nope." he replied, his voice full of concern.\nSugar Belle put her hooves around his neck.\n\n"I know you think things up here are awfully dangerous, and I know you wish I had taken that apprenticeship with Mrs. Cake in Ponyville, but I can't just leave. This is my home, and these ponies are my friends. I have to show them that there's a better way to live. I'd never forgive myself if I ran away in their time of need."\n\n"I know." Big Mac said with a sigh.\n\n"Don't worry," Sugar Belle said excitedly, "no matter what happens I promise we'll be together. You've given me so much help already, and I'll need you even more if I become mayor. It's your love that keeps me going, it inspires me. Other ponies deserve to be as happy as we are."\n\nAs the sun started to dip beyond the horizon, the two ponies shared a kiss."

 starlight.10.t:0 "The Future of Our Town"
 starlight.10.d:0 "The quiet city, normally withdrawn and peaceful with its day-to-day-activities, became abuzz with ponies up and active from practically every corner, signing off their votes, encouraging voters to choose a certain future leader, or doing the vote counting. Talk of the election winner was all that dominated conversation, and the turnout was truly staggering, with several election ballots having long queues from the sheer quantity of energetic ponies voting. Once the election was over, the process of counting began - something that kept thousands of ponies up throughout the night in sheer anticipation. Yet, as morning came, the news broke, and the people held their breath.\n\nWho had won?"
 starlight.10.a:0 "Feather Bangs and Prosperity!"
 starlight.10.b:0 "Party Favor and the Immortal Science!"
 starlight.10.c:0 "Double Diamond and Equality!"
 starlight.10.e:0 "Night Glider and Utopia!"
 starlight.10.f:0 "Sugar Belle and Friendship!"



 starlight.12.t:0 "The Town Anthem"
 starlight.12.d:0 "A public debate in the town hall raged between the five Town leaders on a contentious, all-important topic. Which anthem would represent the Town best? It seemed like there was no end to the discussion as each shared their options. "Starlight's song, though it misled us at first, I believe still holds a good message to aspire to." Double Diamond said. "For all the pain it may have caused, we can take that power back into our hands! Of course, not everything would stay, but the core is still the same. We're all meant to be happy here!"\n\nParty Favor cut in with a polite clearing of his throat. "That is absolutely true, but I would say that the Internationale is a perfect song for the common creature. Have you ever sung it? It's beautiful! I'd say it'd bring a tear to the working pony's eye, and I'd want all of us to be reminded that we fight for our rights every day, just like we are right now." He gave the crowd a beaming smile, but Night Glider glared at him.\n\n"Come on, Party Favor, can't you give an idea that isn't part and parcel from Stalliongrad? Workers of the world have their own song! It's called the United Front Song!" She said. "And I'd say it's got a better tune than the Internationale." She added in. Party Favor gave her a very disappointed look, but she only returned a smug smile.\n\n"All this fluffing up is just silly, I'd say. What about The Heart Carol? I think it's perfect not just for ponykind, but especially for us!" Sugar Belle's smile to the crowd was pleasant and reserved, unlike Party Favor's. "It warms your heart and makes you remember all the friends and family you've got supporting you."\n\nThe black horse out of this entire debate was Feather Bangs. He frankly had no idea what to add in. The closest thing he could wrack his brain was his hit single "Cutie", but... no one really seemed to take it seriously, so he opted to skip his turn to speak whenever it came up, to his muted embarrassment."
 starlight.12.a:0 "Life is so grand in Our Town, we're always filled with cheer..."
 starlight.12.b:0 "Arise ye prisoners of starvation, arise ye wretched of the earth..."
 starlight.12.c:0 "March on in the Workers' United Front for you are a worker too!"
 starlight.12.e:0 "As dawn shines on us every morn, the Fire of Friendship is reborn..."


 starlight.13.t:0 "The Army Budget"
 starlight.13.d:0 "With the clear abstaining of Night Glider (citing that "she really doesn't care about land combat"), only four were left on their podiums to discuss another major aspect of the Town's budget. Though the army was miniscule... practically non-existent... most considered it a worthy cause to argue about. Feather Bangs had started with a thundering proclamation that the Town would use tanks to roll over anycreature who wanted to strip away the Town's freedom - a bold claim that received odd stares and confused huh's from everyone else, though there was some mild approval here and there.\n\n"A gun in every soldier's hooves is the first thing you need to protect yourself!" Double Diamond spoke. "What else comes first before that? We want to all come together, then everypony bravely helping protect our community will need the best firearms they can get their hooves on." He said, nodding to himself.\n\n"The best guns won't do you any good if you keel over before you get it!" Sugar Belle said, irritated by how short-sighted Double Diamond seemed. "What about everything before that? The radio, the hospital? Keeping the actual gun in check? All of that's important too, you know."\n\n"And none of that," Party Favor began, "matters if you've got big enough guns to blow your enemies up skyhigh. I don't mean like a rifle, no, I mean like an artillery piece! I've seen a couple in action when I was in Stalliongrad, and let me tell you people: just a couple of those, and you'll never have to fear a reactionary coming your way!"
 starlight.13.a:0 "The infantrycreature must be our first concern!"
 starlight.13.b:0 "With big guns, we're blow the reactionaries away!"
 starlight.13.c:0 "Hospitals can save our injured and sick!"
 starlight.13.e:0 "Tanks will punch through the enemy lines!"


 starlight.14.t:0 "The Annual Sunset Festival"
 starlight.14.d:0 "Perhaps the most unpleasant debate of the hour was about the Sunset Festival. That day, it was just Party Favor and Sugar Belle arguing on who would be the one to organize it - and the air quickly turned uncomfortable and borderline hostile.\n\n"If you got the keys to the Festival, all you would do is just put up the Stalliongrad flag everywhere! All hammers and sickles and reds, don't you have any other color scheme?!" Sugar Belle asked. "The Festival has no right to be so ideological! It's just about celebrating us - our Town, we as people. Why does it have to be some platform for your Marksism thing?"\n\n"Because it's in our lifeblood, Sugar Belle!" Party Favor replied, his normally cheerful demeanor having dropped to a carefully irritated one. "I'm not saying the Festival would just be about Marksism-Stallionism, but yes, I would include it. It's part of our liberation. It's the worker's ideology, and even if you hate that word, Stalliongrad shows every day why that's true!"\n\n"Is that all it is?" Sugar Belle asked, growing restless. "Stalliongrad this, Stalliongrad that - we're not their puppet!" There was disappointment in her eyes. Party Favor frowned. "The Festival will be just fine without having their banner painted on every street. We'll celebrate things our Town is known for. Not what some other country is doing."\n\nParty Favor sighed. "That's the kind of naivety I'd expect from you, Sugar Belle." The both of them exchanged glances, both disappointed and angry, as the crowd was left to sort out who would lead the festival."
 starlight.14.a:0 "Party Favor is right - you can't forget the struggle."
 starlight.14.b:0 "Sugar Belle is smart, why not just have fun?"

 starlight.11.d:0 "Today, a vote of no confidence was established and passed with a majority vote, determining Double Diamond to be an incapable leader. While he did attempt to hold an impromptu speech about how they had it all wrong and that they needed to give him a chance, a tomato had struck him in the face, stunning him for long enough so that some ponies wrangled him and, quite literally, booted him out of office.\n\nIn a display of impatience and uncertainty, however, as nobody knew what would happen after Double Diamond's forced resignation, a crowd of ponies approached a pony who happened to be walking by that day next to the town hall, accosting him and demanding to know his political expertise. Claiming to be a tailor by the name of Burlap, they had asked him if he was willing to become Our Town's next mayor, to which he gave an anxious shrug. The crowd decided that that was as good a sign as any, and promptly shoved him into the town hall to be appointed as mayor."

 double_diamond.14.d:0 "Double Diamond was not a pony who loved giving speeches, but today's occasion warranted one. He glanced across the table, to his old friends, and began. "My comrades, we have a grave problem on our doorstep. Even as we continue to refine the theory and practice of equalism and the broader movement of revolutionary liberation, our neighbors in Stalliongrad choke under the stifling weight of bureaucracy. How can we speak to international camaraderie when our own so-called friend has fallen so far from the spirit of 995? Stallion was a flawed leader already, but he'd be sickened if he saw what happened to his beloved revolution!"\n\nParty Favor shifted uncomfortably as Double Diamond continued. "The Left Opposition, the Right Opposition, the Center - they're all lost! None of them understand the true mission! Our goal, the sacred goal of Marks, Angel, Stallion, and Glimmer, has always been to liberate all the creatures of the world through the abolition of hierarchy and the establishment of true peoples' democracy. But the bureaucracy suffocates the people in endless forms and papers, inserting the state into every aspect of society!" As Night Glider motioned to interject, Double Diamond unleashed his bombshell. "We cannot abide such an anti-populist stain upon the name of socialism! That is why, my friends, we must launch an IMMEDIATE INVASION OF STALLIONGRAD!"\n\nThe room exploded into shouts of shock and indignation. Feather Bangs was white as a ghost, and Sugar Belle looked about to faint. Night Glider cried, "Double Diamond, have you lost your mind!? Stalliongrad is easily ten times stronger than us, maybe twenty!"\n\n"They've only ever been good to us!" Party Favor protested. "Turning against them would be like a foal betraying their parents!"\n\nDouble Diamond sighed. "Yes, I know it will be difficult, and it will be controversial. We are outmatched militarily, industrially, and politically, and many ponies see Stalliongrad as our friends. But we have something the red bureaucrats lost a decade ago: a fully mobilized, revolutionary populace. A populace ready to march into Tartarus itself to break the chains of the people. As for its necessity? Look at what the red bureaucrats did to the revolution. And I know there is absolutely nothing that can stop a sufficiently determined pony, and I believe that we, the great commune of Our Town, have that determination." As the others stared in disbelief, he paused. "But to find out, we'll have to hold a referendum. Only if the people want war will I declare it.""

As he took the podium before the Supreme Soviet, there was a fire in his eyes few grasped. He took a deep breath, and began. "The harmonists are fond of saying that history arcs towards friendship, and in that they are correct. Cruel methods of rule such as absolute monarchy, serfdom, and secret police are on their way out, historically speaking. But where the harmonists make an error is believing they are the true heralds of friendship. I ask, what friendship is there between even a benevolent President-Marshal and a common factory worker, or a Princess and a peasant? What friendship can there be, indeed ever, between those with different access to power? If you are subordinate to another, you are not their friend--you are their vassal."\n\nHis eyes narrowed. "And for too long, the forces--the true forces--of friendship have sat idle, the province of children and childlike dreamers. For all her faults, Starlight Glimmer dared to dream of a better way, just as Caramel Marks did before her, and moreover she dared to make that dream a reality. What we are building here in Our Stalliongrad goes beyond the simple socialized economy of our predecessors, beyond the wildest dreams of the utopians of Equestria, and even beyond what Caramel Marks herself only dared to hint at as the creature-being." A grin split his face, even as he started to feel lightheaded. "What we are building, my friends, is nothing less than the ultimate culmination of friendship itself! Soon, history will--"\n\nAnd Double Diamond hit the floor, unconscious."

 double_diamond.23.d:0 "Double Diamond floated in an astral void, as a strange vision floated before him. It was the flag of Equestria, yet drawn in the colors of Our Stalliongrad, and with a great equals sign replacing the symbol of the princesses. It waved beautifully, and he had no doubt this was their destiny... but what did it mean? As the vision faded, he awoke to his friends standing over him worriedly. "Are you alright, Double Diamond?" Night Glider asked.\n\nHe got to his hooves, uneasily. "Yes, urgh... my speech..." He brushed his friends' worries aside, and retook the podium.\n\n"As I was saying, soon history will prove us to be not merely socialists, but the vanguard of friendship itself. And that starts here, now. True peoples' democracy! Government comprehensible to its citizens! Solidarity among every people and every culture! A world where none is exploited, and none is exploiter! As the continent burns under the mad dreams of reactionary conquest, the time has come to take a stand for what is right. For true friendship, for true harmony, for true equality, and for the unimaginably bright future that awaits us. That is why, my friends, I have decided to ask your help in a great endeavor." At last, he hesitated. He had come here to urge the Supreme Soviet to vote for joining the continent-splitting war. But could his vision mean that their destiny was to save the people of both sides, just as they had Stalliongrad a few years ago? As he settled on the answer, he opened his mouth once more.

 night_glider.1.d:0 "The first grand speech of the newest mayor of Our Town was highly anticipated by thousands of mares and stallions gathered before the city hall under clear blue sky. Of course, Night Glider’s passion and appeals to the spirit of the community had carried her to victory in the polls, but now, when the rush of excitement of the elections has subsided, citizens were eager to get more details on the promised "utopia".\n\nNight Glider had been carefully preparing a series of appearances addressing various subjects, but one of the key lessons she had learned in her aviation days was certain: without a proper take off, one’s skills in the air did not matter. She crossed the assembled crowd, waving and smiling in response to the cheers and hoorays, while counting down from five hundred in her head. As the numbers reached single digits, she came up on the podium, and finally, after a resounding "zero" started to talk. She spoke of the future, of erasing the societal lines between creatures of different class and race, of opening the Town up for all who might need it, of new language and better welfare, and, most importantly, of the power to bring the change and be that change.\n\nWith last words still echoing in the air, she looked at the ponies before her with hope, and this hope was not misplaced: they listened, maybe skeptical about some aspects and confused about the others, but they listened nonetheless, and were ready to try it together, for their friend."

 night_glider.2.t:0 "New Neighbors"
 night_glider.2.d:0 "It was morning, and Ponder Prism, who preferred to be everywhere a bit early, yawned and looked out of the window of his small food shop set up on the edge of the Town. A mountain road with a rail line running in parallel was well-visible from his vantage point, and following years of working here Ponder Prism learned the schedule of trains and buses rather well. Naturally, they were not always on-time, but guessing the delays was one of the few available amusements before the start of the day.\n\nSuddenly, the shopkeeper noticed something peculiar: a group of creatures was coming up the road. The fact that they were on hooves, or rather on paws, was unusual as Our Town had been seeing few tourists following Starlight Glimmer’s exile, but the travelers themselves were even stranger. Ponder Prism had met griffons such as one leading the group, but had only heard stories about their followers. Three were penguins, much smaller, but also winged, and the other two were massive bears, carrying suitably gargantuan packs. Judging by the size of the luggage, these were no tourists: mayor Glider’s policies seemed to be getting results.\n\nPonder Prism continued to gaze at the caravan with hesitation: the idea of welcomeness sounded nice, sure, he even voted for Night Glider, but he expected the new settlers to be ponies. After all, this was a pony place. Yet, as the group came closer, more parts of the mayor’s latest speech re-emerged in his mind. "Be the change", she said, and he promised himself to try. Circling around the counter, he came up closer to the entrance, tapped the glass door, attracting the attention of the griffon and flipped the sign."

 night_glider.3.t:0 "A New Town Underway"
 night_glider.3.d:0 "Despite living and working on the outskirts of the Town, Ponder Prism had always enjoyed a trot to the city center. He grew to like the mix of the equalist design, with streets made up by similar-looking buildings and arranged in a simple pattern, and the small touches the inhabitants of these dwellings added after the "cutie unmarking" was reversed: a pot with daffodils here, a star mural there, an odd-colored roof tilings to replace a row struck by lightning, all told a little story, but shared the same heart.\n\nIt was easy to predict that with the influx of new citizens this order would be disrupted, but Ponder Prism was still disappointed. Even now, after the significant part of the construction had been completed and the reshaped core of the city had shaken off the scaffolding, he just did not feel the same connection to the assembly of varied houses, designed by different creatures, for different creatures. The Provisional Commissar for Renovations, Rocky Storm, did a fine job making it fit together, using wooden covering inspired by "charmingly rustic Skynavian designs" according to the local paper, but something dear was missing.\n\n"Excuse me, friend." A striped horse - no, a zebra! - passed the lost in thought pony and entered a painted archway to their right. A sign atop it read "Ama-zeebian Corner". Although Ponder Prism did not get the pun, he could smell a very attractive sweet and spicy aroma stemming from the cafe and feel the rumbling stomach reminding him of the need for dinner. After a short session of internal decision making, he followed after the zebra: indeed, if the change was here, one would be dull not to try its benefits."

 night_glider.4.d:0 "The Provisional Commissar for Prescriptive Linguistics Offbeat was not having a productive day. "This is not that hard to remember!" She thumped the floor with her front legs, making some of the gathered clerks and administrators wince. "Certain words and grammatical constructions must be avoided in the official documentation of our commune. Yes, this includes 'fillies and gentlecolts', as noted in the provided guideline booklet. Any other questions?"\n\nThe current target of her frustration, a member of the Infrastructure Committee, raised a hoof again. "I just wanted to clarify that I was going to use the phrase for a poster in a flat block with pony and horse population. Had no intention to offend our citizens."\n\nOffbeat sighed and took a second to regain some composure. There was nothing wrong with the genuine attempt to understand, and her job was to facilitate acceptance of the mayor's reform on all levels so she resumed her speech more softly. "I’m sorry, Duct Stream, I didn't mean to imply that you had. Your poster is about plumbing renovations, correct? The underlying rule is simple: if your content does not depend on race, do not mention it. We want to facilitate the sense of unity and acceptance in the Town. The sooner we stop using such forms of address altogether, the sooner it will become a norm - just as few years ago it became the norm to not highlight whether one arrived from Baltimare or Las Pegasus or Konzan.""

Ponder Prism was hardly what one might call a sociologist, particularly a learned one, but this time in his life turned out to be most delightful nonetheless.\n\nWhat started for him as gawking at strange arrivals and trying unfamiliar food, with a bit of effort, courage and warmth transformed into connections, both with those who lived alongside Ponder Prism for years, and, naturally, with the recent neighbors. On his activity list were parties, political meetings, mountain tours, cooking workshops, reading groups and more, some of which he had never imagined himself trying. Another thing he had hardly expected was the success of his shop: the stream of newcomers showed no evidence of exhausting any time soon, and thanks to a friend adept at hoof painting Ponder Prism was attracting the weary travelers with a big sign, helpfully translated into a few languages. He even had to hire an assistant.\n\n"Last train before opening, chief!" Allen, the second employee of "Ponderous Foods", tapped his claw on the window overlooking a road and a rail line running in parallel. "How are those vegetables looking? Need any help?" Ponder Prism shook his head with a smile. "All good. Will be done in a minute". He returned to organizing the counter, but his mind wandered back to something he had heard from mayor Glider on the radio a few days ago:"

It is impossible to strive for the betterment of conditions for every creature in the society, since it will only keep the gap between the classes growing. For true prosperity and equality, we must follow the teachings of Marks!"\n\nNight Glider was looking at Party Favor from her tribune with an open, polite expression, but inside her a knot was tightening. Since the days of election, he had clearly been taking effort to refine his oratory skills, but also drifting away. In fact, their whole small group was becoming separated, with duties interfering with availability, and political agendas coloring splinters of time spent together. She was hoping to invite Party Favor for dinner after the assembly, but now Night Glider was rather unsure about whether he will accept, and, sadly, about whether she wanted to have him.\n\nMeanwhile, her debate opponent continued. "I would also like to extend a general invitation for a series of lectures in the Red Brick House on history and revolutionary struggle, with the next event tomorrow at six." He glanced towards Night Glider for the first time during the speech, flashing a subtle smile: she almost missed it, and almost dropped the facade when she got it. "Still, I would like to finish on a positive note. The tireless work of the mayoral office and comrade mayor herself deserves praise where it is due: we must welcome the assertive action which has been undertaken and strive to bring the desired change. Together!" Party Favor nodded towards the cheering audience, and when he turned to Glider again, the smile was returned in full."

 night_glider.7.d:0 "During her time as the leader of the New Hope Commune, Night Glider had become rather accustomed to giving speeches about her plans for improving the lives of everyone who found refuge in the Town. However, creating one designed to brush her own mane or praise the administration was an entirely different thing. Did she do enough to deserve it? Would the attending creatures agree? If the goal was to impress the citizens and lift their spirits, surely there could be a more practical way to achieve it? The council and her advisors insisted that a public address would be the best option.\n\nAnother tidbit of old flying school wisdom came to her mind: the take-off is optional, the landing is mandatory. Standing on her comfortably familiar podium, Night Glider took a deep breath, exhaled, pushing out the last bit of nervousness, and started to talk, not about the achievements in industry or the advantages of political transparency, but about the fates turned around by the commune, taking examples from the reports she got as well as her actual experiences during rare days-off.\n\nThe message was simple, but it resonated with the audience fiercely. Veterans of Starlight Glimmer’s experiment, newcomers disillusioned with their previous existence, even outright exiles, all felt the positive change Night Glider’s reforms brought. They knew that they took part in laying the foundation of this society, be it by hoof, wing, claw or paw, and its success was their success. After her closing remarks, outlying the continuation and support of the started projects, the cheering echoed far across the mountains, and one of the voices in the celebrating roar belonged to the mayor herself."

 night_glider.8.d:0 "After returning from another council meeting, Night Glider had been carefully studying a large map of Equus, currently occupying most of her office table. While such an overview lacked the beauty found in observing the land below from a plane, it made up for it with raw data, found not only on the chart itself, but also on a myriad of sticky notes, courtesy of Sugar Belle, which detailed important trade routes and recent geoeconomical developments.\n\nIt was evident that in order to ensure the success of the New Hope Commune the formation of a proper diplomatic corps was required. Despite the idea of a body designed to handle foreign relations and formalize pre-existing agreements being rather straightforward, this endeavor had its own obstacles. \n\nThe first of these came from the neighbors themselves. It went without saying that Night Glider was not willing to work with less scrupulous regimes, but even more reasonable countries would need a lot of convincing to work with the city-state on more or less equal footing.\n\nThe second potential problem was closely connected to the last point: for each of the planned missions she was required to select the best candidate to lead it. A pile of dossiers and applications sat neatly on the corner of the map, and after stretching her wings for a bit Night Glider took the top one."

 night_glider.12.d:0 "For a regular creature living in the Town it was easy to shut oneself from the happenings of the bigger world around them, and indeed many were perfectly willing to do so. Night Glider, however, had no such luxury available to her.\n\nThe escalating conflicts, both far-off and close to home, created shockwaves powerful enough to reach the commune. The possibility of war coming here seemed real - no, was real, - and it was the chosen leader's duty to prepare defense. There had been several competing proposals regarding fortifications and security measures, most of which fell into two distinct categories.\n\nOn the one hand, some of the plans incorporated lighter, less restrictive measures, with no significant changes to the daily routine: increase in anti-air coverage, extra militia patrols and weapon stockpiling. On the other, there were suggestions of erecting sizable fortifications, expanding draft, limiting the transport flow and trapping mountain passes with explosives. Night Glider knew that all of the latter would help during a potential conflict, and she was pretty sure that her popularity would make the population tolerate these changes, but she was in doubt: was this emergency, temporary as it may be, truly a way forward, or was it just a first step away from utopia to another tyranny? The decision had to be made."

Still, the preparation only underscored how everything had changed.\n\nThousands were killed, many more - injured, displaced, wronged. Night Glider believed that it was her duty to lead these creatures back to the better life, reconstruct and reinforce the utopia shattered by artillery barrages, and with each word added to the text this belief only grew. In the broadcast studio, hovering near the stand with the typed-down copy, she felt nervous, but resolute: the resemblance of the recording headset to the pilot one soothed her mind a little. With the signal from the chief technician, Night Glider activated the microphone.\n\nShe was heard far and wide, with a message of reconciliation and fairness, just punishments for those responsible for the conflict and the way forward for those scarred by its flames. This message, carried with passion and hope, became the spark for a different flame, one of warmth and healing, entrusted to the labor of her citizens."

In particular, with regards to punishments, the precedent for exile had been naturally set up, but unlike the surrounding nations the Town came to rarely using prisons, relying on a system of community officers monitoring and performing social work with offenders instead.\n\nNow Double Diamond faced a similarly-themed challenge, as Night Glider asked him to take the lead on overseeing the due process for the trials of the members of Stalliongrad establishment directly tied to wartime perpetrations. Despite some creatures voicing opinions that these extremists should get a taste of their own incarceration facilities, or face even more extreme consequences, others maintained that it would go against the spirit of the nascent republic.\n\nWhile there were arguments to be made for harsher sentences from practical and emotional sides, neither appealed to Double Diamond. Keeping to his own deeply held equalist convictions and with full support from the government, he managed to persuade the members of special jury to stick with the previously established methods of prosecution, resulting in hundreds of cases for the rapidly expanding correctional network as well as several deportations."

Sugar Belle and her assistants spent day after day after day going through the legislation created in Stalliongrad. The decrees of the early regime at least made sense, but as the country's stability took some blows, both from the infighting in the ruling party and especially during the collapse of the frontlines, everything grew into a giant paperwork tumor, consisting of endless acronyms, contradictory graphs and thinly veiled propaganda. If Sugar Belle did not know any better, she would say that it was done to doom any attempts of fixing it.\n\n"Enough!"

"You’re pulling my tail, ain’t you."\n\n"Guilty as charged." With a shrug, Night Glider allowed the smirk to fully appear on her face for a second, but then became serious again. "What’s on your mind, Bangs?"\n\nThe stallion took a few moments to answer. "Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask. How’re you holding up? I mean, we are doing a Celestia-tier job here, and you are the one who leads the show. And I know this might not be the best time,” he said, glancing around the small preparation room, “but you’ll be going off immediately afterwards, right? For the next stop?”\n\nThe initial reaction of Night Glider was to dismiss the concern: it was indeed not the best time. However, something stopped her, a memory of herself clutching to the old friendships time and time again, warming them when they were cooling and taking this warmth in return when she needed it. “You are right. We’ll catch up afterwards, there is time. I’ll make time” Another, softer smile came to her. “But now let’s show these creatures we have time for them, too.” Feather Bangs, visibly reassured, nodded, and gestured towards the exit onto the podium."

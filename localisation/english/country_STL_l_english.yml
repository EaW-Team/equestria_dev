 POLITICS_FEATHERBANGS:0 "A local heartthrob, Feather Bangs lost his love interest to a Ponyville stallion. Quick to move on, Feather Bangs has come to realize that capitalism is necessary for the conditions to create equalism."
 POLITICS_DOUBLEDIAMOND:0 "A faithful follower of Starlight Glimmer's Equalist philosophy, Double Diamond would see Equality succeed by applying the spirit of Equalism without all its idiosyncrasies."
 POLITICS_NIGHTGLIDER:0 "Hobbyist pilot and dreamer Night Glider seeks to achieve the vision of Starlight Glimmer without her crude methods. Equality is about lifting up, not bringing down."
 POLITICS_PARTYFAVOR:0 "A balloon-maker and devout Marksist-Stallionist, Party Favor will follow the winds of Stalliongrad no matter how they blow."
 POLITICS_SUGARBELLE:0 "Sugar Belle's boyfriend Big Macintosh, brother of the Element of Honesty, introduced her to Equestrian harmony. This left a profound mark on her, even as she came to see the good in leftism as well. She has syntheszed these ideas into her personal form of harmonic socialism."
 POLITICS_BURLAP:0 "A tailor by trade, and a very ordinary pony, Burlap never had any interest in politics. But Double Diamond's failures led to his removal, and it was decided a perfectly ordinary pony would be perfect to administrate Our Town in these difficult times. Surely history will vindicate this choice."
 POLITICS_TROCHANTER:0 "One of the most skilled cryptographers of VOPS, Trochanter plans to turn the communist statelet of Our Town into one big intelligence agency. Everyone will be monitored. Everything will be recorded. Inefficiency and treachery will be completely eradicated. And all resources will be put forward to the security and preservation of the Hegemony as a whole."

 STL_design_new_music:0 "Compose a New Kind of Music"
 STL_design_new_music_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's red songs are good, but they are not revolutionary enough. Starlight may have erred in her famous ballad 'In Our Town' with her anti-cutie-mark views, but she was on the right track. New songs will be written for us all."

STL_neighbors_help:0 "Our Neighbours"
STL_neighbors_help_desc:0 "The ponies of Stalliongrad are kindred spirits - they may speak of workers and production instead of Equality, but the end result is the same. We should establish trade and seek industrial assistance."

STL_STG_military_advisors:0 "Our Stalliongrad Advisors"
STL_STG_military_advisors_desc:0 "Should the griffons ever advance south, we shall be the first to be hit. We must seek military support from our neighbours in Stalliongrad."

STL_independence_line:0 "Our Independence"
STL_independence_line_desc:0 "Stalliongrad at first responded positively to our efforts to establish relations, but now grow impatient, hoping we will join them. It is time to make clear - we shall remain independent, now and in future."

STL_industrial_effort:0 "Our Industrial Effort"
STL_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Our balancing act with Stalliongrad has paid off. The support offered, and our own hard work will lead to the development of two new factories. Ponies speak excitedly of the prosperity such investments shall bring. Is it too early to speak of Our City?"

STL_industrial_help:0 "Our Industrial Help"
STL_industrial_help_desc:0 "Like Stalliongrad, we have missed much of the industrialisation that has swept southern Equestria. Today, Stalliongrad is a case study in rapid industrialisation - our countries would be more equal if they were to share...."

STL_new_army:0 "Our New Army"
STL_new_army_desc:0 "Griffons to the north, Our 'Friend' to the south, and the giant of Equestria beyond that, looking to swallow us both. Our citizens must take up arms for safety, for the sad truth is that a bullet is the ultimate equaliser."

STL_demand_griffon_land:0 "Our Griffon Land"
STL_demand_griffon_land_desc:0 "We have gotten so used to referring to everything as 'Ours', that it's starting to get out of control. "Our caves", "Our mountains", "Our northern coasts". The idea of asking Nova Griffonia to give us all that land is getting to tempt. After all, it IS Ours."

STL_socialist_trade:0 "Our Expanding Trade"
STL_socialist_trade_desc:0 "Whatever our differences with Stalliongrad, they are our primary trading partner, and trade grows every day. With continued development, we shall finally be able to shrug off the pall of economic isolation that has crippled the nation."

STL_research_facility:0 "Our Research Facility"

STL_railroad_way:0 "Our Transit System"
STL_railroad_way_desc:0 "Whilst we have no need to build large rail systems, a small effort to integrate with other Equestrian rail lines and local systems of tramways and buses will help accommodate our swelling population. Military logistics will be particularly easy, as our soldiers should be able to take a bus from their house to the front line every morning."

STL_conquest_of_STG:0 "Our Stalliongrad"
STL_conquest_of_STG_desc:0 "Some of our cabinet have grown concerned, as Double Diamond appears to descend into madness, rambling about OPMs and world conquest. Others insist that a military genius is at work. Whatever the case, we gear for the unthinkable - War with Stalliongrad."

STL_equestrian_airbridge:0 "Equestrian Airbridge"

STL_our_town_fortress_desc:0 "Friendship is all well and good, but Equestrian delegates have yet to offer any good suggestions on how friendship can be used against communist tanks and heavily armoured griffon knights. More practically, they can smuggle us large shipments of concrete, barbed wire and heavy machine guns to fortify with. How? Apparently, a cat is involved..."

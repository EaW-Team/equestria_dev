 ### CHARACTERS ###
 double_diamond:0 "Double Diamond"
 feather_bangs:0 "Feather Bangs"
 party_flavour:0 "Party Favor"
 sugar_belle:0 "Sugar Belle"
 night_glider:0 "Night Glider"

 POLITICS_FEATHERBANGS:0 "A local heartthrob, Feather Bangs lost his love interest to a Ponyville stallion. Quick to move on, Feather Bangs has come to realize that capitalism is necessary for the conditions to create equalism."
 POLITICS_DOUBLEDIAMOND:0 "A faithful follower of Starlight Glimmer's Equalist philosophy, Double Diamond would see Equality succeed by applying the spirit of Equalism without all its idiosyncrasies."
 POLITICS_NIGHTGLIDER:0 "Hobbyist pilot and dreamer Night Glider seeks to achieve the vision of Starlight Glimmer without her crude methods. Equality is about lifting up, not bringing down."
 POLITICS_PARTYFAVOR:0 "A balloon-maker and devout Marksist-Stallionist, Party Favor will follow the winds of Stalliongrad no matter how they blow."
 POLITICS_SUGARBELLE:0 "Sugar Belle's boyfriend Big Macintosh, brother of the Element of Honesty, introduced her to Equestrian harmony. This left a profound mark on her, even as she came to see the good in leftism as well. She has syntheszed these ideas into her personal form of harmonic socialism."
 POLITICS_BURLAP:0 "A tailor by trade, and a very ordinary pony, Burlap never had any interest in politics. But Double Diamond's failures led to his removal, and it was decided a perfectly ordinary pony would be perfect to administrate Our Town in these difficult times. Surely history will vindicate this choice."
 POLITICS_TROCHANTER:0 "One of the most skilled cryptographers of VOPS, Trochanter plans to turn the communist statelet of Our Town into one big intelligence agency. Everyone will be monitored. Everything will be recorded. Inefficiency and treachery will be completely eradicated. And all resources will be put forward to the security and preservation of the Hegemony as a whole."

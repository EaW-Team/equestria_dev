 POLITICS_FEATHERBANGS:0 "A local heartthrob, Feather Bangs lost his love interest to a Ponyville stallion. Quick to move on, Feather Bangs has come to realize that capitalism is necessary for the conditions to create equalism."
 POLITICS_DOUBLEDIAMOND:0 "A faithful follower of Starlight Glimmer's Equalist philosophy, Double Diamond would see Equality succeed by applying the spirit of Equalism without all its idiosyncrasies."
 POLITICS_NIGHTGLIDER:0 "Hobbyist pilot and dreamer Night Glider seeks to achieve the vision of Starlight Glimmer without her crude methods. Equality is about lifting up, not bringing down."
 POLITICS_PARTYFAVOR:0 "A balloon-maker and devout Marksist-Stallionist, Party Favor will follow the winds of Stalliongrad no matter how they blow."
 POLITICS_SUGARBELLE:0 "Sugar Belle's boyfriend Big Macintosh, brother of the Element of Honesty, introduced her to Equestrian harmony. This left a profound mark on her, even as she came to see the good in leftism as well. She has syntheszed these ideas into her personal form of harmonic socialism."
 POLITICS_BURLAP:0 "A tailor by trade, and a very ordinary pony, Burlap never had any interest in politics. But Double Diamond's failures led to his removal, and it was decided a perfectly ordinary pony would be perfect to administrate Our Town in these difficult times. Surely history will vindicate this choice."

### IDEAS ###

ROC_stoicism:0 "Rockville Stoicism"
ROC_stoicism_desc:0 "Those who admire the rock farmers of the Southwest speak of them as the embodiments of the elements of loyalty and honesty: solemn, blunt, and disciplined. Others, the types who wouldn't be caught dead venturing into a Rockville farm or spending a day in a Providential gathering, see them as apathetic, harsh, sullen, and drearily depressing. Rockville ponies will fight to their last gasp to defend their homes, their farms, and their families, and preserve what remains of their idyllic way of life.\n\nThey may not smile or laugh all that often, but one should never make the mistake of believing this means they do not love their fellow ponies above all else."

ROC_learn_to_code:0 "Malaise in Rock Country"
ROC_learn_to_code_desc:0 "Rock Country has seen better days. Graduating classes at the Equestrian Institute of Rockology are growing slimmer and slimmer, rock farms have been forced to cut costs and close down, and workers seem even more morose than usual. The return of the Crystal Empire and subsequent boom in the market for crystals has poured further salt in the wounds, all the while the Rockville farms continue to be outpaced by the speed of technological innovation.\n\nRockville must face the harsh truth about the place of their traditions and adapt... or find some other way out of this pervasive malaise."

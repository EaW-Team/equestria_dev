 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YRoad to 56§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduces the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of twenty three races - §YPony§!, §YChangeling§!, §YGriffon§!, §YDeer§!, §YDiamond Dog§!, §YDragon§!, §YBuffalo§!, §YPolar Bear§!, §YPenguin§!, §YMinotaur§!, §YZebra§!, §YHippogriff§!, §YKirin§!, §YHorse§!, §YCamel§!, §YGiraffe§!, §YDonkey§!, §YAbyssinian§!, §YLlama§!, §YGargoyle§!, §YCentaur§!, §YYeti§! or §YUnspecified§!. Many races have their own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be manually changed during the game.\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YScientific Development§!, §YSociety Development§!, §YIlliteracy§!, and §YPoverty§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n§YSociety Development§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YSociety Development§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YIlliteracy§! represents how many of your citizens can read and write. Low levels of §YIlliteracy§! impose §RResearch§! and §RConstruction§! maluses. §YIlliteracy§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YPoverty§! represents how well-functioning your economy is. Low levels of §YPoverty§! impose §RResearch§!, §RRecruitable Population§!, §RIndustry§!, and §RMonthly Population§! maluses. Both of these can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Gone-time 50-200% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!."

 EAW_WS_TAB_4_TXT:0 "\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience. Furthermore, the effects of a negative research speed bonus have been adjusted to their pre-1.6 values. In vanilla currently, a value of -50% cuts your research speed in half, while in EAW it merely makes it take 50% longer. Additionally, a -100% research speed in vanilla means you will have no ability to research anything! Conversely, -100% in EAW means it will take twice as long. Essentially, countries with terrible research speed will not be totally destroyed.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! provides a new, flavorful system of general, admiral and, for players with the La Resistance DLC, operative generation. Various nations will generate different leaders of different races depending on their circumstances. For example, a nation may have both pony and griffon generals, or use multiple namelists. This does not carry any gameplay changes.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the full list of balance changes is larger than can be fit in this tab! Therefore we have moved it to a wiki page.

 # Continent
 EAW_WS_Zebrica:0 "Zebrica - Crossroad of Civilizations"
 EAW_WS_Zebrica_desc:0 "Zebrica is a vast and diverse continent, home to more races than both Equus and Griffonia combined. It is also almost as large as the other two combined. Its climate ranges from the tropical jungles of §GHindia§! to the scorching deserts of §YZebhara§! and to the frozen swamps of §CCape Hestraya§!. Its most advanced societies are comparable to Equestria in their prosperity, while the most backwards ones are little more than isolated tribes. As such, there is little one can say that applies to the continent as a whole. However, Zebrica is a sum of its parts, and each region has its own shared culture and history.\n\nWestern Zebrica is the land of the horses, the larger cousins of ponies who also live there. Besides them, there are sapient cats who walk on two legs in §CAbyssinia§!, and the warlike donkeys of §gAsstyria§! and §gAnseruk§!. Most of the region was once united under §GSaddle Arabia§!, but over centuries of decadence and decay the old empire broke apart, and in 1007 is divided into a brutal civil war.\n\nSouthern Zebrica is more diverse, with zebras, hyenas, gargoyles and centaurs living in the cold south. Besides these races, there are also the yeti of §CStormland§!, a ferocious race who united under the black banner of the §CStorm King§! and wrought havoc across half the continent. However, the Storm King perished in battle, and now the yeti race is divided. Previously conquered races hope that he will never have a true successor.\n\nCentral Zebrica is dominated by the Zebhara desert, but also has the Great Lakes. The §YMazwi Empire§! united the zebras of the Lakes, but the Storm King's invasion brought an end to its reign, and now zebra warlords fight each other to determine the fate of the region. While most of the population here consists of zebras, there are also the camels of Camelkand in the east, but most of them live under the reign of a Storm King's general who forged a kingdom of his own through conquest.\n\nThe north has closer ties to Equus and Griffonia than the other regions, and thus is home to many naval powers. The coast is primarily inhabited by zebras, while the islands are home to hippogriffs and harpies. A small holdout of Equestrians exists in §gChiropterra§!, worshipping Nightmare Moon and biding their time until her return. In the northeast, the native deer of the Hindian subcontinent chafe under the yoke of Olenian conquerors, while the llamas of the mountains live in peaceful solitude, worshipping their ruler as a god.\n\nEastern Zebrica is generally considered the most backwater region, which is why Storm King avoided it almost entirely. Zebras, giraffes and kirin call this region their home, but in recent times Feathisian griffon adventurers have carved realms of their own, looking for treasure and valuable goods to trade. They are attracted by rumours of a §YGolden City§! hidden somewhere in the magical jungle of the south-east. The kirin have so far lived in isolation, but they are slowly opening up to the outside world.\n\nYet all this only scratches the surface of Zebrica. It has numerous nations and tribes, each with their own story to tell, and their own path to follow."

 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The frigid and mountainous north of Equus is an inhospitable landscape, but hardy races have lived there for a long time. Changelings, yaks, polar bears and penguins have adapted to the cold temperatures, yet more recently waves of griffon settlers arrived in the region. Legends also say how ponies once lived here, back when the climate was warmer, but now only ruins remain after all the ponies migrated south or east.\n\nThe changelings are the most formidable race in the north, living under the strong leadership of §GQueen Chrysalis§!. The yaks were until recently united in the isolationist kingdom of §CYakyakistan§!, but as Equestrian influence continued to grow in the region, the more conservative yaks of the §DJaki-Clan§! rebelled. A brutal war followed, but neither side was able to overcome the other so a temporary peace treaty was signed. Further north, there are the §gPolar Bear Communities§! which were founded only some years before. Polar bears are used to being divided, so only time will tell if the newborn nation can survive for long. On the northeastern shores, the venerable §PKingdom of Pingland§! is facing a succession crisis as their old king is at death's door. South of them is the industrialized griffon colony of §ONova Griffonia§!, left stranded as their colonial overlords in the east have utterly collapsed. Now the independent griffons must determine their role on the world stage and learn to live by themselves. Meanwhile their small autonomous territory, the §YGriffon Frontier§!, is far too busy dealing with bandits and worse. Without Nova Griffonia's support, they will likely collapse.\n\nThe changelings have great ambitions, seeing Equestria as decadent and weak and themselves as the rightful rulers of all Equus. The yaks fight amongst themselves, the polar bears and penguins continue to develop into proper states, while Nova Griffonia prospers. The future is full of possibilities for the northern nations, but also full of danger. What will the changelings do? And will the other races of the north band together or tear each other into shreds?"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Southern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "The area of southern Equus is vast, and there is a huge variety of climate and terrain, ranging from the cold marshes of the north to the hot deserts of the south. One race dominates the region above all: Ponies. However, there are also deer, buffalo, dragons and griffons. The ponies live on flat plains, arid drylands and sparse woodlands, the home of the deer is in boreal forests, tall mountains and swamps, while buffalo and dragons live in small nations under the shadow of their gigantic neighbour.\n\n§GEquestria§! is by far the largest and most industrialized nation in the world, regarded as the haven of ponykind. Under principles of harmony, they have remained peaceful and prosperous for a millennium. Other pony nations on Equus are §PCrystal Empire§!, a close ally of Equestria which recently broke free from King Sombra's curse, §RStalliongrad§!, a breakaway Equestrian province and the cradle of communism, as well as tiny §rStarlight Town§!, a city-state which is recovering from the rule of a mad cult. In the northwest, the deer live under the rule of the §gKingdom of Olenia§! and its corrupt King. Aside from these larger countries, there are the small §OBuffalo Chiefdom§!, a tribal enclave within Equestria, as well as the §LUnited Dragon Lands§!, which recently had a pro-Equestrian ruler come to power.\n\nSouthern Equus used to be peaceful, but recent times have changed that. Stalliongrad revolted, §GChangeling Lands§! attempted to seize control of Equestria, and Olenia had a dramatic change of rulership. Now tensions remain high between the major nations. The changelings of the north are building up for war while their rivals seem ill-prepared, as Olenia is weakened by internal instability and Equestria clings onto its pacifism. The smaller nations wait and watch, some of them deciding whose side to take in the upcoming conflict. Worse still, the major nations are among the most technologically advanced and industrialized nations in the world, so any wars between them would turn into carnage on an unprecedented scale. Some pray for tensions to dissipate and for peace to return, but as dark clouds gather, war seems inevitable."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The cold lands of northern Griffonia have long been sparsely populated, as, unlike in northern Equus, arctic races did not settle the region. Instead, there were hardy griffons and ponies who migrated from the south and west, respectively. Griffons settled the marshy valleys south of the §gWhitetail Mountains§!, while ponies arrived from across the gulf to the frozen forests of the northern shores. Most kept going, trying to find a better place to settle, but some chose to stay and have adapted to the cold over the centuries.\n\nThese ponies are known as the §gNorthern Tribes§!, and lived in isolation until griffon revolutionaries crossed the mountains and carved out their own nation in §RSkynavia§!. The §GKingdom of Vedina§! has long stood independent, remaining autonomous during the Empire's reign, with its distance from the griffon heartland allowing its inhabitants to retain their traditions. To the east, the Duchy of Cloudbury fell after the remnants of the §OGriffonian Republic§! fled there. The revolutionaries now live in exile, hoping to one day return to Griffenheim. In the Whitetail Mountains themselves, there is the savage §LSunstriker Clan§!, nominally loyal to the Empire but likely to break free when the opportunity presents itself. To the northeast lie the §YArcturian Order§! and the §gDread League§!, ancient foes stuck in the past due to their extreme isolation.\n\nThe griffons of the north were once subjects of the Empire, but became independent after it fell. If the Empire were to rise from its stupor, their newfound freedom would be at risk, and due to the poor and underdeveloped lands of the north, they have would little strength to resist its might. Out of all of them, the Griffonian Republic is the strongest, but alone they stand no chance. Beyond the mountains, Skynavia and the Northern Tribes are locked in bitter conflict as the ponies try to push out the invaders while the griffons try to spread the light of communism to the dark north. In the continent's darkest corner, the Dread League is gathering its strength to crush the Order once and for all. After that, nothing will stand in their way."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "While the authority of the §OGriffonian Empire§! collapsed everywhere else, it still exists in central Griffonia, albeit in a greatly weakened form. It is here, in the fertile plains around the mighty §CGriffking River§!, where Emperor Grover I established his capital of Griffenheim, and where it has remained ever since. The region is densely populated by griffons, while diamond dogs inhabit the §LBronze Mountains§! to the north. In the east, the magical §GScheißwald forest§! has been a near insurmountable obstacle for griffon settlers for centuries, while the great §DLake Rumare§! and the mountains of §gBlackhollow§! make up the southern boundary of the region.\n\nAfter the §RRepublican Revolution§!, the region became greatly fractured. In the §YHerzland§!, the Empire exists as a small rump state around Griffenheim, surrounded by nominal vassals who are part of the §OReichspakt§!. Further south, the Duchy of §YVerenia§! has been torn asunder by civil war between rival houses. The Kingdom of §rGriffonstone§!, left without its greatest benefactor, is stranded. The small barony of §GRumare§! now has a chance to save its dying culture, while Blackhollow in the east has been overrun by §gBlackrock's Bandits§!.\n\nWhile the Empire is weak for now, it may yet recover its strength. Should that happen, the vassals are in danger of losing their autonomy, and most of them will refuse to give it up without a fight. Unfortunately, the Herzland can only be reunited through conflict. The same is not true for Verenia, where the civil war may yet find a peaceful solution. In the south, Rumare may seek to reclaim its historical lands from Griffonstone, while Blackrock has ambitions in the east - if she isn't overthrown. All of these states have to be wary if the Empire reunites the Herzland, for it may then seek to bring all the former Imperial lands back into the fold. §DAquileia§! and §PWingbardy§!, too, may seek to expand their influence in the region, thus possibly sowing the seeds for a conflict between them and the Empire. It is hard to predict the future, but one thing is certain: There will be blood."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The region of eastern Griffonia is defined less by strict geographical boundaries and more by the §OGriffonian Empire's§! historical lack of influence in the region. As such, it covers a large part of the Griffonian continent, and several races besides griffons live in these lands. Eastern Griffonia is traditionally divided into three sub-regions: the §DEvi Valley§! in the south, where griffons live along the Evi river and its many tributaries, the §GRiverlands§!, a mountainous region populated primarily by ponies, but also by diamond dogs and griffons, and lastly §LBeorgfordas§!, also known as Hill-land, home of the secluded hillponies. The source of the mighty §CGriffking river§! lies in the mountains of the Riverlands. From there, it flows westward, almost splitting the continent in two. Another notable feature in the region is the magical §GEygsic Forest§!, rumoured to be home to giant spiders.\n\nOverall, the nations of the region are less developed than those in the west, primarily due to how far away it is from Equestria and other advanced nations. Out of the three sub-regions, the Riverlands are the most developed. Here, seven pony nations and, more recently, §gDiamond Mountain§!, are united by a defensive alliance known as the §GRiver Coalition§!. In the western Riverlands, there are two griffon nations outside of the Coalition: §gHellquill§! and §gLongsword§!, remnants of the grand crusades of Emperor Grover II. The southern coast of the Riverlands has three nations which sprung up after law and order deteriorated in the region, with a diverse populace of ponies, zebras, deer and griffons. The Evi Valley to the south is more backwards, with its griffons clinging strongly to their traditions. Some, however, want change, and already §YBrodfeld§! is engulfed in a brutal civil war against the communists of the §RPrywhenian Liberation Army§!. In the north, the hillponies have no such desire to embrace modernity. Their tribes are like a time capsule of a bygone age, with tribal chieftains holding to power under the protection of the River Coalition. Off the coast, there is the island of §LGreneclyf§!, home of changelings who, so far, have remained isolated from the outside world.\n\nThe collapse of the Empire brought many changes to the region. The main antagonist of the River Coalition is gone, and it must now redefine its identity. Some push for federalization while others want the Coalition to be a thing of the past. The Evi Valley broke free from the rule of the Empire, but suffers from instability. If reforms are not made soon, the backwards griffon nations will collapse in on themselves, and a red star will rise from the ashes of old. The hillpony nations are less oppressive, but some ponies push for the embracement of modernity regardless. The winds of change are blowing in the east, but none can yet say what kind of change they are bringing."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The southern coast of Griffonia is the warmest part of the continent, with the southernmost areas even sporting humid jungles. Otherwise, the landscape is dominated by arid plains and hills, with a few mountain ranges and many islands in the neighboring seas. It is populated primarily by griffons, but there are also a sizeable number of ponies in the west and minotaurs in the east, who live on numerous islands, the largest of which is §DKainourgio Spiti§!. The northern boundary of the region is made up by §CLake Rumare§! and the §gBlackhollow Mountains§!.\n\nThe ponies inhabit §GNew Mareland§!, an overseas dominion of §7Equestria§! established by ambitious colonists, who bought the monster-infested land from the §RDuchy of Talouse§! centuries ago and cleared it for settlement. After the collapse of the §OGriffonian Empire§!, Talouse, alongside other minor nations in the region, joined the §YKarthinian Pact§!, led by the mighty §PKingdom of Wingbardy§!. §gFalcor§!, their old rival, did not join, and was then devastated in a war against Wingbardy where they lost their capital. The parishes of §RSicameon§! distrust the western and northern monarchies and are a beacon of liberty in the south, alongside the minotaurs of §DAsterion§!, their close allies, who seek to liberate their kin from the oppressive rule of §CCyanolisia§! and its griffons.\n\nWingbardy is by far the strongest nation in the region and dominates its politics. However, they suffer from political and economic instability which may result in a radical change of government. Such a change will likely affect the entire region, not just the other Pact members. Meanwhile, New Mareland has so far remained loyal to Equestria, but the economic depression has made some ponies demand patriation and full independence. In the east, Asterion is preparing for war against Cyanolisia, and Sicameon is likely to support them. And while the nations of the south bicker, the Empire might rise in the north. Despite being so far away from Griffenheim, they may not escape the wrath of a resurgent Empire."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "The Griffonian west has traditionally had closer ties to Equus due to its proximity. It has many natural harbours, and the interior is mostly hilly and densely forested, so population and development are concentrated near the coast. The majority of the populace consists of griffons, though the southwest has a significant pony minority that has integrated into local culture. Off the coast, there are the islands of §LHaukland§! which lie near major trans-continental trade routes.\n\nFor most of its history, the west was dominated by the §RCrown of Aquileia§!, albeit it was conquered by the §OGriffonian Empire§! and, after its collapse and independence, suffered from a republican revolution, counter-revolution and subsequent decentralization. Now, the Kingdom is divided into many parts, all nominally under the rule of the King. North of Aquileia is the §GPeriphery§!, the frontier region of the Kingdom now ruled by many small statelets. To the northwest is the §gSkyfall Trade Federation§!, once the most prosperous part of the Empire, and now an independent nation and a naval powerhouse. The islands of §LHaukland§! are also independent, ruled by deserters, pirates and other outlaws.\n\nUnlike in the Empire, Aquileia's revolutionaries did not flee, they hid. And now they are preparing to strike again and topple the monarchy for good. The King and his vassals are trying their best to crush the uprising before it even begins, but things are unlikely to go as planned. While Aquileia is busy with internal issues, the small nations of the Periphery seek to establish themselves as proper states while clashing with each other. Eventually, Aquileia will go north and seek to reclaim its former territory, so they must prepare. Skyfall remains relatively stable, but their leader is very old and likely to pass away soon, forcing a change in power. The Hauklanders do as Hauklanders please, with no one to intervene in their affairs. However, the heartland of the Griffonian Empire is close, and the old superpower may yet recover its strength. Should this happen, the Empire will likely turn its gaze to the rich lands of the west. Aquileia has long hated the Empire, but hate alone will do nothing if they do not prepare themselves for the storm."
 EAW_WS_Kiria:0 "Eastern Zebrica"
 EAW_WS_Kiria_desc:0 "The homeland of the kirin race, the region of Eastern Zebrica collectively known as Kiria, features many different landscapes, separated from the deer and llamas to the north by a tall and nearly impenetrable mountain range, and from the zebra nations to the west and south by the mighty Marekong river. In the north, the terrain is predominantly plains and hills, interspersed with significant swathes of dense forest. This region is controlled by the §YRealm of Kiria§!, the largest and most powerful kirin state. The area is home to two important river systems that make it hospitable and suitable for a thriving agricultural society. Foremost is the lifeblood of Kiria: the magnificent §CGreat Mellifluve§! and its many tributaries, which connect the majority of the region together and provide for fertile farmland between the river's many branches. The Great Mellifluve empties into the South Kirin Sea after passing by §GVerdant§!, the trade city that connects the region to the lesser kirin nations in the south. The imperial capital of §OVermilion§! sits along the easternmost branch of the Great Mellifluve, nestled safely in a fertile valley surrounded by mountains and hills that partially isolate and protect it from the surrounding countryside.\n\nTo the north lies the other, smaller, but just as vital, river system; the §CCarmine River§! terminates at the port city of Fragrance, once the primary trading hub of the entire realm, connecting the merchants and traders of the §YRealm of Kiria§! to the rest of §YZebrica§!. Nowadays, the rivers are scarcely traveled, with most kirin returning to subsistence farming in the plains between the rivers, their once magnificent cities depopulated and declining, the infrastructure falling into disrepair. However, the region is rich in natural resources, land, and people, and the rivers make it a perfect candidate for industrialization, should §RThe Silence§! ever end.\n\nIn the south of Kiria, three autonomous states split off from the §YRealm of Kiria§! when the Silence began. The nations of §Y[NVA.GetName], [KXN.GetName], and [KHM.GetName]§! are all predominated by dense jungles and forests, with far fewer resources and a much smaller population than their northern brethren. Their lands are underdeveloped and untamed, and it will take great effort to modernize the lower kirin lands to the same level as the north once was. Of these three nations, §Y[NVA.GetName]§! fares the best, as the city of §GBlossom§! has remained a valuable trading port following the collapse of the trade routes in the north, and its lands are not as densely wooded as their two western neighbors. It will take effort and a strong leader, but perhaps there is a chance that these three southern kirin nations may one day unite and find themselves strong enough to withstand a resurgent northern Kiria."

 EAW_WS_Northern_Zebrica_desc:0 "The sunny shores of northern Zebrica lie south of the equator, and thus its climate ranges from tropical to subtropical. The region is very hilly and has many islands, most notably §DAris§! and §GPenaria§!. In the south, closer to the vast Zebhara desert, the region becomes more arid and inhospitable, but also less hilly.\n\nThe nations of northern Zebrica have close ties to Equus and Griffonia and thus are among the more advanced nations on the continent. This is especially true for the island nations of Hippogriffia and Macawia, but also the secluded realm of §gChiropterra§! and the "republic" of §GTobuck§! as well. §LColthage§!, a venerable maritime republic, and §PWarzena§!, a monarchy ruled by a benevolent king, are still in the process of industrializing. §gQuaggatai§!, the realm of a Khan who took advantage of the chaos caused by the Storm King, and §OZarantia§!, a federation of desert nomads, are underdeveloped, agrarian nations.\n\nThe coastal regions were the final victim of the §CStorm King's§! campaigns of pillaging and destruction, but Hippogriffia, Macawia and Chiropterra managed to survive unscathed. In fact, it was the hippogriffs who came out of hiding in §DSeaquestria§! and decisively defeated the Storm King. Macawia's powerful and modern fleet kept the islands safe, while the fortress-nation of Chiropterra was too heavily defended to be worth the effort. The rest of the region still has to recover from the devastation.\n\nChiropterra is the most likely to take advantage of the weakness and disarray. However, what they do depends entirely on what happens in §7Equestria§!. If their plans fail, then they are likely to take an aggressive stance and pose a major threat to the smaller nations. Colthage, despite suffering from internal instability, may choose to ally with them against Hippogriffia. As a bulwark of harmony, Hippogriffia will have to face them, but they might have to deal with internal threats first. Macawia will not intervene in this conflict and in general has little interest in mainland affairs."

 EAW_WS_Northeastern_Zebrica_desc:0 "There is much variety in the geography of northeastern Zebrica. There are the snow-covered §gAndelayas§! which are the tallest mountains in the world, the arid highlands where the llama and alpaca dwell, and the humid jungle valleys and marshes of Hindia, home of the Hindian deer and their Olenian overlords. The sheer size and magnitude of the Andelayas has prevented any invasion by land, keeping Hindia safe and secluded from the rest of the continent. But the mighty mountains could do nothing to keep the region safe from seaborne invaders, whose longships carried them from across the vast eastern ocean.\n\nDue to this separation, much of the northeast is underdeveloped. The llama and alpacas of the highlands live in splendid isolation, ruled by an absolute and divine monarch, the §YSapa Llama§!. The state controls almost everything, and wants to make sure nothing changes the status quo. On the slopes of the mountains, there is the small realm of §LStagpal§!, carved out by an ambitious deer conqueror, yet is populated mostly by llamas and alpacas. Down below, Hindia is divided between four nations: §DChital§! and §gSambar§!, whose Yarils are successors of Olenian vikings who conquered much of the subcontinent many centuries ago, as well as §PDoelhi§! and §GBarasingha§!, the principalities of the native deer. Off the shore, there is also the island realm of §LUusi Hirvimaa§!. Once the center of Olenian rule on the subcontinent, it is now a subjugated §GMacawian§! protectorate.\n\nThe region was spared from the §CStorm King's§! wrath mostly because of how far away from the yeti homeland it is, but the mountains also formed a great barrier against his airships. Yet even then, the region suffers from widespread poverty and illiteracy which hinder progress and weigh down on its nations. The one economic boon the region has is its many rubber plantations, meaning a united Hindia could become one of the world's leading producers of rubber.\n\nA united Hindia, however, seems like a pipedream in 1007. Tensions between the two groups, the heirs of viking conquerors and the native princes, continue to grow, while the Yarildoms and the principalities suffer from internal instability as well. A peaceful solution seems unlikely, and a region-wide conflict seems inevitable. Perhaps in the end, after the dust has settled, the deer of Hindia may have united under one banner."

The desert itself is very inhospitable and is sparsely populated, primarily by zebras and camels who live on scattered oases and endorheic rivers. The outskirts of this wasteland are more habitable: the foothills of the §gAndelayas§! in the east, and the §DGreat Lakes§! in the west, fed by the mighty §CNeighle river§!.\n\nThe desert itself is desolate and is populated mostly by nomadic tribes. The northern part of the Zebhara is nominally controlled by the §RAzir§! tribes, while the south is under the rule of the §CCentral Zebrican Empire§! and its mad yeti warlord. In the east, the §OFree Camel Tribes§! resist the rule of another yeti warlord, the self-proclaimed §gKing Boltrus§! of §DBoltria§! who seized Camelkand and now rules most of camelkind. In the west, around the Great Lakes and along the Neighle river, exist many small zebra kingdoms and warlord states, formed after the fall of the §YMazwi Empire§!. The entire region is a powderkeg ready to explode, as most of the countries only recently declared independence, and some want to replace Mazwi as the new hegemon of the Great Lakes. The small nation of §gRe'em§!, ruled by a religious sect of horses, do not want to get directly involved in the upcoming conflict, but might support some of the warlords.\n\nCentral Zebrica was already poorer and less developed than the northern and western parts of the continent, but the §CStorm King§! made things much worse. The large and prosperous Mazwi Empire was sacked and destroyed, now only existing as a small rump state surrounded by furious former subjects. Further east, ambitious yeti generals established realms of their own after the Storm King's death and now rule as cruel despots. Much of the wealth in the region was looted and carried elsewhere, yet the region cannot recover until numerous existing tensions are resolved.\n\nThe Great Lakes are likely to reunite, but which kingdom, tribe or warlord does so is difficult to predict. The Central Zebrican Empire will likely collapse as soon as the mad emperor dies, while the camels will fight for their freedom or die trying. There is great potential in the region, but for any of it to be realized, much blood will need to be spilled."

The high altitude and proximity to the south pole results in a climate that ranges from temperate to subarctic. Many races live here: Zebras, hyenas, yeti, gargoyles, and centaurs. In the past, most of the races managed to live together in relative peace, but after the §CStorm King§! united the squabbling yeti race under one banner, everything changed.\n\nBut the Storm King is now dead, and the heartland of the kingdom he created is divided between four warlords, each claiming to be his true heir. While they are distracted, other races try to recover from the devastation wrought by the yeti.

In the northwest, the zebras of §RHayzeb§! who are free from yeti influence focus their attention on the power struggle in the Great Lakes, but there is no doubt they will eventually shift their attention south and try to free their oppressed brethren.\n\nThe south suffered the most from the Storm King's campaigns. Many countries were completely destroyed and annexed directly into the Storm King's domain, while others were looted and ravaged. However, the yeti homeland itself has prospered, becoming rich from all the loot brought back by yeti warriors. But now as civil war tears the south apart, even that prosperity is threatened. Whoever wins and claims the mantle of Storm King will have to spend a long time to rebuild.\n\nWhile the yeti focus on their civil war, the Dervishes will intervene and try to reclaim their homeland. The Hayzeb Federation will primarily focus on the Great Lakes, but intervention is not out of the question for them either. Further east, the gargoyles and centaurs will deal with internal affairs, trying to keep their alliance and their countries together. But once the civil war ends, no one wants the brutal campaign of the Storm King to be repeated, and an anti-yeti alliance seems inevitable. The many races of the south yearn for peace, but there will be none until the yeti threat is dealt with once and for all."

But here, truth defies expectations, as the region is predominantly tropical, with subtropical conditions at its periphery. The southeastern peninsula is covered largely by thick jungles, and the air feels hot even when the nights are long in winter. There is no widely accepted explanation for this bizarre phenomenon, but there are rumours that a §YGolden Temple§! deep in the jungle is affecting the climate with magic. Rumours of this temple, as well as valuable tropical plants and precious minerals in the hills, have attracted the attention of §GFeathisian§! adventurers, who have established colonies to extract local wealth.\n\nThere are three such colonies: the §OSouth Zebrides§! in the many islands to the south, the §YVrystaat§! on the hilly coast, and §LTalonsvaal§! in the arid northern mountains. While these states are mostly administered by griffons, their populace primarily consists of native zebras, while the Zebrides have a notable kirin minority as well. The natives of the region have nations of their own as well. In the northwest, there is the giraffe kingdom of §YTwizanyika§!, the belligerent §gZeblu Empire§! and §RRoam§!, whose zebra king has a lost Romauan legion as his retinue. In the southeastern jungles and forests and on the islands in the sea, there are many smaller tribes and kingdoms, the largest of which is §gZongo§!.\n\nThe Storm King largely left the southeast alone, and only small raids on the gold mines of Twizanyika were launched. The griffon colonists and their native neighbours were too militarized, while the rest of the southeast was too underdeveloped and poor to be worthwhile. The Golden Temple interested the Storm King, but he planned to search for it later after he had completed the rest of his conquests. Thankfully, he died before that.\n\nBecause none of the nations in the southeast have to be concerned with rebuilding, they can focus on dealing with their neighbours. Tensions have long been growing between the griffon colonists and natives, with Talonsvaal suffering a disastrous defeat against Roam. Zeblu is a rising power and seeks to become the undisputed hegemon of the region. Deep in the jungles, the tribes of the peninsula are stirring, while in the forests, the agrarian kingdoms seek to finally modernize and possibly wage war against their neighbours. The southeastern nations were spared from the Storm King's wrath, but it appears they will have to face each other's fury instead."

However, the eastern half of the Arabian peninsula is covered in desert due to rain shadows from the mountains while the rains of the Arabian Sea go east towards Riseia. As the majority of the northwest is dry, the population of cats, horses, ponies and donkeys is concentrated on the coast and along fertile rivers which flow from the mountains. The latter is especially true in §FMaregypt§!, as the grand §CNeighle river§! flows through it, providing a vital source of water in the dry sands.\n\nSaddle Arabia is the largest nation in the region - or, it was, until civil war tore it asunder into five factions. The horses of Saddle Arabia were once hegemons of the entire west, but centuries of decadence have seen their empire crumble. Northeast of Saddle Arabia lie §rAsstyria§! and §gAnseruk§!, nations of warlike donkeys, while cats inhabit the mountainous kingdom of Abyssinia. Maregypt is populated by ponies, cousins of Equestrians, as is the area of §GManedalusia§!, which is partitioned between Abyssinia and Maregypt. South of the donkeys is the emirate of §RYemane§! which broke off from Saddle Arabia many years ago.\n\nHalf of the region avoided the §CStorm King's§! fury, while the other half was plundered by him. While Saddle Arabia was still united, its modern and powerful army was able to match the Storm King's host, and they protected the donkeys, who were still in their sphere of influence. Abyssinia, Maregypt and Yemane were not so lucky. The Storm King wreaked havoc in their lands, taking everything that was worth taking and savaging the rest. Abyssinia in particular suffered greatly, as they proudly attempted to resist the Storm King, but to no avail.\n\nThe Storm King has since perished, and now would've been the perfect time for Saddle Arabia to reassert its former dominance. Alas, internal unrest reached a boiling point and the once powerful and wealthy nation is now tearing itself apart. The donkeys are now left without a protector, but are now also free to pursue their own foreign policy. Yemane, Abyssinia, and Maregypt must focus on rebuilding what was destroyed, but all three of them have poor relations with their neighbours. The Griffonian §PKingdom of Wingbardy§! has a small holding in Abyssinia and may seek to expand its influence in the region.

Both are almost entirely populated by horses and ponies, with only a small minority of zebras. Being the more southerly of the two, Hestraya is colder, with boreal forests and marshes, while Riseia has a pleasant temperate climate, fertilized by rains from the Arabian Sea.

The alliance between Maretonia and Aestlonia gives both a chance for survival as long as it lasts, while Riseia must unite one way or another, as being so divided makes them only a minor obstacle, at best. At the very least, the smaller nations don't have to worry too much about modernization, being already so advanced, while Karkadannistan lags behind them.

Migrants were attracted by promises of free farmland, of jobs at the mines and fisheries, and more unofficially, of freedom from the Empire's direct rule. In fact, Nova Griffonia developed a reputation as a place were political dissidents and criminals were exiled to, and many migrants were initially convicts sentenced to forced labour in the mines.\n\nUnfortunately, despite greatly expanding in size over the years, Nova Griffonia always remained reliant on its colonial overlord.

They were there before the §RAge of Monsters§!, and when abominations roamed the land they were there with them.

Each pony tribe thought they were superior in a way and claimed the land for themselves, but only together could they prevail in the end. Equestrian folklore says that the three leaders of the tribes were locked away in a cave in the middle of a blizzard, and that the only reason they survived was cooperation and friendship.

Over a millennium ago, the northern Wingbardian and Falcorian tribes conquered the §YKingdom of Karthinia§! which had splintered from the §RKingdom of Sparléos§!. In the following centuries there were many wars and border changes, with one side dominating the other in turn. This bitter rivalry only came to an end when §YEmperor Grover I§! invaded and subjugated both.\n\nWhat followed was two centuries of peace, which neither Falcorians nor Wingbardians had experienced in a long time. Under Imperial protection, both nations grew and prospered. §GFalcor§!, the capital of the Queendom, grew into a thriving commercial and industrial city, while §GMatton§! attracted many miners and foundry workers. Open trade between the subjects of the Empire meant the border with Wingbardy practically ceased to exist, allowing for free trade and shared wealth.\n\nYet all good things must come to an end.\n\nThe King of Wingbardy was assassinated in 972 and his heir §YGaribald Talonuel III§! formally seceded from the Empire. Falcor remained an Imperial subject, but suddenly the border with Wingbardy became relevant again. Already disputes arose over what village and town belonged to which country, but Falcorians relied on the Empire to protect them.\n\nThen the Empire collapsed in the §RGriffonian Revolution of 978§!.\n\nThe Queen of Falcor was left on her own, and tensions continued to grow. Wingbardy could now assert its claims and Falcorians had to step in to defend their own territory. Clashes in the border town of Meranclawo in 985 escalated and both sides moved in reinforcements. Soon enough, the skirmish became a battle, which then became a war.\n\nAfter some initial advance by Wingbardy, the war became a stalemate until 987, when the Falcorian army launced a northern §Ycounter-offensive§! in the Battle of Clawporetto which broke through the Wingbardian lines and routed the 2nd Army. Falcorians advanced rapidly until they reached the flooding river Piumave, where they were stopped. Wingbardy had a chance to dig in and reorganize. Wingbardy called its ally §RFrancistria§! to join the war and attack the over-extended northern Falcorian divisions, and in 989 the §RGaribald Offensive§! began.

It was a kingdom ruled by powerful §Cunicorn mages§! who formed the meritocratic upper class of society, and their mastery of the arcane was unrivaled.\n\nBut that was over a millennium ago, in an age almost forgotten. Since then, other Empires have risen and fallen, while Wittenland faded to irrelevance. Its meritocracy crumbled as the mages became a decadent hereditary aristocracy, who were content with living a luxurious life in their mountain castles. Other unicorns, as well as the earth pony and pegasus minorities, were forced into serfdom to feed their mighty masters. Wittenland became an isolated, backwards realm.\n\nOver its long history it was attacked by the griffons of the west and the ponies of the north, yet it was only conquered once, by §RGrand Prince Blessed Sword§! of Lake City.

Only in 353 ALB did Wittenland break free, led by the heroic §YKing Haysil II the Lakepony Slayer§!, who hired deer mercenaries from a distant land to drive out the Lakeish oppressors. Afterwards the deer were granted the southeastern peninsula now known as §YAusturland§! as a reward. It is said Haysil was the last good King of Wittenland.\n\nAfter gaining independence, slowly but surely Wittenland's territory shrunk. Control of the southern coast was lost within centuries as it was overrun by corsairs and barbarians. Pònaidhean's tribes became de facto independent. In 807 the §GPrincipality of Rijekograd§! seized Coltstream and even tried to besiege High Mane, but failed to take it and suffered heavy losses in the process.

Around one millennium before Luna's banishment, the region began to see its first inhabitants, Riverpony tribes moving in from the east and settling in Longsword - the ancestors of the Longsword ponies of today.\n\nLongsword as a nation was shaped by its geographical position, its sparse population, and its history. Having to defend themselves and their way of life against incursions from all sides meant that Longsword's ponies became naturally more warlike and stubborn than the ponies of the Riverlands, whereas the forests and marshes of the region divided them into numerous disparate tribes. While they would occasionally unite against a common foe or join together in raids on foreign lands, they generally kept to themselves, holding onto a simple, tribal, communal way of life even when all of their neighbours moved on to feudal kingdoms.\n\nIn the following centuries, population pressures and ambitious tribal chiefs in Longsword would push the ponies to start mounting on raids to collect loot from surrounding kingdoms. Their river boats would reach as far as Romau in the West and Rijekograd in the East. The griffon estates were their primary target, however, and made Longsword ponies, and thus riverponies in general, into a bitter enemy of griffons.

As a condition, however, Western Longsword was granted the Rosewood Order, much like their brothers of the sword on the other side of the Griffking. Grover II's solution was to require the monarchy to share its powers with the Order and its institutions, in the form of an advisory council. This compact stayed, and the county prospered. Though it was seen as a place for griffon colonization, the Longswordian ponies received basic rights and most of them remained in their tribes as tenant farmers as long as they paid taxes. This colonization and pony presence would start to form a different culture as well, a so-called §Y"Ost-Griffonian"§! identity, which, while technically Griffonian, sees itself as something different regardless.\n\nHaving already grown distant from the Imperial heartland in the centuries prior, Longsword severed the last of its ties with Griffenheim during the §RRepublican Revolution of 978§!, and abandoned its status as an Imperial March.

In 143 ALB a large section of the Olenian nobility had grown tired of the increasingly centralized power of the monarchy, and the peace treaty enacted with Equestria that year proved to be the last straw. Many nobles were reliant on the §Rfresh source of thralls§! the raids on Equestria had provided them, and thus decided it was time to look for greener pastures. \n\nThe nobles started slowly moving west, led by the initial expedition of §YHoef Derickson,§! colonizing many small islands along the way. All while growing fat of the loot gained from raids on the sea lanes of Griffonia and Zebrica. The influence of the deer over the affairs of the Riverlands slowly grew, and soon small bands of §RViking§! mercenaries started traveling the area.

The social fabric of Austurland is made up of four classes. At the top lies the §GJarl,§! and the other §Gnobles§! of Austurland. The nobility maintains a high degree of autonomy but does begrudgingly accept the need for some higher authority to resolve feuds and maintain the bare necessity of foreign policy. \n\nBelow them are the §Yfreedeer,§! who owe no oath of allegiance to any noble beyond the Jarl, and have the right to represent themselves at the Althing. The freeder comprise the majority of the merchants, priests, and Vikings within Austurland, and are one of the few forces of modernization within the country. \n\nBelow the freedeer lie the §Ocommondeer,§! serfs who are constrained to the lands of the nobles they serve. Making up the majority of the farmers and craftsmen of Austurland. They often serve as levies used up in conflicts between nobles, and many turn to banditry to escape their conditions.\n\nBut the commondeer enjoy a wealth of rights compared to the lowest rung on Austulands social ladder. The §Rthralls§! are the property of their noble owners, and live miserable lives under them. Most thralls are taken from their own country during Viking raids, and endure grueling manual labor maintaining the vast estates of the Austurlandian nobility.\n\nAusturland has prided itself on maintaining the old ways of the deer, but as the Griffonian continent is thrown into chaos, those very same traditions threaten to take Austurland to the grave.

While their origins are cloaked in myth and legend though, their reasons for leaving their home were clear: oppression by a §Rforeign pony monarchy§! that had seized control of their lands and did not care about their plight. Upon arriving in the §CAsterion Archipelago§! the ships of the fleet spread out to found twenty-one colonies, four of which were located on the mainland. Those twenty-one colonies formed themselves into a §Cconfederation§! to democratically settle any internal and external disputes. This lasted for hundreds of years until a crisis came about that allowed an ambitious politician to declare himself §Rking§!. The new kingdom would end up lasting for longer than the democracy that preceded it, but it was always a hollow existence. Non-compliance was commonplace, and both in secret and abroad the Asterionese would continue to advocate for freeing the homeland of tyranny.

The principalities were soon subjugated, but the Kingdom of Asterion protested. The mountains had belonged to them and the Emperor refused to cede them back. When he heard the minotaurs' demands, his response was harsh: he §Rcrushed§! the Asterionese army and §Rannexed the mainland states§!, which later became the §RCounty of Cyanolisia§!. However, he could not invade Asterion itself without a fleet, so peace was settled. The monarchy had been decisively weakened, so when §REmperor Grover II§! came in 799 to secure supply lines for his crusade against the eastern ponies and to teach the south a lesson in humility, Asterion did little to resist. §YThe Imperial Navy§! blockaded the archipelago, a massive army landed and the King §Rsurrendered§! after a single engagement.\n\nFrom that time on a darkness would settle across the land as the native population was forced to abide by §RImperial rule§!.

The next twenty-eight years were marked extensive planning for a §Gcontinental invasion§! and massive build up of the navy and army. The good times would not last however, and indeed by the time 1007 of the Equestrian calendar rolled around political deadlock had set in. The nation of Asterion now finds itself divided, with a §Rcoalition of nationalists and communists§! gaining popularity by advocating radical policies that change the status quo. Outsiders think this will lead to a civil war, but they miss a key point of the Asterionese national spirit: They are so fearful of griffon expansionism that civil war is off the table for every minotaur in the nation for fear that as soon as they start shooting at each other foreigners will attack and enslave them once again.

As their numbers grew, friction arose between them and Taungpau's indigenous llama population — the latter of whom had long been tolerant of the former's presence within their lands, but now feared the influence of these kirin interlopers on their way of life.

The §YTemporal Conclave§!, a forum of the Canon's most senior theologists and philosophers, was formed in 852 as a concession to modernity's encroachment on Taungpau, with a growing population, gradual technological advancement, and entailingly, the increasing complexity of life, all of which necessitated some form of central government. The de-facto government of the §YEternal Mandate§!, as Taungpau would come to be known, the Temporal Conclave, housed on a small fleet of riverboats, travels up and down the banks of the §YSahajart River§! with a nomadic host of land-based camp followers in tow: a wandering capital straddling both land and water, its location in a state of constant flux so that the Conclave — Taungpau's locus of political power — could never become stagnant and thus disrupt the balance of power in the land.\n\nOf little geopolitical value, Taungpau may well endure the looming turmoil of the new millennium with its bucolic way of life intact, as long as the Eternal Mandate continues to find success in its perpetual tug-of-war against the twin forces of §Rprogress§! and §Rentropy§!, the manifestations of which, in the form of industrialisation, war, and crisis, must be overcome as they arise."

As the island stronghold of §CUusi Hirvimaa§! became the domain of the Sea-Kings, the Kudlinens built a parallel seat of power across the sea in §COstkranbi§!, and soon the word of the Kudlinens became far more powerful than any decree from their rightful liege lord.\n\nCome §G981 ALB§!, §YSubdenbeg§!, the last Sea-King of the line of Ivor, set off on a voyage to south to reconquer Ostkranbi and demonstrate to the Chitali that his rule over Hindia was not only stronger than the Kudlinen hold, but vastly superior. Fate saw it differently, as a brilliant naval assault by the young marshal §YJakob Kudlinen§!, the brother of §YYaril Benjen IV§!, forced §YSubdenbeg§!'s forces to retreat into a perilous storm at sea.

 EAW_WS_KIR_desc:0 "The §GRealm of Kiria§!, born from the squabbling mess of kirin villages and tribes that dotted the land for centuries, was only birthed roughly around the year 450 ALB, becoming the first unified nation-state in the species' history. Until that point, the kirin lived in a state of constant conflict, with the political landscape of the region consisting of an ever-shifting set of alliances that formed and fractured along with the temperaments of their leaders. For the kirin species bears a powerful and dangerous curse within them: the ability to transform into a beast of fire and fury, a §Rnirik§!, upon becoming enraged, losing all sense of friend and foe, shedding their inhibitions and better judgement. When disagreements could leave entire villages §Rburnt to cinders§!, unification of this aggressive species seemed impossible.\n\nBut where conquest, cunning, and cooperation had failed, §CThe Way of Fire§! proved successful. The §CWay§! was a set of religious beliefs that taught its followers to practice controlling their emotions and reject the §Rnirik state§! so that it would be possible for kirin to live in peace and harmony with each other. Those that followed the §CWay§! pointed to the teachings and responsibilities given to all kirin by their mythological deity, §YConcord§!, who had entrusted the kirin species with the last spark of the primordial fire that birthed the world. Succumbing to the destruction of the §Rnirik state§! was a rejection and corruption of Concord's gift, and kirin could only be worthy of Her gifts if they ceased their fighting and worked together. To the kirin, long weary of the destruction and fighting their violent natures enforced on them, §CThe Way of Fire§! offered an escape to a better life. Over the years, the majority of the kirin in the Realm unified under the leadership of the §OVermilion Priests§!, establishing a peaceful society for the first time in their history to work together and better their lot in life.\n\nOver time, the priests that ruled this society slowly morphed into the §OVermilion Dynasty§!, led by an infallible Matriarch Superior. The stability offered by the Dynasty and the Way enabled the Kirin nation to expand in power and influence, allowing it to dominate much of south-eastern Zebrica. But even the Dynasty's might was not enough to prepare the kirin for the modern age. The ninth-century was a period of turbulent change. The invention of steam and clockwork engines sparked socioeconomic and political transformation. Advancements in agriculture led to a population boom and the growth of the cities of §CRhapsody§!, §OFragrance§!, and §GVerdant§!. Feudalism was being replaced by capitalism. The ascendancy of a Kirin bourgeoisie of §Ymerchants§!, §Ylandlords§!, and §Yscholar-industrialists§! §Oundermined§! the control of the Dynasty and the Way of Fire over a Realm on the cusp of an §Yindustrial revolution§!.\n\nWith the §Ystratification of society§! along class lines came an increase in conflict. As they attempted to extend their control over Kiria's economy and agriculture, the interests of merchants and landlords came into opposition with those of the peasants and city-dwelling labourers. Discontent built up among the lower classes, and before too long, violent and destructive §Rpeasant uprisings§! engulfed the land, exacerbated by the violent transformations of thousands of disgruntled peasants into nirik that ravaged large parts of the countryside and set flame to the Realm's urban centers. In an act of desperation, §YMatriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm§! instituted a series of harsh political measures and decrees that would collectively come to be known as §RThe Silence§!. The Matriarch decreed that it was treason to assume a position of power over another kirin, as it undermined the absolutism of her divine rule. All forms of currency were thereby declared blasphemous, as were property rights. All forms of hierarchical organisation and relationships were also outlawed. The only exception was families — and the Way of Fire's §CHierocracy§!, albeit reduced to a rump of its most zealous and ultraorthodox, and therefore trustworthy, acolytes. Most city-dwelling kirin returned to the countryside and engaged in subsistence farming, depopulating the cities.\n\nThose who defied §RThe Silence§! were ostracized and shunned, for the worship and veneration of the §OVermilion Dynasty§! was so prolific and deeply entrenched within Kirin society that much of the populace at the time had become firmly devoted to their Matriarch; during that period of conflict and strife, as Kiria teetered on the brink of §Rcivil war§!, the Matriarch Superior had become a bastion of serenity and calm in the midst of the tempest. The remnants of the Kirin bourgeoisie fled, either overseas, or to the most distant reaches of the Realm, away from Imperial authority — now more or less defunct, because there was no longer a state through which the Matriarch Superior could exercise her power. The §GRealm of Kiria§! had, effectively, been put in a dark corner to slowly die.\n\nNoctilucent Charm died in 971, at which point her only daughter, Princess §CRain Shine§!, ascended as Matriarch Superior in a markedly modest affair. Rain Shine was determined to live up to her mother's legacy, and set about upholding the decrees of the Silence, dedicating most of her time to intensive study of the scriptures of the Way of Fire.\n\n§RThe Silence§! would last for roughly a century before an §YEquestrian diplomatic mission§! would venture into the isolated nation with the hopes of gaining an audience with Rain Shine. Working with a few dissident kirin, the mission was ultimately successful in helping Rain Shine realize her mother's errors, and began the first steps in opening up the country. As a new era dawns on Kiria, it is up to the Matriarch to undo the damage §RThe Silence§! has caused to her Realm and bring her nation into the brave new world it finds itself in, before the influence of her dynasty §Yfades forever§!."

Every kirin in the city streets stopped what they were doing and looked around, and as a crowd began to form from thin air, they moved to join it, swelling its numbers and adding their weight to the procession. Soon, they reached their destination: 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, the national headquarters of the National Association of Kirin Patriots, and the onlookers craned their necks to see over the countless rows of red horns to catch a glimpse of enforcers in crisp uniforms fashioning a perimeter around a stage.

"Kirin of Fragrance, the Grand Gallop Onward was a failure. It was sabotaged by §Cunbending spiritual dogma§!, §Rblasphemous revolution§!, and the §Osheer incompetence§! of those that led it. Fragrance already knew the path forward to peace and prosperity, but our voice was drowned out by ignorance and superstition. And now, with the house of cards beginning to topple in Vermilion, we are supposed to pledge unending loyalty to the regime that fostered all this failure?"\n\n"I will not have it," Current said with a stomp of his hoof. "Fragrance has suffered under Vermilion for too long. No more, I say! No more will we be shackled to the fate of our §Ylesser sibling§!. No more will Vermilion hold sway over us. We, who have been given all the tools we need to succeed, will no longer share them with those that know not how to use them properly. It is time for Fragrance to stand on its own. It is time for the kirin of the north, the kirin of §GGreater Providence§!, to claim the independent identity we have longed for for so long!"\n\n"It is time that we break with Vermilion, and we do what our inept leaders could not: bring Kiria into a §Gnew and prosperous modern era!§!" #lack of closing quotation mark an intentional stylistic choice.

The kirin from Vermilion were armed with rifles, while the peasants carried pitchforks, scythes, spades, and whatever other tools they could get their hooves on, but the garrison was forty against four thousand.

Lan Kir's location on the periphery of the Vermilion Realm meant that it was one of the few places that saw regular combat between Kirin and Zebra. What should have been a sleepy frontier, therefore, instead became an important as well as prestigious military outpost §Ydespite lacking economic or political value§!. Owing to the incessant skirmishes erupting along the conflict-prone border, the §GBanners§! dispatched to defend Lan Kir's borders were viewed as among the most capable in Kiria, and the Banners of the Zaikirian Commandery rotated regularly through the region in order to benefit from the abundance of fighting and valuable combat experience to be had.\n\nAt the onset of the §RSilence§!, the Commandery of Zaikiria became a refuge for Kirin refusing to subject themselves to a slow death by §Rprimitive retrogression§!. As a multitude of petty regional secessionists took advantage of Vermilion's dysfunction to rise up in open rebellion against the Commandery, the Banners of Zaikiria, themselves riven by fratricidal infighting over the imposition of the Silence, failed to restore order, and the entire region §Rexploded into violence§!. In the end, the Zaikirian Banners, marooned at their postings and isolated from Vermilion, were defeated by the wave of local insurgencies in the wake of Kiria's collapse. Of their shattered remnants, some managed to retreat to §Ythe forests of the Zaikirian frontier§!, where the once-proud Banners of Zaikiria attempted to regroup for a counterattack into Zaikiria. Yet no aid was forthcoming from Kiria, where the Silence had already taken hold of the Realm. The last orders from Vermilion, dispatched via dragonfire candle, §Rcensured§! the failure of the Zaikirian Banners to maintain control over the Commandery, and ordered them return to Kiria and submit to the §RSilence§!.\n\nThe message caused great dismay among the soldiers, many of whom had fought for years to keep the frontiers of Kiria safe. Vermilion's brusque dismissal of their service caused much bitterness and anger among the ranks — a tide of rage and fury which saw the remnants of the Banners fall apart in a wave of desertions, banditry, and §Rnirik transformations§!. The crisis culminated with a proclamation by Imperial Commissioner §CSummer Storm§! — formerly the Governor of §YBlossom§! — that the Zaikirian Banners, mutinous, would no longer obey §Rthe dictates of Vermilion§!. The achievements of the §GTwenty Banners§! were nothing to be cast aside so lightly, and instead, he vowed to let their strength and fury be given its due reward. If Kiria would not help them restore order, §Ythen they would do so themselves§!. This proclamation would uplift morale amongst the ranks, and restore a semblance of order and discipline, setting the stage for the founding of the State of Lan Kir with Summer Storm as its first General of State.\n\nFor twenty years, Lan Kir and its native kirin were ruled under a §Yde-facto military occupation§! by the Twenty Banners, but in the end, starvation, attrition, and the §Rsolidification of independent successor states§! in §YSen Kinh§! and §YKhamrin§! meant that the restoration of the Zaikirian Commandery became nigh-on-impossible. After the death of Summer Storm in a raid against a Zeblu farmstead, with the Lan Kir Banners facing yet another crisis of leadership, §CLong Dusk§! — the daughter of Summer Storm — rallied the remaining Bannerkirin against the looming fate of a slow and humiliating demise in exile, and succeeded her father as Lan Kir's §Gsecond General of State§!. Under her guidance, Lan Kir underwent a reformation from a territory under military occupation to something approaching a §Ysemi-modern nation-state§!, ruled over by a stratocratic government premised upon the structures of the §CBanner System§!. A rough and militaristic §Ydemocracy§! emerged within the Banners, where decisions on matters of significance were determined by a system of voting in which the number of votes castable by an individual Bannerkirin increased with the §Yseniority§! of their §Ymilitary rank§!. Over the years, the functions of the military dictatorship were progressively §Ydelegated to bureaucratic institutions§!, and Lan Kir's natives were incorporated into the Banners as auxiliaries and §Ysoldiers§! — the latter category being eligible for full §Ginduction into the Banner System§!. With a secure route to Bannerkirin status in place, a slow but steady §Ydemographic shift§! took place over the course of Long Dusk's reign, where the descendants of the original Bannerkirin and the natives of Lan Kir slowly became one — a people united in their service to a heavily militarized state unlike any seen in Kirin history.\n\nA hundred years after the Silence and the establishment of the State of Lan Kir, the state stands before a precipice, with rumours of the §Yend of the Silence§! in Kiria rumbling throughout Zaikiria.

He made an old Wingbardian trading town of Pulcino his capital and renamed it to §CFrancistria§!, which gave his new country its name.\n\nEver since, the proud and arrogant warrior-rulers of the Martlewing dynasty have defended their realm against foreign incursions and expanded north and east before eventually establishing relatively friendly relations with the §YKingdom of Wingbardy§!. Generations of intermarriage between the ruling families maintained peace between the two. When the §RGriffonian Empire§! eventually invaded in 705, the two stood side by side yet failed to stop the mighty §YEmperor Grover I§!. Count Francis III swore an oath of fealty and remained loyal for the following centuries.\n\nThe close ties to Wingbardy, however, meant that when §YKing Gumberto§! of Wingbardy was assassinated, Imperial nobles were blamed and Wingbardy itself seceded from the Empire, Francistria did the same.

When the Discrets regained power in 985 and demanded the lands back, Francis simply reminded them that he had powerful friends in the south, and the Discrets backed down.\n\nLater during the same year, the §RFalcor War§! erupted. In return for their protection, Francis was bound by honour to aid Wingbardy and joined the war, which ended poorly for him: he died in battle, leading his troops on the frontline like his ancestors had done.

With limited resources and griffonpower, Talonostra was thrown on the defensive and was forced to construct a string of mountain keeps to defend his small realm against the other post-Arantigan kingdoms. The most formidable of the rogue kingdoms proved to be §RKarthin,§! which began a series of conquests across the former empire's southern territories in 566 BLB. The newly-born §RKarthinian Empire§! attempted three failed invasions of Talonsia, each time being repelled by the Talonostras' defensive mountain forts.\n\nAlthough victorious in battle, the conflicts drained enormous wealth from Talonsia. And so in 535 BLB, Talonsia agreed to become a march of Karthin. The period of peace that followed was one of prosperity for Talonsia, even as their imperial masters stagnated and declined, ultimately falling to the §YWingbardians§! in 453 BLB. Talonsia quickly declared independence and was beset by barbarian invaders, but once again its fortifications proved impregnable. As the Wingbardian territories congealed into a patchwork of feudal states, Talonsia continued to maintain its defensive line of forts, proudly bearing the title of §G"Warden of the South",§! a title once granted to the Talonostras by Arantigos himself.\n\nThroughout the 2nd century BLB, Talonsia began to decentralise as local lords consolidated power around their keeps. Although the army remained loyal to the Talonostras, Talononte's grip was loosening. The death knell came after the assassination of §CKing Marus of Talonsia§! in 34 BLB. The kingdom, which by that point only nominally governed the lords, finally ceased to exist. A brutal succession war ensued, with a minor lord securing the capital and declaring himself §CDuke of Talononte.§!\n\nThe birth of the §YKingdom of Aquileia§! during the 2nd century ALB sparked a dramatic increase in trade in the western bay, greatly benefiting the region. Trade also accelerated the mixing of Talonsians and Wingbardians, and as time passed the land became more and more often referred to by its Wingbardian name, §GTalouse§!, instead of Talonsia. By the end of the 3rd century, a strong Talousian culture had formed, marked by their veneration of Arantigos alongside typical Wingbardian traditions. The land remained disunited politically until 602, when §CGiovanni I, Duke of Talonsia,§! was willed the crown of Navarro after §CDuke Emmanuel IV's§! death. Giovanni accepted and combined the two crowns in a new state: the §GDuchy of Talouse.§!\n\nWhen §OGrover I of Griffonstone,§! blessed by the §OIdol of Boreas,§! conquered Wingbardy in 706, Talousian forces fighting alongside the Wingbardians witnessed his army's incredible might. As the mighty conqueror approached the Folino, §CDuke Francesco VI§! himself bent the knee, making Talouse a vassal realm of the ascendant §OGriffonian Empire.§! Peace reigned for the next few centuries, and when §Ymassive coal deposits§! were discovered under the Talousian Highlands, several Wingbardian mining companies moved into the area to provide their homeland with a cheap and plentiful supply of coal.\n\nIn 972, Wingbardy seceded from the Empire. §CDuke Giovanni III§! honored the old alliance and seceded as well. Talouse joined the new §GKarthinian Pact,§! which became the major power bloc in Southern Griffonia. One key provision of the Pact was the right for the Wingbardian mining companies to continue their operations in Talouse: the infamous §RCoal Clause§! derided by nearly all Talousians. Following Wingbardy's example, Talouse established a national §YParliament§! in order to embrace modernity. Unfortunately, just like in Wingbardy, the Parliament proved ineffective and several governments fell in succession.\n\nDuke Giovanni III died in his sleep in 992 and was succeeded by his hot-headed daughter §CGinevra.§! Ginevra's most well-known moment came during the §RGreat Strike of 1003.§! Thousands of workers marched down the streets of Talononte, calling for less hours, more pay, and the fair treatment of workers. The city ground to a halt while Parliament scrambled to think of a solution to quiet the rabble, yet at the same time wished to stay on the good side of the industrialists. The Duchess stormed into the Parliament building, shouting "Lo giuro su Boreas, se voi bastardi non fate qualcosa, appenderò ognuno di voi in piazza!" The very next day, Parliament passed a resolution granting workers slightly higher wages, a slightly reduced work day, and some protections.\n\nWith this year's election fast approaching, Prime Minister §CMarco Paltori§! and the incumbent liberal government will have to fight hard to keep their position. It will be a tough fight, but securing Talouse's place in the world will be an even tougher fight, no matter which party emerges victorious..."

 EAW_WS_CTH:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] - Battered Pride Of Zonicia"
 EAW_WS_CTH_desc:0 "Legends say that the city of §gColthage§! (Kolt-Hadast in Zonician) was founded in 1742 BLB by §YQueen Zido§!, who, banished by her father, led a group of refugees from the city of Zur to establish a new home for themselves. In reality, it had likely been established by Zonician colonists from the west who founded many other cities during that time such as Hippone and Zebinop. Over the following centuries, the mercantile Zonician civilization spread, grew and prospered. Soon, Colthage became the hegemon of northern Zebrica and one of the great empires of the ancient world.\n\nBut Colthage was not without a rival. In the north across the Middle Sea, §RKarthinia§! opposed Colthaginian expansion. Not long after Colthage had founded the colony of §YNew Colthage§! on Scarlet Island, open war erupted between the two powers in 552 BLB. Despite an initial naval advantage, Colthage eventually lost and was forced to cede its overseas colonies. This was merely the beginning of the end. In 490 BLB, Karthinians §Rsacked and destroyed§! Colthage, and the remnants of their fallen empire were annexed by Zur.\n\nAfter Colthage regained its independence in 15 BLB, its zebras attempted to re-establish their dominance once more, but they never reached the heights of their ancestors. While Colthage was weakened by corruption and infighting, the hordes of §RQuaggatai§! descended upon Zonicia in 521 ALB. One by one, cities fell, and Colthage lost its freedom once again. This period was a §Ldark age§! in the history of Zonician civilization, as the Khans of Quaggatai demanded tribute and enslaved thousands.\n\nYet hardships made Zonicians tenacious. In 825 ALB, 300 years after the fall of Hippone, Zinuzel Zidalid, the priest of the town of Zoea, started a §Grevolt§! against the local Quaggatai warlords. He declared that all Zonician zebras should be free and united under a single banner. His uprising inspired resistance all along the north coast. Within a decade, all of Zonicia had been liberated and Quaggatai collapsed into a civil war. Yet the dreams of a united Zonician nation were shattered as Warzena and Zumidia refused to join. Thus, the §GColthaginian Republic§! was established soon after. Conflict arose between §gFederalists§! and §OCentralists§!, but after a brief civil war the latter stood triumphant.\n\nIn 975 ALB, §YZamilcar Zarca§! became the Sufrit of Colthage. He turned the nation from a republic into an oligarchical dictatorship and hired an influential group of academics known as the §CScientific Clique§! to help run the nation. Their economic policies imported the industrial revolution to Colthage, but at the cost of selling off property to foreign investors. Zamilcar also established a treaty of friendship and mutual support with the heirs of their ancient rival, §YWingbardy§!. But soon after the new millennium began, the industrialising Colthaginian nation faced a yet another foreign threat.\n\nColthage was among the last nations invaded by the infamous §CStorm King§!. They fared no better than the others: The army was destroyed, Zamilcar perished and his sons fled into the mountains to wage a guerrilla war against the invaders. Much of the wealth of Colthage was seized and progress on modernisation was halted. But within months, the Storm King had been killed in the §YBattle of Ain Trotgourait§! against §CHippogriffia§!. The Colthaginian Senate gathered once more and elected a new Sufrit: §YZalathel Zarca§!, son of Zamilcar.\n\nColthage is free once more, but plagued by internal unrest following the Storm King's invasion. Internal factions vie for the Sufrit's support and the re-established military consists largely of unreliable mercenaries. There is unrest in the west and east, as §YConstitutionalists§! and §RColtvans§! oppose the Sufrit's dictatorial rule. Quaggatai is resurgent in the south, having seized §YColtdar§! during the chaotic aftermath of the Storm King's death. Can Zalathel Zarca solve these problems, or will Colthage fall again?"

That paradise was the twin realms of Mount Aris and Seaquestria, and their descendants were the first of the Hippogriffs and the Seaponies. For many millennia, the two realms flourished and prospered, with anycreature able to change forms by petitioning the high priest-kings to use the §YPearl of Transformation§!. During this time, the two realms wanted little to do with the outside world, and life was simple but good.\n\nOver time however, the priest-kings grew greedy, demanding lavish tributes to even see the §YPearl of Transformation§!, much less use it. The two realms drifted apart, with the hippogriffs looking to the outside world, to North Zebrica and Equestria, and the seaponies turning inward. Local nobles and merchants came to dominate society, bringing prosperity to the land but also dissatisfaction with the arrogant and distant priest-kings. Finally, in the year 523 ALB by Equestrian reckoning, one family of nobles rebelled against the priest-kings and their monopoly on the §YPearl§!.\n\nThis family, known now as the Royal Line of Novo, rallied both seaponies and hippogriffs to unite into one Kingdom of Hippogriffia, with the §YPearl of Transformation§! now freely available to any creature who wished to use it. They established a tradition of twin capitals: one on Mount Aris, the other in Seaquestria, with the king or queen dutifully moving their court between the capitals every six months, and practiced a form of §PAbsolutist Harmony§! inspired by Princess Celestia.\n\nAnd so it was for many generations: an unbroken line of kings and queens, each one designating a single heir based on which displayed the greatest wisdom and compassion. Change came gradually, usually introduced from above in small portions. Even the §Yindustrial revolution§! was brought in relatively-orderly fashion during the reign of King Skylance and his daughter §YQueen Novo§!, who has reigned for the last thirty years.\n\nOf course, Hippogriffia could not stay apart from the §Rchaos§! of the world forever. When the §CStorm King's§! armies set their sights on North Zebrica, Queen Novo began the creation of a grand army. But when it became clear they would not have enough time before the Storm King arrived, Novo, heeding the counsel of Royal Advisor §YRaft Wood§!, used the §YPearl of Transformation§! to evacuate the population of Mount Aris into Seaquestria.\n\nThe two years spent beneath the waves were hard on the hippogriff population, and caused rifts to form between those who had always been seaponies and those forced to adopt seapony ways to survive. Cut off from information about the outside world, forced to abandon their homes, many secretly called Queen Novo a §Rtyrant§! and a §Ycoward§!, abusing the §YPearl§! just as the old Priest-Kings had. The Queen's own daughter §YPrincess Skystar§! agitated to return to the surface and confront the §CStorm King§!. But it was only thanks to the intervention of the Equestrian §PElement Bearers§! that Novo finally relented, and sent the hippogriff army to attack the Storm King's forces massed at Ain Trotgourait.\n\nThe Battle of Ain Trotgourait changed the course of history. The Storm King's armies taken completely by surprise, their airships were shot down by the mighty Hippogriff airforce with the flagship downed by the famous ace pilot §3Crack Lightning§!. The §CStorm King§! himself was betrayed and slain by his own lieutenant after §YPrincess Skystar§! and the §PElement Bearers§! battled their way past his retinue. The Storm King's conquests were cut short in a single day, but Hippogriffia had changed forever. Seeing the devastation he had wrought on their neighbours while they hid, many Hippogriffs declared that they would never hide again, and began going abroad to see the larger world, bringing back foreign ideas with them. Meanwhile many seaponies see recent events as proof that Hippogriffia should avoid the barbaric wider world, lest they become §3warmongers§! too.\n\nSeeing Hippogriffia beginning to fray, Queen Novo fired §YRaft Wood§! and had the §YPearl of Transformation§! divided into millions of tiny shards, giving up the power which the monarchy had held for so long: now any Hippogriff or seapony could transform at will. She also sent her niece §PSilverstream§! to study friendship in Equestria, and set up a §Yreconstruction mandate§! and §Yrefugee zone§! in the zebra kingdom of §YZumidia§!, in order to prevent the kingdom falling into anarchy after the §Rmurder§! of their king by the §CStorm King§! and the devastation his armies brought.\n\nNow, Hippogriffia stands at a crossroads. Will they stay true to §PHarmony§!, or will they reject their monarchy in favour of §3new ideals§!? Will they become an active player on the world stage, or retreat into isolation once more?"

Caring little for boundaries set by others, they've travelled as the seasons demanded and made their living through trading, farming and herding. Their nomadic life brought them into regular conflict with their neighbours though, and they quickly developed a reputation as ferocious mercenaries and raiders.\n\nTheir history is long and winding, yet in modern times it starts in §G961§!, when a coalition of imazeeb tribes under the command of §YMekiouzza of the Ataghan tribe§! swept out of the desert and into the lands of §GTobuck§!. The mostly Maregyptian-descended pony population had long chafed under the rule of Warzena, and saw in the Imazeeb an opportunity to throw off this yoke. Yet instead of simply serving as mercenaries yet again, the Imazeeb came to remain and Tobuck became part of Zarantia, the first modern Imazeeb state.\n\nWith access to the important trading city and the fertile lands of the coast, the Imazeeb would be able to industrialise, found a modern state, rebuild their desert paths into a modern trans-zebharan railroad and for the first time, truly change. That was the plan at least, and though great strides were made during Mekiouzza's reign, it all came crashing down in §G1005§!. \n\n§CThe Storm King§!'s rampage hit the still fledgling nation hard. Tobuck fell swiftly and the Imazeeb tribes adapted by fleeing into the desert. With no other choice, Mekiouzza was left to follow them and abandon the coast.

Not wanting to be put on trial for spearheading an insurrection, the great houses that supported Her gathered their assets and resources, then fled as far as they could to avoid the long hoof of justice. Eventually, these self-imposed exiles reached foreign shores on a far southern continent, the land which would come to be known as Zebrica. Here, their inherent desire for order and discipline led the exiles to maintain their principles of obedience to the Nightmare, even in this foreign land. They maintained belief in Her return and a near constant state of military preparedness for the day that they'd be needed to return to their former homes.\n\nSince then, the §CGreat Legions§! of Chiropterra have kept up the ancient traditions. All full-blooded citizens are born into Legions, which have their own structure for military and non-military individuals. Each Legion is quite unique, and a reflection upon the hereditary history of the old founders, the ancient nobility that settled in exile. Militarily, the Legions allow any true citizen the opportunity to advance in rank, though a lot of the leadership are formed from noble lineages. Lower caste or those separated insufficiently from 'acquired' labourers who pursue a military path may find themselves in the Auxiliary forces, perhaps treated with disdain by their commanding officers, but still given a chance to prove themselves in battle. Those seeking a more righteous path may find solace in the Moonspeakers, those adherents who whisper kind words and minister to the faithful. The exact devotion to the faith is something permitted to each individual - at least, full citizens - discretion.

They founded a city there and named it Zamivgazal, literally meaning "confluence of the gods", and the rest was history. At least, that's what the priests say. Most likely, Warzena was founded by a group of Zonicians that moved into the region nearly 2200 years ago, and spread out across the Menuch river valley. As the kingdom grew, it remained mostly politically insular. Its markets, however, were wide open, and the kingdom thrived as trade between the Zonician coast and the Neighle flowed through it, creating great prosperity. It was during this period of good fortune that the §6First Temple§!, a great structure dedicated to the worship of the gods, was constructed. After §FMaregypt§! collapsed in the early 1st century ALB, Warzena occupied the Maregyptian settlements in §7Tobuck§!, offering them protection in exchange for loyalty. Over the following centuries, Warzena remained in its splendid isolation, even as empires rose and fell around it.\n\nHowever, isolation could not save Warzena from the armies of the §gQuaggatai§!, which conquered the kingdom along with the rest of Zonicia, and destroyed the ancient First Temple. Eventually, the Quaggatai were overthrown, and Warzena's independence was restored in the Treaty of Colthoba in 836. But Warzena soon found itself in a new world. The trade route that was the lifeblood of the nation had disappeared following the invention of new, sturdier vessels that could traverse longer distances through deeper water. Coupled with the costs of building the grandiose and opulent §8Second Temple§!, the economy began to decline. This caused unrest, particularly in the southern provinces, as its pony inhabitants had grown more and more irritated with their zebra masters. Although Queen Mithonzanit III attempted to alleviate the situation with reform programs and new taxes, it was all in vain. Eventually, the §OImazeeb§!, infuriated by Warzenan taxes on their imports, invaded Tobuck, where they were received with open hooves. The situation only continued to deteriorate as a succession of incompetent rulers caused anti-monarchist sentiment to grow.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, however, there was a brief glimpse of hope. The new king, §GZamaliahon XVI§!, was a young and zealous reformer, who launched numerous programs in an attempt to revitalize the nation. But this was not to last. In 1005, the §CStorm King§! invaded, and the nation's meager defenses crumbled like dust before his vast armada. The Second Temple was looted and the rest was burned to ash, while Zamaliahon himself was killed during a raid on the Royal Palace. His brother, Barekzamal, managed to escape in time, and was made king in absentia. However, he held no real power while the Storm King's forces occupied the kingdom. Fortunately, the conqueror was slain only a few months later and Warzena was free once again.\n\nBut this freedom had come at a §tmonumental cost§!.\n\n§rBarekzamal VII§!, as he was now known, was never intended for the throne, and his inexperience became evident very quickly. He had inherited a broken kingdom, with an economy in tatters, and public morale at an all time low. Zamivgazal lay in ruins, with yet another Temple having been reduced to ash and dust. Although he attempted to initiate reforms with the help of his late brother's advisors, his overreliance on them made him look even more green as the situation continued to spiral out of his control. It was only with the timely arrival of §DHippogriffian§! aid that the country was able to begin taking steps towards recovery.\n\nToday the king presides over an uneasy peace. Although the hippogriffs have continued to provide assistance, their increased presence has served to incense discontent among more isolationist elements.

All the while, threats are mounting on Warzena's borders. The southern coast is now ruled by the §9Republic of Tobuck§!, a front for arms smugglers looking to make a quick bit, while the brooding §2Chiropterrans§! to the west have grown more restless and aggressive.

The conflict became a stalemate, with Manedalusia divided between the two Kingdoms. In addition, modernization was only possible with generous support by the §PKingdom of Wingbardy§!, which was given the island of §YPurrsia§! as a concession.

But that is not the only thing that seems so strange."

 TBK_AF_abyssinia_conquest_desc: "The region of Abyssinia is no stranger to struggle. Yet, it is one that once knew prosperity and greatness.

 TBK_AF_organised_priesthood_desc: "Despite the continued teaching provided to them, the priesthood of the Jadd remains informal.

 TBK_AF_event_start.1.d: "Throughout the ages, the world has seen many strange or otherwise unique creatures appear and disappear. These innumerable mysteries often draw gazes when they appear, although as the world becomes smaller with technological advancements, their uniqueness often fades into obscurity.\n\nHowever, on some occasions, these oddities prove to be more than just a passing glance. Sometimes, they attract more than just a little bit of attention. Sometimes, they can change the course of history.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, a tall, bipedal creature unlike any the world has seen before has emerged in the desert not too far from the city of Tobuck."

Sometimes, they attract more than just a little bit of attention. Sometimes, they can change the course of history.\n\n---\n\nPea Shooter was the sort of pony who planned for everything. His one and only goal was to steal as much money as possible from Tobuck's coffers before returning home, so every loose thread and potential problem needed to be accounted for. However, a new issue has made its way to his desk: a report of a tall, bipedal creature unlike any the world has seen before emerging in the desert near the city of Tobuck."

 TBK_AF_event_start.2.t: "A Very Small Problem" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.2.d: "Princess Celestia was missing.\n\nOrdinarily, this would be a cause for mass panic and chaos. The ruler of Equestria was a very important individual, after all. Fortunately for everypony, Princess Luna was the first to notice her sister's absence. She had searched high and low, even the most obscure nooks and crannies of Canterlot Castle, but to no avail. Worryingly, she sensed that Celestia's hold on the sun had vanished with her.\n\nLuna's sister was inexplicably gone, and she had no idea what had befallen her.\n\nThe younger alicorn returned to her room and stared at her distraught face in the mirror. She didn't have much time now. She needed to do something before the ponies noticed. Something drastic. Who knows what kind of pandemonium would occur throughout Equestria if her little ponies discovered Princess Celestia was gone?! Not to mention the numerous other issues that Equestria was facing...\n\nShe glanced at her makeup next to her mirror. Something drastic indeed.\n\n---\n\nCuriously and in no relation at all to what had just happened, a mysterious bipedal creature has appeared in the desert near Tobuck."
 TBK_AF_event_start.2.a: "Perhaps that strange creature might yield answers to what has happened."
 TBK_AF_event_start.2.b: "There are currently more pressing matters to worry about."

 TBK_AF_event_start.3.t: "The Herald's Arrival" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.d: "It had been some time since Jaddar Jexiszuir had awoken from his battle with Zokka, Devourer of Suns. The fearsome gnoll had gathered a formidable force, but he did not have the light of Surael on his side.\n\nJaddar looked around as his horse reached the crest of the dunes he had found himself in. This desert was a juxtaposition of comforting and unnerving; it was definitely not his homeland of East Salahad. He focused on the last thing he remembered before awakening in this strange land: The mighty desert elves of his Jaddari Legion had clashed with the terrible gnolls of Zokka in the War for the Eastern Sands. The battle was fierce, but in time, Zokka's forces began to overwhelm those of Jaddar. As Jaddar lay dying before the gnoll, his thoughts drifted to his family. He whispered a prayer for their safety, for if the Malevolent Dark was victorious, then they along with all the world would suffer. Suddenly a brilliant, almost divine light appeared in the sky, blinding him and silencing the battle in its entirety. And then...\n\nJaddar supposed that the light must have been an intervention by Surael. How else was he to explain his mysterious transportation to this foreign land? His forces, the Desert Legion of Jaddari, were nowhere to be seen, but neither were the gnolls of Zokka. Not to mention, ever since he had awoken, he felt... different, he supposed. He placed his hand on his chest and took a deep breath. He could feel something had changed within him, but as for what, he did not know. That feeling could be investigated later - now, he needed to find food and water. He had not lived for over two hundred years in the desert just to die to it.\n\nJust as Jaddar tugged at the reigns of his horse toward the setting sun, he noticed something in the distance in the opposite direction. He had to squint, but he saw a small group of zebras walking through the desert, just as he was. He observed them for a short while, only to become even more perplexed as the animals appeared to be clad in cloth wrappings like those a desert elf would wear, as well as... wait... "Are those zebras... talking to each other?" Jaddar wondered aloud.\n\n"It seems like they are," his horse concurred."

 TBK_AF_event_start.4.d: ""I can walk, Jahorše, I insist."\n\n"And I insist that I carry you, Jaddar. Your weight is negligible to me, and I am more than happy to aid you however I can."\n\nIn truth, Jaddar was starting to get a bit tired from walking so much, but he did not want to treat another sapient being as a slave. "I am not comfortable treating you like a common animal, Jahorše."\n\nJahorše raised an eyebrow at the elf. "I have served you all my life, Jaddar. I have no intention to stop now." He trotted forward and turned around to face Jaddar. "I do not know what mystical power transported us here, but it brought me a greater understanding of myself and the world around me. Before, I merely enjoyed your voice and your praise. Now, I see you as my closest friend." Jahorše spun himself and gestured toward his saddle. "Let me help you, as friends do."\n\n---\n\nIn time, the two spotted a settlement in the distance. Relief washed over both of them, as their meager supplies had dried up earlier that day. The speed at which they rode increased in excitement to reach civilization, but as they got closer, they noticed something concerning: screaming. They picked up the pace and saw many other equine figures running around as a strange worm-like creature with tentacles erupting from its mouth chased after them. The villagers seemed ill-equipped to defeat the monster, as it had a few blades and sharp instruments protruding from its scaled exterior.\n\nA monstrous roar, a cloud of dust left in its wake... it seemed like something from the Masnsih's old legends about the Sand Demon, only this beast was much, much smaller than the gargantuan dragon Jaddar knew of. Still, this thing was trying to kill the innocent, and Jaddar had not been made Surael's herald to sit idle in His mission.\n\nDespite exchanging no words, Jahorše seemed to know what must be done. "How shall we approach this, Jaddar?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.a: ""It is too formidable to defeat. We shall aid the villagers in their escape.""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.b: ""If blades can pierce it, then so can my arrows. We shall fight it and drive it away.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.5.t: "Saviour" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.5.d: "Today was not Light Bringer's day. Of course a tatzlwurm would attack her friend's village while she was visiting. Of course it would be a tiny one, making it far more agile than its full grown counterparts. Of course Light was the only unicorn in the area at the time. And of course she had left her gun at home.\n\nIt was all Light could do to hold the tatzlwurm's attention. She had barely dodged its tentacles thrice in quick succession, and her muscles were screaming in agony, letting her know that a fourth dodge attempt might be her last. She desperately fired meager magic bolts at the beast, but to no avail.\n\nShe really wished she was still in Tobuck.\n\nJust as the tatzlwurm was about to reach her again, she was roughly scooped up off of the ground and pulled away. In a daze, she looked to see what had grabbed her: some sort of... minotaur-thing with an arched nose and pointed ears? It wasn't quite the same, but it was seated on the back of a large, muscular horse. The unusual being glanced at her, then spoke with an exotic, yet commanding accent. "Are you okay?" She merely nodded, still shocked by the sudden appearance of her mysterious saviour.\n\nThe bipedal stranger set her down some distance away from the tatzlwurm. "Help gather the others. I shall lead the creature away." Definitely a male voice, Light noted.\n\nJust as quickly as he finished speaking, her new friend sped away on the back of his horse. Light had heard tell of abyssinian slave owners who rode ponies like that, but... this seemed different. These two were companions, she could tell.\n\nLight shook her head and gathered herself. Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the mysterious pair ran circles around the tatzlwurm. Eventually, it seemed to grow either tired or bored, for it gave up its pursuit and returned to the desert."

He was using a bow, of all things, instead of a gun or magic! Light suddenly felt inadequate, as the archer was so skilled that he drove several arrows into the cracks between the scales in quick succession. The tatzlwurm roared loudly in pain, dove back into the sand, then retreated from the pair that had injured it."

 TBK_AF_event_start.7.t: "The Miracle" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.d: "Somehow, despite the damage caused to the village, there were no fatalities. The local ponies and zebras began its reconstruction in earnest while Jaddar briefly rested against the side of a sandstone wall. Jahorše laid near him and was curiously staring at the smaller equines. Jaddar took a sip from his waterskin and contemplated today's events. Many strange things had happened, and he was still unsure of Surael's purpose in sending him here, or how he could best continue the fight against the Darkness.\n\n"I don't know what to make of this place and its people."\n\nJaddar's idle thoughts were halted by Jahorše's comment. Only now did he see just how fascinated Jahorše was by the villagers - not only were they sapient equines like him, but they had presumably lived their whole lives with full awareness of who they were. He reached over and rested his hand atop Jahorše's mane. "I see people unlike any I have seen before, and I see them living lives not entirely unfamiliar. I think, wherever we are, we will find friends. And perhaps with friends we can continue Surael's great work."\n\nThe two sat in comforting silence for some time before they heard a sharp cry from a ruined structure. Jaddar stood up to get a better look and then saw some villagers helping a zebra foal with a nasty gash on her torso. He reached into his pouch and verified he still had some medicinal herbs, then approached the injured zebra.\n\nThe villagers tentatively let Jaddar approach the foal, who proceeded to examine the gash. However, just as he touched the foal, he felt a strange power emanating from himself, the same as he had sensed earlier. It flowed from his hand into the foal, whose wound closed before his very eyes. Jaddar stared wide-eyed and examined his hand. Had he just used magic? And healing magic at that? He was no mage, and even then, that kind of magic was supposed to be impossible. There was no doubt in his mind now - Surael had sent him here and blessed him with great power to save this realm from the Malevolent Dark. "It's a miracle..." The villagers whispered as they crowded around him. The foal stood and bowed, thanking him for using his divine power to heal her.\n\nJaddar reached his hand out and lifted the foal's face back up to meet her eyes. "I am no god." He stood and looked at the crowd, who were still stunned by his healing abilities. "I am simply a messenger of Surael."\n\nAfter a brief moment, Light Bringer spoke up. "Who is Surael?"\n\nJaddar felt pride as he began to teach a new flock. "He is the God of the Sun. He is our defender against the Malevolent Dark. He has granted me the power to spread his message to all, for all can be a part of the Light of Surael...""
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.a: "The villagers sat transfixed as Jaddar preached to them."

 TBK_AF_event_start.8.t: "With Friends Like These" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.d: "Wallnut Drive had many friends. His drinking buddies, his military buddies, even Alesia and Baragzen weren't that bad... most of the time. However, one thing that all of his friends had in common was that they were equine, like him. Not that being a pony or zebra was a bad thing, but lately, Wallnut had been on the lookout for more exotic individuals to add to his circle of pals. That meant when one of his subordinates informed him of a "tall weirdo" performing miracles in a nearby village, he knew what to do: gather a small entourage and set off to meet this exotic fellow.\n\nUpon Wallnut's arrival in the village, the first thing he noticed was the crowd. Comprised mostly of zebras, it was hard to tell exactly how many were present, but the one they were gathered around was impossible to miss: a tall, bipedal creature who spoke with a commanding voice. He heard some phrases like "Sun god" and "Light", which meant he was likely the religious sort. No biggie, Wallnut thought, as long as he didn't worship Nightmare Moon!\n\nThe tall being spotted Wallnut's group and stopped his sermon. "Greetings," he said loudly, causing the crowd to turn their heads to Wallnut, "Have you come to hear the truth of Surael's Light and our mission to aid him in his war against the Malevolent Dark?"\n\nIt was then that Wallnut noticed another individual standing beside the creature: a very, very large horse. Much larger than any he'd seen before, and he'd met a saddle arabian! The horse was clad in barding and armor unlike any Wallnut had ever seen, with... was that a saddle on his back? Wallnut shook his head before he got further lost in tangential thoughts. "War against the dark? Buddy, I've been fightin' the darkness for years now," Wallnut laughed. "Can I ask your name?"\n\n"I am Jaddar Jexiszuir, the chosen Herald of Surael, the Sun God." Jaddar then gestured to his horse, "And this is my faithful companion, Jahorše, sixty-fourth of his name."\n\nWallnut began to approach the pair. He noticed Jahorše lock eyes with him, so he smiled and waved a hoof. After a moment, Jahorše waved back, though he did so with a strange stiffness in his gesture, like he was unused to moving his hoof like that. Hmm. Wallnut turned his gaze back to Jaddar. "Cool. So, Jaddar. Can I call ya Jadd? I know some real nasty folks who practically worship the darkness. They've been causin' me and a whole lotta other innocent people trouble. Wanna help me take 'em down?"\n\n"If what you say is true, then I shall gladly march with you. I can see by how your soldiers look at you that you are a respected military commander. May I have your name as well?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.a: "He reached a hoof out. "The name's Wallnut Drive. Always a pleasure to make new friends.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.9.t: "The Gun Runner's Unease" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.9.d: "Pea Shooter sat in his office, absorbing the information on his desk. There were an ever-increasing number of reports of a new god appearing in the desert, though some conflicting accounts described the being as a prophet or a messenger instead. To Pea, the difference mattered little. He needed to keep this nuisance in check, otherwise, a rampantly growing religious fervor might spell an early end to his operations.\n\nHe examined a blurry photo of the creature in question. It looked almost like a minotaur, though instead of horns, it had pointed ears. Despite it being relatively mundane in appearance, Pea felt uneasy looking at the thing. He scoffed, then threw it in the trash. No matter. Wallnut may be missing, but the other warlords were still around and easily coercible. He'd send Alesia and Baragzen to take care of the creature, then he could return to business as usual.\n\nAlthough...\n\nPea glanced at the reports again. Nearly every settlement that this creature visited ended up joining its movement. If, no, when it arrived at Tobuck, there was a strong chance that...\n\nHe picked up his phone. He needed to offload as much money as possible into offshore accounts just in case his tenure in Tobuck was suddenly cut short by a zealot taking over the city. There was no doubt in his mind: Any sort of religious fellow would not look kindly upon the innumerable shady dealings he had taken to establish his money laundering scheme."

 TBK_AF_event_start.10.t: "With Even More Friends Like These" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.d: ""Tell me, Wallnut," Jaddar asked as he and his growing following were heading to another nearby settlement, "This 'Chiropterra', they serve a god of darkness and nightmares, correct?"\n\n"Nightmare Moon, yep! Let me tell you: every rumor you hear about them is true. In fact, I used to live there! But I never liked 'em, so I ditched 'em and made their army look like buffoons! They sure like holding grudges, though, so now they want me and all my friends dead."\n\n"Then they shall serve as our first test," Jaddar stated with no doubt in his mind about the outcome of this inevitable conflict. He glanced behind him. Surael's blessing had gifted him with a new flock, and he had no intention of squandering this opportunity. He would unite this land and prepare them to face the Malevolent Dark, and after that... his thoughts drifted to his wife and daughter. If this place truly was another world, then he needed to find a way to return to them.\n\nWallnut's voice pierced his idle musing. "Hey, I see a group up ahead." Both of them squinted their eyes as they saw an equally sized group to theirs approaching them in the distance. After a moment, Wallnut perked up and grinned, "Oh hey, it's my buds!" He jumped up and waved in the air. "Alesia! Baragzen! Over here!"\n\nSoon, the two gatherings converged. There was some brief unease as Jaddar observed the opposing group moving like a military force. His unease turned to confusion as he could not spot their weapons. They had no swords, no archers, just long sticks with the occasional short blade attached at the end. Furthermore, their strange, boxy carriages seemed to be pulling themselves. As he was processing that, Wallnut wasted no time hopping over to speak to them. They were mostly zebras and "ponies," as Wallnut had informed him earlier. Apparently, "horses" were a distinctly different race. He would have to find one to compare to Jahorše later.\n\nThe two individuals that Wallnut was speaking to kept stealing curious glances at him. After a few minutes, all three of them turned to approach Jaddar. Wallnut put a hoof behind his head, "So uh, Alesia and Baragzen were sent here to, uh, kill you. But! They think Pea Shooter—that's our boss—is lying to them about you being a threat. I said that you're gonna help me put a stop to all the bad things happening around here, and they, uh, want some proof that you're actually a nice guy and capable and all that. Mind helping me out here?"\n\nJaddar nodded as he descended from Jahorše. His friend needed his help, and so he convinced them..."

 TBK_AF_event_start.11.t: "United In Purpose" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.11.d: "Truthfully, Light Bringer did not imagine herself becoming a motivational speaker and impromptu second-in-command for a religious movement. She was more the sort to rile up others about lousy fiction, but she supposed that appealing to the emotions and desires of her fans could be easily translated to what she now found herself doing. Which in this case was settling an argument between a civilian and one of Baragzen's mercenaries.\n\nThe two had been at it for some time, with the civilian claiming that Jaddar would finally save their homeland from corruption, while the mercenary insisted that Jaddar was merely assisting Baragzen in becoming lord over his rightful domain. Light Bringer soon settled this debacle by explaining that the two goals weren't mutually exclusive from one another. After all, Jaddar had said that there was a place for all under the Light of Surael. Though Light Bringer did have to clarify that she was not the Light of Surael, as some have misconstrued from her name.\n\nLight Bringer turned her gaze forward, looking past the marching columns of followers that had accumulated so quickly in such a short time. Leading them was, of course, Jaddar, who stared into the distant city of Tobuck with determination. Their next mission was to free that city from the false promises made by its fake president. Spirits were high, and all present could tell that once they secured the capital of this republic, great changes would occur in Tobuck, and perhaps Zebrica as a whole."
 TBK_AF_event_start.11.a: "And yet, what would those changes be?"
 
 TBK_AF_event_start.12.t: "The President's Due" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.12.d: "The seizure of Tobuck turned out to be anti-climactic. Jaddar's forces were prepared to fight, yet little resistance was given to them. In fact, the city's residents seemed almost glad to see them. The capitol was the only place that had guards willing to fight, but in a masterful display of negotiations, Jaddar convinced them to surrender rather than give up their lives for a president who did not value theirs.\n\nSaid president was missing from the capitol, however. Jaddar was about to organize a manhunt, but then inadvertently stumbled upon the stallion attempting to slip by his forces with a hooded cloak. Said stallion was quickly apprehended and stripped of his disguise.\n\n"I assure you, I was not trying to run," Pea Shooter lied through his teeth, "I often discreetly visit the marketplace to gauge how the common pony is handling my economic changes."\n\nJaddar dismounted from Jahorše, then knelt before the increasingly nervous-looking president. "Pea Shooter. You are a talented leader, in a sense. You know how to get others to do your bidding. You know just what to say and what to do to obtain the outcome you want." Jaddar paused, then looked at his surroundings. All who had accompanied him seemed eager to see what he would do to one who had attempted to have him killed. "And yet you show dishonesty before me. Before Surael. Why?"\n\nPea Shooter forced his best presidential smile and doubled down. "I have never been dishonest with anyone. I have always had the best interests of Tobuck and her citizens in my heart."\n\nJaddar was disappointed. This kind of creature was often incapable of banishing the Darkness from their heart. Normally, he would issue his standard ultimatum of "join or be banished" to such a creature, but the time he had spent with his new friends had given him another idea. He reached his hand forward and rested it atop Pea's shoulder. "Then you shall practice what you preach. You shall serve as my statesman and manage the ongoings of my empire while I spread the Light of Surael throughout this realm. I entrust this sacred task to you, and you shall be guarded to ensure your safety, as I suspect many will act against us."\n\nA brief expression of horror dawned on Pea Shooter's face as he realized he wouldn't be returning home to his wife and kids anytime soon. Jaddar paid this no mind and stood up to the cheers of his flock. This was a momentous accomplishment, but more trials yet remained."

 ### Main tree events

 TBK_AF_event_general.1.t: "The Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.1.d: "It had been some time since Pea Shooter was put on what was essentially house arrest. Jaddar's followers didn't call it that, but Pea knew that his new job for this theocratic state had an unwritten stipulation of him not being allowed to leave. The numerous guards present around his estate were proof enough of that.\n\nHowever, Pea was a crafty stallion. His sweet Mayflower was waiting for him at home, and though he'd secured barely enough funds in offshore accounts to pay off his family's debt, he knew that the money was useless unless he was back in Equestria to withdraw it.\n\nThus, Pea found himself waiting on the balcony of his residence in the dead of night for his ticket out of here. He'd managed to scrape together enough money to bribe the delivery pony of a local hayburger joint to make a detour to his house, so with any luck...\n\nPea's eyes darted as he saw movement in the alleyway below. There! A pony pulling a hay cart! He patiently waited until the cart was just underneath the balcony, then dropped down into the moving pile of hay. Pea winced as he hit the pile. It wasn't the softest landing ever, but step one was complete. Now all he needed to do was make his way to the port, and-\n\n"Mr. Shooter! Are you okay?" a loud voice called from nearby.\n\nHorseapples. Pea turned to see one of his guards running towards him. He mentally kicked himself. He knew the plan was a long shot, but he should have realized that the cart was the only interesting thing to look at. Of course the guards would be watching it.\n\nThe guard reached Pea and then helped him down from the cart. "You shouldn't lean over your balcony like that, Mr. Shooter! It's dangerous! You're very lucky that this hay cart was here to catch your fall!"\n\nPea forced a smile. "Yes. My mistake.""

 TBK_AF_event_general.2.t: "The Second Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.2.d: ""Where is it..." Pea Shooter muttered to himself as his guards escorted him to his workplace. Over the past few months during his trips to and from work, he had spotted a crevice between two buildings that looked like a promising avenue to get away from his entourage. He had spent an inordinate amount of time memorizing the layout of the streets beyond the crevice to maximize the distance he could put between himself and his guards once they realized he was missing.\n\nFortunately, the guards did not see his earlier leap from the balcony as an escape attempt, or they would be paying closer attention to him. Additionally, Pea had built a rapport with some of them, which meant he had convinced them to allow him to walk to work rather than ride in the back seat of the former presidential car. A "breath of fresh air is good for the body", as he had put it.\n\nThrough the streets, they walked, with a few civilians casting curious glances at the armed escort surrounding the lanky earth pony. Pea's eyes locked on an upcoming bar adorned with a red logo. There! The crevice was fast approaching. He withdrew a glass bottle from his coat in preparation. Once he was next to the crevice, he dropped the bottle and kicked it to his left. It shattered on the pavement of the road, and as the heads of his guards turned to look, he darted to the right into the crevice.\n\nAlthough he knew better than to look back, he couldn't resist the idea of seeing the look of confusion on his guards' faces once they realized that- "Ow!" yelped a voice as Pea tumbled into a young foal.\n\n"What was that?" said a guard. Pea Shooter's eyes went wide as he looked ahead past the foal who was blocking his way; there simply wasn't enough time to shove past them and escape before the guards-\n\n"Um, sir? I'm lost, can you help me find my mom?" asked the foal. Pea gritted his teeth. He didn't have time for this!\n\n"Mr. Shooter!" One guard peered into the crevice and saw Pea reaching for the foal. The guard beckoned his fellows to join him, then followed after Pea. "How kind of you, Mr. Shooter! That foal was lost, and you went out of your way to try to help her! We shall make a detour to return her to her family!""
 TBK_AF_event_general.2.a: "Horseapples."

 TBK_AF_event_general.3.t: "The Third Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.3.d: "This attempt would be successful, Pea Shooter was sure of it. He'd meticulously double-checked every step of his plan; no corners were left unturned. He had been away from his family for far longer than he'd initially planned, and the money he had secured still rotted in an unreachable account. Who knows what sacrifices his beloved Mayflower might have needed to make to avoid their crippling debt?\n\nNow, having gone through the steps one final time, Pea put his plan into action. He started by suggesting that he and his guards have lunch at a restaurant by the dock to enjoy one another's company. They truly believed Pea was their friend, and so they agreed wholeheartedly. Pea had selected one with a bathroom tucked away from the dining area, and even timed the visit on the same day that the business was receiving a delivery from overseas.\n\nOnce they ordered their food, Pea waited until he heard the prolonged blast of a ship's horn from outside. It was the signal that the boat was about to leave, so he excused himself from the table to go to the bathroom. Once he turned the corner and was out of sight, he diverted to the employee-only area, ignoring those who told him he wasn't allowed there. Pea rushed out the kitchen's back door, then galloped as fast as he could toward the ship. He spotted a stallion waiting there, who nodded at him. Pea had already paid off this cargo vessel to grant him passage to Puerto Caballo. Once there, he would catch another boat to Equestria, then finally return home.\n\nPea got on the ship, then immediately headed to the lower deck. He allowed himself to relax next to a barrel of goods once the boat was a fair distance from the port. He sighed in relief, then looked out the porthole. To his dismay, he saw a military vessel intercepting the boat he was on. Why were they closing in on this specific ship?! Dozens of boats left and arrived at Tobuck every day! Pea got up, then looked into the barrel he was leaning against. His heart sank when he saw dozens of guns haphazardly stored inside what he believed to be food storage. He felt the boat drop anchor as the military vessel reached his. They would be boarding soon, so Pea sat back down and resigned himself to his fate.\n\n---\n\n"Mr. Shooter! How proactive of you! We had no idea this vessel was smuggling weapons, but you spotted them before anyone else!" Pea's ever-cheerful guard helped him off the ship. "We saw you sprinting onto the boat from the restaurant window, so we knew that you must have had a good reason for chasing after it! Now that we see these illegal weapons, we know why. Thank you for leading us to these smugglers, Mr. Shooter!""

 TBK_AF_event_general.4.t: "The Fourth Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.4.d: "Pea Shooter was at his wit's end. He'd tried almost everything short of outright murder - bribes, distractions, even fleeing in broad daylight, but each time he was caught and brought back to his estate. Whether it was a miracle or a cruel twist of fate that his guards didn't think he was trying to escape, he didn't know. All he did know was that his family needed him, and he needed them. His anxiety had gotten to such a severe point that when his faithful guard opened his bedroom door to let him know it was time for work, he broke down and resorted to a tactic he would have once sworn was beneath him: begging. "Listen, please. I need to go home. My wife, my children - they need their father. I've been away for too long, I don't want to miss my children growing up more than I already have!"\n\nThe guard put a hoof to her mouth in shock. "I... I had no idea, Mr. Shooter! Is your family still in Equestria?"\n\nPea didn't even care enough to question how his guard knew that. "Yes," he pleaded, "Please, I need to see my family again. Can you help me?"\n\nTo his absolute surprise, the guard offered a tender smile and nodded. "Okay, okay. I'll help. But it'll take a bit of time, all right?"\n\n---\n\nA week later, Pea's guard discreetly brought him to the port at the break of dawn. She instructed him to wait for the next boat. He thanked her again, then patiently watched the sunrise while she walked away. However, just as the boat arrived, Pea heard an all too familiar voice behind him. "Pea Shooter, you look unwell. Tell me, what is the matter?"\n\nOf course, it was Jaddar. Pea stared straight at the boat as Jaddar sat next to him. "I miss my family. I don't want them to think that I abandoned them," Pea sounded utterly defeated, "But you don't understand, do you? You would rather I serve your precious sun god than spend time with what's really important."\n\nJaddar reached a hand to put it on Pea's shoulder. "I do understand, Pea. I understand more than anyone how difficult it is to be separated from one's family." He pointed at the ship's gangway. Pea's heart leaped to his throat as he saw his wife and kids getting off the boat. "When your guard told me of your plight, I had them transported here.

 TBK_AF_event_general.7.d: ""Is this really all who are willing to listen?" Jaddar asked Light Bringer as he looked over the group of roughly twenty Chiropterran Legionaries who had agreed to hear what he had to say. "Out of the untold thousands of Chiropterran soldiers, this is everyone who is willing to accept Surael's Light?"\n\n"...Yeah. This is it." Light Bringer sighed, then pointed at one officer in particular. "That guy's important, though. Some officer, I think."\n\nJaddar turned his attention to the indicated stallion. He knelt to meet him at eye level, then offered his hand. "I am Jaddar Jexiszuir. May I have your name?"\n\nThe stallion seemed apprehensive, but placed his hoof into Jaddar's hand for an awkward shake. "Carrot Stick."\n\n"Tell me, Carrot," Jaddar placed his other hand over the stallion's hoof, "Why are so many of your soldiers afraid of accepting Surael's Light?"\n\n"They're not my soldiers. If they were, more of them would be here." Carrot stared transfixed at Jaddar's fingers. "They're afraid because they think you'll do to them the same that they want to do to the sunnies. That you'll just kill them."\n\nThat comment stirred apprehension in Jaddar. It is true that there is no place in the Light for other faiths, and he did indeed plan on purging those who refused to abandon the darkness from their hearts, but... "If I can show them that Surael will accept all creatures of all heritages so long as they at least try to repent, then would more of them join?"\n\nCarrot Stick sighed, "You'd have to be one heck of a preacher to do that, but... maybe. Most will never renounce Nightmare Moon, but... maybe some would, if given time."\n\nJaddar nodded. "Then time I shall spend with them." He shook Carrot's hoof one more time, then stood up. He was not entirely sure why he was being far more lenient with this radical culture than many hard-hearted creatures he had encountered in the past. Perhaps his new friends were rubbing off on him."

 TBK_AF_event_general.8.d: "The defeat of Chiropterra marked a great victory for the Jadd Empire. A festival was organized with the help of the Imazeeb of Zarantia, and even though their culture was very different from that of the Sun Elves, Jaddar found much to appreciate about their way of life. Their ritualistic dances were reminiscent of the Deioderan, minus the fire.\n\nAs the celebrations died down, Jaddar sat down near one of the many tents that had been set up for the occasion. He stared at the sky as he had several times since his arrival, and though he knew better, he still vainly hoped that he might recognize a constellation.\n\nJaddar reached out his hand and summoned a small orb of light. He knew that Surael had sent him here, and that He had blessed His prophet with divine power, yet there were still so many questions that Jaddar had. Why was he to spread the faith here, and not in his home? What happened to his Desert Legion after the battle against Zokka? And... Jaddar's heart faltered, if but for a moment. His wife, Jasiéne. His son, Andrellion. Each of his other children crossed his mind. Erelessa. Derya. Jareer. Ariatra. Jaddarésa was especially difficult to think about. The young harpy girl was so full of joy, but her lifespan was so short compared to his. He didn't want to miss her growing up.\n\n"Would you mind if I joined you?"\n\nJaddar was brought out of his thoughts by his ever-faithful friend, Jahorše. He patted the ground next to him. "You are always welcome at my side."\n\nJahorše shuffled into a comfortable position. "I've been wondering about what our purpose is here. I... I struggle with my thoughts, sometimes. I know that Surael is the one true god, and that we are doing His work, but still. I feel like I'm missing something."\n\nJaddar placed a reassuring hand on his friend's mane. He had seen many creatures have these same doubts, and hearing them from Jahorše made him realize just what he needed to accomplish in this world. "Surael has given you something very special, and I think what you need is to find someone to share that with." He offered a small grin to his companion, "I've seen some of the ways these ponies look at you. Go out and talk to some. Maybe you'll find a second guiding light."\n\n"What, me? I..." Jahorše was positively flustered, "...I don't know the first thing about courting, but... if you insist, I'll give it a try." He stood back up to hide his nervousness and change the topic. "But what about us? What does Surael want us to do here?""

 TBK_AF_event_general.18.d: "Jahorše had been pacing next to the front door of a nice-looking house for over ten minutes now. He'd practiced the things he planned to say over and over through his mind, but each time he thought he had a good plan, he ended up deciding to change a word here or a phrase there, necessitating practicing it all from the top once again.\n\nTo make matters more awkward, he had no idea what he was doing. He was an adult, but his memories before his arrival here with Jaddar were... basic, to say the least. He just didn't have any useful experiences to draw upon to help him with what he wanted to do today. Which in this case was asking the only mare he knew out on a date.\n\nMaybe I should just go home, Jahorše thought. That way, I won't embarrass myself.\n\nAnother minute passed, another round of nervous pacing. Jahorše sighed, then resigned himself to try some other time. However, just as he turned to leave, he heard the door open, revealing a concerned-looking Alesia Snezhnaya in a bathrobe. "Are you all right? Your hoofsteps are loud enough to wake the dead."\n\nJahorše became acutely aware of how much larger he was than her. "Yes," he said flatly.\n\nAlesia raised an eyebrow. "Then what are you doing here?"\n\n"Well, you see, I..." Jahorše started, then all of the things he had planned to say slipped away. He bit his tongue and decided to be blunt. "...Do you want to go out on a date?"\n\nThat seemed to catch her off guard. "What?"\n\nHe repeated himself in an equally blunt manner. "A date. Like, dinner, or something? I don't know. I've never done this before."\n\nAfter a brief pause, Alesia's expression softened. "I'm afraid I'm not looking for somepony right now," she chuckled, "I don't know if I ever will be. Besides, I'm old enough to be your mother."\n\nJahorše's face dropped. "Oh."\n\n"Don't take it personally, I have... baggage - shall we say - that you neither you nor I are capable of dealing with." She reached up a hoof out to lift his chin and just barely met it, "You're handsome, I grant. There are many nice mares your age that you can talk to. Why don't you ask Rose Rain? After all the chaos in her beloved city, I'm sure she would love a calm dinner with someone who wants to listen and learn.""

Nevertheless, he managed to track down Rose's address, so next, of course, was...\n\n"I really should have asked Alesia more about her," Jahorše muttered as he walked up the steps to the house he believed was Rose's.\n\nTo his surprise, the door opened before he even reached it. "You must be Jahorše," said the rather pretty pink mare leaning against her door frame.\n\n"Yes," Jahorše summoned what courage he could and put on his friendliest smile, "Do you want to go out to dinner?"\n\nThe mare chuckled. "At least ask me my name first, silly."\n\nJahorše mentally kicked himself, then tried not to stumble over his words. "Yes. My bad. What's your name? And do you want to go out?"\n\nHer chuckle spilled into a fit of giggles, "Rose Rain. My friends told me you were awkward in person, but wow, this is something else." She walked out the door and shut it behind her. "They also told me you were asking around for me specifically because you wanted to go on a date. Normally, I'd tell a random stallion to stuff his face and get lost, but I've heard lots of great things about you, and seeing you here, well, you're kind of endearing."\n\n"Oh. Does that mean...?"\n\nRose's smile was genuine. "Yes. I'll try a date with you. And can I just say, wow, you're much bigger than I thought you'd be."\n\n"Sorry," Jahorše shuffled in place.\n\nShe lightly punched his leg. "Hey, that's not a bad thing! Now come on, I know this great Kirian joint nearby. Run by an actual kirin, too!"\n\nJahorše followed after her, not sure what he was getting himself into, but excited nonetheless."

 TBK_AF_event_general.20.d: "While Jahorše had proven to be an invaluable tactician for the cause, he was a novice regarding the various cultures of Jaddar's growing empire. Yes, they all served under Surael's Light, but the faith still respected the ways of its members, provided those ways did not clash with the tenets of the Jadd.\n\nOne culture in particular had piqued Jahorše's curiosity: the Imazeeb of Zarantia. Jaddar had mentioned that the desert zebras were similar in some ways to the sun elves, so Jahorše had decided to learn more about them to broaden his horizons. To that end, he found himself conversing with an elderly zebra matriarch named Mekiouzza in the depths of the Imazeeb's homeland.\n\n"So your daughter, Umalez, was it? She was the pretty mare that waved to me outside, right?"\n\nMekiouzza eyed him up and down, then waved her cane toward the tent's entrance. "Yes. She can teach you the ways of the Imazeeb far better than I can. You like books?"\n\nJahorše nodded, "Well, I haven't read many books, but I enjoyed the ones I did-"\n\n"That settles it. My daughter keeps her head stuck in too many books for my liking. Maybe with you around, she will finally find something more interesting to pay attention to."\n\nThe taller stallion tilted his head in confusion, "Uh, okay? I just want to learn more about her cultu-"\n\nMekiouzza jabbed her cane into Jahorše's chest and spoke with fiery conviction in her eyes. "Quiet! You will talk to my daughter. You will show her the same kindness and courtesy you have shown me. You will make her happy, and if you break her heart, then I will break every limb in your body and have you buried up to the head in the desert for the Ijirmed to find. Is that clear?"\n\nThe elderly zebra's ferocity struck fear into Jahorše. "Um. Yes ma'am. That's clear. What's an Ijirmed?"\n\n"The tatzlwurms, you dolt! You would know that if you had spoken with her!" Mekiouzza shooed him toward the exit, "Now go! I expect her to tell me about your first date tonight. Make sure I am not disappointed."\n\nJahorše shuffled toward the tent entrance, and then the reality of what he had just agreed to began to settle in.

And boy, was Jahorše struggling there. He had started to date both Rose Rain and Umalez. He didn't think he was a bad guy, but... they were both just so nice! He didn't want to make either of them sad! So he kept kicking down the can of breaking up with one of them.\n\nNow he stared at a shot glass the bartender had given him out of pity. He knew what alcohol was, but had never-\n\n"Hey, hot stuff. You look troubled."\n\nJahorše whipped his head to the side to see a disheveled-looking zebra mare holding a bottle of whiskey. She seemed half-awake. Jahorše blinked, not sure how to respond to that. "Well... yes. I have a lot on my mind right now."\n\nThe zebra took a swig of her bottle. "Sounds to me like you're- *hic* -like you need a drink. Here," she offered her whiskey to him.\n\nAfter some hesitation, Jahorše accepted the bottle and sipped from it. "Thanks, I guess." His face contorted as he processed the taste. It was simultaneously repulsive and calming. "My name's Jahorše, by the way."\n\n"Zari- *hic* -shat," She produced another bottle of whiskey. From where, Jahorše didn't know. "This stuff can fix any- *hic* -anything," She raised it for a toast, "To forgetting our troubles!"\n\n---\n\nOver the rest of the day, Jahorše became more and more familiar with alcohol and its effects on the mind. However, it wasn't until he was awoken by an even more disheveled-looking Zarishat in a sleazy-looking hotel room the next morning that he realized just what he had gotten himself into.\n\nZarishat hugged him and planted a kiss on his cheek." Thanks for agreeing to let me move in with you, hot stuff. I've wanted to get away from Colthage for a long time.""

He was now committed to three separate relationships with three attractive mares, and he really, really wished that he knew what to do with them. He never considered himself to be the anxious type, but right now, he needed to get some air. A lot of air. And so, Jahorše walked around one of the airfields near the port city of Winggarden in search of the aviation expert he had been recommended to give him a tour of the skies. He'd never flown before, but seeing the pegasi and thestrals zoom around made him want to experience it for himself.\n\n"Jahorše, right?" asked a slick-looking hippogriff clad in a pilot's outfit. Said hippogriff reached a claw out for a shake, "Name's Crack Lightning. Hippogriffia's premier ace and finest fighter pilot in the sky."\n\nMeeting Crack's claw with a hoof, Jahorše internally sighed in relief. At least this guy wasn't a pretty mare. "Yes. I'm here for the air tour, and I was told you're the best pilot offering one."\n\n"More than the best, actually," Crack nodded and beckoned him toward one of the many aircraft strewn about the field, "Right this way. By the way, I gotta admit - I was skeptical of you guys once you took over Mount Aris, but allowing Hippogriffia's national pride to remain intact? That I respect. So, no hard feelings."\n\nA few minutes later, Jahorše was already regretting his decision. The old biplane had shaken so hard that it felt like it was about to fall to pieces. Now it had a steady, but disconcerting rhythm to its vibrations. The sensation was so terrifying that Jahorše had a death grip on his seat, and-\n\n"You okay there?" asked Crack, who briefly turned around to look at Jahorše seated behind him. "You look like death."\n\nJahorše's eyes darted to Crack, and he nodded furiously while trying to avoid looking down. "Yes. Yes. I'm fine. Are you fine?"\n\nCrack laughed, "I'm having the time of my life, friend! Nothing beats flying like this." He leveled the plane, then turned around again. "Feel free to jump out if you're that scared of me."\n\nJahorše locked eyes with Crack, more out of fear of looking down than anything. "I'm not scared of you."\n\n"Really," Crack raised an eyebrow, then a grin formed on his face, "Then what about lunch after we're done here?""

He supposed that this day had to come eventually, though he kept trying to convince himself that he wasn't a bad guy and didn't mean to keep getting into more and more relationships.\n\nEventually, Jahorše resigned himself to his fate and opened his front door. The first thing he saw was Zarishat lounging on his couch with a bottle of... something alcoholic. She haphazardly waved at him, then pointed to the kitchen. "Others are- *hic* -are in there."\n\nWith a pit in his stomach, Jahorše slowly walked over to the kitchen. He expected the others to be standing there, waiting for him. What he did not expect was to see them... cooking? Umalez was covered in spilled flour and chocolate fudge, Rose was chopping lettuce, and Crack had a baker's apron and hat, oven mitts, and a freshly baked pie in his claws. "Ah, the stallion of the hour!" Crack exclaimed, garnering the attention of the others, "And just in time, too! Dinner is almost ready."\n\nJahorše was still frozen in fear, though he managed to force out a few words. "You're not... angry?"\n\n"Oh, we were furious, actually," Rose Rain stated matter-of-factly, "But after we got past the accusations and sat down to discuss how this happened, we came to the conclusion that this wasn't your fault."\n\n"My mother probably threatened you into dating me." Umalez looked up from her chocolate-stained cookbook. "I could tell by how unnerved you were during our first outing. However, I realize now that none of your actions says that you intended to be unfaithful to any of us."\n\nCrack nodded, then set the pie on a hot pad. "I myself was disappointed to see that you were already taken, but then Zarishat over there had an... unusual idea."\n\n"...What was it?"

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.1.t: "The Herald of the Malevolent Darkness" #podrick
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.1.d: "The march to Castonath Castle was anything but easy. The endless ranks of the dead seemed to blot out the very horizon itself, and each time one was cut down, its pieces got back up. Jaddar himself was leading the charge, utilizing his divine gifts to annihilate swaths of the undead. Thunderous artillery and roaring tanks pounded the monstrous legions as Jaddar and his finest soldiers tore through the things, and soon enough, they reached the sinister structure.\n\nJaddar rode atop Jahorše past the still-open portcullis into the castle itself, disintegrating a skeletal soldier with a ray of light as he did so. Upon reaching the interior, the two paused, as the undead seemed wary of following them inside.\n\nThe reason for their wariness became apparent as Jaddar spotted a hunched-over figure pacing back and forth while muttering to itself. He narrowed his eyes and noticed to his surprise that the rotting creature was bipedal, like him. A human, maybe? Or did it used to be one? Regardless, it reeked of undeath and evil, so he prepared to smite it in Surael's name like he had done so to countless atrocities today.\n\n"What? Who goes there?" The lone figure turned its head to face Jaddar. It was wearing a torn mantle and tattered garments that suggested royalty, and a grimy crown adorned its head. Its eyes were bloated and green, though that didn't stop it from staring accusedly at Jaddar. "You dare set foot in my kingdom? A deceitful fae and the spawn of Agrados? I thought I had already rid the world of monsters like you."\n\nIts comments gave Jaddar pause. He had imagined that the champion of the Malevolent Dark would be more... coherent. "I am Jaddar Jexiszuir, the Herald of Surael. I have come to unite all under the Light of Surael, but I see that you have turned those I wished to save into mindless ghouls."\n\nIt furrowed what was left of its brow. "You? Save them? Nonsense! I, Castan II Beastbane, have saved countless men and women of Castanor from the beastial races that plague this land. Just look over there," It pointed at a writhing mass of reanimated flesh and limbs, which caused Jahorše to gag in disgust. "Those poor children at the orphanage were about to be slain by centaurs before I rescued them!"\n\nJaddar scanned the frail-looking "Beastbane" in front of him. It was clearly deranged, but he sensed it held great power comparable to his own. He steadied himself and whispered a warning to be careful to Jahorše, then drew his bow as he noticed his opponent's hands beginning to glow."

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.2.t: "The Battle of Light and Dark" #podrick
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.2.d: "Jaddar released a flurry of arrows into Beastbane as Jahorše dodged the magical bolts it fired at them. He knew that firearms were standard now, but he was far more proficient with a bow. Three arrows hit Beastbane in the chest, staggering it, and Jaddar focused Surael's divine light in his hand to blast the undead king to oblivion.\n\nUpon being struck, Beastbane screamed in anger and raised its hands. A sickly green shield appeared around it, which deflected Jaddar's attack. Jaddar tried to prepare another magical strike, but the lich was surprisingly fast. Beastbane unleashed a torrent of necromantic rays flying in every direction that converged on Jaddar. Jahorše galloped behind a pillar in an attempt to lose the homing magical missiles, but Beastbane redirected them before they collided with it.\n\nJust before reaching the pair, Jaddar held his free hand out and summoned a magical shield of his own to deflect the blasts. Beastbane's power was far more potent than Jaddar was prepared for, and it took every ounce of his strength just to keep his shield up. It did not help that he was not well-practiced in magical duels, nor that the magic of this realm was unfamiliar to what he did know.\n\nMore and more of Beastbane's attacks pounded against Jaddar's shield, pushing him and Jahorše further and further into a corner. A few bolts slipped through and tore into Jaddar's shoulder and leg, causing him to have to strain even harder to keep the shield up. A memory flashed through his mind: Zokka was laughing at him as he crumbled from his injuries, much like how Beastbane was laughing now. He thought he would die that day, but Surael saved him.\n\nA realization clicked through his mind: Surael saved him because even in defeat, his faith never faltered. In that moment, the only thing he had prayed for was for Surael to protect his family. His faith had saved him.\n\nNow, Jaddar felt that faith again. Not from himself, but from outside the castle walls. From his soldiers fighting the undead. From the countless workers and farmers toiling away, to the millions of simple ponies, zebras, deer, and more who truly believed in Surael and His mission. Jaddar channeled that faith, and in a single decisive strike, he threw his other hand out and pierced Beastbane's shield with a beam of overwhelmingly bright light, striking the lich right in the heart.\n\nBeastbane collapsed to the ground, unmoving. Jaddar dismounted from Jahorše and limped closer to verify its death. When he was but a few paces away, the lich's eyes opened again, but instead of insane malice, they were filled with lucid regret. "Thank you..." the old king of Castanor uttered before he disintegrated to dust. Immediately after, the castle walls began to shake, its stones became dislodged, and the ceiling started to crumble. To make matters worse, Jaddar felt like he was about to pass out from his wounds."

What about-\n\nHe whipped his head around to look for Jahorše, and was relieved to see him unconscious next to a... Jaddar rubbed his eyes and saw a white, winged unicorn, far more majestic than any that had ever graced his vision. It- no, she looked familiar, somehow. "Who are you?"\n\nShe offered him a gentle, though tired smile, "I am Princess Celestia. And if my assumption is correct, you are Jaddar Jexiszuir."\n\nNow Jaddar was doubly confused. He'd heard that name from a multitude of traders who hailed from Equestria, but she still looked familiar, as if he had seen her before then. He rose from the ground and dusted himself off. "Are you a messenger of Surael?"\n\nCelestia thought on his question for a moment. "Many believe I am Surael reborn, but I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be." She approached him, then looked out toward the crumbled castle. "Whatever you did here, it was big. You used magic so powerful that it shone like a beacon across the cosmos, perhaps reality itself. I felt this energy, and with my own power, I diverted some to open a portal here."\n\nJaddar looked behind himself to see the very portal she described. It was a glowing, violent tear in reality, and beyond it, he could see what looked like... His heart skipped a beat. "Is that Azka-Sur?"\n\n"Indeed," Celestia nodded, "This portal leads to Halann, though it is unstable and will dissipate soon. It is how I got here, and if you act quickly, it is how you can return home."\n\nA million thoughts and questions raced through Jaddar's mind, eventually settling on just two: "What happened to my forces? To my family?"\n\nCelestia's expression faltered, though she did her best to hide it. Truthfully, she did not feel prepared to tell him everything that had transpired in his absence. She looked away, then said, "The empire prospers, and your son is waiting for you." Just then, the two of them heard a groan from Jahorše. Celestia shifted the topic before he could question her further."

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.4.t: "Our Last Victory" #podrick
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.4.d: "Jahorše groaned and rubbed his face with his hoof. His head was spinning, and he heard the chirping of birds... wait, where was he? He blinked, then looked around to see Jaddar, along with a large winged unicorn, no wait, an alicorn! There was an alicorn standing next to him. He'd only heard stories about the alicorns from his troops, and... Jahorše noticed that Jaddar wasn't smiling. In fact, he looked outright distraught. Jahorše got up, then asked, "Did... did we win?"\n\n"Yes." Jaddar gestured behind Jahorše. Where once there was a seemingly unending tide of undead surrounding the dark Castle Castanor, now there were ruins along with thousands of soldiers gathering themselves and heading toward the hill he stood upon. Still, it was a victory, so Jahorše ran over to hug his best friend. Jaddar returned the embrace, though Jahorše saw his smile was filled with sadness. "But it will be our last victory together."\n\nJahorše stepped back, confused and scared at what he said. "What do you mean?"\n\nJaddar glanced at the magical portal behind himself. "I must go."\n\nBy this point, soldiers were starting to arrive on the hill. Jahorše looked between them, the portal, and finally Jaddar. Realization clicked in his mind about where the portal led. "But-"\n\n"All present, listen to me!" Jaddar boomed as he addressed the growing crowd, "Today, we have won! The Malevolent Darkness has been defeated!" He raised his hand triumphantly, and his troops cheered with him. "But know this: it will return one day! For now, you must keep the faith as you have been taught, and always remain vigilant! Zebrica needs time to heal from its many wounds, but that is not the task that I was brought here for!" He took a deep breath, then announced, "It is time for me to go."\n\nThe soldiers' cheers morphed into confusion, then despair. The elf raised his hand to quell their concerns, "Surael brought me here to lead you to victory, and that victory has been achieved. I must return to my home now, but I will not leave you without someone to guide you through this new era." Jaddar turned to Jahorše, "I will entrust my deepest friend and companion, Jahorše, with this sacred task."\n\n"Please, let me go with you," whispered Jahorše.\n\n"You have a family, now. I would never take you away from that," Jaddar quietly replied. He returned his attention to his soldiers and raised his voice again, "Just as I was brought for a mission, so was Jahorše. With mine complete, his now begins.""
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.4.a: "Jaddar looked directly at Jahorše with firm resolution. "Kneel.""

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.5.t: "Farewell" #podrick
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.5.d: "With tears in his eyes, Jahorše knelt before Jaddar. The elf withdrew his blade and bow, set them on the ground, and then proclaimed, "I hereby abdicate my position as ruler of the Jadd Empire. In my stead, I appoint Jahorše as ruler and as Defender of the Faith. Jahorše was sixty-fourth of his name, but he will be the last to bear that name, as he now forges his own destiny with Surael's blessing."\n\nJaddar reached forward to hug his companion again. The two embraced, and with a trembling voice, Jahorše quietly pleaded, "But you need a horse..."\n\n"No," Jaddar whispered back as he pressed his forehead to Jahorše's, "What I need is for you to be strong. You are more than everything I could ever hope for in a friend, and I know that you will do truly wonderful things."\n\nBefore Jahorše could respond, his friend left his embrace. Jaddar looked to his gathered troops once more, and for the first time in countless years, his composure broke. "I order... I order all who believe and trust in me to put your faith into Jahorše like you did to me. You must keep the faith of Surael alive so that His Sun will shine across Zebrica for generations to come." Jaddar suddenly turned away and walked toward the portal.\n\nHowever, just before he stepped through, he turned around to look at his best friend and Surael's faithful one final time. Tears streamed down his cheeks along with nearly all who were present."
 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.5.a: "He waved goodbye, and then he was gone."

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.6.d: "Another hand of cards, and another strike of a match. Border duty was not exactly the most exciting parts of service, and yet it had to be done. The two zebras however were most certainly bored, and soon the smell of tabacco wafted into the air while two bored sighs came out of the guardhouse.\n\n"I swear, at least Equestrian's get to do something with their time," One of them whined, only for the other to scowl at him through the lantern-lit gloom. "Don't you dare complain we aren't seeing action- haven't you heard about what's going on?"The first soldier scoffed, "What, zombies, skeletons? Things that guy bump in the night?"The soldier snorted, and flicked the safety on his rifle off. "I got just the thing for that."\n\nDeeper within the darkness, there was a groan. The two looked out into the dark, and squinted their eyes to see what they could. A pair of eyes looked back at them, and their own eyes widened as it was followed by another, and another, and another. The two screamed as they took up their posions, and the crack of gunshots filled the air.Ten minutes later, there was silence but for the shuffling of hooves and the crackling sound of the radio.\n\n"... and it is the duty of every able bodied creature, pony zebra or otherwise, to come to arms. We will fight not for our lives, but for the very light of life itself. We are called to war, and should we lose it will be the last."\n\nThe words went unheard by the hoard of the undead shuffling past, and in the distance the fresh sounds of gunfire erupted in the night. Death had come, but life would not go quietly."

The ponies all scampered away in a rush, and the operator quickly threw the radio over his back as he abandoned his position with them.\n\nThe undead, of course, were not altogether intelligent. They saw the retreat as a victory, and rushed forward to pursue. Their own hooves splashed into the mud and the air was filled with the snarls and wailing of their decrepit forms charging forward.\n\nThe whine of that propeller grew louder, and then with a sharp scream the plane dove towards the treeline. The whistle of its ordnance followed, and for a moment there was quiet as the plane pulled back up and the treeline muffled the sound.\n\nA moment later there was a roar as the canisters erupted in flame, and doused the trees with fire and death. None of the ponies dared look back as the heat hit their backs, and none of them could spare the breath to scream as their fur burned and their skin bubbled. The screams of the undead were silenced, and when those ponies dove into the ditch they were thankful to only be missing one of their unit.\n\nCloser to the flames, the radio laid in the mud."

 TBK_AF_event_beastbane_war.10.d: "Basic Training was the same wherever you went. It was the art of misery honed to a spearhead with a mirror shine and razor sharpness. Performative cruelty on an industrial scale, and Drill Sergeants- by whatever name- were masters of it.\n\nYet a good Drill knew that, at the end of the day, that cruelty served a purpose: to build discipline, strength, and instill an ability to fight as a cohesive unit. That, and plenty of learning about regulation and practical skills. The cruelty, the punishments, and the 'voluntary' suffering all served that end purpose.\n\nSo it is that Master Sergeant Allal looked upon his platoon, and allowed himself a smile. It was raining- as it always tended to this close to the coast- and none in his platoon wore a jacket. They shivered, they suffered, and they bore it with straight faces. He was proud.\n\nAllal halted at the end of the group, and released a soft sigh. "You know what, Coral Bubble, light a fire, let's share some stories. Fucking rain..."\n\nSoon enough Tough Nut sat amongst his platoon, and under the flickering light of that fire they shared their stories. Each were as varied as their accents, and Tough Nut was delighted to learn entirely new insults he could use on his next training division. What he really felt however, was that shared spirit. They weren't zebras, hippogriffs, or batponies. They were soldiers of Surael.\n\nSome of them would die, but all of them would fight to bring the Light to the far reaches of Zebrica. It was that thought that reminded Tough Nut why he was here, so naturally the platoon had to carry the burned logs back with them when they departed. Charcoal, he explained, was dangerous ordnance."

While she was perfectly capable of teleportation, she did not feel a need to rush home immediately. For now, she just wanted some time to collect her thoughts.\n\nShe was most worried about her sister. Thankfully, she could sense that Luna still moved the moon, and... Celestia frowned, sensing that the sun was almost, but not quite, in its correct position. She'd have to talk to Luna about that later, though she understood how difficult it was to move a celestial body that one was not accustomed to.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to Jaddar. She'd quietly excused herself during his departure, not wanting to take away from the moment. It was truly heartbreaking to watch him say goodbye, and while she had said countless goodbyes of her own, she knew it was never easy. What she felt most terrible about was what awaited him when he returned home. Yes, she had led his empire to prosperity, but... "At least he still has his son," she whispered to comfort herself.\n\nThe stars glistened under Luna's beautiful night sky. Looking up, Celestia noticed that the constellations were still exactly as she remembered when she was torn from this world. That meant there was a disparity in the passage of time between here and Halann, since they would have moved at least a small amount, given how long she had spent uniting elves, gnolls, humans, dwarves, and who knows how many other races under the magic of friendship and harmony.\n\nStill, that world was gone, now, and the only thing she carried with her was her memories of them, like she did for all who were bound to their mortal coil.\n\nShe breathed deeply again and adjusted her direction toward home. Toward Equestria."

 TBK_AF_event_military.1.t: "Up To Speed" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_military.1.d: ""If we are to face the Malevolent Dark, then we'll need to muster every trained archer we can." Jaddar pointed at the city of Tobuck on the map in his war room. "I'm certain a city of this size has no shortage of citizens capable of swinging a blade that we can also conscript. Most importantly, we'll need to train as much cavalry as possible. Their usefulness cannot be understated."\n\nWallnut, Alesia, and Baragzen all exchanged worried glances with one another. He was joking, wasn't he? After a moment, Baragzen spoke up. "By cavalry, you mean tanks, right?"\n\nThe elf turned his head. "I am not familiar with that term. You must know how effective cavalry can be in the hands of a skilled commander, don't you?"\n\nWallnut raised a hoof. "Uh, what's cavalry?"\n\n"Surely you are jesting. Cavalry are warriors who fight on horse..." Jaddar suddenly realized the crowd he was talking to.\n\nAlesia stepped forward. "I'm a seasoned military leader, Jaddar, and I've only heard the term cavalry used to describe soldiers who arrive just in time to save the day. Whatever you are thinking of, it doesn't exist here."\n\nJaddar put a hand to his temple in abject horror. Cavalry doesn't exist? Then... how... how was he supposed to fight a war without his most beloved strategies available to him? This world was even stranger than he first realized. He took a deep breath, then sighed, "Very well. If you do not use cavalry to move quickly around the battlefield, then what do you use?"\n\nThe three generals looked at one another again. Baragzen gestured at Wallnut, who grinned and held up a pair of keys. "How about we go for a ride in my car, and you'll see for yourself?"\n\n"All right..." Jaddar hesitantly nodded, "...but first, what is a car?""
 TBK_AF_event_military.1.a: "Wallnut's grin only grew wider. "You'll see.""

 TBK_AF_event_military.2.t: "A Modern Curiosity" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_military.2.d: "One of the many things Tobuck was famous for was its former status as a weapons depot for the late Storm King. Guns of many kinds were prevalent throughout the city, and as guns were the most common tool of war nowadays...\n\n"I was told there would be weapons here, and yet I do not see any blades, nor bows."\n\nA very nervous pair of unicorns glanced at each other as Jaddar examined the firing range they were in charge of. "Well, um, Mr. Presiden- er, Mr. Herald, sir, we uh, stopped using those a long time ago."\n\n"Then what are these?" Jaddar curiously picked up a long stick with pieces of metal blended into it. He spotted a hole at the end, then put his finger inside to ascertain its depth.\n\n"NO DON'T DO THAT!" One unicorn yelled as she magically snatched the rifle away from Jaddar. She sighed in relief, then explained, "This is a Garcano-Ochzor Model 989. Breech-loaded, designed in Colthage. It's a bit old, but like all firearms, it's very dangerous if handled improperly."\n\nJaddar did not see how such a thing could be dangerous, but he nevertheless respectfully set it down. "I've never seen such a device before. Would you care to spar? I wish to learn how it works."\n\n"You can't spar with guns," the other unicorn said, "You said something about bows? Imagine if bows could shoot tiny metal pellets at such high speeds and range that almost no body armor could protect from them, that you don't need years of training or even much physical strength to use them, and that they are cheap to produce. Nobody would use bows anymore." \n\nJaddar frowned as he absorbed their words. He was a master bowman, and now he was being told that his favorite weapon was obsolete. Still, Surael's work must be done, so he needed to learn how these new weapons worked. "Very well. Would you mind teaching me about these 'guns', and how they are used in battle?""

 TBK_AF_jaddar_jexiszuir_desc: "§YBorn§!: 12 Nerament 1161\n\n§YBiography§!: Jaddar Jexiszuir claims he was born from the lineage of the great Jaher ta'Diranhriá, the Sun King. His mother, should his claim be believed, is the Burned Empress Jexis. Over the next three hundred years, he would become the sun god Surael's prophet, the leader of the Elven Desert Legion, and the elected chieftain of the nomadic Masnsih tribes. In time, he would also become the loving husband of the harpy Jasiéne, and they would bear an equally lovely daughter named Jaddarésa.\n\nAfter Surael revealed His truths atop the holy mountain Ebbusubtu, Jaddar understood his ultimate purpose in life: He must spread the fire of his faith across the continents and shatter the forces of darkness that stand in his way. At least, that is what he had planned on doing until that fateful fight against Zokka Devourer-of-Suns. The gnoll had mortally wounded the Jaddar, but before the final blow was struck, a miraculous light descended from the skies, saving him from death and transporting him to the vast land of Zebrica.\n\nJaddar is a brilliant strategist and an expert shot with his bow. He is kind, patient, and unlike many other zealots, pragmatic. Most of all, he is completely devoted to the truth of the Jadd: All creatures can be the light.\n\nThis world may be different to his own, but the truth of his faith has not changed, and neither has the lengths he is willing to go to see it brought to everyone who will listen. For just as all are called to fight the war on Halann, all will be called to fight the war here, too.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Biegeltoren (Anbennar Team)"

One unifying constant held between all of the races under the banners of Surael is a sincere belief in the good works of the Sun, of His benevolence and in the tangible miracles performed in His name. It is an observed fact that the greater number of believers in an area who share faith in Surael and His works, the more actual manifestations of wonder transpire. It has been claimed that a whispered prayer to the Light has prevented lethal harm to a believer; so too is it true that a fervent wish for crops to grow even in arid, normally extremely difficult terrain, has come to pass. As the rays of Light cause the shrinking shadow of the Malevolent Dark to diminish, hope is a constant to cling to. O Great Surael, let shine the Light of Thy joy!"

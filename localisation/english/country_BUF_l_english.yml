BUF_goat_desc:0 "Giles is not a buffalo, but a goat who has adopted the buffalo way of life. Stories are told how he was lost in the desert, wandering aimlessly without purpose in life, and was rescued by a group of buffalo. He met an old shaman who adopted him as a student and taught him everything there was to know about shamanism and the cult of the Rainbow Crow. When the shaman died, Giles succeeded him, becoming the only non-buffalo shaman in the entire Equestrian southwest. It is said Giles can see the future and even use magic after certain rituals."

### Decisions ###
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria:0 "Form the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria_desc:0 "The greatest dream of many buffalo remains the formation of a new, resurgent Buffalo Empire across the whole Southwest. While perhaps absurd, the appeal cannot be discounted.."
BUF_core_empire:0 "Restore the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_core_empire_desc:0 "Although we have retaken all our ancestral lands, things are not as they were before. Ponies live on our lands. We do not want to expel them, and instead envision a future of ponies fully integrated into the buffalo way of life. To convince the ponies of our sincerity will take time and effort, but the rewards will be immense."

### Leader & General Descs ###
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he's better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

oldbuf.2.t:0 "Ponies Refuse to Return Land"
oldbuf.2.d:0 "[NLR.GetName] laughed at the Elder's demands. We cannot ignore such a grievous insult. We did not want war, but [NLR.GetName] has forced our hoof."

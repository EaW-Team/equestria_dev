BUF_goat_desc:0 "Giles is not a buffalo, but a goat who has adopted the buffalo way of life. Stories are told how he was lost in the desert, wandering aimlessly without purpose in life, and was rescued by a group of buffalo. He met an old shaman who adopted him as a student and taught him everything there was to know about shamanism and the cult of the Rainbow Crow. When the shaman died, Giles succeeded him, becoming the only non-buffalo shaman in the entire Equestrian southwest. It is said Giles can see the future and even use magic after certain rituals."

BUF_core_empire:0 "Restore the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_core_empire_desc:0 "Although we have retaken all our ancestral lands, things are not as they were before. Ponies live on our lands. We do not want to expel them, and instead envision a future of ponies fully integrated into the buffalo way of life. To convince the ponies of our sincerity will take time and effort, but the rewards will be immense."

### Leader & General Descs ###
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he's better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

### Focuses ###
# Starting
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Tenth Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "For ten years, the buffalo have been led by Chief Thunderhooves. For ten years, the buffalo and their Chiefdom have survived, if not exactly thrived. And now, the buffalo must prepare for ten more years. But the Chief isn't getting any younger, and some don't want to wait for him to retire..."
BUF_start_reducing_poverty:0 "Grovel for Economic Aid"
BUF_start_reducing_poverty_desc:0 "While it may hurt our pride, the fact is we are a poor nation. Stalliongrad has much knowledge of modern industrial methods and rationalized economic planning. We don't want to alienate Equestria, but what harm could come of asking for aid?"
BUF_calm_the_elder:0 "Calm the Elder"
BUF_calm_the_elder_desc:0 "Elder Greyhorn is one of the fiercest buffalo alive, always reelected leader of his tribe despite his incredibly advanced age. He demands a reorientation of our political alignment and to stop cowering, but we cannot afford an Equestrian blockade or intervention. In a decade, perhaps, we can revisit this, but for now we must let cooler heads prevail."
BUF_multipolarity:0 "Buy Surplus Guns from Stalliongrad"
BUF_multipolarity_desc:0 "Stalliongrad may lack in consumer goods, but they have plenty of weapons. We can trade delicious apple pies and other traditional luxury goods we've made for modern rifles and other implements of war!"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy:0 "Beg for Scientific Help"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy_desc:0 "A buffalo who can read is a rare thing. Too many of our elders don't even understand the idea of an art of binding words to paper, and consider it dark magic. Equestria is full of clever ponies, and while some might grumble and their presence, we stand only to gain from them."
BUF_meet_with_daughter:0 "Meet with Little Strongheart"
BUF_meet_with_daughter_desc:0 "Little Strongheart, the Chief's daughter, is a long-standing pro-Equestrian. She negotiated an end to the Apple War with her friend Braeburn and the help of the Elements of Harmony. But lately, she's been distant from her father, feeling he's not enough of an Equestriophile. Maybe they can talk it out?"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee:0 "Gain an Equestrian Guarantee"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee_desc:0 "Right now, we are vulnerable. While the non-aggression pact with Equestria holds, our oceanic border is exposed and could easily be invaded by anyone. Equestria is a superpower and could protect us. We just have to make sure we aren't tied too closely to it..."
BUF_the_worst_case:0 "The Worst Case"
BUF_the_worst_case_desc:0 "Should the worst come to happen and we have to fight an enemy, or spirits forbid Equestria itself, we must be ready. While the Elder is hardly a voice of reason, he does know a lot about war. He has demanded a draft be raised and further requested a cabinet position for himself. Chief Thunderhooves has reluctantly agreed."
BUF_the_best_case:0 "The Best Case"
BUF_the_best_case_desc:0 "Hopefully, we can continue our independence and isolation, while being friendly to our neighbors. Little Strongheart has asked her father for a chance to try her hoof at politics, and he has readily agreed!"
BUF_the_middle_path:0 "The Middle Path"
BUF_the_middle_path_desc:0 "Neither the violence of Elder Greyhorn, nor the submission of Little Strongheart: this will define the buffalo for now and for the foreseeable future. We are interested in trade, cooperation, education, and cultural exchange, but no military commitments. And that is how things will stay!"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost:0 "Modernization Whatever the Cost"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost_desc:0 "Even if it means letting more Stalliongradian agitators in, we need to learn how to run a modern economy. Otherwise we'll be swept away by industrialization completely. This is the lesser evil."
BUF_steel_for_jobs:0 "Steel for Jobs"
BUF_steel_for_jobs_desc:0 "The Equestrians are eager to help us industrialize, and hopefully get some of our natural resources. While some are reluctant to part with our treasures, Thunderhooves has been persuaded by his daughter."
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Eleventh Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Out of the darkness rises a great Chiefdom, one friendly to all and foe to none. We have walked the razor edge between extremism on both sides and grown stronger for it. And now Thunderhooves can reign for a decade more!"

# Civil War 
BUF_chieftainess_little_strongheart:0 "Chieftainess Little Strongheart"
BUF_chieftainess_little_strongheart_desc:0 "Thunderhooves' young daughter, Little Strongheart, has been chosen as Chieftainess to lead the Buffalo. But there's still the Elder to consider..."
BUF_desert_bunkers:0 "Desert Forts"
BUF_desert_bunkers_desc:0 "In light of worsening relations with the so-called "Southern Corporate State", we need to fortify our borders and place bunkers throughout the desert. Only through extensive fortifications can our borders be safe!"
BUF_desert_supply_lines:0 "Desert Supply Lines"
BUF_desert_supply_lines_desc:0 "In light of worsening relations with the so-called "Southern Corporate State", we need to ensure our troops will be sufficiently fed. Only through expanding our internal supply lines, started by Strongheart's beloved father, can we be ready."
BUF_sheriff_braeburn:0 "Sheriff Braeburn"
BUF_sheriff_braeburn_desc:0 "With the recent referendum in Appleloosa and its merger with our lands, the time has come to promote Braeburn, Strongheart's close friend, to Sheriff of Appleloosa. She has absolute confidence in his abilities."
BUF_stick_with_silverstar:0 "Stick with Silverstar"
BUF_stick_with_silverstar_desc:0 "Silverstar has done a fine job as Sheriff, and there's no need to replace him. Besides, he's well trusted by the ponies!"
BUF_self_defense_from_aggression:0 "Self-Defense from Aggression"
BUF_self_defense_from_aggression_desc:0 "We are facing a superior foe in this Corporate State. With the industrial heart of the Southwest as well as more modern equipment, we'll have to fight correspondingly harder. But we've already lost so much - we will not lose more!"
BUF_exile_brigades:0 "Pony Exile Brigades"
BUF_exile_brigades_desc:0 "The Appleloosans are eager to fight for their home, and we are in dire need of reinforcements. Together, let's protect our homes!"
BUF_our_new_pony_friends:0 "Together as a Team"
BUF_our_new_pony_friends_desc:0 "With the help of Appleloosa, we are finally in a position to drag our country into the modern era. And this time, we won't be caught off-guard!"
BUF_partisan_warfare:0 "Partisan Warfare"
BUF_partisan_warfare_desc:0 "While we may not be able to fight the Corporate State head-on, we will have a much better chance by luring them into small pockets and then encircling their supply lines! Elder Greyhorn will take the lead on this project."
BUF_modernize_equipment:0 "Modernize Equipment"
BUF_modernize_equipment:0 "We can't expect to win with muskets or bronze cannons. Little Strongheart has ordered an expansive military buildup and modernization of our troops' gear."
BUF_friendship_with_rock_union:0 "Friendship with Rock Union"
BUF_friendship_with_rock_union_desc:0 "The Rock Union, our neighbor to the north, may be a communist regime. But they are certainly preferable to the Corporate State, and Las Pegasus is eying them hungrily. We should reach out for cooperation!"
 BUF_the_second_apple_war:0 "The Second Apple War"

BUF_the_old_one_returns:0 "The Old One Returns"
BUF_the_old_one_returns_desc:0 "Elder Greyhorn, the oldest and wisest of us all, has won the confidence of the emergency Convocation of Chiefs. A new era is upon the buffalo people, an era of victory won and honor restored!"
BUF_a_new_foreign_policy:0 "A New Foreign Policy"
BUF_a_new_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Under Thunderhooves, we tried to balance the many powers seeking a hoofhold in the Southwest. This is fine for peace, but we have war looming. The time has come to pick a side, and the only power that we can be certain of opposing Equestria is the Changelings. While working with imperialists is hardly appealing, they are likely our only opportunity to defeat Equestria."
BUF_proclaim_our_intentions:0 "Proclaim our Intentions"
BUF_proclaim_our_intentions_desc:0 "We are not like the dishonorable pony settlers who would preach kindness and then fail to act kind. We will be open about our goals: the total and complete annexation of the Southwest into a new government under buffalo rule!"
BUF_to_avenge_our_ancestors:0 "To Avenge our Ancestors"
BUF_to_avenge_our_ancestors_desc:0 "The countless years of settler-colonialism has left a mark on the Elder. He has decreed that the coming war is not only our best chance to reclaim our territory, it is our best chance to redeem our ancestral honor over those who have wronged us. All ponies currently occupying our rightful land will be offered a simple choice: assimilate completely, or leave forever."
BUF_to_ensure_our_survival:0 "To Reclaim our Birthright"
BUF_to_ensure_our_survival_desc:0 "Ultimately, the main reason we are waging this war is over land. The fate of the ponies on the land is of little concern to us. Any troublesome ones will be expelled, but the masses of teeming ponies will be allowed to remain under our watchful eye."
BUF_to_protect_our_descendants:0 "To Protect our Descendants"
BUF_to_protect_our_descendants_desc:0 "The most important duty of every generation is to ensure that the next has a future. We cannot adopt harsh measures, or our children may have to face another war. The ponies will be treated as equals in our new society."
BUF_a_nihilistic_destiny:0 "A Nihilistic Destiny"
BUF_a_nihilistic_destiny_desc:0 "Our coming struggle is one beyond traditional wars. On one side stands tradition, faith, and the oppressed, and the other stands the glib harmonist oppressor who saps the people's will with false promises. There can be no such thing as a "civilian" in our realm."
BUF_the_brutality_of_the_desert:0 "The Brutality of the Desert"
BUF_the_brutality_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The desert is harsh, cruel, and deadly--and we will be the same. We will strike without hesitation at every target we must.

BUF_state_polytheism:0 "State Henotheism"
BUF_state_polytheism_desc:0 "Our traditional faith is deeply varied in practice, and as such no organized central authority exists. While Elder Greyhorn has no plans to change this, he does recognize the terrible threat that atheism poses to a moral society. All buffalo will be required to seek the Divine in whatever form they feel connected to."
BUF_honor_stronghearts_actions:0 "Honor Strongheart's Actions"
BUF_honor_stronghearts_actions_desc:0 "Although they are rivals, the Elder respects Strongheart's conviction, bravery, and dedication. He considers her a naive fool, but the fact is she negotiated a peaceful end to the Apple War. She is no enemy--merely a too-trusting dreamer, as he once was."
BUF_a_duty_most_sacred:0 "A Duty Most Sacred"
BUF_a_duty_most_sacred_desc:0 "Our highest obligation is to the spirits, and while war may be approved of by them, slaughter or pillaging surely are not. Tight regulations will be placed upon the army to ensure no one transgresses these bonds."
BUF_syncretize_with_the_communists:0 "An Offer for the Communists"
BUF_syncretize_with_the_communists_desc:0 "Gorick is an upstart and a naive fool, but he wants what is best for the buffalo just as the Elder does.

BUF_weaponize_old_magic_desc:0 "The Elder is not a shaman himself, but he is familiar with their ways. And in his long life he has stumbled upon many forgotten places, cursed caves and remote monoliths. Such power always comes at a cost--but we will pay it gladly."
BUF_state_control_of_economy:0 "State Control of the Economy"
BUF_state_control_of_economy_desc:0 "The economy, as part of the nation, must be controlled by it. We cannot let the rich sell our wealth any more than we can let the ponies exploit it. Every aspect of the economy will be placed under the Elder's control."
BUF_strike_strategic_regions:0 "Strike Strategic Areas"
BUF_strike_strategic_regions_desc:0 "While our methods are violent, they need not be bloodthirsty. Through sabotaging communications, transportation, and other necessities of modernity, we can make it very difficult indeed for the ponies to crush us."
BUF_the_shaman_corps:0 "Medicine-Buffalo Corps"
BUF_the_shaman_corps_desc:0 "Our shamans are traditionally reclusive and uninterested in politics. This is unacceptable--in the coming war for the Southwest, all must do their part. The shamans will be recruited into the army and deployed as field medics, saving lives with their powers."
BUF_worker_control_of_economy:0 "Worker Control of the Economy"
BUF_worker_control_of_economy_desc:0 "We are not like Chrysalis, who commands the economy to her bidding. The workers at a factory deserve to run it--it's a simple application of communal tribal ownership to the modern era. They know how to maximize productivity, so why interfere?"
BUF_measured_industrialization:0 "Measured Industrialization"
BUF_measured_industrialization_desc:0 "We cannot risk becoming so militarized we run out of food or water! Additional factories will be built, but with land continuing to be set aside for roaming and grazing."

BUF_service_for_tribal_membership:0 "Service for Tribal Membership"
BUF_service_for_tribal_membership_desc:0 "There are some ponies within our lands already, and some buffalo who for one reason or another do not belong to a tribe. These neglected and forgotten individuals are vital to our success--by offering them membership in a tribe for serving in the army, we will integrate a potential fifth column as well as gain a ready supply of recruits."
BUF_reconnoiter_the_region:0 "Reconnoiter the Region"

BUF_a_grim_bargain:0 "A Grim Bargain"
BUF_a_grim_bargain_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has only increased her revanchist rhetoric towards Equestria. While an imperialist herself, and a brutal dictator, she leads the only nation on Equus we can be certain of sharing geopolitical aims with. Joining her faction may be an extreme solution, but it is perhaps the last chance we have to reclaim our homeland."
BUF_abandon_appeasement:0 "Abandon the Appeasement Policy"
BUF_abandon_appeasement_desc:0 "Under Thunderhooves, we made a habit of befriending Equestria, as if politely asking would get the ponies to stop invading our home. Either Celestia ignored the pleas, in which case she is our enemy; or she was unable to do anything about them, in which case she is too weak a ruler to bother asking. Either way we have no business befriending our oppressors."
BUF_new_meaning_of_recruitment:0 "New Meaning of Recruitment"
BUF_new_meaning_of_recruitment_desc:0 "Recruitment should be more than simply grabbing buffalo and forcing them into military service. It should be seen as a glorious affair - to bravely fight for your country and in the service of reclaiming your homelands!"
BUF_on_the_skulls_of_imperialists:0 "On the Skulls of Imperialists"
BUF_on_the_skulls_of_imperialists_desc:0 "Our enemy is not the common pony who was sold a false picture of the Southwest as an empty land ripe for the taking. It is those who sold them that image! We shall show no quarter to the masterminds of the stealing of our land. Partisan activities must be drastically increased, so not a single imperialist can sleep at night!"

BUF_for_the_liberation_of_all_victims_desc:0 "Throughout the world, small nations are oppressed by large ones, and the same is true of peoples. The line of Grover conquered much of Griffonia, and while our changeling allies may be fine working with them, we are not. We will reach out to all the victims of colonialism and create a pact of mutual research and friendship!"
BUF_new_level_of_mobilization:0 "New Level of Mobilization"
BUF_new_level_of_mobilization_desc:0 "This catastrophic war requires a degree of state control and militarization of the economy never before seen. This will of course be enormously unpopular with the public, but in time it will be understood."

BUF_a_long_road_desc:0 "The struggle towards the glorious future free of tyrants continues, despite our triumphs. Chrysalis is now the greatest threat to the peace we have made, as well as to her own so-called "Pax Chrysalia". It is time to remind the changelings that we do not serve them."

BUF_heroes_of_the_final_war_desc:0 "Friction between ourselves and the changelings continues to rise.

BUF_partisan_allies_desc:0 "Throughout Equestria, the people cry out for salvation. We cannot save them--we are not strong enough. But we can help them. With guns, forged papers, and more besides, we will save as many Equestrians as we can, and give the rest the strength to fight!"
BUF_friends_in_the_north:0 "Friends in the North"
BUF_friends_in_the_north_desc:0 "Not all who joined the Hegemony are blind servants of Chrysalis. Some joined for the same reason as us--to upend the Equestrian order.

BUF_central_banking_desc:0 "Right now, our economy's major investments largely are handled through traditional oaths and pledges in front of witnesses. While this is how it's always been done, it is not really efficient and foreign countries tend to find it absurd.

BUF_university_of_ayandi_desc:0 "Ayánídi, the home of Thunderhooves and Strongheart, has long been a centre of learning and science, but the curriculum is woefully out-of-date.

newbuf.1.t:0 "The Thunder of Hooves"
newbuf.1.d:0 "Gorging on the delicious apple pie resting on his big and meaty hooves, the chief of the buffaloes stood stalwart upon the crest of the hill gazing down at the glorious sight in front of him. A massive herd of buffaloes stampeded undeterred across the great plains of their ancestral stampeding grounds, shaking the earth down to the very core as if trying to communicate to their ancestors buried deep down in the ground. Showing them that the ancient ways remained strong and steadfast.\n\nA deep, hearty grunt bellowed out of Thunderhooves mouth, partially from a big helping of the pie, as he regarded his people. The earth ponies of Appleloosa had gifted them a large donation of apple pies in honor of 'another year of continued friendship between ponies and buffaloes'. While they had adopted the Equestrian calendar for many years, sometimes it was still a little difficult for the old buffalo to keep it in mind. New years, holidays, it all seemed very abstract. Despite this, he knew that he had been leader for a many, many moons. Ten years, according to the calendar.\n\nHe reminisced the years past, the trials and tribulations they had faced and the support they received from their new friends. From mending ties with the Appleloosans and allowing them to keep their apple orchards in return for apple pies, to signing friendship treaties with the great nation of Equestria (formal diplomacy still being very new to the old bull), to once again receiving help from old pony friends in bringing harvest back to their lands by returning the Rainbow Crow.\n\nRecently, the new trade relations with Stalliongrad allowed the mostly isolationist nation to truly begin its nascent journey to modernization. While influence from all these sources might be an issue, Thunderhooves was sure he could handle it. After all, the nation had been the most peaceful and prosperous in history under his leadership. Much more than in the time of his father. And his father before him. And his father before him. And his father before--\n\nThunderhooves chuckled. Scarfing down the remaining apple pie, he let out a content shout."

We have sent our envoys to Canterlot to find out what is happening but in the meantime, please st--STOP STAMPEDING EVERYWHERE!!"\n\nThunderhooves tried and tried but he could not stop the utter pandemonium that was unravelling in front of him. Buffaloes of all shapes and sizes ran amok stampeding and yelling all over the place, the panic-stricken scene enshrouded in an eerie eclipse the chiefdom hadn't seen since the time Nightmare Moon had returned to Equestria. \n\n"What is going on?! Why is the moon in the sky?!" "The ponies have barred us from their plantations! Saying we are 'trespassing' on the lands of the 'Southern Corporate State', whatever that is." "What!! Does that mean...no more apple pies?! Nooo! This cannot be!" The shouts, the questions, they only seemed to build and build ever more until a deep, sonorous voice cut through the noise.\n\n"I foresaw this, my brethren, as I had foreseen many times before." As the cacophony of the crowd slowly wore out to give space to this voice, the buffalo behind it stepped into the limelight to draw all eyes upon his resplendent self. It was the Elder Greyhorn.\n\n"Dependence is complacency. Strong are those that take charge of their destiny within their own hooves, independent of any outside power. Brothers and sisters, heed my words. Let not your hearts be clouded with fear but instead take this as a sign. A sign for the tribes to once more reclaim its future. To retake all of our lands from those that we once foolishly deemed friends."\n\n"That is not true!" came an almost immediate defiant answer from within the crowd. Startled, they gave space to the figure that had spoken up and out came Little Strongheart, walking up to stand opposite to the older buffalo. "Our lands have only benefited with our friendship with the ponies! Just look at the past ten years alone. Our Appleloosan friends, the economic advisors from Stalliongrad, even the teachers from Equestria! All of this only came about because we trusted our friends to be there in our time of need. The time has come to return the favor. If Equestria needs our help then we should help them. After all, that is what friends do!"\n\nThe tension was rife within the crowd. Both leaders stood fervently on their grounds, on their beliefs of what the future of the chiefdom should be. One thing was clear - Thunderhooves could not lead them in this battle."

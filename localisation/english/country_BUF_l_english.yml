BUF_goat_desc:0 "Giles is not a buffalo, but a goat who has adopted the buffalo way of life. Stories are told how he was lost in the desert, wandering aimlessly without purpose in life, and was rescued by a group of buffalo. He met an old shaman who adopted him as a student and taught him everything there was to know about shamanism and the cult of the Rainbow Crow. When the shaman died, Giles succeeded him, becoming the only non-buffalo shaman in the entire Equestrian southwest. It is said Giles can see the future and even use magic after certain rituals."

### Decisions ###
BUF_balance_of_power_category:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria:0 "Form the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria_desc:0 "The greatest dream of many buffalo remains the formation of a new, resurgent Buffalo Empire across the whole Southwest. While perhaps absurd, the appeal cannot be discounted.."
BUF_core_empire:0 "Restore the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_core_empire_desc:0 "Although we have retaken all our ancestral lands, things are not as they were before. Ponies live on our lands. We do not want to expel them, and instead envision a future of ponies fully integrated into the buffalo way of life. To convince the ponies of our sincerity will take time and effort, but the rewards will be immense."

BUF_organize_the_opposition: "Organize the Opposition"
BUF_organize_the_opposition_desc: "The government has not succeeded in delivering on their promises and must be dealt  with accordingly. It is time to unify the opposition and organize events to gather support and discredit [ROOT.GetLeader]."
BUF_appeal_to_the_buffalo_spirit: "Appeal to the Buffalo Spirit"
BUF_appeal_to_the_buffalo_spirit_desc: "We must appeal to the extraordinary determination, resilience and hardiness of the Buffalo in the face of adversity. The Buffalo People must work together in order to prevail against all odds. Our Stubbornness makes us strong!"
BUF_entice_the_masses: "Entice the Masses"
BUF_entice_the_masses_desc: "The masses are easily swayed. By giving promises to solve smaller close-to heart questions and issues, our government can easily become more appealing and liked by the average Buffalo."
BUF_organize_the_opposition_cost_increase_tt: "\nThe cost for §Y$BUF_organize_the_opposition$§! decisions will be §Rmultiplied§! by §Y[?BUF_bop_decision_cost_multiplier]§!.\n"

### Leader & General Descs ###
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he's better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

### Focuses ###
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Tenth Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "For ten years, the buffalo have been led by Chief Thunderhooves. For ten years, the buffalo and their Chiefdom have survived, if not exactly thrived. And now, the buffalo must prepare for ten more years. But the Chief isn't getting any younger, and some don't want to wait for him to retire..."
BUF_start_reducing_poverty:0 "Grovel for Economic Aid"
BUF_start_reducing_poverty_desc:0 "While it may hurt our pride, the fact is we are a poor nation. Stalliongrad has much knowledge of modern industrial methods and rationalized economic planning. We don't want to alienate Equestria, but what harm could come of asking for aid?"
BUF_calm_the_elder:0 "Calm the Elder"
BUF_calm_the_elder_desc:0 "Elder Greyhorn is one of the fiercest buffalo alive, always reelected leader of his tribe despite his incredibly advanced age. He demands a reorientation of our political alignment and to stop cowering, but we cannot afford an Equestrian blockade or intervention. In a decade, perhaps, we can revisit this, but for now we must let cooler heads prevail."
BUF_multipolarity:0 "Buy Surplus Guns from Stalliongrad"
BUF_multipolarity_desc:0 "Stalliongrad may lack in consumer goods, but they have plenty of weapons. We can trade delicious apple pies and other traditional luxury goods we've made for modern rifles and other implements of war!"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy:0 "Beg for Scientific Help"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy_desc:0 "A buffalo who can read is a rare thing. Too many of our elders don't even understand the idea of an art of binding words to paper, and consider it dark magic. Equestria is full of clever ponies, and while some might grumble and their presence, we stand only to gain from them."
BUF_meet_with_daughter:0 "Meet with Little Strongheart"
BUF_meet_with_daughter_desc:0 "Little Strongheart, the Chief's daughter, is a long-standing pro-Equestrian. She negotiated an end to the Apple War with her friend Braeburn and the help of the Elements of Harmony. But lately, she's been distant from her father, feeling he's not enough of an Equestriophile. Maybe they can talk it out?"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee:0 "Gain an Equestrian Guarantee"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee_desc:0 "Right now, we are vulnerable. While the non-aggression pact with Equestria holds, our oceanic border is exposed and could easily be invaded by anyone. Equestria is a superpower and could protect us. We just have to make sure we aren't tied too closely to it..."
BUF_the_worst_case:0 "The Worst Case"
BUF_the_worst_case_desc:0 "Should the worst come to happen and we have to fight an enemy, or spirits forbid Equestria itself, we must be ready. While the Elder is hardly a voice of reason, he does know a lot about war. He has demanded a draft be raised and further requested a cabinet position for himself. Chief Thunderhooves has reluctantly agreed."
BUF_the_best_case:0 "The Best Case"
BUF_the_best_case_desc:0 "Hopefully, we can continue our independence and isolation, while being friendly to our neighbors. Little Strongheart has asked her father for a chance to try her hoof at politics, and he has readily agreed!"
BUF_the_middle_path:0 "The Middle Path"
BUF_the_middle_path_desc:0 "Neither the violence of Elder Greyhorn, nor the submission of Little Strongheart: this will define the buffalo for now and for the foreseeable future. We are interested in trade, cooperation, education, and cultural exchange, but no military commitments. And that is how things will stay!"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost:0 "Modernization Whatever the Cost"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost_desc:0 "Even if it means letting more Stalliongradian agitators in, we need to learn how to run a modern economy. Otherwise we'll be swept away by industrialization completely. This is the lesser evil."
BUF_steel_for_jobs:0 "Steel for Jobs"
BUF_steel_for_jobs_desc:0 "The Equestrians are eager to help us industrialize, and hopefully get some of our natural resources. While some are reluctant to part with our treasures, Thunderhooves has been persuaded by his daughter."
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Eleventh Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Out of the darkness rises a great Chiefdom, one friendly to all and foe to none. We have walked the razor edge between extremism on both sides and grown stronger for it. And now Thunderhooves can reign for a decade more!"

oldbuf.2.t:0 "Ponies Refuse to Return Land"
oldbuf.2.d:0 "[NLR.GetName] laughed at the Elder's demands. We cannot ignore such a grievous insult. We did not want war, but [NLR.GetName] has forced our hoof."
oldbuf.2.a:0 "Let us hope this war is not too costly."

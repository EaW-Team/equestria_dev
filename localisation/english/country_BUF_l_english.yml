BUF_goat_desc:0 "Giles is not a buffalo, but a goat who has adopted the buffalo way of life. Stories are told how he was lost in the desert, wandering aimlessly without purpose in life, and was rescued by a group of buffalo. He met an old shaman who adopted him as a student and taught him everything there was to know about shamanism and the cult of the Rainbow Crow. When the shaman died, Giles succeeded him, becoming the only non-buffalo shaman in the entire Equestrian southwest. It is said Giles can see the future and even use magic after certain rituals."

### Decisions ###
BUF_balance_of_power_category:0 "Balance of Power Decisions"
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria:0 "Form the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_steal_states_from_equestria_desc:0 "The greatest dream of many buffalo remains the formation of a new, resurgent Buffalo Empire across the whole Southwest. While perhaps absurd, the appeal cannot be discounted.."
BUF_core_empire:0 "Restore the Buffalo Empire"
BUF_core_empire_desc:0 "Although we have retaken all our ancestral lands, things are not as they were before. Ponies live on our lands. We do not want to expel them, and instead envision a future of ponies fully integrated into the buffalo way of life. To convince the ponies of our sincerity will take time and effort, but the rewards will be immense."

BUF_organize_the_opposition: "Organize the Opposition"
BUF_organize_the_opposition_desc: "The government has not succeeded in delivering on their promises and must be dealt  with accordingly. It is time to unify the opposition and organize events to gather support and discredit [ROOT.GetLeader]."
BUF_appeal_to_the_buffalo_spirit: "Appeal to the Buffalo Spirit"
BUF_appeal_to_the_buffalo_spirit_desc: "We must appeal to the extraordinary determination, resilience and hardiness of the Buffalo in the face of adversity. The Buffalo People must work together in order to prevail against all odds. Our Stubbornness makes us strong!"
BUF_entice_the_masses: "Entice the Masses"
BUF_entice_the_masses_desc: "The masses are easily swayed. By giving promises to solve smaller close-to heart questions and issues, our government can easily become more appealing and liked by the average Buffalo."

BUF_partisan_tactics_category: "Partisan Tactics"
BUF_partisan_tactics_category_desc: "The partisan strategy involves encircling and isolating enemy units to cripple their logistical and communication lines. \nThe implementation of this approach requires careful planning and training of the defense forces to ensure its effectiveness on the battlefield, but it will allow to outmaneuver the enemy and strike where they least expect."

BUF_elder_partisan_infiltration:0 "The Elder's Sabotage Strategy"
BUF_elder_partisan_infiltration_desc:0 "Before war between the buffalo and the ponies happens, its fate will be decided by the states controlled by the Buffalo partisans. Both Equestria and the Buffalo will need to invest resources to control this remote desert."

### Leader & General Descs ###
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he's better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

### Focuses ###
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Tenth Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_tenth_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "For ten years, the buffalo have been led by Chief Thunderhooves. For ten years, the buffalo and their Chiefdom have survived, if not exactly thrived. And now, the buffalo must prepare for ten more years. But the Chief isn't getting any younger, and some don't want to wait for him to retire..."
BUF_start_reducing_poverty:0 "Grovel for Economic Aid"
BUF_start_reducing_poverty_desc:0 "While it may hurt our pride, the fact is we are a poor nation. Stalliongrad has much knowledge of modern industrial methods and rationalized economic planning. We don't want to alienate Equestria, but what harm could come of asking for aid?"
BUF_calm_the_elder:0 "Calm the Elder"
BUF_calm_the_elder_desc:0 "Elder Greyhorn is one of the fiercest buffalo alive, always reelected leader of his tribe despite his incredibly advanced age. He demands a reorientation of our political alignment and to stop cowering, but we cannot afford an Equestrian blockade or intervention. In a decade, perhaps, we can revisit this, but for now we must let cooler heads prevail."
BUF_multipolarity:0 "Buy Surplus Guns from Stalliongrad"
BUF_multipolarity_desc:0 "Stalliongrad may lack in consumer goods, but they have plenty of weapons. We can trade delicious apple pies and other traditional luxury goods we've made for modern rifles and other implements of war!"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy:0 "Beg for Scientific Help"
BUF_start_reducing_illiteracy_desc:0 "A buffalo who can read is a rare thing. Too many of our elders don't even understand the idea of an art of binding words to paper, and consider it dark magic. Equestria is full of clever ponies, and while some might grumble and their presence, we stand only to gain from them."
BUF_meet_with_daughter:0 "Meet with Little Strongheart"
BUF_meet_with_daughter_desc:0 "Little Strongheart, the Chief's daughter, is a long-standing pro-Equestrian. She negotiated an end to the Apple War with her friend Braeburn and the help of the Elements of Harmony. But lately, she's been distant from her father, feeling he's not enough of an Equestriophile. Maybe they can talk it out?"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee:0 "Gain an Equestrian Guarantee"
BUF_gain_an_equestrian_guarantee_desc:0 "Right now, we are vulnerable. While the non-aggression pact with Equestria holds, our oceanic border is exposed and could easily be invaded by anyone. Equestria is a superpower and could protect us. We just have to make sure we aren't tied too closely to it..."
BUF_the_worst_case:0 "The Worst Case"
BUF_the_worst_case_desc:0 "Should the worst come to happen and we have to fight an enemy, or spirits forbid Equestria itself, we must be ready. While the Elder is hardly a voice of reason, he does know a lot about war. He has demanded a draft be raised and further requested a cabinet position for himself. Chief Thunderhooves has reluctantly agreed."
BUF_the_best_case:0 "The Best Case"
BUF_the_best_case_desc:0 "Hopefully, we can continue our independence and isolation, while being friendly to our neighbors. Little Strongheart has asked her father for a chance to try her hoof at politics, and he has readily agreed!"
BUF_the_middle_path:0 "The Middle Path"
BUF_the_middle_path_desc:0 "Neither the violence of Elder Greyhorn, nor the submission of Little Strongheart: this will define the buffalo for now and for the foreseeable future. We are interested in trade, cooperation, education, and cultural exchange, but no military commitments. And that is how things will stay!"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost:0 "Modernization Whatever the Cost"
BUF_modernization_whatever_the_cost_desc:0 "Even if it means letting more Stalliongradian agitators in, we need to learn how to run a modern economy. Otherwise we'll be swept away by industrialization completely. This is the lesser evil."
BUF_steel_for_jobs:0 "Steel for Jobs"
BUF_steel_for_jobs_desc:0 "The Equestrians are eager to help us industrialize, and hopefully get some of our natural resources. While some are reluctant to part with our treasures, Thunderhooves has been persuaded by his daughter."
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves:0 "The Eleventh Year of Chief Thunderhooves"
BUF_eleventh_year_of_thunderhooves_desc:0 "Friends, we have done it. Out of the darkness rises a great Chiefdom, one friendly to all and foe to none. We have walked the razor edge between extremism on both sides and grown stronger for it. And now Thunderhooves can reign for a decade more!"

BUF_chieftainess_little_strongheart:0 "Chieftainess Little Strongheart"
BUF_chieftainess_little_strongheart_desc:0 "Thunderhooves' young daughter, Little Strongheart, has been chosen as Chieftainess to lead the Buffalo. But there's still the Elder to consider..."
BUF_desert_bunkers:0 "Desert Forts"
BUF_desert_bunkers_desc:0 "In light of worsening relations with the so-called "Southern Corporate State", we need to fortify our borders and place bunkers throughout the desert. Only through extensive fortifications can our borders be safe!"
BUF_desert_supply_lines:0 "Desert Supply Lines"
BUF_desert_supply_lines_desc:0 "In light of worsening relations with the so-called "Southern Corporate State", we need to ensure our troops will be sufficiently fed. Only through expanding our internal supply lines, started by Strongheart's beloved father, can we be ready."
BUF_sheriff_braeburn:0 "Sheriff Braeburn"
BUF_sheriff_braeburn_desc:0 "With the recent referendum in Appleloosa and its merger with our lands, the time has come to promote Braeburn, Strongheart's close friend, to Sheriff of Appleloosa. She has absolute confidence in his abilities."
BUF_stick_with_silverstar:0 "Stick with Silverstar"
BUF_stick_with_silverstar_desc:0 "Silverstar has done a fine job as Sheriff, and there's no need to replace him. Besides, he's well trusted by the ponies!"
BUF_self_defense_from_aggression:0 "Self-Defense from Aggression"
BUF_self_defense_from_aggression_desc:0 "We are facing a superior foe in this Corporate State. With the industrial heart of the Southwest as well as more modern equipment, we'll have to fight correspondingly harder. But we've already lost so much - we will not lose more!"
BUF_exile_brigades:0 "Pony Exile Brigades"
BUF_exile_brigades_desc:0 "The Appleloosans are eager to fight for their home, and we are in dire need of reinforcements. Together, let's protect our homes!"
BUF_our_new_pony_friends:0 "Together as a Team"
BUF_our_new_pony_friends_desc:0 "With the help of Appleloosa, we are finally in a position to drag our country into the modern era. And this time, we won't be caught off-guard!"
BUF_partisan_warfare:0 "Partisan Warfare"
BUF_partisan_warfare_desc:0 "While we may not be able to fight the Corporate State head-on, we will have a much better chance by luring them into small pockets and then encircling their supply lines! Elder Greyhorn will take the lead on this project."
BUF_modernize_equipment:0 "Modernize Equipment"
BUF_modernize_equipment:0 "We can't expect to win with muskets or bronze cannons. Little Strongheart has ordered an expansive military buildup and modernization of our troops' gear."
BUF_friendship_with_rock_union:0 "Friendship with Rock Union"
BUF_friendship_with_rock_union_desc:0 "The Rock Union, our neighbor to the north, may be a communist regime. But they are certainly preferable to the Corporate State, and Las Pegasus is eying them hungrily. We should reach out for cooperation!"


BUF_the_old_one_returns:0 "The Old One Returns"
BUF_the_old_one_returns_desc:0 "Elder Greyhorn, the oldest and wisest of us all, has won the confidence of the emergency Convocation of Chiefs. A new era is upon the buffalo people, an era of victory won and honor restored!"
BUF_a_new_foreign_policy:0 "A New Foreign Policy"
BUF_a_new_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Under Thunderhooves, we tried to balance the many powers seeking a hoofhold in the Southwest. This is fine for peace, but we have war looming. The time has come to pick a side, and the only power that we can be certain of opposing Equestria is the Changelings. While working with imperialists is hardly appealing, they are likely our only opportunity to defeat Equestria."
BUF_proclaim_our_intentions:0 "Proclaim our Intentions"
BUF_proclaim_our_intentions_desc:0 "We are not like the dishonorable pony settlers who would preach kindness and then fail to act kind. We will be open about our goals: the total and complete annexation of the Southwest into a new government under buffalo rule!"
BUF_to_avenge_our_ancestors:0 "To Avenge our Ancestors"
BUF_to_avenge_our_ancestors_desc:0 "The countless years of settler-colonialism has left a mark on the Elder. He has decreed that the coming war is not only our best chance to reclaim our territory, it is our best chance to redeem our ancestral honor over those who have wronged us. All ponies currently occupying our rightful land will be offered a simple choice: assimilate completely, or leave forever."
BUF_to_ensure_our_survival:0 "To Reclaim our Birthright"
BUF_to_ensure_our_survival_desc:0 "Ultimately, the main reason we are waging this war is over land. The fate of the ponies on the land is of little concern to us. Any troublesome ones will be expelled, but the masses of teeming ponies will be allowed to remain under our watchful eye."
BUF_to_protect_our_descendants:0 "To Protect our Descendants"
BUF_to_protect_our_descendants_desc:0 "The most important duty of every generation is to ensure that the next has a future. We cannot adopt harsh measures, or our children may have to face another war. The ponies will be treated as equals in our new society."
BUF_a_nihilistic_destiny:0 "A Nihilistic Destiny"
BUF_a_nihilistic_destiny_desc:0 "Our coming struggle is one beyond traditional wars. On one side stands tradition, faith, and the oppressed, and the other stands the glib harmonist oppressor who saps the people's will with false promises. There can be no such thing as a "civilian" in our realm."
BUF_the_brutality_of_the_desert:0 "The Brutality of the Desert"
BUF_the_brutality_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The desert is harsh, cruel, and deadly--and we will be the same. We will strike without hesitation at every target we must. The definition of 'target' will be expanded too, to include pony landlords, industrialists, and other such masterminds of our exploitation."
BUF_a_sandstorm_in_the_making:0 "A Sandstorm in the Making"
BUF_a_sandstorm_in_the_making_desc:0 "We will churn up the mesas and the plains with our force! Every rock will hide a rifle behind it, and invasion of our sacred lands will become impossible!"
BUF_state_polytheism:0 "State Henotheism"
BUF_state_polytheism_desc:0 "Our traditional faith is deeply varied in practice, and as such no organized central authority exists. While Elder Greyhorn has no plans to change this, he does recognize the terrible threat that atheism poses to a moral society. All buffalo will be required to seek the Divine in whatever form they feel connected to."
BUF_honor_stronghearts_actions:0 "Honor Strongheart's Actions"
BUF_honor_stronghearts_actions_desc:0 "Although they are rivals, the Elder respects Strongheart's conviction, bravery, and dedication. He considers her a naive fool, but the fact is she negotiated a peaceful end to the Apple War. She is no enemy--merely a too-trusting dreamer, as he once was."
BUF_a_duty_most_sacred:0 "A Duty Most Sacred"
BUF_a_duty_most_sacred_desc:0 "Our highest obligation is to the spirits, and while war may be approved of by them, slaughter or pillaging surely are not. Tight regulations will be placed upon the army to ensure no one transgresses these bonds."
BUF_syncretize_with_the_communists:0 "An Offer for the Communists"
BUF_syncretize_with_the_communists_desc:0 "Gorick is an upstart and a naive fool, but he wants what is best for the buffalo just as the Elder does. While the Elder will not trust Stalliongrad much more than Equestria, he can trust a fellow buffalo patriot. Labor shall be protected and a good life guaranteed."
BUF_the_fires_of_liberation:0 "The Fires of Liberation"
BUF_the_fires_of_liberation_desc:0 "Our mission is not vengeance, nor even justice. It is liberty, that most sacred of fruits, for ourselves and our children! The whole Southwest shall soon be united under the rights of creatures!"
BUF_grenade_in_hoof:0 "Grenade in Hoof"
BUF_grenade_in_hoof_desc:0 "The war for the Southwest will depend on our bravery and our tenacity, but also our ability to be well-equipped. We will "acquire" industrial capabilities focused primarily on military output. Luxuries can wait until the Southwest is ours."
BUF_weaponize_old_magic:0 "Weaponize Old Magic"
BUF_weaponize_old_magic_desc:0 "The Elder is not a shaman himself, but he is familiar with their ways. And in his long life he has stumbled upon many forgotten places, cursed caves and remote monoliths. Such power always comes at a cost--but we will pay it gladly."
BUF_state_control_of_economy:0 "State Control of the Economy"
BUF_state_control_of_economy_desc:0 "The economy, as part of the nation, must be controlled by it. We cannot let the rich sell our wealth any more than we can let the ponies exploit it. Every aspect of the economy will be placed under the Elder's control."
BUF_strike_strategic_regions:0 "Strike Strategic Areas"
BUF_strike_strategic_regions_desc:0 "While our methods are violent, they need not be bloodthirsty. Through sabotaging communications, transportation, and other necessities of modernity, we can make it very difficult indeed for the ponies to crush us."
BUF_the_shaman_corps:0 "Medicine-Buffalo Corps"
BUF_the_shaman_corps_desc:0 "Our shamans are traditionally reclusive and uninterested in politics. This is unacceptable--in the coming war for the Southwest, all must do their part. The shamans will be recruited into the army and deployed as field medics, saving lives with their powers."
BUF_worker_control_of_economy:0 "Worker Control of the Economy"
BUF_worker_control_of_economy_desc:0 "We are not like Chrysalis, who commands the economy to her bidding. The workers at a factory deserve to run it--it's a simple application of communal tribal ownership to the modern era. They know how to maximize productivity, so why interfere?"
BUF_measured_industrialization:0 "Measured Industrialization"
BUF_measured_industrialization_desc:0 "We cannot risk becoming so militarized we run out of food or water! Additional factories will be built, but with land continuing to be set aside for roaming and grazing."
BUF_mandatory_service:0 "Mandatory Service"
BUF_mandatory_service_desc:0 "Everyone must do their part to retake the Southwest, and that extends to military service. Conscription will be intensified and training will be expedited."
BUF_death_is_a_duty:0 "Death is a Duty"
BUF_death_is_a_duty_desc:0 "The greatest honor in our ancestors' eyes is to die a hero. And we intend to honor them greatly indeed. In the service of our people, no cost is too great."
BUF_service_for_tribal_membership:0 "Service for Tribal Membership"
BUF_service_for_tribal_membership_desc:0 "There are some ponies within our lands already, and some buffalo who for one reason or another do not belong to a tribe. These neglected and forgotten individuals are vital to our success--by offering them membership in a tribe for serving in the army, we will integrate a potential fifth column as well as gain a ready supply of recruits."
BUF_reconnoiter_the_region:0 "Reconnoiter the Region"
BUF_reconnoiter_the_region_desc:0 "To successfully invade the Southwest, we must know where to strike. Our spies will be sent out with binoculars and radios and we will learn exactly where all key depots are."
BUF_a_realm_of_heroes:0 "A Realm of Heroes"
BUF_a_realm_of_heroes_desc:0 "Our soldiers are not meat for the meat grinder! They are noble warriors, modern-day knights-errant here to bring swift victory to our people."
BUF_service_for_benefits:0 "Service for Benefits"

BUF_a_grim_bargain:0 "A Grim Bargain"
BUF_a_grim_bargain_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has only increased her revanchist rhetoric towards Equestria. While an imperialist herself, and a brutal dictator, she leads the only nation on Equus we can be certain of sharing geopolitical aims with. Joining her faction may be an extreme solution, but it is perhaps the last chance we have to reclaim our homeland."

BUF_central_banking_desc:0 "Right now, our economy's major investments largely are handled through traditional oaths and pledges in front of witnesses. While this is how it's always been done, it is not really efficient and foreign countries tend to find it absurd.

BUF_a_legacy_of_war_desc:0 "The great Elder Greyhorn remains our foremost expert on warfare, and he knows that even in an era of tanks, planes, and other modern horrors, there will always be a place for infantry. Ultimately, a tank or a plane can't hold a patch of ground!"

BUF_embrace_modernity:0 "Embrace Modern Tactics"
BUF_embrace_modernity_desc:0 "The Changelings have the right of it: speed, firepower, and a focus on results over orders make an army invincible. While we can't expect to achieve blitzkrieg as they have with tanks, motorized infantry and artillery will still be unstoppable."

BUF_infantry_tactics:0 "Stick to our Strengths"
BUF_infantry_tactics_desc:0 "Equestria's military situation is rather like ours. With an army focused around the common soldier and defensive operations, we will become unconquerable. Let the enemy come - we'll be ready!"

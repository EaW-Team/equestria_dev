 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Weapons From The Capital"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "A large delivery of weapons has come from Aquila, courtesy of the royal armoury. With revolutionary tensions rising, these weapons likely will be invaluable in the coming months."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.2.t:0 "The Chouette Raids"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "The secret police has been on the move recently. Through their usual methods - unsavory as they are - they have revealed several revolutionary headquarters and raided them in the middle of the night. Hopefully, this will be enough to thwart the rebels."
 aquileia.2.a:0 "This will force the rats into the open..."
 
 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Pony March"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "A grand march through the countryside took place this week. Ponies, numbering in the thousands, marched from Pelis to Rila, holding royal banners and placards with pro-royalist slogans on them. In every village they passed more ponies join them, and as they reached Rila they filled the city square, singing the Royal Hymn and declaring their loyalty to the crown."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Glad to see our Equine friends are still supporting us."
 
 aquileia.4.t:0 "Republicans Within The MPA Arrested"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "It seems that the local MPA have had greater issues than we suspected. The Chouette, acting on orders from Aquila, arrested over a dozen high ranking MPA members on charges of revolutionary activities."
 aquileia.4.a:0 "How embarrassing."
 
 aquileia.5.t:0 "A Visit to Vinovia"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Vinovia has been graced by the presence of the royal family. With tensions high, many had feared that a visit from the tempramental king would only make things worse, but thankfully the visitor turned out to be princess Vivienne. The princess, as charming as any griffin could be, took her time with both commoner and noble and was all smiles and delight. Even with the possibility of revolution ahead, for one evening the princess managed to assuage fears and give a moment of joy to all."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Thank Eyr Moriset sent Vivienne instead..."
 
 aquileia.6.t:0 "Letting Loose"
 aquileia.6.d:0 "So the revolutionary rats have crawled out of their holes again to make a mess of things, have they? Well, if they did not learn the last time, it seems we will have to teach them a lesson again. Let's make sure we are suitably excessive this time around."
 aquileia.6.a:0 "Violence solves most things."
 
 aquileia.7.t:0 "Search And Destroy"
 aquileia.7.d:0 "Pridean forces have struck all over Pridea, dragging the traitors and their sympathisers out of their holes kicking and screaming. The citizens are too afraid to defy us, knowing the price of treason, and by the time we're done there will not be a single rat left in all of Pridea!"
 aquileia.7.a:0 "None can hide from us!"
 
 aquileia.8.t:0 "Friends In the MPA"
 aquileia.8.d:0 "It seems the MPA have been receiving aid from Aquila. That's splendid news as it means that there's more fighters out there, willing to fight for Aquileia. "
 aquileia.8.a:0 "Magnifique."
 
 aquileia.9.t:0 "Rila Holds"
 aquileia.9.d:0 "The revolutionaries came, and the revolutionaries failed. They thought they could break Rila, but it broke them instead. Raise the royal banner high, Rila Holds!"
 aquileia.9.a:0 "Hurray!"
 
 aquileia.10.t:0 "The Revolution In Rila"
 aquileia.10.d:0 "Early this morning, the Duke fled Rila after the streets were blocked by revolutionaries and several military units declared for the Republic!

 aquileia.12.t:0 "The Revolution In Westkeep"

 aquileia.13.t:0 "Vinovia Holds"
 aquileia.13.d:0 "It seemed like disaster might strike, but in the end, the Duke's leadership has seen us through, and the revolutionaries have failed in their objectives.

 aquileia.14.t:0 "The Revolution In Vinovia"
 aquileia.14.d:0 "Down with the tyrants! Our forces have secured the Ducal palace and the outlying regions of the capitol. Raise high the banner of Vinovia and march forth! We march for freedom, to victory!"

 aquileia.15.t:0 "Pridea Holds"
 aquileia.15.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the traitors and revolutionaries, Pridea remains loyal to the crown. They tried their best, but it was all for naught, and it seems we are dragging more traitors to the wall again."
 aquileia.15.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the monarchists have been overthrown across Aquileia! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Even the officers that once begrudgingly fought beneath the banners of cruelty and tyranny have been swayed by our cause, and have pledged their undying support to the new republic. They will safeguard Aquileia from the return of the Discrets, as surely the taint of their royal blood lingers in bastards across Griffonia, but for now Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new Republic!"
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the last of the monarchist vassals has finally collapsed beneath the unstoppable tide of freedom! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Though our enemies fought on to the bitter end, they have all been defeated on the field of battle, their armies crushed and routed. A new generation of heroes will safeguard Aquileia from those that would see the monarchy restored yet again, but for now Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new Republic!""
 aquileia.18.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.19.t:0 "A Few Missing Rifles"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "The quartermaster walked through the depot, a clipboard clutched in one claw. "Twenty-four new artillery pieces," she murmured to herself, counting out the new cannons and scratching a note in the clipboard. "Fifty mortar tubes and grenades... check. Replacement rifle parts... check."\n\nShe hummed to herself as all the numbers on her charts added up. So far, so good. She prided herself on taking good notes, and not having a mishap in her depot since her posting. "Let's count the guns, then I can get some tea with Louis..."\n\nIt was always the chore she saved for last. Not only did she have to count the crates, but the factories never rigorously checked how many rifles they put in the crates, so sometimes her numbers could be off. Even years after the revolution had been crushed, not all of Aquileia's wheels turned smoothly.\n\n"...forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-eight?" She counted the crates again. "There were supposed to be fifty crates..." Maybe the factories had crammed more guns into the crates to save wood? But after spending an hour cracking open crates and counting their contents, the quartermaster had no answer for the missing guns.\n\nShe'd have to report this to her higher ups. Lunch with Louis would have to wait."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Quite odd, wouldn't you say?"
 
 aquileia.20.t:0 "Gone Like The Wind"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "The spymaster general dug his claws into his skull. The reports kept rolling in, one after the other. It seemed like every revolutionary cell in the kingdom had simply disappeared overnight, their members gone with the wind. Some of his spies believed that the cells had simply given up the fight, but he knew better. They wouldn't all disperse in unison. They had to be planning something. But there were dozens of cells with hundreds of griffons that his spies were keeping track of. Now, not a one could be found. Where did they all go?!"
 aquileia.20.a:0 "Now where did they go off to?"
 
 aquileia.21.t:0 "Assistance From The MPA"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment growing throughout the kingdom once more, griffons have been organizing and gathering in secret and making demonstrations in public. Unrest grows by the day, but stability and order is coming from an unexpected source: the Ultranationalists of the Mouvement Patriote d'Aquileia. The Ultranationalist are very organized and well-equipped, and they have lent our gendarmeries a helping claw in keeping unrest suppressed. Thanks to their help, our police force can focus on more pressing matters, like rooting out all the revolutionaries we can find and piling their heads beneath the guillotine!"
 aquileia.21.a:0 "That's rather generous of them?"
 
 aquileia.22.t:0 "Increased Chouette Activity"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Recent days have seen the Chouette, the secret police that serve as King Moriset's right claw, increase their presence and visibility throughout the kingdom, breaking down the doors of suspected revolutionaries in the middle of the night and publicly executing them by day. In this day and age, no griffon is safe from being a suspected sympathizer of the revolution, and the Chouette have taken it upon themselves to sort the matter out once and for all."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "How strange."
 
 aquileia.23.t:0 "Support From the Capital"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment rising throughout the Kingdom of Aquileia, several companies of soldiers and additional support for our gendarmerie arrived today to bolster our numbers, bearing official papers signed by the king himself. These extra griffons will help keep an eye out for any rebel organizations in our lands, and are already swiftly being integrated into our local gendarmeries and briefed on the current situation."
 aquileia.23.a:0 "That's absolutely grand!"
 
 aquileia.24.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
 aquileia.24.d:0 "Private Noelle stared at the growing mound of papers gathering in the gendarmerie station. The police had been bringing them in all day, with griffons constantly coming and going ever since the sun rose that morning. She was barely literate and struggled to read out the words on the pamphlet clutched in her talons, but the revolutionary tricolour was easy enough to see. She needed no script to know what that meant.\n\n"Find the printers that helped them make these," her sergeant grumbled, tearing a pamphlet in half out of frustration. "Better yet, just arrest all the printers in the city. We can't have anymore pamphlets on the streets, you understand?"\n\nNoelle saluted in acknowledgement. "It will be done, sir," she said, and then quickly slipped out of the station at his dismissal. But even as she stepped outside, she saw a pair of griffons down the street snatching two pamphlets off the ground and tucking them into their overcoats. Arresting all the printers in Pridea might put a pause to new pamphlets being spread, but once words put an idea in a griffons head, it was notoriously hard to shake out.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in her life, Noelle was glad she couldn't read."
 aquileia.24.a:0 "If only more of our subjects were illiterate."
 
 aquileia.25.t:0 "Murders Most Foul"
 aquileia.25.d:0 "Ever since King Moriset returned from Zebrica and reclaimed the Aquileian throne, those that supported him have been rewarded with better postings and better pay all throughout the kingdom. Perhaps this is not more evident than in the Barony of Pridea, where ponies that collaborated with the king and Marshal Berthelot have climbed the ranks of the gendarmerie, and now command griffon underlings of their own. Last night, however, a string of coordinated attacks on gendarme officers left many of these ponies dead and sent those remaining on the force into hiding, fearing for their lives. Racial tensions in Pridea are beginning to boil over, and this could only be the work of those damn Revolutionaries!"
 aquileia.25.a:0 "The Revolutionaries are getting bolder."
 
 aquileia.26.t:0 "Mail-Order Disaster"
 aquileia.26.d:0 "Pridea's gendarmerie is already stretched thin enough as it is with the deaths and resignations of our pony brethren in the force, so perhaps it was no surprise that a bomb managed to make its way inside of Baron Dennis' castle. The bomb had been stuffed inside a crate carrying a statue of himself the Baron had commissioned, and was wired to explode when the crate was split open, in anticipation of our baron being present for its reveal. As luck would have it, the Baron's art collector couldn't help but sneak a peek at the scupture before its reveal, and while Dennis will need a new collector for his private gallery and some repairs done to the stonework of his castle, the vile revolutionary plot has failed. Still, the plot is the talk of the barony, and it is sure to spread revolutionary tensions across Pridea..."
 aquileia.26.a:0 "Find whoever did this!"
 
 aquileia.27.t:0 "Rising Extremism"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The past few days have seen Vinovia erupt into a veritable volcano of chaos and extremism. It began with a public speech by a revolutionary sympathizer in the town square that was quickly interrupted by our loyal gendarmerie. However, before they could disperse the crowd and place the sympathizer under arrest, a brick thrown from a nearby building struck a gendarme in the back of the skull, killing him instantly. The sergeant in charge of the gendarmerie then attempted to place every griffon present under arrest, and when some began to resist, his unit began indiscriminately firing into the crowd, killing seventeen and wounding dozens more. Riots broke out that night, and the city took on an orange glow as the mob set fires to storefronts and the homes of gendarmes and loyalists to the monarchy. Another confrontation between the mob and the gendarmes led to a brutal fistfight that saw scores wounded on both sides before a battalion of professional soldiers arrived to scatter the mob. Over the next few days, revolutionary sentiment has only seemed to increase, with more protests and riots throughout Vinovia. Our gendarmerie and the army are doing the best they can to control the situation, but calling it a tense time would be an understatement."
 aquileia.27.a:0 "It will pass."
 
 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Scandal"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "A snicker from the adjacent room took Duke Gadiffer's attention away from the book he read in his study. Frowning, the Duke placed a marker between the pages and looked up, his eyes meeting those of a pair of maids looking at him from the other room. Too late, the griffonesses realized that the Duke had heard him, and their faces paled at his stern look.\n\n"Come here," he ordered them, setting the book aside. Reluctantly, the two maids nervously stepped into his study, bowing their heads before the duke. After a moment to look them over, the Duke sharply frowned. "Were you laughing at me?"\n\n"N-No, milord," the first maid answers. "We would never!" exclaims the other.\n\n"Lie to me, and I'll take your tongues," the Duke warns them. After letting that threat sink in, he steeples his claws together. "Now," he says, staring them down. "What have I done that you find so amusing?"\n\n"I-It's lies, milord," the first maid says. "We were laughing at how absurd they are."\n\n"Lies?" Duke Gadiffer asks. "What lies?"\n\n"They commonfolk... they say your beak is crooked."\n\n"Crooked?" Gadiffer blinked. Then he laughed. "Oh, that's it? That's what's so funny?"\n\n"They also said you've got a balding spot on your head... and your talons are dull... but your brain is duller..." Gadiffer and the first maid looked at the second, who rattled off the talk of the town. "You're impotent and prefer the presence of gentlegriffs to hens... and chicks aren't allowed near the castle for their own safety..."\n\nThe duke held up a claw, silencing her. "Say one more thing and forget losing your tongue, I'll have your head." His simmering rage left the two maids fidgeting uncomfortably before them, before he angrily waved them away. "Leave me. Now."\n\nThe two maids wasted no time curtsying and scampering out of the room as fast as they could, leaving the Duke to fume on the slander that was apparently making its way around Vinovia. Finally, sighing, he opened his book back up and tore through the pages with renewed energy, simply trying to take his mind away from the lies of the revolutionaries."
 aquileia.28.a:0 "No griffon will believe them, right?"
 
 aquileia.29.t:0 "Take It To The Duke"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Duke Gadiffer watched the mob gather outside the gates of his castle in dismay. They weren't being particularly violent, which was a good thing, though he did have soldiers lining the walls with their weapons displayed to discourage any sort of unruly behaviour. The bad news was the slander and insults they chanted weren't that much better. It seemed the rumors he'd gotten out of his maids weren't exactly a limited sentiment, nor did they blow away on their own.\n\nAfter listening to their shouts for a few minutes, the Duke turned to his captain of the guard in exasperation. "Make them go away!" he shouted, emphatically gesturing with his claws. "Shoot them if you have to. Just make them stop!"\n\nThe captain bowed in acknowledgement and walked away, shouting orders to his nearby subordinates, and the Duke sighed and buried his face in his claws. With his respect in Vinovia all but gone, he could only watch as his supporters disappeared, one by one, and the ranks of the revolutionaries grew. And all because of one stupid rumor! Maybe he should just start executing anygriffon that continues spouting those lies. His beak wasn't that crooked after all..."
 aquileia.29.a:0 "They can't do that! Shoot them... or something!"
 
 aquileia.30.t:0 "The Death of Marshal Berthelot"
 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."
 aquileia.30.a:0 "Rest in peace old friend."
 
 aquileia.31.t:0 "The Royal Execution"
 aquileia.31.d:0 "The Republic claimed its grandest prize yet today with the capture and swift execution of the hated King Moriset. A daring raid last night saw the royal palace seized just before the break of day, and King Moriset was captured before he could slip out of a hidden passage in his bedroom. The King was immediately taken to his throne room in irons, where the Council had set up a court to try him from the room where he once condemned thousands of Revolutionaries to their deaths with his words alone. Today, however, the King seemed less interested in defending himself from his crimes, instead spewing insults at Théodore Vérany, the Republic, and the griffons of Aquileia who had brought him to justice. He was swiftly found guilty by unanimous decision of the court, and was dragged to the town square to meet the guillotine that had claimed so many of our comrades. The royal continued to spit forth vile slander against the Republic, threatening his unending wrath were he not released, up until the moment the blade removed his head from his body. He had very little to say after that.\n\nUnfortunately, the King's daughter, Vivienne, did not meet the same fate as her father. It seems there may have been a secret monarchist guarding her cell; either that, or the harlot used her charms to seduce a weak-willed comrade and convinced him to let her go free. Whatever the case may be, the hated Discret dynasty lives on, though with the king dead, Vivienne is likely to see her friends and supporters abandon her in the coming weeks. It is only a matter of time now."
 aquileia.31.a:0 "Thus unto tyrants."
 
 aquileia.32.t:0 "The Flight Of The King"
 aquileia.32.d:0 "Just before the dawn, a team of experienced revolutionaries, veterans from the glorious first revolution, assaulted the royal palace in unison with the uprisings throughout the capital. One team was tasked with breaching the walls with a wagon full of dynamite. A second was to land on the highest spires and fight their way inside, sealing the palace from the top down. A third was to surround the palace and make sure no griffon fled into the night.\n\nOf course, no plans go off without a hitch. The first team struggled to set off the wagon full of powder owing to the morning drizzle, costing valuable time. The second team was discovered circling above the palace waiting for the explosion, and the resulting shootout alerted the soldiers on the grounds to the attempt. By the time the first two teams successfully secured the palace, King Moriset and his family was nowhere to be found, and the third team fell for a diversion meant to draw their attention away from the fleeing king. King Moriset has vanished into the night, and our chance to end the vile Discret line in one fell swoop is gone."
 aquileia.32.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 
 aquileia.33.t:0 "The Rila Bombing"
 aquileia.33.d:0 "A deafening blast broke windows and shook the buildings of central Rila today. Dazed citizens staggered out of their buildings and into the street, only to be greeted by a rising cloud of black smoke over the town square. This morning, vile rebels detonated a bomb in front of the statue of King Gerad, demolishing the statue and killing a platoon of soldiers marching by at that moment. Similar bombings were coordinated throughout the city, with the targets being a recruitment station, a post office, and a naval dockyard. Altogether, twenty soldiers lost their lives in these vicious attacks, and the city of Rila has been placed under martial law until the suspects have been apprehended."
 aquileia.33.a:0 "Bollocks!"
 
 aquileia.34.t:0 "The Word Spreads"
 aquileia.34.d:0 ""Sergeant Dupont!"\n\nSergeant Dupont raised his head from the papers in front of him, missives from his superiors in Aquileia. "What is it, Henri?" the sergeant asked. Henri was supposed to be with the rest of his patrol along the wharves. Were they attacked by rebels?\n\nHis answer came when Henri held out a claw. In it was a piece of paper, marked with the distinct tricolour of the long-lost revolution. "We found these down by the shipyards."\n\n"These?" Sergeant Dupont asked, taking the paper from the private. It was a revolutionary pamphlet, decrying the monarchy and urging the peasants to fight for their 'freedom', whatever misguided concept the rebels supposed that was. "Are there more?"\n\nHenri nodded and dug into his bags. When he pulled his claw out, a fat stack of pamphlets came with it. "We tried collecting all we could, but..."\n\nSergeant Dupont stared at the stack in disbelief. How did the rebels manage to print so many pamphlets? He stood up and moved past Henri, heading for the door, the confused private following in his wake. Turning the latch with a claw, the sergeant looked out into the street, beak falling slack at the dozens of pamphlets drifting down the cobbles, carried along by the breeze.\n\n"I won't need to go far to look for stationary to tell the general about this...""
 aquileia.34.a:0 "Bloody Revolutionaries!"
 
 aquileia.35.t:0 "The Meshorio Raid"
 aquileia.35.d:0 "While the previous revolution may have have centralized in the holdings of the previous King of Aquileia, one of its most fervent and chaotic breeding grounds was the Duchy of Rila. Here, revolutionary sentiment took root in dozens of different flavors, leading to the foundations of almost innumerous Revolutionary Clubs throughout the Duchy. While most nominally attempted to organize to beat back Monarchist sentiment, cooperation between the clubs has never been a guaranteed thing, and most were almost more eager to backstab each other than to take the fight to the monarchists. That sentiment seems to be changing today for the fractured clubs, however. One club in particular, the Meshorio Peasants, has been growing in strength lately. Where they are getting the additional support from, we cannot say, but their activity and recruitment has increased dramatically throughout the Duchy. Other clubs are either falling in line behind them or disappearing entirely, but one thing is absolutely certain: the clubs are growing in strength once more, and when the clubs begin to grow, Revolution is not far behind."
 aquileia.35.a:0 "The Clubs are getting bolder..."
 
 aquileia.36.t:0 "Raising Unrest"
 aquileia.36.d:0 "It's a sound in the night, a whisper in a coffee house, a figure darting down an alleyway. It's the barred windows, the tense atmosphere, the way that young griffon's eyes watch you walk down the street. A hen cries out in outrage over rising bread prices, and a pair of gendarmes drag her away. A gang of angry young griffons and griffonesses marches down the streets, waving signs condemning the King and championing the rights of the working class. Pridea no longer feels safe, and Baron Dennis Discret's rule is no longer secure. The winds of change have arrived: the Revolution is coming to Pridea once more."
 aquileia.36.a:0 "Not again!"
 
 aquileia.37.t:0 "A Murder Most Foul"
 aquileia.37.d:0 "For years, the loyal pony minorities throughout the Barony of Pridea have formed the backbone of Baron Dennis Discret's militant gendarmerie. They aided him in retaking the city during the first Revolution, and were amply rewarded with high postings throughout the new gendarmerie and his personal army. Today, however, that seems to have made the ponies a target of the Revolution. Dozens of pony gendarmes and low-ranking military officers were systematically targeted and murdered throughout the previous week, crippling our gendarmerie and sending our loyal ponies into a fearful frenzy. While this has raised support for the monarchy to an all-time high amongst the pony population, they remain still a minority, and for every new pony swearing themselves to protect the monarchy, five new griffons meet in secret to plot its downfall, throwing their traitorous weight behind the coming of a second revolution."
 aquileia.37.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 aquileia.38.t:0 "The Strike"
 aquileia.38.d:0 "The dockyards of Pridea are the pride of the Barony, and Pridea's naval thinkers are some of Aquileia's finest. Thus it was a great blow to the monarchy and Baron Dennis Discret's hold over the city when a massive strike broke out along the wharves, shutting down the dockyards. Hundreds of griffons gathered outside of the property, denying entry to any and all, and demanding better pay, better treatment, and better hours before they would return to work.

 aquileia.39.d:0 "Wagons full of gold bullion arrived today in Westkeep, having made a difficult and perilous journey across the Kingdom, managing to somehow skirt past the pockets of unrest and republican sentiment scattered throughout. Colonel Colette personally received the wagons outside of her keep, and after exchanging a few words with the soldiers guarding the wagons, gave them permission to enter the stronghold. The wagons presumably came from the crown, but no royal mark was present on the crates of bullion; perhaps that was to keep their journey secret, their contents unassuming. Instead, only a short letter accompanied the shipment. "Make good use of this in the coming struggle," it said. "We know where your loyalties lie." No names demarcated the parchment, and the only signature plainly listing off the sender as "Your Friends in Aquileia."\n\nCollete smiled as she put the letter away. Was was coming to the Kingdom once more, and there was no better place for a soldier than on the front lines."

 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrest, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."

 aquileia.42.d:0 "Notable journalist and novelist Émile Zolavi has recently died, in his old home on the Aquilan outskirts. His writing career has inspired a new trend in Aquileian culture, short-lived as it was, and his outspoken approach even convinced the government to loosing their grip on the society. His most notorious action, however, was a full scale condemnation of the ruling officials during the Pascal affair. His caustic, inflammatory accusation spared none, and he was quickly sued for libel. As a result, Zolavi escaped abroad to New Mareland, where he continued to defend his close friend Pascal. He was only recently permitted to return, but the stress of his prosecution has left him weary of life. The government of Aquileia has decided to name their newly formed literature prize after Zolavi, to honour his contribution to society."

 aquileia.43.d:0 "Voracious lover of life and dandy, Charles Beaklaire was well known in the artistic circles of Aquila for his rather divisive poetry. While a vocal minority considered his work to be a rejuvenation of art, far more considered them to be works of complete debauchery. The numerous lawsuits and charges of defiling public morals have not deterred Beaklaire from publishing more verses on themes of modernity, love and wine. Additionally, he has taken it personally to confront his critics, causing multiple public brawls. This has resulted in many griffons receiving serious injuries, as Beaklaire is overly fond of the bottle, and great damage to public property. Recently however, his brief stint in the prison has somewhat mellowed him out, yet his works continue to cause much controversy in the cafés of Aquila."

His absurdist approach towards life, which is widespread in his works, has attracted many griffons, weary of the constant wars raging across the world. He has recently finished his newest novel, titled L'Étranger (The Outsider), which follows Griffsault and his indifferent lifestyle. The critics praised the main character's disposition towards life, authority and religion, stating that these are the proper values for the uncertain times.

Teaching in a small rural town in the depths of Orvalillo had seemed like such a dreary prospect, but it seemed that was where his life had taken him. The state paid a decent salary, and after the recent unrest he found the countryside good for his nerves.\n\nIn the corner of his eye he saw how one of the local farmers, the father of young Lacroix if he wasn't mistaken, was lurking by the door, glancing inside and mouthing along with the lecture. Of course... even the adults around here were illiterate.\n\n"Good afternoon Monsieur Lacroix, are you here for your son?" he decided to ask, the farmgriff startling. Before he could say anything though, Monsieur Mésange continued. "We are not quite finished yet, but please, have a seat. Maybe you can assist me if the children get too rowdy," he said with a smile as he motioned to the back of the classroom to help the farmgriff save face. Somewhat hesitantly, Monsieur Lacroix stepped inside and sat down as Monsieur Mésange returned to the beginning. "Once again now mes élèves: A for Aquila, where Her Majesty lives...""

She hadn't at first been too sure about Monsieur Mésange, the city griffon had seemed so stuck-up and distant, and she couldn't understand why her son had to be away for so long to learn all these odd things. They needed him at the farm, after all.\n\nStill, Remy was happy, and he had taken to school like a fish to water. Maybe... she found herself dreaming as she stood by the stove... maybe this would really lead somewhere?\n\nRemy, meanwhile, was utterly absorbed in the book, reading about the strange and distant lands of "Equestria" and its supposedly immortal goddess-queen. Monsieur Mésange had let him borrow it on the condition that he'd perform a presentation on the book in front of the class, and Remy wasn't going to waste this chance. After all, Monsieur Mésange had told him that depending on how things went for him in school, any number of possibilities were open."

"See, Remy has been an exceptional student. He is dilligent and talented in equal measure, and I am convinced that he has the potential to succeed even in higher studies. Therefore," Monsieur Mésange said, smiling at Remy, "I would like to give you a recommendation so that you may go to the Lycée."\n\nRemy tried to say something and accept politely, but the news made his eyes well up and he didn't manage to do anything but to nod as tears of relief and happiness began to flow down his cheeks.

"We packed warm clothes, did we not? What of your shirt? Do you have your best one?" Remy couldn't help but blush a little but bore it silently as the train rolled into the station and they boarded. Finding a seat, Remy sat down as his father helped him to get the bags up on the shelves above them\n\n"Mom, I will be okay," Remy said, giving his mom a hug. In truth, he was scared himself. He had barely even left the town before, and that he'd now move all the way to Vanguardigo to attend school was still a dizzying prospect.\n\nAs his parents got off the train, they delayed outside, waving goodbye to him as the train began to slowly move again. Remy couldn't help but notice that his mother seemed to start crying again and swallowed to choke down his own tears.\n\nIt was frightening, but it was also exhilarating. For the first time, this farmchick from rural Orvalillo found he could dream. First the Lycée, then Université, then who knew where? The future was his now, and he wasn't going to waste it!"

Our noble pony subjects have twice been among the most fierce and brave protectors of this nation that any monarch could wish for. My father knew their strength and in the recent months, so have I come to know it. Where griffons marched in the streets, seeking to overthrow their rightful king, the ponies remained loyal nigh on to the last stallion.

Followed by second act where theatergoers were able to witness valiant stand of Aquileian soldiers against army of Grover I. during his conquest of Griffonia. One was really able to feel their patriotic zeal when defending the land and everyone living in there. In third act theatergoers could see rebellion of proud aquileian patriots led by their king against tyrannical rule of Grover II. which drew many parallels to rebellion of King Gerard Discret in 978 and restoring sovereignty of Aquileia. Casting of the play was excellent and except small technical mishap during the climax of second act this journalist can only praise execution and sheer dedication that went into this play. During the entire play theatergoers could freely enjoy food from banquet tables prepared for the occasion. After the play concluded, all those interested could stay for late night lecture where events showcased in play were fully explained in length."

From the outlines one could tell it was a griffon but not much else in this darkness. Figure stopped in front of small house on the outskirts of industrial area of the city. Figure knocked three times. After a while door opened and young male red feathered griffon peered through the crack. He immediately recognized newcomer and smiled. "Pierre, good to see you!" He said friendly and let newcomer-Pierre inside. "I am sorry for being late." Pierre said with apologetic expression. "There were too many policeponies today. I couldn't risk leading them here, Louis." He explained as he removed his cloak, revealing not much older griffon with light orange feathers. "Don't worry we haven't started yet." Louis smiled. Both griffons moved into the next room where rest of the group was already gathered. Room was filled with griffons of all ages and genders. Some old, some young barely beyond being little chicks. They were no army for sure. Some wearing scraps of clothing others being armed with simple outdated revolvers. Yet atmosphere in the room was tense. "You would have us follow FJA? After they run away?!" One of the griffons shouted. "You do not understand. We need to work with them if we are to succeed. Only cooperation can ensure our victory over monarchists." His opponent argued. "NO! FJA is merely Vérany's band of bootlickers. Vérany who run away when things got tough. Abandoned everyone just to save his skin!" Yet another griffon chimed in. "Please be reasonable, comrades. We cannot win without compromise." Griffon continued to argue for alliance with FJA. "They are not so bad. We'll be able to enact our policies and FJA can help us quickly capture hearts of the people and establish truly free democratic nation. You must see that they are right." "Better coward than pony."

Revolution may have failed before, because intervention of treacherous maréchal Berthelot. Vérany and his lackeys fled and abandoned us, left us to suffer under tyranny of another King, but today we stand here with second chance. It is so close that one could grasp it in their claws! Yes, we will prevail!" Crowd noded, some clapped in agreement. "We now know that it is not enough to free just griffons of Aquileia. There are many others suffering under reactionary yoke! We will not stop until everygriff on the continent is free!" He continued. "Free to decide their own life. We don't need any fancy Kings, Princesses or Presidents to tell us what to do.

Everygriff of Aquileia needs to be ready to die for the cause of freedom and our nation because I can guarantee, the forces of bankers, shadowy oligarchs and nobles of the Empire are already scheming in unison with the King and his lackeys how to crush us into the ground.

It became clear that if revolution in Pridea is to succeed FJA needs to bring all revolutionary elements within the city on board. Preparations for meeting between FJA party representative and Pridean communards were under way. Meeting had to be rescheduled and moved to different location several times to different location, for fear of being discovered by police authorities. It needs no mention that might spell disaster for the revolution as a whole. At last one night members of all sides met in a forest within territory of Duchy of Vinovia.

It took all of her will and oration to bring them together to agree on any amount of points. Points that just happen to be exactly against the MPA.\n\nBut now she must make a choice. Even with the wide base established, who shall take the lead in her group?

Do you remember the blood that flowed down the streets? No more! It cannot happen again!"\n\nCheers went up from the assembled crowd, and Gerald allowed himself a little smile. Aging as he was, he was still the leader of the MPA's monarchist bloc, and one of the party's most influential members as a whole. "The real threat lies in the communists that the Revolution harbors. They have dangerous ideas that will see this nation burn even moreso than those who merely cry out for freedom, whatever mockery they attribute to that word! They must be stopped!"\n\nAgain, cheering roared to meet him, but then he saw several griffons slipping out the doors in disgust. "Fools," he muttered to himself. He'd have his loyal enforcers find out who had left early, and make them sorry for it. "I have with me a list of communist sympathizers in Westkeep, gathered by my talons in the dark. We shall start with them and rid Aquileia of the communist menace once and for all! Who is with me?!"\n\nGriffons stood up and raised their voices, ready to join the march.

Once loyal griffons are turning their backs on the monarchy, and the tricolour is being raised in more places, and more openly as well. The Colonel has sent her soldiers to round up republicans and make arrests, but with the situation spiraling out of control as it is, it seems like a lost cause. To make matters worse, a recent meeting between the Colonel and nobles from the capital has made it clear that this increased recruitment has been going on throughout the Kingdom for some time, and it was only a matter of time before it made its way to Westkeep as well. Unfortunately, that information is now useless to us, considering the revolutionary cells have already taken root throughout Westkeep, and we have missed the opportunity to nip this problem in the bud."

The Harmonists of the Front des Jeunes Aquileia - the FJA - have begun holding rallies in the streets of Vinovia, arquing that the Kingdom should reform to become a true democracy, a place where every griffon has a say in how the nation runs. While such ideas are certainly laughable and short-sighted, doomed to failure, the sizes of the crowds the FJA is beginning to attract are certainly worrying.

Normally, that would have been no cause for alarm - the mobs had always been poorly equipped - but today was different. Today, the mob brandished rifles of their own, clean and modern, obviously fresh out of a factory from somewhere. Where that somewhere was, Adeline had no idea. Of course, that didn't matter now. What mattered is that she was on the opposite end of a larger block of armed griffons, and with the company blocking the street from sidewalk to sidewalk, the mob couldn't possibly miss if they decided to open fire.\n\n"Think if we ask nicely they'll go away?" Remy asked from her side, his usually snarky jokes shaken with worry. "They could all fire their guns at once and not hit the side of a barn. It's not like they're trained, right?"\n\nBut Adeline knew better. Many of these griffons were older. Many probably fought in the previous Revolution. Many probably knew how to use the weapons they held. And when the mob started pointing their weapons at the gendarmes, her heart jumped into her throat.\n\n"Fire! Shoot them, damn it!" her sergeant shouted. Discipline moved her talon for her, training forcing her to follow the suicidal command, and Adeline squeezed her eyes shut in terror as she fired her rifle.\n\nThe mob's rebuttal ripped through the gendarmes with a terrifying thunder, and Adeline opened her eyes just in time to see a bullet drill right between them."

Now, with Election Day drawing ever nearer, Grand Cru has promised to continue the work he performed during the Revolution, by expanding his party and bringing regional representation to all the far-flung corners of Aquileia. He even seeks to continue providing homes for families displaced by the war, a move sure to see him attain easy gains at the ballot box. Grand Cru presents an excellent look for the socialists, and is sure to draw the votes of countless griffons throughout Aquileia.

As chaos quickly engulfed the nation and the duchy, Cécile returned to her homeland of Vinovia from exile and took command of the revolutionary cells operating there, urging for the valiant soldiers of the Republic to only fight those that still openly supported the monarchy. Her messages of harmony amongst even enemies had a remarkable affect in the fighting, and Vinovia saw some of the least partisan bloodshed and extrajudicial killing in the entire Republic. Now Cécile, whom the revolutionaries of Vinovia call their rose, has come to Aquila to champion the peaceful reconstruction of the nation. In the power vacuum left by Vérany's departure, she has become the obvious successor as leader of the FJA, having clashed with Vérany on the same issues that caused the party split in their long history. Cécile intends to breathe new life into the party by championing it's founding tenets of the harmony and social democracy. She seeks to foster cooperation between the different parties in Aquileia, not competition, and is committed to restructuring Aquileia's tax code and bringing the nation into the modern era with electrification for the countryside and modernized labor laws.

Centering around nationalism and Aquileian unity, the Ultranationalist Maréchal has unified griffons far and wide who fear the influence of the nations surrounding our great Republic and are looking for a strong leader to keep them safe. He champions the promotion of Aquileian culture and the expansion of our urban centers, as well as getting the former nobility to fall in line and provide some of their wealth to the Republic through generous pardons. Though the loyalties of the MPA throughout the revolutions are certainly suspect, it is quite clear that they are too large of a force with too much influence to simply label as traitors and be done with it.

 aquileia.116.d:0 ""You misunderstand me," Madame Hirondelle interrupted Remy. She had come by his house out of the blue, saying she wanted to talk about his performance at school. It all had left him scared, and the only ones more nervous than Remy at the moment seemed to be his parents, who were almost falling over themselves to be good hosts. "I am not asking what you feel is expected of you," she told him gently, "I am asking you what you want to do when you grow up. What is your heart's desire?"\n\n"I..." Remy was floored. The idea that he could choose what he wanted to do in life was hard for him to grasp. He had never thought of it, and in the end he had to lower his head in shame. "I am sorry Madame, I don't know." Madame Hirondelle smiled kindly at the answer though.\n\n"The important thing is this Remy; you can choose," she told him. "You are a studious and intelligent young griff, and I am sincerely convinced that you can go anywhere that your heart desires to. Wherever you want to go, I will help you get there."\n\n"Can... can I have a week to think?" Remy asked, Madame Hirondelle nodding."

Sitting in her living room, he rocked slowly back and forth on the chair as he tried to decide how to say it.\n\n"I read the newspaper you lent me Madame," he began, stumbling a little over his words. "I read about the parliament, and think I realized what I want to do. I... I want to become a politician. I want to learn how the laws work, and make them better for everyone. If I live here I can help my neighbors, but in parliament I can help everyone in the country."\n\n"President Lacroix..." Madame Hirondelle mused, nodding to herself and making Remy almost fall off the chair at the thought. "That will be a very hard road to walk," she cautioned him, "You will need top grades from a fine Université, as well as both experience and contacts." Remy nodded at her explanation, listening attentively. "The first step will be Lycée," she continued. "And you will need to be active in the political clubs as well. Use that time to decide where you want to go next; law will be a good choice at Université. When you are there, you will know better than I what to do." She smiled widely at him. "I'll start writing a recommendation for you right away. You'll have it tomorrow. Now go home and tell your parents where they will see you in thirty years."\n\n"Thank you Madame!" Remy exclaimed, almost leaping off his chair to head home. "Good bye Madame!" As he walked home, he thought of what she had said. He adjusted his bag, letting the strap hang diagonally over his chest like the presidental sash as he looked at it. The thought made him almost tip-tap with glee as he hurried home to tell his parents."

Newspapers from all over the nation are holding this as a sign that the Republic is here to stay this time, and all the major political parties of Aquileia have voiced their support for the President's latest act.

The Aquileians demand that we cede all lands which formerly belonged to the County of Tarrin before the revolution. If we do not accept this demand, they will not hesitate to use force to reclaim their rightful territory.\n\nAquileia has grown much stronger and more centralized in recent years, so we only have a chance to survive by relying on our allies. However, the Tarrinian region has proven to be quite difficult to administer, and it might be better to simply give in to their ultimatum.

Attendees can freely call to drink for various causes, in honor of certain persons, the values of Aquileia and of course to our good king.\n\nThis year, a local merchant of note seemed to have too much to drink. After a gentlegriff offered to drink to king Moriset's wisdom and the bright future of Aquileia, the merchant suddenly sprang up, causing glasses and bottles to spill on the table. He grasped his glass in his claw and started to rant nonsensically about the king's policies. He ended his speech by raising his glass to the king's head and how it should be separated from his shoulders, causing gasps and angry yells.

As Béroux remains a bastion of republicanism despite repression, with many republicans attending the gathering but so far, they have been forced to remain closeted. Few even knew that other like minded griffs attended.\n\nTradition commands that the dinner is rhythmed by various toasts. Attendees can freely call to drink for various causes, in honor of certain person but also on political topics. While the evening started with several toasts to the king's good health and various local causes, a slight change occurred later on. A local noble known for being critical of the king raised his glass to the needed reforms of Aquileia. While tipsy attendees cheered and drank, many republicans saw it as a hint.\n\nAs the evening went on, republican attendees started subverting the event. Toasts were raised to liberty, equality and fraternity. As nogriff seemed to react badly or truly realize, republicans asserted themselves, raising their glasses to universal suffrage and even more surprisingly the betterment of workers' conditions and rights. With each cheer, republicans recognized each other. The toasts ended without incidents and as people began to mingle again, the Béroux republican elites met and discovered that the fire of revolution hadn't been snuffed out in their city."

These names include the famous Chateau-Béroux, Côtes-de-Vyzima, Cuvée-du-Roy, Cru-de-Westkeep or Rilac.

While some applauded the second part, it has proven to be a disaster for our farmers and the many vineyard owners. Some called the APA system a draconian measure. However, Jean Capus who has lead the movement in favor of it painted a dire picture of our wine production. He has talked about fine Aquileian wine being mixed with poorer wines mass produced in Wingbardy, New Mareland or Talouse and sold as Aquileian or poor wine spiked with chemicals and alcohol. All products which would only serve to tarnish real Aqullian vintage.\n\nSome foreign wine traders have strongly protested against the measure, calling it discriminatory and arbitrary, and communists have attacked the APA as a bourgeois construct designed to protect noble-owned vineyards at the expense of the average griffs."

While some expected the book to be censored and Fauxvelles arrested, the book was surprisingly widely released and much to the Republicans dismay, it became soon clear why.\n\nThe book - A Spring Flower - depicts the grueling journey of a young idealist republican who left his home in a peaceful Vinovian village to go fight for Kemerskai and the Griffonian Revolution. The tone of the book becomes then increasingly somber as the young hero sees the crushing of the revolution at the claws of the monarchist armies, the long march to the cold duchy of Cloudbury, the cruel way the monarchists were persecuted there and the decay of the republic into a warlord state. The hero then turns to communism, blaming capitalism for Kemerskai's failures and flees to Skynavia where he hopes to see a truer form of democracy flourish. Sadly for him, he only discovers famine and the bickering between ideological groups. Finally, he concludes that republicanism in all its forms is a "spring flower", beautiful in many ways but incapable of lasting. The book ends with the hero sailing back to his native Vinovia, contemplating all the pain he caused by his naivety.\n\nWhile some republicans called Fauxvelles a traitor, other tried to claim that the book was apocryphal and that he was forced. But Fauxvelles was knighted for his writing and held numerous speech to apologize for his errors and to denounce republicanism or even moderate constraints to royal power. Despite the controversy, many republicans conceded sadly that Fauxvelles remained a wonderful writer and that the book would stand the test of time as a major piece of Aquileian literature."

Sadly, he has declined many invitations to join other of our great thinkers in Aquila. Instead, he has left to his home near Vinovia.\n\nSome journalists and friends travelled to the old Fauxvelles farm and asked about him.

The news has come as a shock to many in Vyzima as the Corporation was one of its oldest institution and a shining beacon of its culture. The guild used to assemble both workers and owners of the glass industry in a spirit of craftgriffs solidarity, a throwback to an era where ideas of class and social questions were unheard of.\n\nSome in Vyzima say the breakup was long overdue as the glass industry owners were becoming more and more powerful within it. The traditional solidarity and craftgriffship culture were withering under the strain caused by mechanization after the revolution. The writings of Caramel Marks also left their mark. For years now, glassmakers were increasingly identifying as proletarian workers whose interests were fundamentally at odds with the wealthier guild members.\n\nFor a time, guild members attempted to soften the divide by making deals to improve working conditions. Unfortunately for them, the ideological radicalization of the time gradually degraded the willingness to make such piecemeal contracts. Both workers refused to adhere to the system and glassworks owners ceased to rely on the apprenticeship system and started to use wage labor under contract outside of the guild system. The remaining members saw the writing on the wall and voted to disband, the first vote to pass the guild assembly in two years."

Refusing to negotiate, he has aggressively recruited Severyanian pony refugees to replace the strikers. He also employed the service of a Severyanian paramilitary group composed of former soldiers and policemen who fought the Stalliongrad Revolution.

Sabotage attempts in the fabrique caused evermore damages and the bars owned by Desvases became target of arsonists.\n\nYesterday, it all came to a head when a team of strikers stormed Charles Desvases' mansion on the outskirts of town. Armed with smuggled guns, they massacred the ponies protecting Desvases and took him hostage. In a moment of lucidity, the strikers allowed Desvases' family to flee the scene, claiming they were only interested in forcing Desvases to finally agreeing to a fair deal. The police was alerted and quickly surrounded the mansion. Negotiations fell apart as the police unit was lead by a political friend of Desvases whose emotions and anticommunist opinions got the better of him. Shots were fired and the police stormed the building. It is unclear what happened. The chaotic scene left the strikers, the Severyanian ponyguards, several servants accused of helping the hostage makers, five policegriffs and Desvases himself dead.\n\nThe bloodbath caused the strike to fall apart after strikers split between supporters and opponents of the attack.

And yet, she seemed so peaceful when working.\n\nSugar Crepe coughed once, letting Cécile notice her presence.\n\nCécile looked up, her eyes meeting Sugar Crepe's. "Oh! Just who I was waiting for!" She said, signing the last note, putting the rest off to the side.\n\n"Hm?" Sugar wondered.\n\nCécile folded her claws, and leaned back in her chair. "As you may know, my term is coming to an end soon, and...well, I am thinking of retiring."\n\n"But retire? When everything is just getting started?"

Back in his day, they had worked 80 hours a week without complaining, and these little chicks had demanded 40! And where would they go now? Off to watch a movie? Or go to the theatre like some fat, spoiled nobles? Or just sit home lazing around, playing with their kids.\n\nSure, he hadn't liked the Discrets, but things right now were just too good to be true. Soon the crash would come and it all would end. He had seen the kind of money they gave even a common labourer like he once was. Where was that money meant to come from? Were they just making new money on the spot? That couldn't be good. And all this schooling nonsense! Griffs like him worked with their claws and their backs, they didn't need to learn about fancy mathematics or what pony princesses across the sea were named. It'd leave them all fat, spoiled, distracted and lazy, and then what was going to happen?!\n\n"Are you doing well, Monsieur Bouhier?" Jean-Luc looked up as he heard the voice of Eulalie, one of the nurses. He grunted. "Hrhm, young people today... you really have it too good, mark my words."\n\n"We really do," Eulalie responded with a patient smile.

For any other occasion, it would have been the perfect weather to simply relax, take in the sights of the city, and perhaps have lunch with friends at a cafe. Unfortunately the President had no time for such trivialities today, as her visit was purely business. To ensure the continued peace of both Aquileia and the Herzland, she was meeting today with the new Archon of Boreas, Astraeus I, to finally come to a concordat between the Archonates and Aquileia itself.\n\nTen minutes later, she found herself sitting in a chair, on the opposite side of a table from the Archon. "I'm glad that you were able to join me today," Astraeus said, still dressed in his priestly robes. "Many of my colleagues were concerned about the future of the Three Temples."\n\n"Yes, well the Aquileian government and I decided it was best that we come to an agreement on things," Crepe responded, trying to project her usual confidence and certainty. She was knowledgeable about many things, but religion was not one of them.\n\n"I have already examined the proposed concordat you sent, and after much consideration I have found it acceptable. Unlike my predecessor, I believe it is time for the temples to retreat from their role in politics and international affairs."\n\nSugar Crepe couldn't help but let out a quiet scoff. "As it should be," she quietly muttered.\n\nThe Archon raised an eyebrow. "Tell me, Miss President, what do you know for certain about what happens when a griffon dies? Or about how the world was created? What about how the sun rises and sets each day?" When she was silent, struggling to find the words to respond, he continued, "Religion is not just finding answers to these questions. It is also a source of unity for any griffon, something that both you and I could be together in despite our many other differences. I, for example, sense in you the fiery spirit of Arcturius, despite how you may object. We seek to help creatures find their place in this world, and that is why we expect you to allow our independence in that, just as we will allow yours in politics."\n\nThe unicorn mare found herself nodding along, still at a loss to formulate a response.

It had been nigh endless, but in the end, as he poured over his compilation of it, he realized something that made his breath hitch.\n\nGoing back fifty years, to before the first revolution, the average lifespan had been low enough that he himself likely would have passed before then. Barely half of the population had even been literate, most of them engaged in sustenance farming. A name here of a sixteen year old girl already married with three children to someone more than twice her age. Row after row of names lost in childbirth or before their fifth birthday, whether to disease or starvation. So many names had only existed as tax record notes, nothing more. Generations upon generations reduced to merely an income or source of soldiers.\n\nHis eyes went over to last year's records and he found himself covering his beak with his claw. Not a single name without a record of where they went to school. Many of them were noted as having pursued secondary education as well, with geography being a minimal factor in it. Child mortality in the last years was below three percent and shrinking steadily, maternal mortality following a similar pattern. And as for expected lifespan, it had shot upwards thanks to nutrition, healthcare and senior welfare equally. Slowly rising up, he shuffled out into the open plan office beyond it where his ten subordinates were all hard at work."\n\n"Everygriff," he called out to get their attention. "I would like for you all to quit early today. All I'm asking is that you take your family to a café, or something else. We live in good times, please, let us go home to enjoy it." As his subordinates thanked him and began to depart, he got his coat and hat as well, locking the door to his office. He should get flowers for his wife, maybe go out for a movie. After all why shouldn't he? Without even realizing it, their homeland had become the shining star they only could have dreamed of in their youths. They probably wouldn't dedicate a day to celebrating it, but he could, and he would." #Conclusion Event - Player should get a nice event describing just how great of a place to live in they've made

 aquileia.192.d:0 "Swiftly it came, unbidden, like a silent hunter, but in the years to come many would see how the signs pointed to this moment. In the late afternoon, and without warning, the socialist paramilitaries struck, raiding the party headquarters' of the MPA and of the PnDA and arresting several party officials. In the evening, President [ROOT.GetLeader] went on the radio to declare a state of emergency, citing the infiltration of anti-revolutionary elements into the rightist opposition, and assuring the citizens of Aquileia that the state was enacting temporary security measures for their safety. One of these measures was the suspension of the National Assembly, which was supposedly under particular threat, but not to worry: the executive would continue to make the necessary policies in its stead. The first order, of course, was the dissolution of the MPA and of the PnDA, who were deemed too compromised by enemies of the people.\n\nThose outside of the PAT saw it for what it was: a naked grab for power and a clear precursor to autocracy. Within hours of the announcement, protests erupted on the streets. The largest protest, in Aquila, was led by Théodore Verany himself, who stood before the crowd denouncing [ROOT.GetLeader] as a tyrant and a traitor to the republic. His long speech on the evils of communism was interrupted by police and red militia, who dispersed the crowd by driving their riot vehicles into it. Maréchal Rodier was more circumspect, making his own radio announcement insulting [ROOT.GetLeader] (he was a "theory-addled pillock", among other colorful phrases) and vowing resistance before disappearing from public view. Whispers quickly arose of dissension and edition within the ranks of the armed forces, prompting the executive to shuffle problematic members to less important posts. Meanwhile, Cécile Gaudreau, whose FJA was the only other remaining legal party, made a statement of protest, wildly published by a sympathetic press, but she quickly found herself disempowered when much of the FJA's left joined the socialists instead.\n\nAs the dust settled, the ruling socialists found the Aquileian state in great disarray. Aquileians across the country had endured the shock of betrayal by their seemingly mild-mannered President, and with the police thoroughly reduced by the purges, social life died down as a pall of fear descended upon the nation." #The Third Step of the Revolution - Grand Cru essentially kicks the MPA and the PnDA out of the Assemble and rules by decree...

Their weapons were not rifles or bombs but pamphlets, posters, and prodigious zeal. With the aid of local workers' councils they set to work, posting on walls and lampposts messages extolling the common griffon and the glorious future of the republic. They sought out the clubs and dens where monarchists and other reactionaries huddled in refuge and infiltrated those establishments, which quite suddenly found themselves under pressure from the pro-republic press and under scrutiny from local municipal authorities. Many of them pre-emptively closed shop, or enacted 'policy changes' that kept political activity to a minimum. Outside, of there, there was a lot of political activity, and much of it was in favour of the socialists.\n\nSuch operations continued and developed, in the light and in the dark. Politically unreliable griffons had sordid details of their pasts unearthed in public, shaming them into silence and isolation. Letters to newspapers reminded all of the crimes of the old regime. Rallies and marches aroused anger at the recalcitrant skeptics of the republic and directed scorn at the symbols of old. The operatives were happy to oblige such sentiments: statues were torn down, reliefs were chiselled away, and the symbols of the crown were replaced with those more representative of republican ideals. Workers and peasants, not generals and aristocrats, were the proper focus of praise and honor, and every little detail of Herzlander daily life was subtly, carefully altered to reflect the new ideals, the true ideology." #Aquileia Political Assistance

To the outside world, there was only a bastion of steel and stone, a once-decrepit symbol of the old regime purified into a bulwark of true peoples' government.\n\nInside the palace, there was energy and force. Hundreds of delegates from all across Aquileia had gathered, and in the spirit of camaraderie they spoke with fiery spirit about the great affairs of state. They discussed most fiercely the greatest matter approaching them, the impending departure of President Grand Cru and his possible replacement. The Big Fellow himself brought the assembly towards its end, summoning the delegates to the main hall to begin the proceedings. In his opening speech (indeed, his speech of farewell), he encouraged his comrades to keep the spirit of revolution alive, and to let the writings of the socialist canon be their lodestar into a wonderful future of freedom and equality.\n\nThere were two candidates whose names had been bandied about. Thibault Devereux was known to be Cru's close associate, or even his protegé, a staunch defender of orthodoxy and of the power of the worker's councils. His election would signal continuity and development, a gradual but inexorable change of the state into a true proletarian republic.\n\nOn the other claw, there was Victor Allard. A young, brash, and obdurate rabble-rouser, Allard was the true radical, a proponent of a strong state that would guide the revolution on behalf of the masses. Representatives, empowered by the people, would speak for the nation, a doctrine he termed "Democratic Vanguardism". Already, he had attracted his fair share of detractors, though others carefully suggested that his deviation from tradition was necessary in the face of imperialist threats across the world.\n\nUltimately, the choice would be Grand Cru's." #Cru Steps Down and chooses his successor

Pridea, Rila, Vinovia, and Westkeep: these were no longer just geographical expressions, put into abeyance by the end of the monarchy, but came back into being as real entities, as true places within a federalized republic. Already, the provincial parlements had begun operations, and already they began to express concern over the Assembly's latest act, over the President's expanded power. The bothersome FJA had even taken many seats in their first elections.\n\nAllard knew all of this, and the building opposition to his methods was at the forefront of his mind as he read through the very first of his Directives, the draft of which had arrived at his desk less than an hour after the passage of the Act. He took a deep breath, filled with a mixture of giddy excitement and tremorous anxiety. The great power at his disposal, he knew, would allow him to do great things for Aquileia, but it could also bring him to ruin. With his psyche stretched twofold by these conflicting possibilities, he took hold of his new authority and, with imperious daring, he signed the Directive."

 aquileia.206.d:0 "The Front des Jeunes d'Aquilée could not tolerate another inch. They had given this griffon too much, and they must be taken back at all costs. The very idea that the assembly should not be involved in every aspect of the government, even in times of crisis, was absurd! The very notion must be overturned, and that one swing vote must be flipped to annul this amendment to the new constitution.\n\nThey gathered together in the Assemblée Nationale. The hall once used by the nobles and clergy to oppress the masses would not be used to sanction a new kind of oppression. Cécile Gaudreau and Théodore Verany stood at the podium together. They hesitantly took each other's talon, not out of love but to show solidarity in their decision. It was Cécile who spoke first. "Today, we must declare that Victor Allard does not represent this assembly nor the wishes of the people of Aquileia any longer!"\n\nIt was Théodore's turn to say something, to denounce the unholy alliance of Harmonist values with Socialism, to stop a new tyrant from rising. At least, that is how they viewed it. He cleared his throat and gripped Cécile's talon - she was his friend and opponent all at once - for strength. "Yes, Victor Allard is not only a new tyrant, he is a traitor to the revolution we fought, bled, and died for! I did not get this scar upon my face only to see a new form of tyranny rule the Aquileian people. I would rather die before I allow a king, emperor, or any kind of autocrat to set up a new throne in our noble and purified city. I call upon this place, upon this gathering, the Assemblée Nationale, to take a stand! Here and now, Aquileian blood must be wagered to defend our freedom. Stand against the new tyrant! Down with Victor Allard! Down with Allardism! Down with Federalism!"\n\nCécile gripped Théodore's talon back, and the two exchanged a smile with a very long look into their eyes. A spark seemed to go between them, but not now; perhaps in another life or another time. Still, the thought that politics could bring together a pair of star-crossed griffs was interesting."

Whispers of an iron fist beneath his velvet glove, of hidden oligarchs beholden to him, polluted the air, but he knew that what he had to say might make all of that dissipate once and for all.\n\nSomeone had placed a cigar upon the podium. He smiled; it was his favourite brand, made in Fezera. Was it a gift from one of the delegates, or a poisoned trap planted by a reactionary spy? He resolved to proceed with his speech first of all. Perhaps his would-be assassin might have second thoughts once he had finished.\n\n"My fellow Aquileians," he began, "there have been rumours concerning me, that my programs have been a distraction for the consolidation of my power. I think they have confused me for my competitor." Laughter erupted throughout the room, and Thibault let it simmer down before he continued. "Still, I understand these concerns, because I have not been forthcoming about my plans. Let me tell you this, then: I plan to strengthen this Assembly, to grant it plenipotentiary power. I plan, you see, to dissolve the executive branch of this government." A hushed silence followed as Thibault brought his speech to its climax. "No longer will Aquileia labor under the rule of a strong-creature. The state will, now and forever, be a servant of the people, for the people, and by the people!"\n\nThe applause was deafening, and to rousing cheers Thibault descended the podium for the last time as President. The work began at once, with staff being moved, political officers re-directing their reports to the Assembly, and the TUCO creating new committees to oversee the affairs of state. As Thibault sat in his office, thinking of his imminent return to private citizenry, he lit his cigar and placed it in his mouth, letting the sweet smoke fill his nostrils.

Ponies and griffons were still milling around not far from the palace in the city, even as the palace had gone silent. Mostly silent. The lone exception a single griffon wandering the corridors of her personal apartments.\n\nIt had been several long years. From ascending the throne, to then uniting the Périphérie. It felt like millennia ago to her. So many victories, and they were only the first of many. Overseeing the old Kingdom rising from the ashes of the failed revolution to then becoming the envy of the world. Being crowned Queen Regnant of Aquileia, and then later, Empress.\n\nShe looked out of the palatial windows, noticing the park, and, in the distance, the city of Aquila. It had grown by a long shot since she had entered the world, boasting of monuments and boulevards. She had overseen those as well as possible, even as the conquest of the Empire had taken over more and more of her time.\n\nA row of portraits. Woe to the vanquished. She passed one portrait, and looked up at the griffon portrayed on oil and canvas. Crown on his head, Idol of Boreas in one claw and sword in the other. She scoffed. Grover I. He left his work unfinished. Another portrait, just to the left of the first Emperor. Grover II, in full armor and armed. At this she too scoffed. She waged war for a reason, not for petty revenge. And his conquest of Aquileia barely lasted a century.\n\nShe pondered what they were thinking now. Did they think that she was greater than them? Or did they curse her for destroying their bloodline? She parked the train of thought as she passed their successors. A griffon surrounded by paper and with a scepter. At that, she scoffed again. His 'stable' empire couldn't even survive his two successors. And then the fourth Emperor. At that, she scoffed once more. She was decisive, and he was weak and unable to come to a conclusion.\n\nShe didn't even bother looking at the last two. The less said of them and their ministers, the better."

As it stands, currently with Aquileia in control of Griffenheim they would be the dominant force in such a unification, with ourselves being relegated to a more regional authority.\n\nOf course, there is always another option available to us. Instead of joining them like the proposed terms, we could put up our own deal involving the primacy of our own regime over theirs.

While his family had lived among the Diamond Dogs for generations, and were fierce Imperial loyalists, nothing could compare to the fervor these dogs had for their Emperor. The idea of living under a republic was so foreign to them, it was hard to forget the Emperor. But now, he was out of power, and all the citizens of Bronzehill had to make do with the new order, and for Ludwig, that means taking advantage of the situation he was in. His father Erhard was a frugal griffon, and after the republicans took over, he showed his son a secret savings stash he kept in the house. So when the government announced their new "Mittelstand" program, his family decided to go all-in with what they could.

Some have doubted the sincerity of this pledge, but it is hard to find any fault in Grand Cru's decisive handling of the crisis.

He convinced me that though the empire was rotten, it had created the seed for an unity for all of griffonkind, no matter the small details that divided us. Yet, I had barely had time to begin championing these ideals before Madame Gaudreau made sure to temper them and tirelessly argue with me that I could not so lightly dismiss griffonkind's desire to be ruled not by a distant authority figure, but by representatives closer to them in culture and traditions.\n\nFrom Monsieur Cru I learned to take the concerns of even the least among us seriously. From Monsieur Rodier, I learned to find pride and strength in my Aquileian heritage." Turning to look to the griffoness who sat by his side, he smiled. "And from my dear wife Sylvaine, I learned patience, to look at things more deeply, and that raising a family demands not just willingness to help, but to actively engage in the labours it entails." He took her claw in his, squeezing it lightly before looking up to everygriff else.\n\n"And from all of you, I learned that when the people stand together, there is nothing they cannot accomplish." He raised his glass to them all. "For all the invaluable lessons you taught not just me, but each other, and which has shaped the republic that we have all built... thank you.""  #Verany looking over his achivements, literally just an epilouge event for after you've conquered Griffonia

The wide boulevards, once mere tools of state power, have been given new purpose as thoroughfares of commerce. The engines of the economy, whether in the offices or in the factories, have been linked together by broad avenues, and new telephone and electric lines have been built to empower their wealth-creation. Zoning laws have been revised to permit new forms of commercial activity, with small businesses sharing lots with apartments above them. Spaces once reserved for statues of the Discrets have been reassigned, instead, to show statues of common folk, now just of revolutionaries but of artists and writers and great thinkers.\n\nAs the city hums with renewed energy from wealth flowing through lubricated channels, the state has established its own presence at the very centre. The old palaces have been refurbished, finding new life as offices for the Republic. New such offices have been built: smaller, less grandiose, but admirable in their simplicity, a new kind of "palace" for a different kind of government. These dot the city at strategic intervals, often interspersing with the commercial zones, but they do not seek to impose with their humbler frames. Rather, they are partners with their private counterparts, a silent declaration of the prosperous collaboration of market and state." #Verany's Aquila

War might be cruelty, but to waver was the greatest of all cruelties, since the pain inflicted would strike your own people. You had to take a stand, and you had to do it thoroughly, it was none of your business to protect a people who sent their griffs, their guns, their tanks and planes and all that was of any account to war against you. When your enemy came to do you harm, you let them reap the consequences. Your duty was to end the fighting by whatever means necessary, and to ensure that when peace came, it'd be a lasting one, destroy their willingness to fight, tear down their banners and do away with their symbols: you could not leave anything to chance.\n\nThe Herzland griffons prided themselves on being the champions of the empire and the ones who had fought for the Grovers from the very beginning. There was no reason to think they would not do so to the bitter end. The Empire and the Grovers were one and the same in the mind of so many, and ever since the last emperor's death, [GRI.GetLeader] had exploited the young Emperor well, propping him up as a symbol to fight for. It was a clever move, not least because defending children was something primal to everycreature.\n\nSwirling the liquor around in his glass, Rodier stared out into the air as he mused on the order he had given. War was cruelty. It had to be. Hesitation took more lives than you could imagine, and for the sake of peace, you had to do what needed to be done. A carefully picked team, a nighttime raid, a silenced pistol and a deep grave far into the woods. With the last Grover mysteriously vanished, the zeal would go out of the Herzlanders and a lasting peace could come faster. As for him, he'd do what a soldier was meant to. He would shoulder the guilt and carry it to the grave; let it die with him, only then the matter would be settled and there could be peace."

I don't know how to be somebody else, and I am scared of what I will become.\n\nI was always taught that as Emperor, I would be the most responsible of all griffs in the Empire, and that I would form the empire through my actions and my personality. That was what made the empire what it was. Under Grover I and II it was strong and conquered most of Griffonia to show how the Empire alone could bring peace and unity. Under Grover III and IV it was working to maintain that promise. Now that you are going to choose leaders every few years, how can Griffonia become anything but a confused mess?\n\nMaybe there is no point in me writing this, but I want to ask you to not step down when your time ends. You are strong, and you created peace through that strength. Whatever you have done to me, at least you are the kind of griff that can make sure that peace sticks.

Thankfully, the last Grover was still an impressionable child, and with the right upbringing, he'd not be a threat to her rule.\n\nThe name change for the realm was a simple matter: Groverwald. It sounded rural, almost quaint. It was not a name that inspired respect. Baron Grover of Groverwald would obviously need to stay at his estate under heavy guard, as these were dangerous times. That would mean he could not build the kind of contacts among the nobility that would make him dangerous.

The book has been a massive success and caught the attention of the Palace.\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to the prestige of Aquileia, her Majesty Vivienne knighted Gustave, granting him the title of Count of Bon Appétit. She tasked him with opening a royal school of cooking which would further entrench the Aquileian tradition of fine dining in all the grandeur and expertise required.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, Count Gustave was tasked with organizing a grand feast for her Majesty Vivienne. To demonstrate his ability as a chef and to thank his benefactor, Count Gustave set out to make a special dessert fit for an empress.

After a full-course dinner served with the finest wines, breads and cheeses showcasing all regions of Aquileia came the time of the dessert.

Tomorrow, the crowds would sing revolutionary songs, write slogans on the walls and spit behind nobles and guards. And his advisors would come back to the palace to badger him about beating them back into obedience.\n\nHe was tired. His conscience was weighing increasingly heavy on his shoulders. The truth was plain and simple and yet it pained him to discover himself so foolish. He had always been at odds with his family. The Discret dynasty had always been so... Backward looking. they had no ideas as to what the world should become. They only saw tradition and Aquileia as their personal property. There was no place for popular consent, greater ideals of statecraft or even a conception of life being more than obedient labour. Those ideas, any understanding of the great truths of the world really, were held not by them but by the likes of Kemerskai or Vérany. Michel always saw the republic as an experiment that had been worth trying, even if it cost to his family. His birth didn't leave him much choice in life but it gave him some power. His power had been the sword of ducal power. Yet, he tried to subvert it, transforming it into a tool to carve something new. If he had bore any other name than Discret, he would have been executed for treason already but the family let him indulge in hosting philosophers and artists if the bastilles would operate and if Rila was stable. Not enough, he thought. And he indulged more, helping the republicans to bring about\n\nAnd what now? The bastilles were ashes and Rila was clamoring for revolution. All because he followed his ideals, blind to the fact that his friends, those reasonable partisans of compromise, reform and freedom in either a monarchy or a peacefully installed republic, were drowned in the cries of blood. All because of these "enragés", the rabid members of this Cocardiers club. It was them who resonated with the people, who spoke to their lower instincts.

These prisoners were gathered in a few fortresses that would serve as fortified prison: the bastilles. As time went on, they become the living symbol of the royal oppression in Rila, standing high as a perpetual reminder of where lovers of liberty would go to die in darkness if caught.\n\nThe Committee, united in this at least, sought to put an end to theses prisons.

While the proposal was at first met with grumbles or shuckles from the moderates and reformists ranks, it resonated among many club representative from the lower classes and some socialists. They scolded the moderates and reformists for their unwillingness to follow through on the revolutionary ideal. After the attack was made against their rivals, the Cocardiers loudly heckled them and rallied around the proposal. Some moderates wavered while others tried to defend their reputation. Some left the meeting in protestation. In the end, the proposal was adopted.\n\nThe debate had some immediate consequences as members of various clubs decided to join the Cocardier cause, reinforcing their lead in the Committee further.\n\nIn the following weeks, members of the Cocardiers would begin organising raids on the so-called "rupins", wealthy nobles of Rila, and recruiting the populace to join in the looting."

To the surprise of many in attendance, one of the clubs now gained a majority, absorbing many smaller but like-mided clubs. After the roll call, the session fell into a semi-silence, a far cry from all previous sessions. There were some speeches, calm ones, but a recess was quickly called. Many groups gathered hastily to chat, some worried and other enthusiastic.\n\nWhen the committee went back in session, there were a few speeches. Club leaders were congratulating the new majority for bringing some clarity of purpose to their group. Some pointed to the necessity of fair debates and respect for one another. The speeches were respectfully applauded. Some less than others, prompting more worried looks among some representatives. Finally, the leader of the new majority rose. In his speech, he thanked the clubs for their support but called for unity. It was no longer time for half-measures. The ideals of the Republic required action and no more endless debates and planning. They were ready."

 aquileia_two.8.d:0 "From the balcony of his palace, he couldn't help but see these small clouds of black smoke rising from the city. Duke Michel knew they weren't just coming from kitchens where families would lovingly make cherry pies together. He sighed sadly, knowing that it was a piece of Aquileia's soul and spirit that was burning down there.\n\nIn the streets of Rila and in other cities, order had been given. All bookshops, printers and private libraries were to be raided. Any books deemed subversive to the established order of Aquileia and its vassals were to be gathered and burned in front for all to see.\n\nThe decision had been a tough one. His advisors had united against the duke who had committed himself to protect a certain degree of freedom of thought and writing among philosophers in Rila. He fought back but it was clear that if he didn't comply, the fabric of his administration would begin to unravel at a time when he couldn't afford to. It would enrage his friends and allies but it was a necessary compromise to maintain some degree of order. At least, it would keep the royal administration in Aquila at bay."

 aquileia_two.9.t:0 "The Royal Market Decree"
 aquileia_two.9.d:0 "Rila has long been plagued by difficulties in tax collection as well as a legacy of ducal fiscal concessions to the nobility. For years, the ducal advisors tried to sugarcoat it at court in Rila or Aquila but to put it plainly: the treasury is nearly empty. At this moment, credit is unavailable and the duchy needs funds to handle the instability.\n\nFortunately, the ducal administration has designed a policy based on an area where the ducal authorities has remained absolutely unchallenged: the organisation of fairs and marketplaces. Traditionally, it has been used to favor trade and the organization of fairs in all of Rila. It has historically made marketplaces and fairs much more popular in the ducal policies. The plan is to harness this popularity by enacting a decree banning trade outside of fairs and markets organized by the duchy and imposing a fee on all participating vendors. This would also placate the trading nobility and the merchants who heavily lobbied for interventions against new competition.\n\nThe decisions hasn't gone down without immediate reactions. The coterie of liberal thinkers hosted by the duke is rather miffed, to put it mildly. Smaller merchants have also already began petitioning to lower the fee or repeal the decree. Duke Michel himself seemed sympathetic to these pleas and already agreed to grant some exceptions to various small farmers and artisans who regularly took parts to the markets."

Nearly two hundred crates of brand new Marielle 1002 rifles, ammunitions and bayonets have by boat. Our soldiers are already unloading them at the Rila docks."

 aquileia_two.11.d:0 "Today is Weeping-Renée day and the great ducal parade to celebrate it is happening in the capital! Griffons and ponies alike are gathering to watch the grand parade, attend a grand ceremony at the temple of Eyr and finally ending with public festivities and even a grand popular ball at the main plaza! Duke Michel will oversee it all himself as a grand marshall and will attend the festivities. One could even catch the eye of Rila's most prized bachelor at the ball.\n\nNow, one would be hard-pressed to find a griff who could tell you the story of Weeping Renée in Rila. One who could is a griff with a burning passion for Aquileian folklore at duke Michel's court. She was apparently a most devout griff who threw herself before emperor Grover II as he prepared himself to burn down Rila. While a fine story and a proof that history lessons may be needed, it mostly mattered as a justification for the grand festivities. And while the good people watches our duke dancing, a whole other kind of dance will happen all over the capital.\n\nThe ducal administration knew of many warehouses in the capital which could be potential safehouses or arsenals for the revolutionaries. The duke himself produced a list of specific warehouses owned by members of the Cocarcier revolutionary club. Asked by an advisor of how he discovered it, the duke simply chuckled: "Why Weeping Renée of course ! It is only normal she would come back to prevent other griffs from setting the duchy ablaze." The advisors awkwardly chuckled back. They knew they wouldn't know any more."

 aquileia_two.12.d:0 "Today, Flowerino is at the height of a special fair organised by none other than the duke himself, in a display of love towards his people. A true city of tents and music has been erected around the rural temple of Eyr known as the Rocher tranquille, the tranquil rock. Under the patronage of the duke, local artisans and farmers have been invited to sell and share their products, free of taxation. Artists are entertaining the masses and activities have been organized for the fledglings.\n\nWith only minimal security, duke Michel has braved the danger and mingles among the crowd. Numerous activities have been planned. Michel will notably be the judge of numerous contests, notably for the largest produce. Tonight, a great public feast will be organized, with the duke offering some wine barrels to the populace from his own vineyards. Tomorrow, a grand hunt will be organized for the local nobilities.\n\nYet, the true object of the party is not to entertain the common folk but to distract him. As griffs of all ages entertains themselves in a family-friendly manner, the ducal army has moved in the countryside. One by one, farmhouses are being raided for any traces of revolutionary hiding places or sympathizers.\n\nAs expected too, the presence of the duke attracted opportunistic revolutionaries, namely a local group of Cocardier terrorists. The fools tried to make a move on the duke. Sadly for them, the duke's entourage had been tipped off and as soon as they tried to attack him, soldiers in civilian clothing jumped on them. Surprisingly enough, peasants joined the fight on the side of the duke, thinking the duke was indeed at risk. The trap suddenly transformed into a glorious moment as Michel thanked the crowd for saving his life. The fair was roaring with cheers for the duke. And all the while, the farms of the good cheering people were being thoroughly investigated."

 aquileia_two.13.d:0 "The Chantiers de Pélis, a small shipyard, have built their hundredth merchant ship earlier this year. While it was happy news for the shipyard, it was surprisingly well-received in Rila where the duke Michel ordered what the ducal palace called an "overdue celebration of the Pélis shipyard workers, sailors and overall naval achievements". With extraordinary speed, a grand Défilé was organized on the seaside streets in a celebration of Pélis, a true pearl of the duchy.\n\nYet, the elites of Rila had little interest in Pélisian naval tradition. However, they had been keeping tabs on the revolutionary activities in Pélis which was a well-known bastion of republicanism in the duchy. Revolutionary clubs like the Fanal or the Cocardiers had ample support among the dockworkers and shipyard workers. Local forces had gathered a lot of information but never used them, for fear that action could cause an uprising. The revolutionaries knew it and exploited it.\n\nThe Défilé allowed to finally break the revolutionaries surveillance. Ducal agents assembled in Pélis, disguised as civilians attending the Défilé. They came by cars, carriages, train, ships and by flying with their wings. With their support and with the distraction from the Défilé, the local authorities finally launched a large scale raid. A bastion of hardline republicanism in Rila had fallen by a single stroke."

 JER_encourage_extremeism_desc:0 "The only way to break Duke Gadiffer's hold over Vinovia is to mobilize our more radical and fanatic elements to the duchy. If we can stir up a frenzy and start riots in the streets, the Duke's honeyed words will no longer be able to save his wretched spine."
 JER_political_slander:0 "Air The Laundry"
 JER_political_slander_desc:0 "One of Duke Gadiffer's tricks to dismantle and discredit the revolutionary factions in Pridea was vile slander and false rumors about the moral character of their leaders. Well, two can play at that game, and soon the duke will be little more than a mockery throughout Vinovia."
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies:0 "Stick It To the Duke"
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies_desc:0 "With the Duke's credibility in shambles, it's time to march on his castle hold and show the soldiers there just how far he has fallen. A duke without an army is nothing to fear, and his friends and supporters are beginning to desert him at a wonderful rate."

 JER_the_triumph_desc:0 "Victory at last! Once more, the monarchists of Aquileia lie in shambles, chased from the country or placed six feet deep in its soil.

 JER_educate_the_populace:0 "Battle Illiteracy"
 JER_educate_the_populace_desc:0 "Ignorance is the tool of tyrants, the weapon of warlords. Knowledge is the foundation that freedom rests upon.

 JER_delegalize_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Everything we do as a republic must have a basis in our laws and constitution. This includes removing the last vestiges of the monarchy and embracing democracy.

 JER_social_security_for_all_aquileians_desc:0 "For as long as anyone can remember, Aquileia has maintained a sizeable pony minority throughout its lands, with the ponies acting as a support base for the Discret monarchy. In order to get them on our side, and share our revolutionary fraternité with them, we shall pass an official declaration ensuring that ponies are full citizens of our republic and have the same rights as any griffon."

 JER_unite_all_of_aquileia_desc:0 "Aquileia was once a great kingdom, and now we shall make it an even greater republic.

 JER_limit_presidential_executive:0 "Limit The Presidential Executive"
 JER_limit_presidential_executive_desc:0 "One of the most hotly debated parts of the Aquileian constitution is the function of the executive office. Our political stance has always been to limit the executive and devolve more power into the Assemblée Nationale and have them be the primary driving force behind our democratic system. Our president is not to become a dictator, and these restrictions will make sure of that."
 JER_presidential_powers_expansion_act:0 "Expand The Presidential Executive"
 JER_presidential_powers_expansion_act_desc:0 "One of the most hotly debated parts of the Aquileian constitution is the function of the executive office.

By increasing the presidential powers, they can take decisive action when needed to ensure the nation will never again fall to tyranny."

 JER_army_expansion_act_desc:0 "If Aquileia is to defend its revolutionary freedom, and possibly even extend it to the rest of the continent, we need to ensure that our army shall be up to the task.

Why shouldn't we work together?"

 JER_union_representation_act:0 "Loi sur la représentation syndicale"
 JER_union_representation_act_desc:0 "Ensuring that the various unions across Aquileia have political representation at lower levels will strengthen the ties between our government and said unions. Tying PAT politics and union industrial activity together will lose us some support in the Assemblée, but the productivity and rights of the workers are worth it."
 JER_state_housing:0 "Logement d'état"
 JER_state_housing_desc:0 "The provision of housing to the poor by the state has long been a proposal of Aquileia's socialist movements. We are no different; we will ensure that all have a place to spend their nights in comfort and that none shall be left living on the streets!

 JER_civil_nationalism:0 "Aquileian Civic Nationalism"
 JER_civil_nationalism_desc:0 "Aquileia is a land of its citizens. This is a founding principle of our socialist ideology that we should never forget. While we are not nationalists in the vein of those Blackwings in Wingbardy or others like them, we are proud of our nation and of our revolutionary past. Our identity as Aquileians is inseparable from this revolutionary struggle for liberty, and we would do well not to forget it."
 JER_bring_the_unions_into_politics:0 "Politicise The Unions"
 JER_bring_the_unions_into_politics_desc:0 "While unions have previously only been active on a local political basis, it is time to bring them into the national limelight. Every administrative division, including at the federal level, will have a council of union members that represent the interests of the working griffon. This way, the state will always be responsive to the needs of the labourer."
 JER_ammend_gun_ownership_laws:0 "Amend Gun Ownership Laws"
 JER_ammend_gun_ownership_laws_desc:0 "The pony revolutionary Caramel Marks once said, "Under no pretext should arms be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be sabotaged, by force if necessary."

 JER_foreign_brigades_desc:0 "We have succeeded in throwing off our own chains of tyranny, and we have created a haven for the worker within our own borders.

 JER_tax_policy_revisions_desc:0 "Currently, our nation's tax code is all over the place. With there being roughly 63 different tax laws overlapping across all layers of society. This will not do. We shall come together as a nation and redefine all tax obligations for every Aquileian citizen. This will hopefully both increase revenue and decrease bureaucratic bloat, bringing a much needed boost in revenue."
 JER_rural_electrification_commission:0 "Commission d'Electrification Rurale"
 JER_rural_electrification_commission_desc:0 "Many parts of rural Aquileia still lack full electrical connection. As one of Griffonia's premier nations, this can not remain! We will embark on a campaign to connect electricity to the entirety of the nation, opening new lands to industry and development. However, it's an expensive plan, and will cost us some support amongst more financially conscious députés, or those who don't think it goes far enough."
 JER_labour_law_revisions:0 "Modernise The Labour Laws"
 JER_labour_law_revisions_desc:0 "While we are not socialists by any means, we recognize it is the responsibility of the state to protect its workers through the legislative process. A new Aquileian labor code shall be drafted in order to provide legal protection for the rights of laborers as well as their unions. Unfortunately, however, this code is opposed by many in the Assemblée as either going too far or not far enough."

 JER_aquileia_reclaimed_desc:0 "Finally! Aquileia's own blood brothers, those griffons of the Périphérie, are once again united with their homeland and can bask in the same freedom that embraces their countrygriffs. With this unification, our popularity is on the rise amongst the population, and we should easily be able to get some more legislation through the Assemblée riding on our new popularity."
 JER_anti_monopoly_laws:0 "Anti-Monopoly Laws"
 JER_anti_monopoly_laws_desc:0 "Looking back to the days of the Royal tyranny, we see that the monarchy often employed massive corporations to oppress the common griff into what was, in essence, slave labor. We must create a fairer business and working environment that all griffs will be able to operate in without fear of megacorporations driving them out of markets, or abusing them as laborers."
 JER_the_republican_gednermerie:0 "Form The Gendarmerie"
 JER_the_republican_gednermerie_desc:0 "While the idea of oppressive state surveillance and the very memory of La Chouette strikes a chord of fear and hatred in all Aquileians, we recognize that there is a need for protection amongst Aquileians. Not to spy on our own citizens, but to protect us from foreign agents and to conduct operations abroad. Of course, they may, at some points, need to operate domestically, but there we can only do our best."
 JER_cultural_pluralism:0 "Cultural Pluralism"
 JER_cultural_pluralism_desc:0 "While all the griffons of the Périphérie may now bask in the glory of our freedom, many of them are unwilling to accept other aspects of Aquileian culture. While in a perfect world, we would love it if they eventually accepted the Aquileian way of life, we recognize this is unlikely to ever happen. Instead, we must emphasize a multi-cultural outlook in all territories we rule."
 JER_eradicate_hunger:0 "Limited Price Regulations"
 JER_eradicate_hunger_desc:0 "The idea of bringing in price regulations to feed the urban poor of Aquileia has been brought up many times since our rise to power. While many see it as too much government intervention in economics, some are starting to come around to the idea's benefits. From now on, the government will purchase grain at market price and distribute it to the poor at a lower rate, or in exchange for labor projects."

 JER_wrangle_the_party:0 "Wrangle The Party"
 JER_wrangle_the_party_desc:0 "The MPA is a political bushfire. Unpredictable, out of control, and extremely volatile. It is time to bring our estranged députés in line with Rodier and the party to ensure the Président is never lacking in support for his measures. Why use coalitions when you can pass what you want by yourself?"
 JER_repatriation_act:0 "Repatriate the Idole Aquiléenne"
 JER_repatriation_act_desc:0 "The "Idole Aquiléenne" is a tense subject in Aquileian politics. Starting out as fervent monarchists, this mostly pony based organization has, over the years, become closely affiliated with the MPA's new Republican cause. Since the revolutions, they have since calmed their methods a bit, and it is now time to legalize their practices once again."
 JER_urban_expansion_act:0 "Loi Sur l'Etalement Urbain"
 JER_urban_expansion_act_desc:0 "The Maréchal can see the future of industry and development. He knows that the center of commerce and even of society in the future will be the megacities. In line with this, we must invest in our urban infrastructure to provide services to all those who live in the cities. Many of these jobs will come in the form of military manufacturing to prepare for the coming national conflicts."
 JER_institute_of_cultural_preservation:0 "Found l'Institut de Préservation Culturelle"
 JER_institute_of_cultural_preservation_desc:0 "One of the strongest forces backing the MPA politically is that of Aquileian nationalism. The preservation of the Aquileian cultural identity was one of Rodier's main speaking points during the election, and now it is time to make good on those promises. The creation of a government agency with the sole job of sponsoring and nurturing our culture will be a strong boon to our nation's strength and pride!"

 JER_patriotic_fervour_desc:0 "Aquileia is once again fast on her way to rising to become a Great Power on Griffonia once again!

He has brought our nation glory and prestige! And we shall follow him to the end!"
 JER_establish_state_unions:0 "Syndicats Nationaux"
 JER_establish_state_unions_desc:0 "In order to improve our urban economic output, some members of the MPA, styling themselves as "National-Syndicalists" have recommended implementing a program of state-sponsored unions in order to improve working conditions while still retaining control over the economic process to serve the state. While some more traditional members call this "Communist," we are more than happy to embrace this idea."
 JER_aquileiafication_campaign:0 "Aquilifaction Campaign"
 JER_aquileiafication_campaign_desc:0 "The griffons of the Périphérie still cling to backward cultures that demean their lives with uncivilized practices. We shall bring these griffons under our wings, show them how to be Aquileian, how to be greater than they once were. And once the lesser cultures are wiped from the land, we can all rejoice in the simple fact that we are all Aquileian, griffons of liberty and freedom!"
 JER_establish_the_foreign_legion:0 "Establish The Légion Etrangère"
 JER_establish_the_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The Idole-d'Aquiléenne has thus far served its purpose well. It has brought more ponies into the MPA and bolstered our support in key areas. And now the Maréchal has the perfect idea on how to thank them. By integrating the Idole-d'Aquiléenne into the Aquileian army as the "Légion Etrangère," we will create a government-sanctioned way for minority groups to do their service to the state."
 JER_the_four_principles:0 "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, Nationalité!"
 JER_the_four_principles_desc:0 "While the Aquileian revolution has always done its best to embody the three principles of Théodore Vérany, "Liberté, Egalité, and Fraternité", Rodier wants another one added to the list. By ensuring nationalism maintains as high of a position as the other three, we will ensure that Aquileia will always be a distinct cultural identity from the rest of Griffonia, a shining example for all to try to become."

 JER_poach_support:0 "Poach The Députés"
 JER_poach_support_desc:0 "The PNdA is, in many ways, a coalition ticket in a coalition system. Composed of politicians from all over the ideological spectrum of the Assemblée. All dissatisfied with other political factions and rallying behind Vérany's Pan-Griffonian ideology. With such a diverse cast backing us up, it is relatively easy to bring in support from all parts of society to boost our political acumen."
 JER_use_veranys_reputation:0 "The Hero Of The Republic"
 JER_use_veranys_reputation_desc:0 "Vérany's image as the hero of the Republic still rings loud and true with many across Aquileia. While many call him a relic of a bygone age, his loyal members of the PNdA still remember his glories and his victories. Along with them, many of the FJA still remember his as the greatest spokesgriff of Democracy, and are willing to vote with him in memory of that image."
 JER_reform_the_national_bank_of_aquileia:0 "Reform The National Bank"
 JER_reform_the_national_bank_of_aquileia_desc:0 "One of the greatest issues currently facing our revolutionary republic is that of the national debt. Through the fighting and the bloodshed, we also spend massive amounts of gold and other currencies to keep our state stable. To manage this, we must create a financial institution with the sole purpose of lending money to the government so that we may remain solvent."
 JER_increase_military_funding:0 "Redefine The Army Budget"
 JER_increase_military_funding_desc:0 "Théodore Vérany has big plans for where Aquileia will go from here. He is a Pan-Griffonian through and through and believes strongly in going forth to spread our revolution across all of Griffonia. And to do that, he believes we must expand the army. The bill will be long, but we have the instruments of state, like our new bank, to lighten the load."
 JER_the_dream_aint_dead:0 "The Dream Isn't Dead"
 JER_the_dream_aint_dead_desc:0 "We can not give up on the great dream of Pan-Griffonianism! If the revolution only exists in Aquileia, then inevitably the other monarchies of the land will see us as a threat, and come to snuff us out once and for all. It is our sacred duty as a republic that successfully cast off the chains of bondage that once held us, to go beyond our borders, and free the rest of Griffonia!"
 JER_support_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
 JER_support_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Cooperation with the large industrial conglomerates of Aquileia will allow us to stockpile enough war materials for the coming conflict. Using loans and shares from the national bank, we will be able to bankroll a far larger military than before, always ready to defend republicanism wherever it is threatened. And eventually, that army will pay back the debt with a visit to Griffenheim itself..."
 JER_griffonian_citizenship_act:0 "The Griffonian "Citizenship" Act"
 JER_griffonian_citizenship_act_desc:0 "The Assemblée has drafted a controversial provision that massively eases the requirements to get Aquileian citizenship to any republican dissidents who enter our borders. While masquerading as a way to attract intellectuals from abroad, in reality, we are building networks, making contacts, and sharing information from abroad. When there are republicans everywhere, the imperials have nowhere to hide."
 JER_equal_lingustic_representation_act:0 "Equalise The Languages" 
 JER_equal_lingustic_representation_act_desc:0 "The effort by the Assemblée to equalize all Griffonian languages in the eyes of the Aquileian government is seen by all as a massive step towards fully embracing Pan-Griffonian identity. It sets up Aquileia as a leader in international efforts for republicanism, while also setting it on a collision course with the Imperial government. As there is no way they can pretend Vérany lacks ambition any longer."
 JER_prepare_for_the_future:0 "The Father Of The Revolution"
 JER_prepare_for_the_future_desc:0 "It is now time for Vérany to step into the role that was already made for him. He is not just the hero of both revolutions, but he is also their ideological father. It was his ideas that propelled our nation to what it is today, his influence creating the Aquileia its citizens now know. And as the father cared for his children, now to shall the children support the father in his great mission..."
 
 JER_the_tarrin_question:0 "The Matter of Tarrin"
 JER_the_tarrin_question_desc:0 "Not long ago, the land of Tarrin was Aquileian just as much as Rila or Pridea is today. The local Discret Countess was overthrown by republicans in 980, but the Francistrians were quick to invade and claim the region. Now it is again ruled by an oppressive monarchy, but this time the monarch is foreign as well! We must oust the Wingbardian puppets from these lands and reclaim them pour la République!"
 JER_diplomacy_is_good:0 "A Soft Claw"
 JER_diplomacy_is_good_desc:0 "Our neighbors to the east may appear like squabbling buffoons to the rest of the world, but we know they may have some sense to them.

 JER_the_conquest_of_avian_desc:0 "The lands of Verenia have been torn between the influences of the Herzlanders and Aquileians for centuries. The western half of the Duchy of Verenia, Lointaineau, was once part of Aquileia and retains its Aquileian identity to this day.

 JER_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 JER_on_our_own_desc:0 "Long ago, the failed revolutionary Alexander Kemerskai failed to bring freedom to the Herzland. He retreated north and became a monarch in all but name, abandoning the principles he once fought for. While we may appreciate his effort, he has lost the revolutionary mandate. It now falls to us, the second great revolution to instead take up this torch, and bash some Imperial skulls with it!"

 JER_liberal_industry:0 "Finish the Coltbert Reforms"
 JER_liberal_industry_desc:0 "The ministry of Coltbert was a strange time. By welcoming back the bright minds that had fled the counter-revolution, Coltbert both weakened the prestige of the monarchy and yet offered it prosperity.

 JER_local_resource_extraction_desc:0 "Aquileia's soil is much like its people, full of potential and yet so often untapped.

 JER_agrarian_reforms:0 "Agricultural Modernisation Committee"
 JER_agrarian_reforms_desc:0 "Coltbert had long lamented at how outdated the Aquileian agriculture was but the question was incredibly sensitive since King Moriset had to walk a fine line between contenting both the former serfs and the land-owning nobility. Now that the situation is settled, we can finally modernize the countryside!"
 JER_fund_arms_production:0 "Tax Cuts For the Arms Industry"
 JER_fund_arms_production_desc:0 "Coltbert made a large gamble during his ministry by heavily taxing the arms industry in what he saw as an era of unrest but peace for the kingdom, bringing him much needed funds. It was wise then but now, Aquileia requires guns and cannons. We'll have to trust our civilian investments to make up for the loss."
 JER_all_aquileian_railway:0 "Create the SNCA"
 JER_all_aquileian_railway_desc:0 "Despite the great progresses that Aquileia has made in recent years, transportation still remains woefully outdated.

 JER_support_automobile_industry:0 "The Léopard Compagnie Automobile Bailout"
 JER_support_automobile_industry_desc:0 "The Léopard Compagnie is one of the pearls of Aquileian industry. Yet, their focus on luxury cars at home and their expansion in Saddle Arabia proved to be a disaster due to the social changes at home and civil war overseas. By bailing them out, we can save a titan of industry and save it from itself at the same time."
 JER_aquileian_academy_of_science:0 "The Aquileian School of Polytechnique"
 JER_aquileian_academy_of_science_desc:0 "While Aquileia has long cultivated a tradition of higher learnings, it has long failed in focusing it on practical matters like the famed universities of Yale.

 JER_aquileian_standard_desc:0 "Aquileian industrial output has long been of either poor quality or bound by outdated methods.

 JER_destroyer_developments:0 "La gendarmerie maritime" 
 JER_destroyer_developments_desc:0 "Though grand warships stir the soul, the smaller vessels are no less important. The destroyers are the vanguard, the patrol ships, the submarine hunters, and the escorts of our navy, and by developing new, more capable models, we strengthen the navy in a hundred small ways."
 JER_restart_battleship_developments:0 "Restart Battleship Development" 
 JER_restart_battleship_developments_desc:0 "The battleship is the heart and soul of a navy, and its presence is a show of force and a symbol of pride. Before its guns lesser ships flee, and before its armor all but the strongest weapons must admit defeat. We were forced to suspend our battleship projects before, but the time has come to reassume them."
 JER_cruisers:0 "Cruiser Development" 
 JER_cruisers_desc:0 "Neither destroyers nor battleships will carry us to victory alone. A well-constructed cruiser delivers firepower enough for most occasions at much lower cost, and it allows us to project power more evenly across the ocean."
 JER_naval_bomber_dominance:0 "The Floating Fortress Doctrine" 
 JER_naval_bomber_dominance_desc:0 "As it has on land, the war at sea is changing, and these floating airfields are positioned to take on the role of the new kings of the ocean. An airplane flies further than even the greatest gun can fire, and the firepower they deliver is no less precise. The shift in warfare will be seismic, and Aquileia shall lead the way."
 JER_submarine_development:0 "The Wolfpack Theorem" 
 JER_submarine_development_desc:0 "Submarines are potent weapons, but they need to be used properly. They are not ships of the line; they are hidden ambushers, and they should be used and developed accordingly."
 JER_pridean_marine_traditions:0 "Reform The Commandos Marine" 
 JER_pridean_marine_traditions_desc:0 "Artillery only will not win on land, and it will not win at sea. Whether during boarding actions or during landings on enemy shores, we need to train soldiers for the specific task of fighting in and around water."
 JER_naval_aviation_transport_department:0 "The Naval Aerial Transport Department" 
 JER_naval_aviation_transport_department_desc:0 "The seas are no obstacle for aircraft, but they do present unique challenges and opportunities. Torpedoes serve our bombers better than bombs here, and if a plane plans to land at sea, it must be built for the task."
 
 JER_army_reforms:0 "Aquileian Remilitarisation" 
 JER_army_reforms_desc:0 "Aquileia has been infirm for too long, and after the recent traumatic events it is clear that we can no longer rely on anyone for protection but ourselves. Whatever awaits in the coming years, Aquileia will face all challenges as strong as it ever has been."
 JER_adapting_new_stategies:0 "Settling Doctrinal Disputes" 
 JER_adapting_new_stategies_desc:0 "War has changed, and Aquileia must decide how it is going to approach the battlefield of the 11th century. The wars of the future will be ones of industry and grand strategy, and we cannot delude ourselves into thinking old methods will still work."
 JER_tank_modernisation:0 "The Armour Research Grant" 
 JER_tank_modernisation_desc:0 "The tank is a weapon still in its infancy, but it has already shown its potential. If we make sure to fund the development of this peculiar vehicle, we can well place ourselves in a position to be the masters of tank warfare across Griffonia."
 JER_medium_tanks:0 "Infantry Support Tank Development" 
 JER_medium_tanks_desc:0 "Early tank models were lightly armoured and armed, and though they served well, the way that warfare is developing means that we will have to increase both of these things."
 JER_heavier_tanks:0 "The Tip of the Lance" 
 JER_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Standing as the apex of tank design in many ways, these behemoths may be large, expensive and slow, but they can wade through fire like nothing, and their guns can destroy all but the most heavily armoured fortifications. With these at the front, our forces will surely be unstoppable! "
 JER_equipment_modernisation:0 "The MAC-40/2" 
 JER_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "The humble infantrygriff has been at the centre of warfare ever since griffons first took up the sword. There have always been those that outshine him, but there has never been anyone as important as him. Making sure he has the proper weapons for his duty is to strengthen the very foundation of our armed forces."
 JER_support_equipment_modernisation:0 "Field Support Battalions" 
 JER_support_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "Whether it is to build bridges across rivers, care for wounded soldiers, provide reconnaissance or ensure supplies are getting where they should, we need to ensure that our soldiers are trained for the task."
 JER_unit_mechanisation:0 "Mass Infantry Mechanisation" 
 JER_unit_mechanisation_desc:0 "Considering the speed with which motorised infantry can strike, there is no reason to not presume that it will become standard in the future, or at least as widespread as possible. It will be up to us to make sure we have the best possible vehicles for it."
 JER_mobile_logistics_corps:0 "Le corps logistique mobile" 
 JER_mobile_logistics_corps_desc:0 "Getting supplies to the front is not a side job, but a core duty of our armed forces, and we should approach it with the same élan as we do everything else. Whether in storm or snow, in mountains or desert, Le corps logistique mobile will be there!"
 JER_assault_section_memes:0 "Assault Section Proliferation" 
 JER_assault_section_memes_desc:0 "To ensure that every unit will be able to push the advantage, no matter the situation, we will establish assault sections across the army down to company level. No matter the formation, there will always be soldiers with the equipment and élan to charge into the fray and defy the odds."
 JER_medical_service_corps:0 "Le corps du service médical" 
 JER_medical_service_corps_desc:0 "Our soldiers' lives are not to be thrown away casually. Every Aquileian has the potential to be a hero and a champion, and we will not let them die for nothing, no matter how or where."
 JER_artillery_modernisation:0 "The Queen of the Battlefield" 
 JER_artillery_modernisation_desc:0 "The roar of the cannon has been the herald that announced the start of combat for over a century, and age has only sharpened her fangs. We will make sure to keep them as sharp, if not sharper, and she will keep her throne for many years to come."
 JER_anti_tank_advancements:0 "The Dassault 76mm" 
 JER_anti_tank_advancements_desc:0 "Tanks are frightening weapons, but artillery is even more terrifying. A specialized barrel and shell can make light work of most tanks, and all for a very reasonable price as well!"
 JER_special_forces_department:0 "Form The Commandement des Opérations Spéciales" 
 JER_special_forces_department_desc:0 "The chevalier's era has come to an end, and though they stride across the battlefields still, they are now accompanied by other soldiers as well, soldiers who will share their role as the first to the fight and the greatest of fighters Aquileia has. War might change, but the need for heroes doesn't."
 
 JER_reforming_the_airforce:0 "The Third Branch of the Military" 
 JER_reforming_the_airforce_desc:0 "Though our wings have carried us far throughout history, it is clear that these new aerial weapons are neither a fad nor pointless. They will be a foundational part of future warfare, and we must make sure to face the challenges that await us with one unified doctrine."
 JER_develop_airplane_industry:0 "Aviation Industry Development Grants" 
 JER_develop_airplane_industry_desc:0 "Aluminium used to be an odd metal that kings of old made into the most expensive dinner plates since it was so rare. In these modern times, it is not only easily produced, it is also the foundation of aircraft construction. By ensuring our industry can produce a steady supply of it, we will ensure we can keep our airforce flying."
 JER_domestic_rubber:0 "Hippogriffia Synthetic Rubber Initiative" 
 JER_domestic_rubber_desc:0 "We are not blessed with the natural rubber plantations of Zebrica, but that is a challenge, not an issue. If we cannot grow rubber, we will find ways to synthesize it, and thanks to some contacts in Hippogriffia, we are already well underway."
 JER_tactical_bomber_developments:0 "The Aquileian Bomber Fleet" 
 JER_tactical_bomber_developments_desc:0 "The air is not merely a place for fighter pilots to joust, but also one from which we can wreak untold devastation on our enemies. If we control this space, we can paralyze our foes by blowing apart their factories, infrastructure and formations. This, however, will need a well-developed bomber fleet."
 JER_bomber_priority:0 "Payload Calibration" 
 JER_bomber_priority_desc:0 "Aerial bombing is not merely to throw massive amounts of bombs as your target, it is a precise science where one well-aimed and calibrated bomb can cause equal damage to a hundred blindly-dropped ones."
 JER_heavy_fighter_development:0 "Bomber Escort Craft" 
 JER_heavy_fighter_development_desc:0 "As our bombers go forth to bring destruction on our enemies, they will be easy targets. The development of long-range fighters is imperative to make sure that we can give them the protection they need."
 JER_fighter_developments:0 "Fighter Craft Modernisation" 
 JER_fighter_developments_desc:0 "Thanks to wasteful and unfocused development efforts in recent years, the Aquileian fighter corps is woefully out of date. Thankfully, there is enough knowledge and experience spread among the various efforts that if they are brought together, we can jumpstart our efforts to modernize."
 JER_close_air_support_development:0 "Infantry Support Craft" 
 JER_close_air_support_development_desc:0 "Infantry came first, then that which supported the infantry. Though the war in the air provides new challenges, this fact remains, and our planes should be designed to fulfil this role. "
 JER_infantry_support_priority:0 "Combined Arms Tactics" 
 JER_infantry_support_priority_desc:0 "Our air force is independent from, but interconnected with, the rest of our armed forces. When one strikes, they all shall strike, and tanks and soldiers shall roll forth supported closely by our air force."
 JER_aquileian_ace_priority:0 "The Aquila Institute Of Aerodynamics" 
 JER_aquileian_ace_priority_desc:0 "Flying is an artform, whether by wings or by plane, and Aquileia's tradition of excellence in all that we do demands that this art is taken seriously. Veteran fliers will be rotated back to the academies, where they can teach their methods to the new generation of pilots so that they all can share in the unified knowledge of all pilots."
 
 JER_MPA_triumphant:0 "Triumph Of the Will"
 JER_MPA_triumphant_desc:0 "We have done it! The Empire is no more, and Griffenheim is ours! Our most accursed enemy has been brought low, and Aquileia has proven itself to be stronger than the enemies it faced. Now, the governing of the newly conquered lands falls to us, as well as spreading the Aquileian culture further than ever before."
 JER_securing_greater_aquileia:0 "A Greater Aquileia"
 JER_securing_greater_aquileia_desc:0 "The dream of a Greater Aquileia has been in the minds of the MPA and of President Rodier for some time now, and with the fall of our main rival that dream is finally within reach. Through the rapid Aquilifaction of neighboring Herzland territories, the natural borders of the nation will spread farther than they have ever before."
 JER_secure_skyfall:0 "Secure Skyfall"
 JER_secure_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall is the primary trading hub of Griffonia, and one of the richest cities in the world. As such, it is of the utmost importance that we secure the region and integrate it into the Aquileian nation. In time, it will become as much a part of our country as any other city."
 JER_nationalise_the_industries:0 "Curb the Oligarchs"
 JER_nationalise_the_industries_desc:0 "The oligarchs of Skyfall are a clear enemy to the ongoing integration of the soon-to-be province. Their influence must be curtailed if we are to continue unhindered. Some members of the MPA have proposed nationalizing their factories: they will serve a better purpose producing arms and goods for the country."
 JER_work_with_the_industrialists:0 "Shake Claws With the Oligarchs"
 JER_work_with_the_industrialists_desc:0 "While the oligarchs are an obstacle towards our goals in Skyfall, they can also be reasonable griffons if given the right incentives. The rich and wealthy still hold power in the trade cities, and getting them on our side will prove useful in speeding up cultural integration. An agreement can be struck, surely."
 JER_economic_regulations:0 "Implement Trade Regulations"
 JER_economic_regulations_desc:0 "Even with how rich Skyfall and the surrounding cities have become due to trade, we can not allow it to continue unrestricted. New restrictions and regulations will be put into place in Skyfall, keeping the hubs of commerce under a tight leash."
 JER_free_economic_zone:0 "Free Trade Zones"
 JER_free_economic_zone_desc:0 "Skyfall was called the "Biggest Little City on Griffonia" for a reason. Free trade has made the region extremely wealthy, with an exorbitant amount of both goods and creatures coming and going. Keeping the cities unrestricted will allow Skyfall to continue to prosper, with Aquileia partaking in the benefits."
 JER_begin_aquilification:0 "The Province of Caillefolois"
 JER_begin_aquilification_desc:0 "Now that the oligarchs have been dealt with and the trade question has been answered, we can now proceed with the full integration of the Skyfall region. The next shining star of Aquileia, henceforth it will now be known as a new, more Aquileian name: Caillefolois. "
 JER_secure_griefenmarschen:0 "Secure Greifenmarschen"
 JER_secure_griefenmarschen_desc:0 "Though not a historically Aquileian region, nor particularly valuable in terms of trade or industry, Greifenmarschen lies on the border between us and the Herzland, and is within our plans of Aquileisation. Taking this bed of republicanism would only benefit Aquileia."
 JER_keep_the_traditions:0 "Special Legal Privileges"
 JER_keep_the_traditions_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen was a republic with a long history, one of the oldest on Griffonia. While not the most efficient, their tradition of direct voting and governing positions has stood for centuries. It is important that we respect these ancient systems, and allow the region to keep them in place."
 JER_centralise_voting_regions:0 "Redraw Electoral Borders"
 JER_centralise_voting_regions_desc:0 "While they may have stood for many years, the electoral system in Greifenmarschen in a product of the past and horribly outdated in this day and age. We can not allow one select region to be treated differently from the others, even if the griffons there are not happy about it. The whole system will be redrawn, this time up to more modern standards."
 JER_protect_local_farms:0 "Ignore the Mess"
 JER_protect_local_farms_desc:0 "Although it is confusing to say the least, the land system that the peasants of Greifenmarschen have used has worked for years on its own. Even if it is not the most efficient system, leaving things as they are will at the very least help us curry some favor with the locals."
 JER_consolidate_the_land:0 "Consolidate the Farmland"
 JER_consolidate_the_land_desc:0 "The current situation of land ownership in Greifenmarschen is in complete disorder. In its current state, our officials can barely understand who owns what land and where the resources there are, if there are even any at all. Surveyors will be sent out to the entire region to redraw and redistribute the land and fields, which will finally bring some order to this chaos."
 JER_aquileiafication_griefenmarschen:0 "The Province of Les Griffemarches"
 JER_aquileiafication_griefenmarschen_desc:0 "With the various issues settled, Greifenmarschen, now Les Griffemarches can finally become a full state of Aquileia. Once the Aquilifaction of the region is finished, this bed of republicanism will become one with our glorious nation."
 JER_integrate_local_parties:0 "Integrate Local Parties"
 JER_integrate_local_parties_desc:0 "In our annexed territories, there are many local republican parties which used to campaign in their respective regions. By integrating these parties into the main Aquileian ones, we can once again give them a voice in the government and make allies across the whole parliament at the same time."
 JER_double_down:0 "Reinforce Integralism"
 JER_double_down_desc:0 "The integration of griffons within our borders to the Aquileian culture has always been a priority of the MPA, and we must double down on this goal towards the total conversion and unity of the nation. While some within our own party are calling this a step too far, President Rodier has made it clear that wiping the primitive cultures from Aquileia is a necessity."
 JER_limited_multi_linguism:0 "Limited Multi-Lingualism"
 JER_limited_multi_linguism_desc:0 "Though Aquileian is clearly a superior language and culture, continuing assimilation of others is detrimental to the stability of the nation. As such, regions will be allowed to practice limited multi-lingualism in their respective areas, to allow better representation of other cultures in the country."
 JER_expand_the_legion:0 "Expand The Légion Etrangère"
 JER_expand_the_legion_desc:0 "During the war, the Légion Etrangère served on the front lines with honor and distinction, playing a critical role in many battles. This devoted group has proved their worth time and time again, and in return we shall expand their ranks to allow them to continue their faithful service."
 JER_embrace_the_free_market:0 "Railway Centralisation"
 JER_embrace_the_free_market_desc:0 "All across the new Aquileia, the railways that link the nation are all loosely tied together, separately owned by different companies. To unify this means of transportation in the nation and standardize rail lines, we will merge all these corporations into one state-sponsored entity, easing the construction of new railroads."
 JER_aquileian_tourism:0 "Increase Military Spending"
 JER_aquileian_tourism_desc:0 "While the Empire may have been beaten, Aquileia must remain vigilant. There are still nations both on Griffonia and the world at large which could seek our downfall. Therefore, more funding must be allocated to the armed forces, so we are always ready to fight against our future enemies."
 JER_the_game_was_rigged_from_the_start:0 "The Game Was Rigged From The Start"
 JER_the_game_was_rigged_from_the_start_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic. Once the torch of the Revolution, it was forced to flee north to Cloudbury and sit in waiting for decades while the Empire decayed. Even now, they still have their eyes set on Griffenheim, their Pan-Griffonian ideals in conflict with our dreams for Aquileia. It is time to snuff out this dying flame once and for all."
 JER_new_friends:0 "The Twin Eagles"
 JER_new_friends_desc:0 "To our south, the Kingdom of Wingbardy has adopted a nationalism similar to our own. While they still have a monarchy in place, real power lies in the claws of their Il Duce, Beakolini. Though the matter of Tarrin has caused some conflict in the past, surely it is not too late to seek reconciliation and make a new ally?"
 JER_define_spheres:0 "Propose The Volino Agreement"
 JER_define_spheres_desc:0 "The Volino Agreement is a treaty that if signed, will allow the freedom of movement between the Wingbardian's Karthinian Pact, and our own Entente. While this will increase immigration and ease of trade between our two factions, it will also serve to keep ourselves and our spheres of influences from conflicting with each other."
 JER_the_mutual_military_attache:0 "Aquileian-Wingbardian War Games"
 JER_the_mutual_military_attache_desc:0 "Both the Aquileian and Wingbardian armies are experienced forces, who have fought in many wars in recent years and have their own unique tactics and doctrines. By sending military attachés to each other and participating in joint exercises and war-games, we could learn from each other in the ever-evolving field of warfare."
 JER_freedom_of_transit:0 "The Aquileian Marriage"
 JER_freedom_of_transit_desc:0 "With our two nations closer together than ever before, it is finally time to propose the culmination of our diplomatic advances: the full merging of the Wingbardian alliance with our Entente. If successful, this new pact will signal a new age of friendship between us as new allies on the world stage, the twin eagles of Griffonia."
 JER_focusing_inwards:0 "The Lone Eagle"
 JER_focusing_inwards_desc:0 "Aquileia will need friends to stand strong in the future, this much is certain. While an unusual choice, our best option is to ally ourselves with the new Herzland Republic, a state carved out of the old Empire. While still technically a client state of ours, it has the potential to become much more if we invest in it."
 JER_help_them_rebuild:0 "Bolster the Herzlandisch Republikanische Garde"
 JER_help_them_rebuild_desc:0 "The new Herzland military is, to put it lightly, woefully inadequate. It will require a major expansion to once again become a modern force, and to this end we will send aid in the form of military assistance to help re-modernize and recreate their army."
 JER_economic_stimulus:0 "The Murat Plan"
 JER_economic_stimulus_desc:0 "The war with the Empire has left the Herzland's industry and economy in shambles. To fix this, our economists have proposed the Murat Plan, which involves sending economic aid and stimulus to the Herzland Republic in an effort to quickly rebuild its ailing economy. This will allow the reborn nation to once again become competitive in the international markets."
 JER_equals_not_subjects:0 "Liberators Not Imperialists"
 JER_equals_not_subjects_desc:0 "Now that the Herzland Republic can stand on its own two claws, it is finally time to let it take its place in the world as a new independent republic in the Entente. Our sister republic will stand tall beside us, as bastions of freedom and liberty on the continent!"
 JER_literally_GIGN:0 "Form the GIGN"
 JER_literally_GIGN_desc:0 "A motion has been put forward to form the Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale, or GIGN. An elite tactical unit of the army, its roles would mainly include special operations in foreign countries and targeting crime in the nation. It will also serve as protection for critical sites and government officials to defend against foreign intrusions."
 
 JER_the_aquila_concordant:0 "The Rila Conference"
 JER_the_aquila_concordant_desc:0 "Victory! The Empire has been defeated, and the Herzland has been liberated into a new, shining republic! But, while we have defeated our enemy, the question still remains of our relationship with our fellow republic. We must meet in Rila with the other republican leaders to decide how to move forward."
 JER_the_concordant_succeeds:0 "The Republican Pact Reaffirmed"
 JER_the_concordant_succeeds_desc:0 "Us and the Griffonian Republic are like two shining stars on the continent, two beacons of light that bring freedom and prosperity to their citizens. Aquileia will remain an independent member of the Republican Pact, standing together with its loyal ally!"
 JER_military_ties:0 "Aquileian-Republican Military Cooperation Treaty"
 JER_military_ties_desc:0 "The newly proposed treaty of military cooperation has been put forward by both Republican generals and our own, involving deeper collaboration between general staffs in military matters. It would also allow both our armies to work better as a cohesive force should actual conflict break out."
 JER_joint_research_effort:0 "Pan-Griffonian Research Initiative"
 JER_joint_research_effort_desc:0 "Science and technology are things that should benefit all griffons in the world, not just those in our country. To collaborate better on scientific advances, a joint research effort of our bright minds will work with the Republic's to usher in a new age for all griffonkind."
 JER_permenant_transport_ties:0 "The Romau Agreement"
 JER_permenant_transport_ties_desc:0 "Even though we may not believe in the idea of a united Griffonia, borders should not be something that stops griffons from immigrating from country to country. The Romau Agreement will allow the citizens of both us and all our allies to travel freely, and to migrate to any country they choose easily."
 JER_no_tarrifs:0 "Griffonian Free Trade Zone"
 JER_no_tarrifs_desc:0 "Our allies have built many ties between each other and us economically, but tariffs and taxes on foreign goods still stymie trade between them and us. By creating a free trade zone and lifting these restrictions, goods can flow more freely and improve the economy of all involved."
 JER_entente_triumphant:0 "The Entente Triumphant"
 JER_entente_triumphant_desc:0 "We alone have defeated the Herzland, and we alone will stand tall on Griffonia as a place of harmony. The Entente will remain the premier alliance on Griffonia, bastions of liberty in the world!"
 JER_rapid_reconstruction:0 "Herzlandisch Reconstruction Authority"
 JER_rapid_reconstruction_desc:0 "While the war is over, the Herzland is still devastated by the fighting. The new Herzland Republic has having trouble repairing all the damage, so the new Herzlandisch Reconstruction Authority will be formed to aid in the reconstruction of the region."
 JER_rapid_buildup:0 "The Herzlandisch Landwehr"
 JER_rapid_buildup_desc:0 "The old imperial Reichsarmee was one of the most modern and prestigious military forces on Griffonia. The current Herzlandisch Landwehr, not so much. Though it may never reach the size it once was at, we can at least help the fledgling republic recreate a respectable army."
 JER_a_new_airforce:0 "A Herzlandisch Airforce"
 JER_a_new_airforce_desc:0 "A large and modern airforce can be just as key to winning a way as tanks or ships. The Herzland has none to speak of at the moment, leaving them vulnerable to bombing runs if future conflict breaks out. To fix this, we will help the Herzlanders create their own new fleet of planes to defend themselves."
 JER_were_not_imperialists:0 "The Sister Republic"
 JER_were_not_imperialists_desc:0 "We are liberators, not imperialists. Despite our victory, we neither need nor want to hold dominion over the Herzland. Instead, we shall let it go as a fully independent nation in the Entente, a true sister republic to our own. Their future will be theirs to forge, not one that we decide for them."
 JER_im_sorry_little_one:0 "A Tragedy In Two Parts"
 JER_im_sorry_little_one_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic was once the shining torch of liberty and freedom on Griffonia, the flame of the revolution. But now, they are a threat to Aquileia's own freedom and prosperity through their steadfast goal of Pan-Griffonianism. Though it may pain us to do so, we must defeat the Republic to truly bring safety to an independent Aquileia."
 JER_guardians_of_liberty:0 "Guardians Of Liberty"
 JER_guardians_of_liberty_desc:0 "With the fall of the Republic, Aquileia now stands as the true guardians of liberty on Griffonia. We are the new bastion of harmony and republicanism, and our country stands united behind that fact in the defense of liberty!"
 JER_the_concordant_fails:0 "The Aquileian-Republican Split"
 JER_the_concordant_fails_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic's ideals, while in some ways similar, directly conflict with our own. They seek a policy of Pan-Griffonianism, wanting to unite all griffons under their banner. If an independent Aquileia wants to remain, it seems we will have to fight our fellow republicans."
 JER_boost_the_herzlandish_army:0 "Rapid Reconstruction"
 JER_boost_the_herzlandish_army_desc:0 "With Cloudbury no longer an ally, we must look elsewhere for friends and help. The Herzland Republic, a newborn state birthed from the ashes of the Empire could be an excellent choice. Their military must be quickly recreated if they are to stand on their own two claws once more."
 JER_set_them_free:0 "Proclaim the Pan-Griffonian Dream Dead"
 JER_set_them_free_desc:0 "The Pan-Griffonian idea is a failure, one that sought to unite every griffon under a single banner, much like the Griffonian Empire once did. We reject this idea, and will instead allow these other regions to choose their own fates, as free nations in the world."
 JER_focus_on_aquileia:0 "Gaudreau's Final Farewell"
 JER_focus_on_aquileia_desc:0 "Président Gaudreau's plans for Aquileia have all been put in place, and the nation has prospered under her policies. However, she has realized that her time for acting as leader is coming to its end, and has put forward her resignation as Président. Though we will miss her, it is time for Aquileia to move on from the past and into the future."
 JER_reinforce_the_idol:0 "Fiscal Reform Act"
 JER_reinforce_the_idol_desc:0 "Gaudreau did much to fix the state of Aquileian taxes, but there is still more to be done on the subject of our economy. The Fiscal Reform Act will cut unnecessary taxes which, while slightly lowering our revenue, will stimulate increased spending and strengthen our currency."
 JER_get_rid_of_price_regulations:0 "Abolish Price Regulations"
 JER_get_rid_of_price_regulations_desc:0 "The policies put in place so far have been relatively successful and helped Aquileia prosper. One of the more controversial acts by the government, though, was implementing price regulations. Though they were useful once, now they stand as an obstacle to the free market, and will be repealed."
 JER_kind_capitalism:0 "Embrace Social Capitalism"
 JER_kind_capitalism_desc:0 "Social Capitalism, the idea of using capital to improve society as a whole, is exactly what the spirit of Aquileia needs. The free market will help the nation and the economy, and the people who gain from it will help others so they too can thrive."
 JER_deepen_the_welfare_state:0 "Deepen The Social State"
 JER_deepen_the_welfare_state_desc:0 "The government's duty is to protect and care for its citizens. The labour laws were a good start, but we need to go further in aiding both our workers and our people as a whole. Every Aquileian should be able to live a good life, and we shall ensure that they can."
 JER_aquileian_education_improvements:0 "Universal Education Act"
 JER_aquileian_education_improvements_desc:0 "Every creature deserves an education. Be they pony or griffon, from Aquila to Westkeep, all should get the most quality schooling we can provide, from the alphabet to a college degree. As the next generation takes their place in Aquileia, they will be learned, ready and prepared for the world around them."
 JER_parliamentary_supremacy:0 "Assemblée Supremacy"
 JER_parliamentary_supremacy_desc:0 "The Assembly is the body closest to the people, being elected out from the people, rather than through some shady process deciding who even gets to vote. And it is only right and proper that they be granted primacy over the President. After all, there must never be another king."
 JER_embrace_provincialism:0 "Provincialism"
 JER_embrace_provincialism_desc:0 "The many cultures that make up Aquileia and their differences are just as important as the unity between them. Although we are still one united country, we must acknowledge and even support the differences between us so that a griffon can call themselves Rilian or Vinovian as much as they can Aquileian."
 JER_aquileia_on_the_world_stage:0 "Aquileia On The World Stage"
 JER_aquileia_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "Our nation is not the only one who has embraced harmony. While not all of them may exactly follow our ideals of republicanism, there are still many who value freedom and liberty for their citizens just as we do. Reaching out to these countries will help solidify our position on the world stage as well as making some new friends for the future."

Cru intends to step aside and let a new generation take up the torch of revolution, a concept the old guard of the first struggle could never understand. So, we are left with two options, the Syndicalist Thibault Devereux, and a surprise candidate, the Vanguardist Victor Allard."

No longer is the party the vanguard, but rather it is the people as a whole who push the nation to its socialist destiny, with him merely acting as the compass to guide them."

A modification to the curricula of several universities should be a good start."
 JER_authority_decentralisation:0 "Assemblée Decentralisation"
 JER_authority_decentralisation_desc:0 "The next step of Thibault's reforms regards the power of the regional departments of the republic.

 JER_POLITICS_VIVIENNE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! May 9th, 983\n\n§YBiography:§! Born far from the kingdom her family ruled, Vivienne Discret's first memories were not of the royal halls of the palace in Aquileia, but of the warm white walls of the Saddle Arabian emir's court. Aquileia was in chaos, with the death throes of the Revolution turning the rivers red with blood. The Discret family tree had been sheared of its branches by the guillotine, leaving only five surviving dynasts to escape, with Vivienne as the future of the royal lineage. As forces loyal to the monarchy secured their kingdom for them, the royal family waited out the bloodshed from afar, safe from the chaos.\n\nWhen she finally returned to Aquileia, she was immediately surrounded with a veritable army of tutors and scholars. Given the disposition of her father, however, many doubted that the young princess would be keen to learn what they had to say. Fortunately, Vivienne took to her studies and learned well. Better still, they became her passion. The young griffoness read any books she could get her talons on, and touring the countryside became as important to her as her studies. All who met her found her charming and instantly disarming, her wit leaving them impressed for a griffon barely an adult. The nobility of Aquileia and those loyal to the crown knew that the kingdom would be in good claws when it was her turn to take the throne, and many hoped behind closed doors that some unfortunate accident would befall Moriset so his talented and ambitious daughter could take the throne.\n\nThey would be granted their wish. With the Second Aquileian Revolution leaving King Moriset dead, the future of the kingdom lies in the claws of Princess Vivienne – now Queen Vivienne Discret.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"
 JER_SOLEIL_DESC:0 "Soleil Moonshadow was born in 980 ALB in the countryside of Southern Equestria. The youngest member of the family, she got along with her older brother Sunrise very well thanks to her sweetness, gentleness, and charm.\n\nShe was willing to help out her family as much as she could, exporting grains. Though she was young, whenever trouble arose, Soleil always had a few tricks up her sleeve, or when it came to her brother, fighting ability.\n\nEventually, her parents were able to save enough money to invest in her education. Soleil accepted their offer with some reluctance; she did not wish to be separated from her brother. She promised to Sunrise that whatever happened, she wouldn't forget her best brother, and set sail, bound for Aquileia.\n\nShe came to Vanguardia, where she was the newest of generations of ponies already settled there. She quickly found interests in history- warfare, in particular, from the ancient tales of Grover I's conquering campaigns to the application of modern equipment like tanks and planes.\n\nAfter much dedication and hardship, her professors recommended her to the military institution of Aquileia - one of the most prestigious military academies in Aquileia. She quickly raised up the ranks of the Aquileian military command and built up connections with her many envious peers and seniors.\n\nDespite living in Aquileia for some time, her thoughts were always of her Equestria, her parents, and especially her Sunrise. She dreams of reuniting with her family. Soleil hopes that one day, she with Sunrise will defeat any tyranny that threatens them, to defend the Magic of Friendship by which she was raised, and to defend the once undying Aquileian motto, \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité.\"""
 JFT_FLEUR_DESC:0 "Now a knowledgeable and cultured mare, the soft-spoken Fleur was born in one of the villages near the city of Vanguardigo, into a humble and courteous family of ponies that had lived in these lands for decades prior. As a filly, Fleur quickly found an interest in history books, and came to look forward for the next glimpse of history to learn about. Her enthusiasm was compensated as she was sent to a higher institute of learning within the city itself, and while being passionate over what she loved helped her greatly in her studies.\n\nAfter graduating with commendable grades and honours, she joined the military to make not only her career, but to play her part in history. Silently helping out and thoughtfully assisting her superiors in planning and organising, her workload steadily increased as her superiors saw her keenness and silent demeanour, delegating their tasks to her. But as she worked as a literal silent workhorse, she also impressed and built connections with her seniors, catapulting her rise to the top once she was finally noticed by the army's higher-ups, at the envy of many now under her. With her career in the military guaranteed, she is eager to find her place in this new chapter of history.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"
 JER_POLITICS_MORISET_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! December 2nd, 950\n\n§YBiography:§! If there is one thing that can unite all Aquileia in harmony, it is wine. It is very much not Moriset Discret.\n\nA tyrant to all republicans, and a poor leader even to many monarchists, only the most zealous supporters of the monarchy praise him in both public and private. Moriset may not be the griffon at fault for causing the first revolution, but most believe he will be the one to cause the second. With his oppressive policies and harsh punishments, Moriset indulges the destruction of his enemies and the exaltation of himself, leading a court of luxury surrounded by an angry population.\n\nNo one can quite tell when history will come for its revenge on Moriset, or how, but it will occur, someday and inevitably.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! bunnyshrubby"
 JER_POLITICS_RODIER_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! May 28th, 962\n\n§YBiography:§! The Maréchal, Hero, Traitor, the Linchpin of the revolution, the new republic's missing link. One griffon can indeed be all of these and yet also none. But to explore that would be a waste of time, as Léonard Rodier isn't one for pleasantries and long-winded stories anyway.\n\nBorn in Vanguardigo in 962, Rodier was destined for military life one way or another. His family was poor, but they had earned their keep as soldiers for generations. His father had wished to end that, wanting to establish his family as small landowners in their rural region, but as the revolution and monarchist terror swept through their homes, there was no other place to go. So in 982, it was off to a military academy in Westkeep for Léonard, where he met a unique group. The MPA soon approached him on the academy's campus, noting his academic skills and strong personality, they welcomed him to their club. If only they could see him now, they would regret it. For his inviters were ardent monarchists, but as Rodier sunk deeper into the MPA, and began to rise through its ranks, he found hidden within it, new republican circles, which he was far more fond up than stuck up noble sons and daughters.\n\nAfter working with a certain Colonel Colette to cement a republican hold on the MPA, Rodier began to bide his time. He made connections with other republican groups, prepared for the exiles' return, and awaited the second revolution. So when his moment came, he was more than ready. Rallying the military from their barracks in the Capital, it was Rodier who seized the city and welcomed back the ever-popular Vérany, succeeding where the first revolution had failed. \n\nNow Rodier stands ready to build a new, strong Aquileia, based on his ideas of national strength and honor. \n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"
 JER_POLITICS_VERANY_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! June 20th, 950\n\n§YBiography:§! Loved and hated, viewed with awe, fear, disgust, and plain hatred throughout Aquileia and beyond, Théodore Vérany would have it no other way. Known across the land as the de facto leader of the first Aquileian revolution, Vérany is likely the most famous individual in Aquileia besides the King himself. An absolutely magnetic personality, Vérany has gone his whole life attracting others to his words and message.\n\nA child to a newspaper distributor in the Capital, Vérany quickly learned his way around words from his father, and furthered this study by learning about rhetoric and philosophy in school. From the first time he spoke to a crowd, in his youth to petition for a longer recess, he had a sparkle in his eye, an inspirational spark that caused others to follow him, and he would put it to world-sundering use.\n\nNo one is quite sure what got Vérany into republican thought. The griff himself admits he isn't quite sure either, but once he did, he immersed himself fully in the world of underground republicanism, joining all the groups he could to prepare for the day when the Imperials would be thrown out. But then, in 978, a griffon named Kemerskai beat him to the punch, throwing the Emperor out of his own capital. Triggering his planned uprising, Vérany assumed command of the republican cells throughout Aquila and got to work. Though this work didn't last very long. Exiled from his own land, Vérany lost the spark in his eye for the first, and last, time. Since then, he has loved and lost, and loved again, but has never forgotten about his homeland. And now, he has returned triumphant, ready to lead Aquileia into a new pan-griffonian dawn.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo/Martin"
 JER_POLITICS_GAUDREAU_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! August 28th, 953\n\n§YBiography:§! The Rose of Vinovia, a name invoking respect even amongst rivals and opponents, and a life journey of rejecting the past and embracing the future. Born to a Baron within Vinovia's hilly regions, the formerly destitute Gaudreau Barons struck metaphorical gold when veins of iron and coal were discovered on their properties. With industrialization in full swing, by the time Lady Cécile was born into the house, it was a very different place than when her father was born. An only child, her parents cared for her very much, but being that Cécile was quite a bookworm, even in her youth, they didn't worry much about her and let her live her own life. Meeting and playing with the local children, Cécile became perplexed and angry how whenever she mentioned her last name to the towns' people, they would suddenly treat her; differently, she became not a friend but an enemy. Whenever she'd try to help the workers at her family's mines or local villages, they would shy away in fear. The Gaudreaus were not tyrants, Cécile knew this, but because they were part of the nobility, the commonfolk detested them. And so, Cécile turned her focus to freeing her family name of this curse, and began to plan.\n\nWhen the uprising came, heralded by the Aquila rising led by the up-and-coming Vérany, Cécile persuaded her parents to "flee." Simultaneously, she took command of the local cells, guiding them in public under a pseudonym, while contacting monarchist army units in the region under her real name, and persuading them to give up without a fight or defect. But all was for naught, as the revolution failed and Cécile needed to flee. It would be a while before her parents heard from her again, but when they did, her message was clear, "Je reviendrai." Since then, her name has become famous amongst republicans, both for her evolving ideas, as well as her relationship with, then split from the famous Vérany. Their clash of egos and ideals has set the scene for modern politics in Aquileia, a battle that Cécile has come out on top. The time of the people is now, and the Gaudreau name is finally cleansed.\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"
 JER_POLITICS_GRAND_CRU_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! March 18th, 962\n\n§YBiography:§! Born in 962 in the Pridean dockyard district to a pair of pony parents, Cru was only 16 when the fire of revolution engulfed his city, but he was already at the center. A story involving him even says he was the pony to raise the commune's banner to the city's prison fortress, signaling the revolt's start. Unfortunately for the revolutionaries, Pridea became a slaughter ground as the guns of Dennis Discret destroyed their fledgling revolt. Cru only escaped the city with help from an unlikely source, a fellow pony and an early MPA member, who held republican sympathies.\n\nAfter being spirited away to the Capital, Cru became connected to a network of Republican stay-behinds who operated after the revolution. To support himself, he opened a barbershop, which became a hotbed of revolutionary action, as well as a place many Royal agents got trims, acting as excellent intelligence gathering. Over these years, Cru developed his ideas, wishing to apply the Pridean dream to all Aquileia. He envisioned a network of democratic socialist states across Griffonia and published books and pamphlets with his ideas, at first failing to realize the effect he was having on the revolution as a whole. He only realized his near fame when a young griffon asked him for an autograph one day in his barbershop, and after his horror abated, he decided he should embrace this, and try to take a more leading role in the revolution overall. Quickly becoming a leading force in the PAT's moderate wing, and getting his iconic nickname "The Big Fellow" for his friendly demeanor.\n\nNow Cru stands on top of his world, ready to guide the revolution to a place the old guard can not, and then make way for a new generation of revolution for all his comrades.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! bunnyshrubby"
 JER_POLITICS_CREPE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! May 2nd, 987\n\n§YBiography:§! Born a decade after the year of revolutions, Sugar Crepe's childhood was marred by the consequences of the Aquileian republic. Living within the small pony enclave of the capital Aquila, her parents tried to shelter her from the often hostile city environment. The "Boulevard des Poneys" in the capital was considered a reactionary neighborhood by the city's citizens, and the ponies who lived there were often regarded as violent monarchists. The truth, as always, was far more complex, but perception often matters more. Regardless of this stereotype, or perhaps even because of it, Sugar became obsessed with the revolution of 978 and began to join clubs that connected her with moderate republican elements. This soon merged with her other passion, music, and she began writing republican hymns like "Cette terre est votre terre" and the "Chanson Frontale Unie".\n\nBut her fame really took off during the second revolution, where her fiery musical performances and powerful personality attracted many followers. Aligning herself with the FJA, many expected her to just serve as a party mouthpiece, but were quickly proven wrong when Cécile Gaudreau saw promise in the unicorn, and took her under her wing as a political protegé, and Sugar quickly proved she was an extremely intelligent individual. However, this is where Sugar Crepes more... eccentric personality traits came to the forefront. She loudly played music during some assemblé meetings, declaring the subject at claw not worth discussing as she already had the answer. She made a habit of purposefully infuriating Léonard Rodier at every opportunity, though even he can not deny her near genius. So even still, following Gaudreau's transfer of power, Sugar Crepe has been elected to lead the Aquileian republic into a new bright future, draped in Blue White and Red.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Neither"
 JER_POLITICS_THIBAULT_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! December 12th, 963\n\n§YBiography:§! During the first revolution, Thibault Devereux was apprenticed to a county clerk and had few political ambitions. Yet, during the reprisals against the revolutionaries in Pridea, he was dragged into it when a republican by the name of Felix Georges hid in his shed and his overzealous pursuers chose to not ask questions when they came looking for him. Wounded over the eye and barely escaping with his life alongside the republican, Thibault ended up fleeing to Skyfall. Felix and his compatriots, grateful for his aid welcomed him into their exiled family in gratitude for his help. Thibault had planned to create a new life of quiet in Skyfall, but kept getting dragged back into the orbit of the group. He was soon forced to choose between getting involved with them or see them bumble their way into prison or worse.\n\nThis ramshackle introduction to the revolutionary cause contrasts sharply to his later accomplishments, as he quickly not only rose to the challenge, but became a noted writer and leader for the revolutionaries in exile. His series of pamphlets, "What do the republicans desire?" reached widespread acclaim and gave him a reputation as one of the great thinkers of the post-revolution era. Their methodical reasoning for how a post-revolutionary should be organised and the reasoning for them did much to rally support for the movement, especially when his conclusions came to line up neatly with those of Grand Cru, who began to correspond with Thibault and eventually recruited him into the PAT. Thibault has chosen to not speak about how the pamphlets were for himself as he tried to figure out what he even wanted, and that an overzealous Felix printed them without his knowledge.\n\nThibault has now reached the highest position possible, and while he does not quite know how he achieved it, he knows that just like in Skyfall people depend on him. If all he can do is to do the best he can, then that is what he will do.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Vanilla Swirl"
 JER_POLITICS_ALLARD_2_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! ????, 969\n\n§YBiography:§! Victor Allard's story is an uniquely twisty and complicated one, and Allard does little to dispel the mysteries around his origin. Speaking with a carefully cultivated standard Aquileian accent and mixing expressions from across the nation, he appears as if he stepped out of the shadows one day. As far as most know him, he turned up at Grand Cru's barbershop one day and discussed politics with him at length. He soon became a regular, and even as many others would only stop by once or twice on occasion, he kept showing up. His own brand of revolutionary fervor was a radical such, and he advocated tactics of a kind much more brutal than the first revolution had seen. The two's intellectual sparring matches continued every week for several months, drawing many to the socialist movement itself as griffons came to watch and listen.\n\nThough Allard was at best suspicious of the moderate vision that Grand Cru presented, the many triumphs of the PAT both in Aquileia and against the Empire in recent years has changed his viewpoint of the system. And although his new, much more moderate course has swayed many within the party, there are still many others who remain dubious of his intentions. Those who approach him as friends find a charming, if acerbic, figure with a wry sense of humour and a keen, unique understanding of both politics and socialist ideology. Those who treat him as a potential villain see a smug griffon who seems to enjoy getting a rise out of people and play on their naivete.\n\nNone of that matters to Allard, though. He will continue to lead Aquileia the way he always has: through logical socialist policies and decision-making. Or at least, what is logical to him.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! bunnyshrubby"

 JER_POLITICS_VIVIENNE_2_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! May 9th, 983\n\n§YBiography:§! Born far from the kingdom her family ruled, Vivienne Discret's first memories were not of the royal halls of the palace in Aquileia, but of the warm white walls of the Saddle Arabian emir's court. Aquileia was in chaos, with the death throes of the Revolution turning the rivers red with blood. The Discret family tree had been sheared of its branches by the guillotine, leaving only five surviving dynasts to escape, with Vivienne as the future of the royal lineage. As forces loyal to the monarchy secured their kingdom for them, the royal family waited out the bloodshed from afar, safe from the chaos.\n\nWhen she finally returned to Aquileia, she was immediately surrounded with a veritable army of tutors and scholars. Given the disposition of her father, however, many doubted that the young princess would be keen to learn what they had to say. Fortunately, Vivienne took to her studies and learned well. Better still, they became her passion. The young griffoness read any books she could get her talons on, and touring the countryside became as important to her as her studies. All who met her found her charming and instantly disarming, her wit leaving them impressed for a griffon barely an adult. The nobility of Aquileia and those loyal to the crown knew that the kingdom would be in good claws when it was her turn to take the throne, and many hoped behind closed doors that some unfortunate accident would befall Moriset so his talented and ambitious daughter could take the throne.\n\nNow, these believers have been proven correct. Vivienne stands atop her new Empire, and looks across the land, a continent ruled by her dynasty alone, with pride. There is no greater title worthy of her than Empress, and so she shall rule till the end of her days.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"
 JER_char_himir_desc:0 "Chimère Oncrena was born in the first Aquileian republic to a family of minor nobles who fell from grace during the first revolution. Though her family were nobility, they were bankrupted during the revolution as they bowed their heads and surrendered their lands instead of risking the republicans' wrath. Wise investments kept them from starvation, but it meant that Hímír grew up among commoners during the first years of her life.\n\nAfter the Discret restoration, the Oncrena family regained their old holdings and status, leaving Hímír to rise from running on the streets with her friends playing to the high-society life of the resurgent nobility. Though she learned and adapted to her new surroundings, she never quite forgot her childhood friends and never quite felt at home among the nobility. As she grew up and joined the the royal military academy, she outwardly appeared to be the perfect noble daughter of the resurgent Oncrena family. In secret though, she joined the underground republican movement the very day she entered the academy as well."

 ### Characters

 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewodora the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father, King Mawkonnen, ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her for a long time due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon, especially by his father. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and, with his royal authority, was able to immediately marry Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned and he had lost a part of his right ear, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."
 ABY_slave_leader:0 "Sharp Spear"
 ABY_slave_leader_desc:0 "Sharp Spear was a young soldier in the Maregyptian army when the Manedalusian War broke out in 988. In the fervor of nationalism that followed the Kingdom's proclamation of independence from Saddle Arabia, she eagerly went to fight in the frontline against the perfidious felines. Yet in the chaos of battle, she was wounded and taken prisoner by the enemy. Not long after a ceasefire was declared, and like many other prisoners of war, she was enslaved.\n\nAs a healthy and able-bodied pegasus mare, she was a valuable slave and changed owners several times. She ended up working at a coffee plantation in the highlands of Catorahe, where she befriended a zebra slave called Bontu. Their owner was a cruel aristocat who saw them as little more than property and treated them poorly. Bontu warned that many escapee slaves died quickly, but Sharp Spear did not heed her warning and managed to escape the plantation, promising to one day return and free her friend.\n\nSurviving alone was difficult, but she eventually met a group of other runaway slaves. They lived a life of aimless banditry, seeking to do nothing more than to survive. Yet Sharp Spear was burning with ambition. She convinced the group to conduct raids to free other slaves and increase their numbers, while also contacting other groups of rebellious slaves. Within years, she had become a leader of thousands of slaves who desired nothing more than to keep their freedom. Yet it was not enough for her to free all slaves. To avoid repeating the past, she dreamt of making Abyssinia a better place that could be a friend to Maregypt: a nation where all races were equal, all property was shared and all decisions were made by democratic votes. It remains to be seen if she can make her dream into a reality."
 ABY_catrina_catwe:0 "Catrina Tabby"
 ABY_catrina_catwe_desc:0 "Catrina is a direct descendant of the Catwe kings and queens who once ruled Abyssinia for two hundred years. While this makes her technically a noble, she has no special legal privileges or formal status as the Clawomons stripped her family of any such things. Nevertheless, she is far more wealthy and influential than any mere common cat. While her relatives were kept in check by a strong central government, Catrina was able to use the recent chaos as a ladder to climb up in Abyssinian society. With many blaming the Clawomons for the numerous problems that plagued the Kingdom, she proposed herself as a tempting alternative. The nobles were especially dissatisfied with the Clawomons due to their modernizing reforms, and many of them quickly rallied behind Catrina, as out of all pretenders to the throne, she has by far the strongest claim to it.\n\nBut Catrina has no intention of being a mere lackey of the nobles. The invasion of the Storm King opened up her eyes to a simple truth of life: it is better to be among the mighty than caged at someone's command. Abyssinia had long been dominated by foreign powers and other races, but she had ambitious plans that would change everything. Underneath her family mansion, she conducts secret experiments that may well change the fate of catkind forever..."
 ABY_catra_meowmeow:0 "Catra Meowmeow"
 ABY_queen_morticia:0 "Morticia Addisu"
 ABY_queen_morticia_desc:0 "Being born as a daughter of King Mawkonnen's sister Addisu meant that Morticia was privileged from the start as one of the members of the House of Clawomon. Yet unlike some of her relatives, she never let it inflate her ego. A kittenhood friendship with a servant ensured she'd feel empathy for those who were deemed "commoners" in Abyssinian society. After her mother's death, she used her inherited wealth for philanthropy and buying freedom for slaves owned by the Kingdom's nobility. While she had to firmly stand her ground against most of her family, her cousin Gomez admired her generosity and kindness. As the two lived under the same roof, they had long been familiar with each other. However, it came as a shock to their relatives when they announced that they were lovers. Gomez's father King Mawkonnen disapproved of the relationship and forbade their marriage. The two had to wait until his death to finally hold a private wedding ceremony by themselves. Thus, Morticia became Queen consort of Abyssinia.\n\nDespite the controversy with her husband and the fact that the nobility look down upon her, Morticia is very popular among the common cats. This is because she genuinely cares for their well-being and, thanks to her confidence, acts as the public face of the monarchy while Gomez is more withdrawn. Nevertheless, some radicals still believe she is just acting or pretending and that she only gave out wealth to increase her own popularity and influence."
 ABY_nathaniel_claw:0 "Nathaniel Claw"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen_desc:0 "Ever since being a kitten, Dejen has been fascinated with statecraft. He was born to a middle-class family and his parents poured all their savings to afford a good education for him. Thankfully, he was naturally gifted at absorbing and handling information, even if his peers saw him as distant and emotionless. As Abyssinia modernized, it started to develop a fledgling modern bureaucracy which was always in need of cats like Dejen, who loved nothing more than dull paperwork. Within a few years, King Mawkonnen recognized Dejen's talents and appointed him as the new Minister of the Pen, Tsehafe Taezaz. This made him the King's right-paw cat, who ensured all his commands would be fulfilled in practice. He served Mawkonnen for only a short time however before he passed away and his son Gomez inherited the throne. Despite all the difficulties during his reign, Dejen tolerated him and focused on doing his job. Yet after the Storm King's invasion broke Gomez's mind completely, he wondered if someone more competent could replace the King. After all, he had always cared more about Abyssinia than about the monarch."
 ABY_colonel_meow:0 "Meow Frown"
 ABY_colonel_meow_desc:0 "While formally being the General of the Crown Guard, Meow Frown is widely known as "The Colonel". He is the highest ranking professional soldier in the Kingdom, having served in the Guard for many years and proving his devotion to the Kingdom of Abyssinia. During the Storm King's invasion, he led the defence of Panthera and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy despite being outnumbered and outgunned. The Crown Guard stood by Gomez's side even as he surrendered to the invader.\n\nOutside of his military career, Meow is known for holding the world record for longest cat fur. Despite his scowl, he is rather friendly off-duty, especially after he has drunk some of his favourite scotch."
 ABY_ras_tardar:0 "Tardar Sourpuss"
 ABY_ras_tardar_desc:0 "As Tsahife Lam, she is the second highest ranking military officer (see: "The Mesafint (And The Royalty) In A Nutshell"). Maintaining the role of the nobility as leaders of the military is a vital goal for her. She is known for her grumpy and pessimistic personality."

 ABY_ras_thurston:0 "Thurston Waffles"
 ABY_ras_thurston_desc:0 "The Ras of Tigeray can be described as a sycophant, always trying to earn the favour of the monarchy. This does not mean that he always approves of his liege's actions. In fact, he can protest quite loudly. He rules over the strategically vital and prosperous port city of Tigeray, which acts as Abyssinia's gateway to the wider world."

 ABY_MGY_ankha_desc:0 ""All that glitters is not gold.""
 ABY_rep:0 "Rep"
 ABY_rep_desc:0 "Rep is an unusual sight in Abyssinia. He is not a cat, but a wingless young adult dragon. Catrina, the female pretender to the throne of Abyssinia, has long been his closest friend, but Rep is growing concerned with her ever-growing ambitions and grand plans. He is nostalgic for simpler days when the two lived a happy life together. While Catrina becomes increasingly ruthless over time, Rep retains his sympathy and tries his best to protect others from Catrina's wrath."
 #Yet he is able to use magic to shapeshift into many forms like a changeling can, so his true race is a mystery to everyone except Catrina.
 ABY_the_patriot:0 "The Patriot"
 ABY_the_patriot_desc:0 "No one really knows who the Patriot is. His identity is a well-kept secret and he spends much of his time in hiding, refusing to make any public appearances. Somehow, he became the supreme leader of the Abyssinian Patriotic Front, a devout nationalist resistance movement, yet only the higher ranking members of the organization know how or why. Theories and rumours about him spread like wildfire. Some theorize he is in fact King Gomez, a few claim King Mawkonnen has risen from the dead, while others say he is a former notorious bandit and murderer turned freedom fighter. Whatever the truth is, it is clear the Patriot will use any methods possible to liberate Abyssinia and enact brutal vengeance upon the enemies of felinekind."
 ABY_random_clawomon:0 "Mewditu Mawyam"
 ABY_oc_general:0 "Clock Muraqie"
 ABY_oc_general_desc:0 "Clock Muraqie was born in the early 980s. Growing up in Coltoba, his upbringing was rough due a combination of the war between Abyssinia and Maregypt as well as the general unstability in the region. His family was lucky to not be enslaved during this time, allowing Clock to become a clockmaker and open a small shop in the mid-990s. When the Storm Kingdom invaded Abyssinia, Coltoba was not spared and Clock's shop was ransacked by yeti troops and set aflame. In a failed attempt to save whatever he could, he was caught in the fire. He survived, but was left with singed hair and coat.\n\nLeft impoverished, he had no choice but to become a slave to survive. Experiencing slavery firsthoof only made him hate it more when he faced mistreatment from his new owner. So when he heard rumours from other slaves of a brewing slave revolt, he was eager to help out. Using his knowledge of time from all the clock making he had done, he kept track of the schedules of the guards and his owner to just barely escape while the former were switching shifts and the latter was asleep. After a difficult journey through the countryside, he found other escaped slaves and eventually joined the larger rebel movement. His clockmaking and timekeeping abilities allowed several guerilla raid operations to be carried out successfully. Eventually he rose through the unofficial ranks of the slave army and became one of its leading figures."
 ABY_spymaster:0 "Mittens the Spymaster"
 ABY_spymaster_desc:0 "No one knows what she actually looks like."
 ABY_donkey_general:0 "Sennacherib"
 ABY_donkey_general_desc:0 "A proud Asstyrian donkey and a former soldier, who in his youth got into a heated argument that escalated into a hooffight. Afterwards he was sentenced into slavery for his crimes and was eventually sold abroad to an Abyssinian noble to work on their coffee plantation. Despite spending several decades in slavery, he never submitted and endured harsh physical and psychological punishments for his disobedience. He attempted to escape several times, was recaptured, was punished, was sold off to another noble, and so on, over and over again.\n\nWhen a group of slave rebels under Sharp Spear's command rescued him alongside many other slaves, he showed little gratitude, claiming that he had planned to escape again anyways. Yet soon enough, his determined and confident attitude had earned the respect of his fellow slaves. His military experience meant that he often complained about the incompetence of other slaves and asserted himself in a commanding role during several raids. One day, Sharp Spear recognized his talents and promoted him to one of the commanding officers of the slave liberation army. This proved to be controversial, as many soldiers under his command complained of his harsh discipline and unyielding attitude."
 ABY_horse_general:0 "Fahd Al-Kasaar"
 ABY_horse_general_desc:0 "Born into slavery in Yemane, Fahd was always an obedient and hard worker. He received no education and spent much of his life carrying and hauling heavy objects. When his owner received a lucrative offer from an Abyssinian merchant, he was sold to an Abyssinian noble to work as her personal steed. That was when his obedient spirit started to crack, as the feline treated him more like an animal than a slave, feeding him nothing but oats and keeping him in a stable. Eventually he reached his limit and kicked his owner in the ribs, crushing her chest and galloping away to escape. His strong physique allowed him to survive in the wilderness for many weeks until he was finally found by a group of armed slaves led by a pony called Sharp Spear.\n\nSince then, Fahd has always been grateful to Sharp for saving him and even swore an oath to serve her for the rest of his life. While she claimed all slaves were free to do as they wished, Fahd remained by her side and acted as her personal bodyguard. Over time, he earned Sharp's trust and was soon allowed to lead a raid on his own despite his lack of experience. Through his charisma and determination, the raid was a rousing success and Fahd was promoted to a high rank in the slave liberation army. While some question his intelligence and lack of education, soldiers under his command like him for his sarcastic sense of humour as well as a friendly and easy-going attitude, while Sharp likes him for his undying loyalty and unconditional obedience. And the sarcasm, though she doesn't admit it."
 ABY_com_hc1:0 "Merkurioz Zoba"
 ABY_com_hc1_desc:0 "Merkurioz Zoba is a zebra from Alwani who was once a proud Zubian desert warrior. His life changed after a raid on a caravan heading to Timbucktu failed completely. Afterwards, he was banished abroad and lived as a vagrant bandit in Abyssinia before being captured by the retinue of a feline noble. He then endured several years of slavery until managing to escape and returning to banditry once more. One day he ambushed a group of rebellious slaves in the desert, but despite having the upper hoof, yielded and stopped fighting as soon as he realized who they were. The slaves he had attacked took him prisoner and brought him to Sharp Spear, who decided to not only spare him, but recruit him for her army. Despite initial distrust, Merkurioz soon proved himself to be an expert in guerrilla warfare, conducting numerous raids on slave owners and freeing hundreds of slaves."
 ABY_com_hc2:0 "Enkara"
 ABY_com_hc2_desc:0 "Enkara is a donkey from Anseruk who was a high-ranking priest, before her rivals framed her for a crime she didn't commit and had her sentenced into slavery. After some years, an Abyssinian noble bought her for a high price, seeing her as a fine addition to their exotic 'harem of four-legged concubines'. This disgusting treatment was not tolerated even for a day by Enkara, who in a fit of anger murdered her owner. She was severely punished for this, but her act of murder made her undesirable as a slave. Unable to sell her for even a low price, the Abyssinian merchant who now owned her decided to let her go into the desert wilderness. Rather than starving to death, she managed to find other runaway slaves and used her experience as a religious leader to form a small army of her own. After over a decade of fighting, she had become a seasoned veteran of war. Initially she was skeptical of Sharp Spear's own slave liberation army and stubbornly refused to join it, but after a failed raid on an outpost, her ranks were decimated and she had no choice but to ask Sharp Spear to recruit her."
 ABY_com_hc3:0 "Tamrat Pawit"
 ABY_com_hc3_desc:0 "Cats are a rare sight in the slave liberation army. One of them, Tamrat Pawit, is a self-proclaimed "freedom fighter" who claims to oppose all forms of slavery, though he hails from Klugetown and also has an extensive criminal record. While he certainly is immoral, he has also proven to be a talented infantry commander. He has yet to lose a battle against the enemy, a fact he certainly likes to brag about."

 ### National Spirits
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which, according to the Abyssinian version of the treaty, stipulated that Abyssinia "temporarily leased" the island of Purrsia in exchange for development aid and trade agreements. However, it was later discovered the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed the island was permanently transferred to them, which soured relations.\n\nThings became even worse when the Storm King sacked and burned Abyssinia. Rather than a potential ally on Zebrica, Abyssinia now appeared more like a weak and helpless country. Wingbardy took advantage of this, seizing the port city of Katren and forcing King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the recent seizure as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewodora II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races.

 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in the current time of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them.

 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. As cats are also obligate carnivores, the rest of arable land is used for cattle fodder. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of importing tonnes of meat from abroad, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."

As such, they have an infrastructure in place to produce enough meat for export at a relatively low price."
 ABY_WNG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Wingbardy"
 ABY_WNG_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing economic ties have made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Wingbardy. Unlike most neighbouring countries, griffons do consume meat, and the Wingbardians are more than happy to export some to Abyssinian markets. However, they are also trying to profit as much as possible while knowing Abyssinia's desperate need for food, so the prices aren't fair in the slightest."

 ABY_famine:0 "Famine"
 ABY_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen exponentially recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season.

When the Crown Guard attempted to catch her, she climbed atop a lamp pole with remarkable dexterity, resulting in a miniature siege. The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap] himself intervened, and, contrary to what anyone was expecting him to say, thanked her for hitting him. He then ordered the guard to stand down. The dark blue cat descended and apologized to the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap], offering him a pretzel out of all things. Gomez had no idea where she had gotten Griffonian food from, especially as cats were carnivores and did not eat baked goods, but accepted the apology nonetheless. This was the start of a rather peculiar friendship."

 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "During his reign, King Mawkonnen had founded the Bank of Abyssinia, a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. With the recent economic instability, I advise that this near-bankrupt bank is liquidated and replaced with a fully state-owned bank that will give us greater control of the economy."
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard:0 "Abandon The Gold Standard"
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "For about a century now, the Abyssinian purr has been a gold standard currency, backed by the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] treasury of the monarchy. Unfortunately, the Storm King's recent unauthorized permanent loan has caused rapid deflation due to lack of gold. I've been saying this for a while now, but it is finally time to move away from the gold standard."
 ABY_seek_trade_partners:0 "Seek New Trade Partners"
 ABY_seek_trade_partners_desc:0 "Abyssinia has long been a trading nation, yet the Storm King's invasion and resulting regional instability have left many merchants idle.

 ABY_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Public spending is one way to recover from economic disasters. Until now, we've lacked the funds, but thanks to the recent endeavours we can finally launch infrastructure projects across the realm. This will provide jobs for thousands of cats.

Of course, this infrastructure could have other uses as well."
 ABY_import_food:0 "Import Food"
 ABY_import_food_desc:0 "Abyssinia hasn't been self-reliant on food for many decades now, after much of our limited farmlands were dedicated to growing cash crops like coffee. Now that we've attempted to establish new trade routes, our merchants have the capital they need to restart food imports. Unfortunately, most of our neighbours are herbivores and we need meat more urgently than cattle feed, so our options are limited."
 ABY_distribute_food:0 "Open Soup Kitchens"
 ABY_distribute_food_desc:0 "The main cause of hunger is not necessarily food production, but distribution. Due to feudal taxation, many peasants cannot afford to buy food when they are unable to produce enough themselves. To increase societal food security, [ROOT.ABY_queen_loc_cap] Morticia proposes that we should establish food distribution centers or "soup kitchens" to provide free meals for the hungry cats."
 ABY_repurpose_plantations:0 "Plantations Into Pastures"
 ABY_repurpose_plantations_desc:0 "Much of the arable land in Abyssinia is currently used for growing cash crops, especially coffee.

 ABY_ban_slave_trade:0 "End The Slave Trade"
 ABY_ban_slave_trade_desc:0 "After feline slavery was brought to a sudden end, imports of slaves into Abyssinia increased drastically as trade of non-feline slaves had not been forbidden.

 ABY_ban_slave_baby:0 "Freedom Of Wombs"
 ABY_ban_slave_baby_desc:0 "So far, slave owners have assumed that any offspring of slaves inherit their status from their parents, similarly to how offspring of cattle instantly become property of the parents' owner.

 ABY_revised_plan_desc:0 "King Mawkonnen's economic development plan, which you continued to follow until the Storm King's forceful restructuring of our economy, relied heavily on cooperation with Wingbardy. Now that they have shown their true colors, we need to formulate a new plan for the modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_noble_council:0 "Cooperate With Aristocats"
 ABY_noble_council_desc:0 "Implementing the modernization plan will require cooperation with local governors who manage economic affairs. While most nobles are content maintaining agrarianism focused on export of cash crops, some of them have more ambitious plans and would be more than willing to work together with us."
 ABY_protectionist_taxation:0 "Protectionist Taxation"
 ABY_protectionist_taxation_desc:0 "Your predecessors trusted the griffons, and in return they immediately sought to exploit our nation. So far, foreign companies have been given concessions to conduct business freely, but this gives them an unfair advantage. By introducing new taxes, we will force them out of Abyssinia and allow our domestic businesses to grow."
 ABY_merchant_council:0 "Summon The Negadras"
 ABY_merchant_council_desc:0 "Implementing the modernization plan will require cooperation with local merchants who are most directly impacted by our policies. The Negadras, head of the merchants, is an influential figure largely responsible for running our economy. They are far more eager about the prospects of industrialisation and foreign trade than the conservative nobles are."
 ABY_centralized_development:0 "Invest In The Catital"
 ABY_centralized_development_desc:0 "The city of Panthera, along with its hinterland, is already the most developed region in the realm, only rivaled by Coltoba. As such, there is a solid foundation to build upon. With the provinces under the control of local nobles, putting funds into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] capital is a guaranteed way to empower your central authority."
 ABY_catpany:0 "Sign Contract With CAT Incorporated"
 ABY_catpany_desc:0 "It is difficult to overstate how many construction projects are required to create a modern nation. All of them require immense resources which in turn need well-organized logistics. Working together with nascent construction equipment manufacturers is a vital step towards the full modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_decentralized_development:0 "Invest In The Provinces"
 ABY_decentralized_development_desc:0 "While Panthera can be called a somewhat modern city, the same cannot be said for the outlying provinces, many of which are ruled by nobles who either lack the will or the funds to develop their own lordships. For Abyssinia to truly modernize, we must distribute development more evenly across the realm."
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection:0 "Improve The Tigeray-Panthera Connection"
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection_desc:0 "The port city of Tigeray is Panthera's gate to the wider world. Existing transportation infrastructure is sufficient for our current needs, but if we want to further grow the capital then it is vital to expand it. The railway will be improved, the harbour shall be expanded and new paved roads will be built."
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company:0 "Invest In The General Goods Company"
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company_desc:0 "I have recently learned about a successful small business called the General Goods Company. Yes, the name doesn't have a cat pun. They manufacture a wide variety of goods that are purchased both by our civilians and the military. If we provided them with increased funds, they could greatly expand their production, benefitting the entire nation."
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces:0 "Connect The Provinces"
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces_desc:0 "A railway was built years ago to connect Tigeray, Panthera and Aspurra. Though this has secured the logistics of the capital, the rest of our country has been neglected. Therefore I recommend we undertake a great project to expand the railway network across the entire realm, connecting all notable settlements."
 ABY_car_company:0 "Subsidize Hissan Motors"
 ABY_car_company_desc:0 "Hissan Motors is a fledgling and struggling car manufacturer that has difficulty competing with overseas imports of vehicles. If we provided them with subsidies, they would gain a competitive advantage that could help them gain a pawhold on the market."
 ABY_ship_company:0 "Establish A State-Owned Dockyard"
 ABY_ship_company_desc:0 "So far, the needs of the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy are fulfilled by various small shipping companies as well as foreign imports. If we used our funds to found a dockyard, personally owned by you, we could have a more reliable supplier for all naval needs."
 ABY_airplane_company:0 "Sign A Deal With Leopardo Holdings"
 ABY_airplane_company_desc:0 "Leopardo Holdings is a company owned by a noble who is fascinated with aircraft. Under her personal patronage, the company has been able to compete against imported planes. However, the noble does not have an infinite supply of money to sustain the company. We should approach her and sign a deal where Leopardo will get the exclusive right to make planes for us."
 ABY_panthera_dam:0 "Build The Grand Panthera Dam"
 ABY_panthera_dam_desc:0 "Modern industries and households consume immense amounts of energy. Energy that could be easily generated by damming the Panther river that flows next to the capital. Of course, it would reduce the amount of water flowing downstream and create a large reservoir, but a single dam would be enough to power the country for years to come."
 ABY_desert_irrigation:0 "Irrigating The Desert"
 ABY_desert_irrigation_desc:0 "While vast irrigation projects were conducted in the past century along the Panter river, the same cannot be said for the eastern Tiger river. It would only be fair to invest in the poorer eastern provinces as well. Irrigation would not only increase rural productivity, but provide local industries with more vital water."
 ABY_textile_factory:0 "Support The Yarn Industry"
 ABY_textile_factory_desc:0 "Yarn production is one of the mainstays of the Abyssinian economy. It is a sensible investment for us, and would help ensure all of our citizens and soldiers get any clothing they desire or need. This in turn would provide increased employment and boost the economy in general."
 ABY_salt_mine:0 "Open The Dollo Salt Mine"
 ABY_salt_mine_desc:0 "The dry endorheic basin of Dollo is one of the largest deposits of salt on Zebrica. Any rainwater that flows into it from the mountains ends up evaporating, which over the millennia has created a great source of salt. If we invested into opening a salt mine, we could provide plenty of this vital resource which can be used to conserve fish and other foods."
 ABY_steel_foundry:0 "Construct The Panthera Steel Foundry"
 ABY_steel_foundry_desc:0 "Modernization requires truly vast amounts of refined high-grade steel. This in turn needs a large-scale industrial operation that converts coal, flux stone and iron en masse into steel. Therefore I recommend we launch a construction project in Panthera with the intention to build one of the largest foundries on Zebrica."
 ABY_expand_mines:0 "Expand Mining Operations"
 ABY_expand_mines_desc:0 "There are many mines scattered across the ore-rich mountains of Abyssinia. Most of them are operated by private individuals such as nobles, and utilize manual labour to arduously extract minerals. The state clearly needs to intervene to expand and modernize these mines, and in exchange receive a share of the profits."
 ABY_modern_healthcare:0 "Provide Modern Healthcare"
 ABY_modern_healthcare_desc:0 "Industrial work is prone to accidents, and increased pollution causes many health issues. As such, workers are increasingly demanding better access to healthcare. There is no reason for us to not provide them with what they want. I suggest we begin establishing a state-owned healthcare system, staffed by skilled professionals."
 ABY_elektirsity:0 "Electrify The Nation"
 ABY_elektirsity_desc:0 "While cats don't need electric lamps to light up the streets, electricity can be used for countless different purposes. It can be said that electricity is the foundational pillar of truly modern societies. Not only will our industry utilize it, but the citizens as well, to power their household appliances. The military can get a use out of it, too."
 ABY_r_and_d_center:0 "Center Of Research and Technological Development"
 ABY_r_and_d_center_desc:0 "In cooperation with the leading companies of Abyssinia, we should establish a centralized facility for conducting scientific research. This would not only lead to new, innovative products, but give us a place among the advanced nations of the world."
 
 ABY_ban_child_labour:0 "Outlaw Kitten Labour"
 ABY_ban_child_labour_desc:0 "While the literacy program of King Mawkonnen, your father, has been very successful at rapidly increasing the literacy rate of adults, we can't forget about the kittens too. Many youth do not attend school as they work as employees instead. It is finally time we ban the use of underaged workers and make school attendance mandatory."
 ABY_support_royal_academy:0 "Found The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Academy"
 ABY_support_royal_academy_desc:0 "To cultivate intellectualism in Abyssinia, we should create a national academy under your patronage. It will promote enlightenment, preservation of traditional values and research to increase the prosperity and well-being of your subjects. Its duty will also be to ostracize intellectuals with excessively radical or dangerous ideologies."
 ABY_standardized_language:0 "Standardize The Abyssinian Language"
 ABY_standardized_language_desc:0 "The Abyssinian language and its script are both almost a thousand years old. However, especially in the provinces other dialects and even languages are spoken. Through education, we should ensure our tongue is used identically across Abyssinia to facilitate communication and enforce the unity of the realm."
 ABY_university_of_panthera:0 "Establish The University of Abyssinia"
 ABY_university_of_panthera_desc:0 "Abyssinia has so far lacked a public institution of tertiary education. Now that we are civilized enough, it is time to create one. The new state university will be located in the capital, spread out across multiple campuses such as Rockadia, and admit only those who pass the challenging entrance exams to prove their worth."
 
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion:0 "Analyze The Storm King's Invasion"
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion_desc:0 "While our defeat to the Storm King was a bitter drop to swallow, we must not get stuck in the past. Instead, we need to investigate what went wrong and draft plans for improving our armed forces, so we can repel any other invaders in the future. Failures are to be learned from, after all."
 ABY_modernizing_navy:0 "Modernize The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy"
 ABY_modernizing_navy_desc:0 "Modernizing our naval forces means not only refitting our ships, but also updating our combat stratagems. The long coast and many overseas trade routes of our country can only be secured by a navy that knows how to fight against advanced and well-organized opponents."
 ABY_professional_army:0 "Professionalize The Army"
 ABY_professional_army_desc:0 "Most of the Abyssinian army, besides the small contingent of Crown Guard, consists of feudal levies drafted from the provinces. Their lack of training meant that they melted away before a superior foe. Replacing them with proper full-time professional soldiers would not only reduce our reliance on nobles, but improve the quality of the army as well."
 ABY_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Catscription"
 ABY_mass_conscription_desc:0 "One explanation for our military weakness is our relatively small population, which results in a lack of catpower for the army. This issue can be addressed by expanding conscription and making it every subject's sworn duty to serve in the army if needed. Of course, conscription has traditionally been the duty of nobility, so we must be careful with them."
 ABY_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 ABY_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "Instead of trying to fix our own army, we could simply hire experienced soldiers from abroad. There are plenty of options available on the mercenary market. Unfortunately, they are rather expensive and they are only loyal to money, not you. But they are well worth the price."
 ABY_establish_air_force:0 "Establish The Abyssinian Air Force"
 ABY_establish_air_force_desc:0 "One of the primary reasons for our defeat against the Storm King was the complete lack of an air force, meaning we had no counter to the yeti airships. Thankfully, the hippogriffs proved the world that modern air planes rule the sky. We must simply follow their example and lay the foundations of a proper air force."
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare:0 "Asymmetric Naval Warfare"
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare_desc:0 "If we ever have to face a larger enemy navy, let's say, one belonging to an expansionist overseas griffon kingdom, then we should not try to face them in a direct confrontation. Rather, we should follow the suggestion of one of our admirals and invest in affordable yet effective submarines that can utilize hit-and-run tactics."
 ABY_convert_convoys:0 "Convert Merchant Ships"
 ABY_convert_convoys_desc:0 "As a trading nation, our mercantile class owns a substantial number of cargo vessels. We could purchase some of them at a low price, then go through the effort of converting them into warships. This would be a far more economical way to expand our navy compared to building ships from scratch."
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Officer Corps"
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion_desc:0 "While we don't lack capable leaders for our army, many officers are still aristocats who gained their positions through inheritance. We should consider making our officer corps entirely meritocratic, meaning military positions have to be earned through exemplary service."
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons:0 "Reinforce Local Garrisons"
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons_desc:0 "Protection of provinces has traditionally been the duty of local nobles who maintain their own retinues. Relying on these private armies is unwise, as was proven by their ineffectiveness during the invasion of the Storm King. We should send soldiers from the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army to not only aid the nobles, but to better defend our country."
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes:0 "Purchase Hippogriff Planes"
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes_desc:0 "The hippogriffs did what we could not, defeating the Storm King's fearsome armada of airships with nimble fighters and other planes. We should acquire some of these technological marvels for our own use, so no one can ever threaten Abyssinia from the skies again."
 ABY_pilot_training:0 "Train Pilots"
 ABY_pilot_training_desc:0 "Without the industrial capacity to build a large air force, we must instead focus on improving the quality of the personnel. Rigorous training will ensure only the finest pilots will defend the skies of Abyssinia from the enemy. Hopefully, they will be able to face off against greater numbers and even seemingly impossible odds."
 ABY_cattier:0 "A Converted Cattier"
 ABY_cattier_desc:0 "During the reign of your father, construction began on a Mawkonnen-class dreadnought that was never finished and was left abandoned. It can be put to use again. However, modern naval warfare appears to rely heavily on air support, so it'd make more sense to make it into a carrier, I mean, cattier instead."
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs:0 "Steal Wingbardian Torpedo Designs"
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs_desc:0 "Our former friends in Wingbardy are known for their advanced torpedoes. Years of cooperation means our own ships make extensive use of the same weapon. I normally don't suggest questionable action such as this, but perhaps some industrial espionage would enable us to upgrade our torpedo designs, if you understand what I mean."
 ABY_establish_general_staff:0 "Establish General Staff"
 ABY_establish_general_staff_desc:0 "An army without proper leadership is like a headless chicken. While command of the army is centralized in you, the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap], you cannot be everywhere at once, and neither can the generals. They need organized staff groups to assist them in their role of command and control. With a meritocratic foundation hopefully in place, creating such staff should be easy."
 ABY_military_motorization:0 "Military Motorization"
 ABY_military_motorization_desc:0 "For almost a century now, the Abyssinian army has made extensive use of slaves for transportation and logistics. With slavery being phased out and domestic production of motor vehicles established, the army can now utilize trucks instead. While they do consume fuel and are prone to breaking down, they don't rebel against their owners."
 ABY_improved_occupation:0 "Counterinsurgency Experience"
 ABY_improved_occupation_desc:0 "Prolonged conflict with Manedalusian resistance has given our armed forces plenty of experience related to fighting against insurgents. This experience should be analyzed and combined with foreign military theory to greatly improve the effectiveness of our garrison units."
 ABY_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 ABY_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Ships have traditionally ruled the waves, but it appears aircraft are attempting to dethrone them. A proper modern navy must combine both sea and air power to thrive against its enemies. As such, we need to invest time and resources into naval aircraft."
 ABY_anti_air_defence:0 "Anti-Aircraft Defences"
 ABY_anti_air_defence_desc:0 "With limited industrial production capacity, we cannot necessarily build a large enough air fleet to defend the skies of the realm. As such, we need to invest in ground-based defences to protect our cities and our troops from aerial attacks."
 ABY_special_forces_shit:0 "Formalize The Special Forces"
 ABY_special_forces_shit_desc:0 "Traditionally, experienced highlanders have acted as the "special forces" of the Abyssinian army, fighting in difficult terrain and conducting challenging operations. But if we want to further expand and develop our special forces, we need to properly organize them as a modern subsection of the larger military."
 ABY_tonk:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 ABY_tonk_desc:0 "The flat desert terrain that is common in Abyssinia is ideal for armoured warfare. These so-called "tanks" can quickly overrun unprepared enemy infantry with ease, able to withstand small-arms fire. While expensive, we should still consider utilizing them in the army."
 ABY_mag_weapons:0 "Magical Stun Weapons"
 ABY_mag_weapons_desc:0 "While cats are unable to utilize magic, unicorns often use stun spells to incapacitate opponents. New technology based on crystals allows spells to be cast by any creature. Our garrisons would greatly benefit from such magical weapons. Of course, that is true for the rest of the army as well, assuming we set up the required production lines."
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent:0 "The Ultimate Deterrent"
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent_desc:0 "It is entirely possible, even likely, that our sovereignty will be threatened again and again. To secure our independence against the great powers of the world, we need the most powerful weapon in existence. Thankfully, the theories of famed physicist Alpurrt Catstein have laid the groundwork for the development of such a weapon."
 
 ABY_convene_council:0 "Convene The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_convene_council_desc:0 "The council of nobility is an advisory body consisting of the most influential nobles of Abyssinia. Its meetings have in recent years been organized by the aristocats themselves, but you, as the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap], also have the right to do so. I think it's time to summon them to the catital and remind them who is truly in charge of the country."
 ABY_assert_authority:0 "Assert Absolute Authority"
 ABY_assert_authority_desc:0 "In Abyssinia, there are traditionally no limits on the monarch's power. As much as the nobles tried to subvert this fact during the reign of the Catwe dynasty, it remains true to this day. So remember, you are not just above the law; you ARE the law."
 ABY_power_to_people:0 "Power To The People"
 ABY_power_to_people_desc:0 "You and the commoners have a common enemy: the scheming nobility. So why not forge an alliance with them? Delegate some of your [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority to competent commonfolk like me. After all, I have proven that we "mudblooded" cats can be relied upon, as we earn our wealth and power through hard work rather than just inheriting them from our parents."
 ABY_expand_crown_guard:0 "Expand The Crown Guard"
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_desc:0 "While regional levies often have secondary loyalties to their feudal liege lords, the Crown Guard is a dedicated professional force loyal to you alone. To further strengthen [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority over the nation, you should consider recruiting more members to your personal armed retinue."
 ABY_land_reform:0 "Implement Land Reform"
 ABY_land_reform_desc:0 "Almost all arable land in Abyssinia is owned by a small number of magnates, most of whom are part of the Mesafint. As such, many tenants pay high rents and can barely afford any taxes. Of course, ultimately all land in Abyssinia belongs to the crown. Therefore you have extensive authority to redistribute land as much as necessary."
 ABY_estates_assembly:0 "Establish The Assembly Of Estates"
 ABY_estates_assembly_desc:0 "As a legislative body to counterbalance the council of nobility, we shall organize the Assembly of Estates, consisting of deputies elected from all social classes. For now, their power remains limited. But if you so desire, they can be gradually given the ability to propose and pass legislation even without your approval."
 ABY_blessed_of_baast:0 "The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap] Who Turns The Wheel Of Virtue"
 ABY_blessed_of_baast_desc:0 "While the priesthood care little about politics, preferring the seclusion of their temples, great legitimacy and influence can be gained by earning their blessing. Thanks to your previous interactions with the Abuna of Felibela, you could relatively easily proclaim yourself a divine monarch who follows the path to enlightenment."
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies:0 "Outlaw Private Armies"
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies_desc:0 "Traditionally, the Mesafint have had the privilege of raising personal retinues to guard their estates. These small private armies give the aristocats military power that can be used against the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] government. As such, I highly recommend we disband these forces and integrate them into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army."
 ABY_empower_mekwanint:0 "Empower The Mekwanint"
 ABY_empower_mekwanint_desc:0 "The Abyssinian upper class has traditionally been divided into two categories: the Mesafint, hereditary elites, and the Mekwanint, the appointed officials who are often commoners. I, of course, belong to the latter group, so I may be biased. Nevertheless, I still strongly believe that we should take over some of the responsibilities of the fickle nobles."
 ABY_progressive_taxation:0 "Introduce Progressive Taxation"
 ABY_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "It is common sense that those with more wealth can afford to give a larger share of it away. However, nobles aren't known for their appreciation of common sense. Taxing the wealthier more and the poorer less would therefore be a controversial reform, yet would also greatly affect wealth inequality in favour of the masses."
 ABY_advisory_council:0 "Abolish The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_advisory_council_desc:0 "The council of nobility was originally supposed to have a purely advisory role, providing counsel to the ruling monarch. Since the reign of the Catwe dynasty however, they've had the privilege of being able to elect a new monarch at will. This dangerous political body can now finally be disbanded with a new decree. All you have to do is sign it."
 
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty:0 "Unilaterally Repeal The Treaty Of Katren"
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_desc:0 "The Katren concession is a dagger pointed at the heart of Abyssinia. However, it is protected by the Treaty of Katren, which you were pressured to sign under duress. As its legality itself is questionable, you have the right to repeal it, but know that Wingbardy might response with military force. We must be ready to fight if necessary."
 ABY_try_to_negotiate:0 "Attempt To Negotiate With Wingbardy"
 ABY_try_to_negotiate_desc:0 "You once said that "The only thing we have in common with griffons are feline rears". While that may be true, we should still seek to avoid triggering a risky armed confrontation that could end in our defeat. Diplomacy is thankfully an option, as Wingbardians haven't yet become completely unreasonable."
 ABY_liberate_katren:0 "Liberate Katren"
 ABY_liberate_katren_desc:0 "The time has come for us to reassert our sovereignty and reclaim Katren for ourselves. Of course, as the occupiers see the town as rightfully theirs, they will likely put up a fight. But chances are we can negotiate a peace treaty with them if we manage to firmly expel them from the Abyssinian mainland."
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren:0 "Request The Return Of Katren"
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren_desc:0 "The current occupiers of Katren seem to be open for negotiations. Perhaps we can convince them to vacate our territory peacefully. If not, we will still have to reclaim Katren by force, but hopefully they will listen to reason and understand that the town was seized illegally."
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia:0 "Contact The Ras of Purrsia"
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia_desc:0 "According to the deal made with Wingbardy, the Rasdom of Purrsia is temporarily under protectorate status. Of course, the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed this status is permanent, but they also agreed to respect our territorial sovereignty. Seeing how they violated this treaty, it's clear we can violate it as well."
 ABY_purchase_purrsia:0 "Purchase Purrsia"
 ABY_purchase_purrsia_desc:0 "While the Rasdom of Purrsia was legally ceded to Wingbardy, there's no reason why we couldn't legally buy it back. I'm sure that if we offer enough currency, the owners of the island would gladly sell it to us. However, the sum might end up being rather large, so we must prepare our treasury for that."
 ABY_anti_wingbardianism:0 "An Enemy Of My Enemy..."
 ABY_anti_wingbardianism_desc:0 "Wingbardy showed us how they cannot be trusted. While we have managed to expel the perfidious griffons from Abyssinia, they remain a threat to many other nations. Rather than doing nothing, we should actively support Wingbardy's enemies and oppose their expansionism. A weaker Wingbardy results in a safer Abyssinia."
 ABY_make_amends_with_wingbardy:0 "Normalize Relations With Wingbardy"
 ABY_make_amends_with_wingbardy_desc:0 "Now that territorial disputes between our two countries have been solved, there's no reason to not return to our past productive relationship with Wingbardy. After all, they greatly helped us with modernization during the past century. Forgive and forget, as they say."
 ABY_liberate_les_meridiennes:0 "Liberate Les Meridiennes"
 ABY_liberate_les_meridiennes_desc:0 "Our anti-colonial efforts have been successful. Why not continue them? Not far to the northwest, the island chain of Les Meridiennes was an Aquileian colony for well over a century. By liberating them from griffon minority rule, we not only improve our reputation, but gain strategically valuable islands."
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters:0 "Liberate Trots And Canters"
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters_desc:0 "The Trots and Canters islands were colonized by Hippogriffia some centuries ago. It has a small indigenous pony population, which is enough of a justification to militarily occupy, or "liberate", the island chain. All we need is a window of opportunity for a swift and secretive overseas operation. Perhaps when the owners of the islands are busy with conflict?"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs:0 "Military Cooperation With Mount Aris"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs_desc:0 "In recent years, Wingbardy displayed some degree of hostility towards [HIP.GetNameDef]. As such, it is in the strategic interest of both of our nations to support each other militarily, to improve security in northern Zebrica. I'm sure both of us have much to learn from each other."
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo:0 "Liberate Puerto Caballo"
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "The island of Puerto Caballo was under Equestrian dominion for a long time, but the island can hardly be called Equestrian. Yet remnants of foreign minority rule persist, despite the island nation regaining its lost freedom. It is clear they need a gracious country like Abyssinia to provide them with much-needed liberty."
 ABY_approach_equestria:0 "An Alliance With Equestria"
 ABY_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria remains the undisputed superpower, despite not exerting its influence too much abroad. Yet judging by events in Hippogriffia, Kiria and Griffonstone, this is changing. If we managed to secure an alliance with this massive nation, our own security would be guaranteed for many years to come."
 
 ABY_manedalusia_is_abyssinia:0 "Manedalusia Is Abyssinia"
 ABY_manedalusia_is_abyssinia_desc:0 "Manedalusia was part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia from 12 ALB to 672 ALB. Based on historical records, Abyssinia controlled it longer than any other country. Thus, our claim to the region is the strongest one. Of course, the previous war over the region ended in a bloody stalemate, so trying again might be risky."
 ABY_cede_manedalusia:0 "Cede Manedalusia"
 ABY_cede_manedalusia_desc:0 "With Manedalusia, we might be suffering from sunk cost fallacy. The brutal war of 988 with Maregypt and two decades of expensive occupation have been a great drain on our resources. Not only that, but our relations with the current occupiers of Manedalusia have been ruined. While controversial, abandoning Manedalusia would be a quick way to cut our losses."
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt:0 "Negotiate About The Status Of Manedalusia"
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_desc:0 "Tensions with Maregypt over Manedalusia have lasted for two decades. Rather than continuing to fight over the region, we could turn Manedalusia into a buffer state, similar to Klugetown's de facto status. It would mean both sides giving up their claims on the region in the name of mutual peace and coexistence."
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia:0 "The Province Of Manedalusia"
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia_desc:0 "In the past, Manedalusia was governed as an integral part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia, despite lacking a feline majority population. This meant the region was treated same as any other province, with local governance being the responsibility of a noble, the Basha. Integrating the region will require some degree of cooperation from the locals, however."
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia:0 "The Federal Act"
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia_desc:0 "The Manedalusians have shown that they will not easily accept a return to the previous status quo. Much has changed in the 300 or so years since we lost Manedalusia. Pro-Abyssinian ponies have proposed the formation of a federation, with Manedalusia having both extensive self-rule and some power in the central government."
 ABY_manedalusian_auxiliaries:0 "Manedalusian Auxiliaries"
 ABY_manedalusian_auxiliaries_desc:0 "After regaining Coltoba in 988, some recruitment among the local ponies was started to make use of their unique abilities such as flight and use of magic. While seen as more unreliable, ponies can nonetheless be a very effective supplement for the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army. As such, we should consider greatly expanding their recruitment."
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY:0 "Form An Alliance With Maregypt"
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY_desc:0 "With our disputes with Maregypt resolved and the relations between our two nations greatly improved, we should consider further deepening our ties to the eastern ponies. They would make for a powerful ally, and could help us avoid repeating the past, when both Kingdoms were separately subjugated by Saddle Arabia."
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2:0 "Negotiate About The Status Of Klugetown"
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2_desc:0 "Klugetown was founded as a trade outpost on an oasis in Abyssinian territory in 467 ALB. Ever since, they have done their best to act independent from us, which culminated in 947 when any Abyssinian officials were expelled and they stopped obeying our laws. After the 988 conflict, Maregypt has supported them. We should negotiate with them to have any chance in reclaiming Klugetown."
 ABY_support_ovingoland:0 "Support The Ovingoland Movement"
 ABY_support_ovingoland_desc:0 "After the Storm King's rampage, southern Maregypt was filled to the brim with zebra refugees. With Maregypt itself suffering from internal instability, these zebras have been neglected and demand better treatment. We could use these tensions to our advantage by supporting the creation of an independent zebra state which would be reliant on our aid."
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown:0 "Reassert Sovereignty Over Klugetown"
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown_desc:0 "De jure, Klugetown has been part of [ABY.GetNameDef] for centuries. De facto, it has acted like a rogue city-state ever since Saddle Arabia turned us into a tributary in 672. It is time law and order is restored in this crime-infested oasis city. Ideally, [KLG.GetLeader] will be willing to negotiate, but if not, we must be ready to use force."
 ABY_trade_with_alliance:0 "Trade With Allies"
 ABY_trade_with_alliance_desc:0 "Our new alliance enables us to establish new commercial ties with other countries.

 ABY_research_with_alliance:0 "Scientific Cooperation With Allies"
 ABY_research_with_alliance_desc:0 "Scientific advancement often requires the sharing and exchange of knowledge, as well as cooperation between researchers.

 ABY_topple_mgy_government_desc:0 "The illegitimate [MGY.Capital.GetName] regime clearly has no interest in having a peaceful and friendly relationship with us. As such, to secure our eastern border, we have no choice but to use military force to reorganize Maregyptian politics and replace [MGY.GetLeader]'s government with a more cooperative one."

 ABY_restore_law_and_order_in_KLG_desc:0 "As an independent city-state, Klugetown was ruled by the ruthless mafia boss Verko and was a hotspot for all kinds of crimes. Now that we've regained control of the wayward city, I highly recommend we send in all law enforcement officials available to clean up the mess. Then, we will hold elections for a new Kantiba, lord mayor."
 ABY_the_kloog_connection:0 "The Klugetown Connection"
 ABY_the_kloog_connection_desc:0 "Klugetown grew as a city thanks to its central location and became a nexus for desert trade routes, like the ones between Abyssinia and Maregypt or the one crossing from Coltoba to Farasrah, connecting the Manedalusian Bay to the Arabian Sea. These traditional caravans can now be replaced with modern railways and trains."

 ABY_ally_donkeys_desc:0 "The donkey states that exist downstream on the Tiger and Panther rivers were once subjects of Abyssinia, but in these modern times we can develop a more equal and amicable relationship. We should invite them to our newly formed alliance, for together we will be stronger, perhaps strong enough to even resist potential superpowers."
 ABY_dominate_donkeys:0 "Dominate The Donkeys"
 ABY_dominate_donkeys_desc:0 "In 150 ALB, Abyssinia subjugated the donkeys of the south under its rule. This lasted until the 5th century when Saddle Arabia seized the lands from us, but during that time the vassal states prospered. The donkeys have been independent since 989, but history tells us that they are unable to rule themselves. Most importantly, we can secure our wide and defenceless southern border."
 ABY_liberate_farasrah:0 "Liberate Farasrah"
 ABY_liberate_farasrah_desc:0 "The port-city of Farasrah is disputed between the donkeys and the state of Yemane. While having a mixed population of horses and donkeys, it was historically part of Anseruk before Yemane seized it with military force in the aftermath of Saddle Arabia's withdrawal from the region in 989. This gives us the casus belli we need to secure our connection to the Arabian Sea."

 ABY_just_as_according_to_keikaku_desc:0 "Historians will call it the Catwe Restoration, but for me it was just one step in my plan. There is still much work to be done, as I must first secure my rule. The nobles think I will be their puppet, so they will try to discard me if I ever even raise a claw against them. Thankfully, the nobles are also arrogant idiots. They won't realize what I'm doing until it's too late."

 ABY_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "My family managed to hide away plenty of treasure from the vengeful Clawomons. Some in secret vaults, some on offshore bank accounts, some guarded by loyalist nobles. Now that the royal treasury is ours, we can fill it with all our concealed assets. I knew how to keep my wealth safe, unlike the foolish Clawomons who lost everything."
 ABY_reduce_slave_rations:0 "Reduce Slave Rations"
 ABY_reduce_slave_rations_desc:0 "With a looming famine, I'm afraid we can no longer afford to fully feed all our precious slaves. Cats take priority. I will meet with the nobles who own the most slaves and convince them to provide less sustenance for their property as well. This should result in lowered food demand and lower prices. The slaves won't like it, but that's part of the plan."
 ABY_turn_a_blind_eye:0 "Turn A Blind Eye"
 ABY_turn_a_blind_eye_desc:0 "Slaves are property and often end up being treated as such. Slave unrest is often fueled by mistreatment and abuse, all of which is technically not against the law. The Clawomons were displeased by this and used indirect means to punish or warn nobles for such behaviour, but I will promise to do no such thing. This should please the nobles and anger the slaves."
 ABY_cash_crop_tax:0 "Introduce Taxes On Cash Crops"
 ABY_cash_crop_tax_desc:0 "At this stage I should avoid unpopular policies, but it is impossible. The Clawomons left a potential famine for me to prevent, so I have no choice but to fix the situation by any means available. I will have to introduce hefty taxes on production and sale of cash crops, to encourage nobles and peasants to herd cattle instead."
 ABY_import_food_2:0 "Purchase Food From Abroad"
 ABY_import_food_2_desc:0 "With a refilled treasury, my royal government will be able to import meat from relatively few markets available, considering most neighbouring nations are full of herbivores.

 ABY_bank_takeover:0 "Bail Out The Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_bank_takeover_desc:0 "The Bank of Abyssinia, founded by the Clawomons, is a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank.

 ABY_legalize_slavery:0 "Legalize Non-Feline Slavery"
 ABY_legalize_slavery_desc:0 "The Clawomons outlawed feline slavery many decades ago, but were either too foolish or too cowardly to explicitly forbid the enslavement of other races. Until now, this has existed as a legal loophole exploited by the nobles, making it a grey area out of the reach of the government. By rewriting the law to clearly allow limited slavery, I can gain full control."
 ABY_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
 ABY_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "Abyssinia's weakness was proved when the Clawomons failed to defend the country from the invasion of the Storm King. While my plan will eventually ensure this can never happen again, in the mean time I must launch a large-scale government-funded effort to recover from the devastation of the pillaging and destruction."
 ABY_eyes_of_the_tiger:0 "Eyes of the Tiger"
 ABY_eyes_of_the_tiger_desc:0 "My rule is anything but secure. Not only do the nobles seek to exploit me, but many cats remain loyal to the deposed Clawomons. While the Crown Guard function as my hammer with which I can crush my enemies, I need a finer tool to counter foes in a more delicate and concealed manner. A new organization of secret police shall be my dagger in the dark."
 ABY_next_step_of_plan:0 "The Next Step of the Plan"
 ABY_next_step_of_plan_desc:0 "With the slaves sufficiently riled up, they are preparing for a large-scale revolt against their masters. The nobles are desperate and unable to stop them alone, so they will now come begging for my help, at any cost. And unfortunately for them, the cost will be quite high."

 ABY_ill_come_up_with_a_name_for_this_later_desc:0 "The people of Abyssinia should understand what just happened. The slaves rose up against their rightful masters, the nobles could do nothing about them, and I stepped forth to restore order and save the country from anarchy. They must know that I am the only one who can protect our nation from certain doom."
 ABY_strengthen_garrisons:0 "Strengthen Local Garrisons"
 ABY_strengthen_garrisons_desc:0 "With the uppity slaves dealt with, I can now use the former militias of the nobles to reinforce law enforcement in the provinces.

 ABY_repurpose_slaves:0 "Repurpose the Slaves"
 ABY_repurpose_slaves_desc:0 "Working conditions on the vast plantations of the nobles were difficult, which contributed to dissatisfaction among slaves and eventually caused the revolts. With slaves now belonging to the state, I can put them to a more productive use. Factory labour may not be as profitable as growing cash crops, but it will strengthen our economy."
 ABY_distributed_arsenals:0 "Provincial Arsenals"
 ABY_distributed_arsenals_desc:0 "To prevent further slave revolts, arsenals will be distributed across the nation to provide the local garrisons with plentiful supplies of weapons they can use in emergencies. These arsenals, of course, will also become centers of arms production, strengthening our military industry."
 ABY_demand_noble_loyalty:0 "Demand the Submission of the Mesafint"
 ABY_demand_noble_loyalty_desc:0 "Now that the aristocats have lost their economic and military leverage, they have very little they can use to threaten my royal authority. I shall no longer tolerate disobedience and sabotage. From now on, every noble must fulfill their duty or be accused for treason. Some of them may be insulted by this and try to resist, but that will only make their punishment more severe."
 ABY_seize_mines:0 "Seize the Mines"
 ABY_seize_mines_desc:0 "The mountains of Abyssinia are rich in valuable minerals, yet the mines that excavate them are owned by private individuals, mostly nobles. Strategically vital resources must be in the possession of the state. As such, I will sign a decree to expropriate all mines in Abyssinia. Afterwards state-owned slaves can be put to work in them."
 ABY_fortification_brigades:0 "Fortification Brigades"
 ABY_fortification_brigades_desc:0 "While Abyssinia has always benefitted from its defensive terrain, it is not enough in this age of machines. Proper and modern defences need to be built to fend off any potential invaders of our nation, and I can put the state-owned slaves to work constructing them. They'll be happy to do something more useful than harvesting coffee beans."
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_2:0 "Expand the Crown Guard"
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_2_desc:0 "The Clawomons created the Crown Guard and as such many of their veterans remain loyal to the pretender dynasty. Nevertheless, it is important for me to have an elite force under my direct control. I will promote promising and loyal soldiers from the ranks of the feudal levies and the garrisons to the Crown Guard. They can be trusted, as they'll owe me a debt of gratitude."
 ABY_bureaucratize_nobles:0 "Appoint Provincial Governors"
 ABY_bureaucratize_nobles_desc:0 "The provinces of Abyssinia have traditionally been ruled by their regional nobles who inherited their titles. This outdated and unreliable practice ends now. I shall grant the titles of provincial governors to Mekwanint who can be trusted. As their income will depend on their government salary, they will be far more loyal to me than the nobles are."
 ABY_nationalize_foreign_assets:0 "Nationalize Foreign Assets"
 ABY_nationalize_foreign_assets_desc:0 "The ceaseless plunder of Abyssinia done by foreigners will end now. Any property owned by those without Abyssinian nationality shall become state property without compensation to previous owners. They must be reminded that Abyssinia and all its wealth belong to the Abyssinians, and no one else."
 ABY_introduce_catscription:0 "Expand Catscription"
 ABY_introduce_catscription_desc:0 "Feudal levies scattered before the storm. If Abyssinia is to keep its independence, it will need a proper army that is built on a modern system of catscription. Every able-bodied adult citizen will have to go through a period of military service. Defence of the homeland should become every cat's patriotic duty, instead of being the task of selfish nobles."
 ABY_enlighten_populace:0 "Enlighten The Populace"
 ABY_enlighten_populace_desc:0 "The Clawomons started the effort to increase literacy rate in our nation, but I don't think they went far enough. They failed to abolish kitten labour and build enough schools in the countryside. I will succeed where they failed. If nothing else, my reign will be known for ending illiteracy in Abyssinia!"
 ABY_state_companies:0 "Establish State-Owned Enterprises"
 ABY_state_companies_desc:0 "Without firm guidance from the state, it would take many years for Abyssinia to properly industrialize. As such, I will create several government entities dedicated to production of industrial products. Many of which, purely coincidentally, can be used to equip modern armies. My long-term goal is to secure domestic production of critical goods."
 ABY_defend_coast:0 "Defend The Coasts"
 ABY_defend_coast_desc:0 "Due to its shape, the Abyssinian peninsula has a long coastline. Some might say it is impossible to defend all of it, but by Baast, I will try. The decrepit Abyssinian navy needs to be modernized, our ports need to be fortified, and our naval officers need to be retrained. Even then, it is not enough, but these changes are a good start."
 ABY_learn_to_fly:0 "Learn To Fly"
 ABY_learn_to_fly_desc:0 "Those feathered lions developed machines capable of flight, despite already being able to fly... at least they haven't been able to hoard their miracle inventions for themselves. Soon cats, too, will be able to soar in the skies. I will decree the establishment of the Abyssinian Air Force. That should even the odds somewhat, I hope."
 ABY_catrinas_school:0 "Catrina's School For Gifted Cats"
 ABY_catrinas_school_desc:0 "Too many exceptional cats are left with no choice but to live and work on their peasant farms. Such cats should be given a chance to accomplish greater things in life. Following Equestria's highly successful model, I will create an educational facility for those felines who can demonstrate their extraordinary talent."
 ABY_dam_the_rivers:0 "Dam The Rivers"
 ABY_dam_the_rivers_desc:0 "A truly modern country needs vast amounts of electricity to power countless machines and electronic devices. One of the best ways to produce energy is through hydropower, so I will order the construction of great dams on both Panther and Tiger rivers. Because of the resulting reservoirs, tens of thousands of cats will have to be relocated, but it is worth it."
 ABY_manedalusia_slave_state:0 "The Manedalusian Slave State"
 ABY_manedalusia_slave_state_desc:0 "Many cats, especially nobles, love claiming that Manedalusia is an integral part of Abyssinia... this is nonsense, feline population is a small minority there. No, Manedalusia will be the first of many slave states which have to provide the government with tribute of slaves every passing moon."
 ABY_foundations_of_welfare_state:0 "Foundations Of A Welfare State"
 ABY_foundations_of_welfare_state_desc:0 "A state's foremost duty is to defend its subjects. Traditionally this means defend from invaders and criminals, but why not expand this definition? All cats need to also be defended from disease, poverty and malnutrition. Other modern states, like Equestria, have already done this, so I say we just follow their example."
 ABY_research_institute:0 "Found The Feline Research Institute"
 ABY_research_institute_desc:0 "Feline minds are no less capable than those of other races, I am living proof of that. With the minds of many promising young cats being cultivated, I think it's time we put them to good use. A state-funded institute dedicated to innovative research programs shall be created under my most generous patronage."
 ABY_best_of_best:0 "The Best Of The Best"
 ABY_best_of_best_desc:0 "My army should be led by competent commanders, not by a bunch of corrupt sycophants and traditionalists stuck in the past.

 ABY_choo_choo_bitches:0 "Arteries Of Steel And Concrete"
 ABY_choo_choo_bitches_desc:0 "Turning Abyssinia into a unified and centralized nation-state has been quite the pain in the tail. Yet my work is almost done. I simply need to decree the construction of railways and roads to connect every remote corner of the Kingdom, which will not only allow rapid transport of goods and cats, but also help supply the military."
 ABY_reveal_plan:0 "Reveal My Plan To The Masses"
 ABY_reveal_plan_desc:0 "Another stage of my plan is nearing completion. The time for secrecy is about to end as well. Everything should soon be ready for the ultimate salvation of felinekind from oblivion. When I show them all what I have planned, some may protest or complain. But their mewling will be drowned out by the raucous exclamations of support and approval."

 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_2:0 "Unilaterally Repeal The Treaty Of Katren"
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_2_desc:0 "The fact that the Clawomons signed the Treaty of Katren is a mark of shame for the entire nation and a stain upon our proud history.

 ABY_cavalry_finally_added_in_eaw:0 "Slave Cavalry"
 ABY_cavalry_finally_added_in_eaw_desc:0 "While slaves are a great source of cheap labour, they could be utilized by our military as well. Nobles already use slaves as steeds for travel, so why couldn't the soldiers do so as well? These "mounted" units would be able to traverse much faster than infantry, and the enslaved equines they ride can also function as meat shields."
 ABY_liberate_purrsia:0 "Operation: CAT ISLAND"
 ABY_liberate_purrsia_desc:0 "The despicable Clawomons sold out our lands to the griffons many years ago. Ever since, Purrsia has been under foreign occupation, with the local Ras being little more than a powerless figurehead. It is time to contact the Ras and reclaim what is rightfully ours."

 ABY_cut_off_klugetown_desc:0 "The Abyssinian city of Klugetown has been taken over by local criminal gangs who have managed to get Maregypt to secure their "independence". This is just another example of the weakness of the Clawomonic regime. However, I have a plan: incite an insurrection in Ovingoland to isolate Klugetown from their allies, then strike at them with full force."
 ABY_universal_healthcare:0 "Universal Feline Healthcare"
 ABY_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "Every cat in Abyssinia has the right to quick and proper healthcare provided by trained professionals.

This I shall provide."
 ABY_anti_air_defence_2:0 "Shield The Skies"
 ABY_anti_air_defence_2_desc:0 "While Abyssinia may indeed lack a proper industrial capacity to build an expansive air force, I think we can invest in improved air-defence capabilities to lessen the negative impacts of potential enemy air superiority.

 ABY_mag_weapons_2:0 "Fusion Of Magic And Machines"
 ABY_mag_weapons_2_desc:0 "Abyssinia will be a shining example of the new age, where magic and technology have been perfectly merged.

 ABY_rebuild_felibela:0 "Restore The Glory Of Felibela"
 ABY_rebuild_felibela_desc:0 "Felibela was built by one of my most esteemed ancestors many centuries ago as a holy city dedicated to the glory of Baast. However, nowadays it is little more than a village and a site of pilgrimage. I shall honour King Felibela by using royal funds to rebuild his eponymous city and put it back on the map."
 ABY_slave_literacy:0 "Educate The Slaves"
 ABY_slave_literacy_desc:0 "Now that slaves are no longer wasting their lives on plantation work, they need to be capable of doing more complex industrial tasks that often involve reading manuals and instructions. For this, they need to be literate. While there are some risks involved, it is absolutely necessary to provide basic education even to the slaves."
 ABY_yet_another_research_slot_focus:0 "Ascension Of The Feline Mind"
 ABY_yet_another_research_slot_focus_desc:0 "It is the might of science that has elevated catkind from its inherent weakness. The light of reason will expel the darkness of ignorance, and illuminate the path towards immortal greatness. Abyssinian minds need to be carefully cultivated, skill and intelligence rewarded, intellectualism encouraged. Only then can we achieve true enlightenment."
 ABY_convert_convoys_2:0 "Put Merchant Ships Into Better Use"
 ABY_convert_convoys_2_desc:0 "To compensate for our lack of industrial capability, we can quickly expand our navy by seizing merchant vessels and converting them into warships. I'm sure the merchants will be upset, but I'll make sure they'll be powerless to do anything about it. Our security is more important than the profit margins of the rich."

 ABY_invade_maregypt_desc:0 "Continued foreign occupation of Manedalusia has been a thorn on our side ever since the Clawomons failed to maintain control of it. However, it does provide an excellent justification to destroy our eastern rivals completely. The Catwe dynasty shall succeed where our predecessors failed!"
 #Most of the Manedalusian slave state remains under foreign tyranny. Manedalusia has been Abyssinian land for centuries, even before the Catwe dynasty first became rulers. Whatever justifications are made for occupation or even Manedalusian independence are nonsense. I won't listen to it. Instead, I will take back what is rightfully ours."
 #Maregypt has had an antagonistic relationship with us ever since independence from the vile state of Saddle Arabia. I've seen no reasont to amend this foreign policy plunder of the Clawomons as it is quite advantageous for me. I always have a need for more equine slaves, and Maregypt has more than enough to offer.
 ABY_motorization:0 "Cats & Cars"
 ABY_motorization_desc:0 "Cats have always had a great disadvantage compared to most races: we are unable to carry heavy loads or pull large wagons like the four-legged races can. This has always made logistics and travel difficult without the use of pack animals or slaves. But with the introduction of mass-produced motor vehicles, transportation is easier and cheaper than ever."

 ABY_anti_monarch_propaganda_desc:0 "The Clawomon dynasty enabled the mass enslavement of other races and amassed great wealth in their palace, only to lose it all at once, leading the country to the brink of collapse. The Catwe dynasty was no better, giving great power to the greedy landlords. We should make sure every Abyssinian knows the truth about their so-called monarchs!"
 ABY_improvised_workshops:0 "Improvised Weapon Workshops"
 ABY_improvised_workshops_desc:0 "To fully supply our army of liberation, we need our own reliable source of equipment. Already some slaves make their own improvised weapons in makeshift workshops.

 ABY_ally_manedalusia_desc:0 "Manedalusia has been forcefully occupied by Abyssinia since 988. Our leader, Sharp Spear, is one of the many ponies who ended up as slaves as a result of this crime. As such, the freedom of Manedalusia is vital to our cause, and we should see their brave resistance fighters as our allies. We need to contact them as soon as possible."

 ABY_down_with_crown_desc:0 "Death is preferable to bondage, so our brave warriors are ready to fight until the bitter end. If we triumph, Abyssinia will become a better place for every creature.

 ABY_trans_rights_government_desc:0 "With the fall of the ancient regime, it is time we hold the National Conference on Peace and Reconciliation, inviting any political organizations aligned with the revolution to it. Together, we can officially establish a transitional government to temporarily lead the country, and lay the groundwork for a better future."
 ABY_slave_repatriation:0 "Ex-Slave Repatriation Program"
 ABY_slave_repatriation_desc:0 "While many slaves have lived in Abyssinia most of their lives or were even born here, numerous others yearn to return to their homes as free creatures.

 ABY_fate_of_old_order_desc:0 "Though the monarchs themselves managed to escape abroad, alongside many nobles, our brave soldiers did manage to capture quite a few leading figures of the ancient regime. Some ex-slaves are very... vocal about giving them the ultimate punishment, while others call for moderation. The transitional government will have to decide what to do with them."
 ABY_reconstruction:0 "The Reconstruction Plan"
 ABY_reconstruction_desc:0 "Much of Abyssinia suffered from the recent societal upheaval. To strengthen the legitimacy of our government, we must do our part in healing the wounds of the nation and earn the favour of the feline populace. While our resources are limited, what we don't lack are prisoners of war, who can be put to work with little expense."
 ABY_reorg_army:0 "Create A New Army"
 ABY_reorg_army_desc:0 "The revolutionary army consisted of various bands of armed former slaves loosely united under the central command of Sharp Spear.

 ABY_a_chat_with_cats:0 "Listen To The People"
 ABY_a_chat_with_cats_desc:0 "The goal of our government is to create a free and equal society, a better place not just for non-felines but all races. By allowing public petitions, we can improve our legitimacy in the eyes of the populace. However, this means we must implement at least one of the petitions to show that we listen to them."
 ABY_communalize_land:0 "Seize The Noble Estates"
 ABY_communalize_land_desc:0 "Much of land in Abyssinia, especially fertile farmlands, was in private possession of a small group of noble houses. This led to the rise of intensive agriculture and a slave-based plantation economy. To prevent such a travesty from happening again, lands formerly owned by the nobility will become communal land, free to use by local communities."
 ABY_manedalusian_question:0 "Resolve The Manedalusian Question"
 ABY_manedalusian_question_desc:0 "Manedalusia has been disputed between Abyssinia and Maregypt for centuries, and has always been a source of conflict.

 ABY_worker_coops:0 "Nationalize The Industry"
 ABY_worker_coops_desc:0 "We must be careful to avoid the formation of more modern forms of slavery.

 ABY_principles_of_good_gov_desc:0 "To make Abyssinia a better place for every creature to live in, we must abide by guiding principles that strengthen the rule of law and minimize corruption and mistreatment.

They are the most determined freedom fighters I know of, and their help will be invaluable."
 ABY_fortify_panthera:0 "Fortify Panthera"
 ABY_fortify_panthera_desc:0 "I am used to fighting a hit-and-run war in the mountains, but the current situation forces me to adapt. With the transitional government located in Panthera, defence of Abyssinia's largest city is of utmost importance. After all, those who try to defend everything ultimately defend nothing. My soldiers will have to learn how to fight defensively while the civilians construct fortifications."
 ABY_focus_north:0 "Focus On The North"
 ABY_focus_north_desc:0 "The Patriotic Revolt, supported by majority of the feline populace, is a far greater threat than the traitors down south. As such, I think we can afford to ignore Senna- that dumb mule's pathetic forces and concentrate our efforts on pacifying the northern parts of Abyssinia. Once we're done there, we can come back south to finish the job."
 ABY_focus_south:0 "Focus On The South"
 ABY_focus_south_desc:0 "While weaker than the Patriotic Revolt, the Neo-Assyrian terrorists present a far greater future threat if the southern donkeys decide to intervene in their support.

 ABY_any_weapons_will_suffice_desc:0 "Back in my day, we didn't have fancy guns. We had sticks. Two sticks and a rock for the entire platoon of freedom fighters! And we had to share the rock! If we can liberate all of Abyssinia with nothing but sticks and stones, then we can sure as Tartarus restore peace and order with some antiquated rusty swords and paw cannons."

 ABY_emergency_factory_conversion_desc:0 "Panthera is the center of industrial production in Abyssinia, but this production currently serves civilian needs. In this time of crisis, we have no choice but to use any means possible to fulfill our supply needs. I will do my best to ensure this process goes smoothly and without excessive coercion, in cooperation with both factory owners and workers' councils."

 ABY_skidaddle_skadoodle_your_supply_is_now_fucked_desc:0 "Regular armies already have to dedicate an immense amount of time and resources towards logistics. For a renegade army of former slaves hiding in the hills and mountains, logistics was everything. Over the years, me and my officers learned every detail about supply lines in Abyssinia and where they intersect. Now, we know exactly where to strike."
 ABY_rapid_training_program:0 "Accelerated Training Program"
 ABY_rapid_training_program_desc:0 "We cannot just rely on veterans of the last civil war. We need fresh and motivated soldiers to fill in gaps in the frontline, and we need them as quickly as possible. Former freedom fighters, unable to fight due to injuries, can now pass on their knowledge to new recruits. They shall be taught only the most important aspects of warfare. I hope that's enough for them to survive."
 ABY_a_generous_donation:0 "A Generous Donation"
 ABY_a_generous_donation_desc:0 "A rich Wingbardian recently contacted us... while I was sceptical at first, I learned he was a liberal industrial magnate who had emigrated from his country. He offered to donate his entire collection of fighter aircraft, apparently made by a company he used to own. He wished us good luck with our "revolutionary struggle against backwards monarchism". I suppose we should thank him?"

 ABY_rely_on_popular_support_desc:0 "Despite the lies and propaganda that our revolution was organized by a "Maregypt-Equestria-Stalliongrad axis of evil", our primary goal remains social revolution in Abyssinia. While nationalists and monarchists may oppose us, the peasant masses know our agenda of land reform and equal rights for all creatures. They are like an ocean of dry grass ready to be ignited."
 ABY_compromise_with_enemy:0 "Make A Compromise"
 ABY_compromise_with_enemy_desc:0 "The Patriotic Revolt's goals were unclear to me at first, but now I see that it is a conservative reaction against our radical revolution. Rather than crush them and deal with the resulting political instability, I will offer them a compromise to convince them to put down their weapons and join us. Abyssinia has bled enough."
 
 ABY_referendussy:0 "The [GetYear] Constitutional Referendum"
 ABY_referendussy_desc:0 "To ensure lasting political stability, an agreement has been made with monarchist forces that a popular referendum will be held, allowing the Abyssinian people to decide which form of government they prefer.

 ABY_parliamentary_elections:0 "Hold Parliamentary Elections"
 ABY_parliamentary_elections_desc:0 "The transitional governent's mandate is about to end. While cats may be exhausted to vote again so soon after the referendum, it is absolutely necessary for the formation of a democratic legislative body. As agreed, the Patriot Front will participate in the elections. I truly hope these representatives will embody the will of the Abyssinian people."
 ABY_sennacherib_fate:0 "Decide Sennacherib's Fate"
 ABY_sennacherib_fate_desc:0 "While I made peace with some of my former enemies, I will never forgive Sennacherib for what he did. And I am sure the Abyssinians won't forgive him either, for the atrocities his forces committed against felinekind. His punishment is inevitable, but it remains to be seen how exactly he will be punished."
 ABY_reconstruction_again:0 "Rebuild The Country... Again"
 ABY_reconstruction_again_desc:0 "The black market is thriving, the Abyssinian currency has collapsed and the population has reverted to a barter economy. Suffice to say, we have to start over. The government is near-bankrupt, so we'll have to rely on bonds, loans and taxes to finance not just state-led reconstruction efforts, but also private construction companies."
 ABY_a_new_currency:0 "Introduce A New Currency"
 ABY_a_new_currency_desc:0 "Now I don't know much about economics, but I don't think one chicken egg is meant to cost 10 quintillion Abyssinian purrs. As such, I've talked with the newly founded Abyssinian National Bank about introducing a new, slightly less inflated currency. A less cat-centric name would be good too. How about combining bit and purr? Like... birr?"
 ABY_voluntary_collectivization:0 "Voluntary Collectivization"
 ABY_voluntary_collectivization_desc:0 "Making all rural land communal after taking it from the nobles might not have been the best of ideas. Smallholders and peasant farmers will now be allowed to retain their land. Those who own too little to survive can use communal land or join an agricultural cooperative. I'm sure the communists and the APF will love my idea!"
 ABY_power_sharing_agreement:0 "Power Sharing Agreement"
 ABY_power_sharing_agreement_desc:0 "For the sake of peace and unity, we must learn to cooperate with our former enemies. As part of the peace treaty, APF was promised positions of political prominence in the new government. I intend to keep this promise. As long as they're not nobles, any APF candidates are welcome in the halls of power."
 ABY_unnationalize_industry:0 "Socialization, Not Nationalization"
 ABY_unnationalize_industry_desc:0 "Although critical aspects of the national economy should be under direct state control, we must return the means of production to the paws and hooves of the workers themselves. Though private ownership will not be outlawed, as agreed with APF, I will encourage the establishment of cooperatives and mutual organizations."
 ABY_organize_provinces:0 "Reorganize The Provinces"
 ABY_organize_provinces_desc:0 "Abyssinia has traditionally been divided into numerous provinces ruled by local nobles. This system was very inefficient and decentralized, allowing the nobility to rule their domains largely automously. This is one of the factors that permitted them to employ slavery on such a large scale. The new Abyssinia I am- we are making will not repeat the mistakes of the past."
 ABY_denounce_stalliongrad:0 "Denounce The Stalliongradian Model Of Socialism"
 ABY_denounce_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Even if the Winter Revolution was a globally significant triumph against the old order, it was not a triumph for either democracy or socialism. The one-party state was governed through democratic centralism, which was nothing more than absolute tyranny of the majority. The same state also implemented socialism from above rather than from below. We will not repeat their mistakes."
 ABY_intel_agency_focus:0 "Form The Revolutionary Security & Intelligence Service"
 ABY_intel_agency_focus_desc:0 "Both Sennacherib's betrayal and the patriotic uprising came as an almost complete surprise. I don't like unexpected surprises, so I will decree the creation of a branch in the military that is dedicated to internal security. They will keep an eye on anyone who would conspire to undo the achievements of the revolution."
 ABY_worker_unions:0 "Cooperate With The Trade Union Federation"
 ABY_worker_unions_desc:0 "While labour unions have existed in the country for many years, they were rather small and marginalized. Since the revolution, their membership numbers have skyrocketed and they have recently formed a national congress, the TUF, to facilitate greater cooperation. We share a common cause, the protection of workers' rights, so they're our natural allies."
 ABY_the_caring_state:0 "The Caring State"
 ABY_the_caring_state_desc:0 "The purpose of government is to protect its citizens and take care of their basic needs. At least, that's what I believe.

 ABY_expand_bureaucracy:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
 ABY_expand_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The foundation of institutional rule is public administration. Hired and meritocratically promoted civil servants are a safeguard against nobility, nepotism and tax farming. Though inherently undemocratic, a proper politically neutral bureaucratic system is required to maintain a modern welfare state. Of course, we must be careful not to expand it too much..."
 ABY_enshrine_racial_equality:0 "Enshrine Racial Equality In Law"
 ABY_enshrine_racial_equality_desc:0 "Queen Mewodora II's law forbidding slavery only from Abyssinian cats started a chain of events that resulted in our revolution. This differentiation between cats and others was the root of all the suffering. Such laws will never again be allowed to be enacted on the Abyssinian peninsula. The government will become blind to race."
 ABY_status_of_religion:0 "The Status Of Religion"
 ABY_status_of_religion_desc:0 "Despite the Baastist temples rarely getting involved in politics, the Abyssinian monarchy always sought to gain legitimacy from religious authorities. I don't think there's a need for our revolutionary government to do the same, though more radical voices are demanding we oppose religion and see it as a dangerous, reactionary force. Seems it's time for another debate..."
 ABY_katren_question:0 "The Katren Question"
 ABY_katren_question_desc:0 "While our new government does not recognize the Treaty of Katren, we have unfortunately inherited a nasty land dispute from the fallen monarchy. Griffon squatters remain in the port town of Katren, and seem uninterested in leaving. We will have to ask them kindly to do so. If they still stay, well. I'd really rather avoid starting a conflict..."
 ABY_manedalusia_question:0 "The Manedalusia Question (Answer: Don't Bother)"
 ABY_manedalusia_question_desc:0 "Ah yes, Manedalusia. The disputed land between Abyssinia and Maregypt. The place where I became a prisoner of war and a slave. Fond memories of it. Really looking forward to getting my hooves dirty and sorting out this whole Manedalusia thing for good. Really."
 ABY_purrsia_question:0 "The Purrsia Question"
 ABY_purrsia_question_desc:0 "The Abyssinian monarchy was desperate enough to modernize that they pawned off an entire island to Wingbardy, but not so desperate that they'd fully abolish slavery... Anyways, while legally we recognize the island as occupied territory, there's no harm in offering to buy back the island to avoid conflict over it."
 ABY_klugetown_question:0 "The Klugetown Question"
 ABY_klugetown_question_desc:0 "From what I understand, the only reason Klugetown is marked on any map as a "country" is because Maregypt didn't want Abyssinia to reassert its control over the area for geopolitical reasons. Which is stupid, as the city was run for years by a brutal criminal gang. I guess it's time to resolve this dispute, too..."
 ABY_maregypt_question:0 "The Maregypt Question"
 ABY_maregypt_question_desc:0 "As a Maregyptian mare, the concerns that I am biased about my homeland are entirely valid, even if I have lived in Abyssinia for several decades. However, I will do my best to act neutral. While ideally we avoid any conflict with them, if they have a hostile government, it might be necessary to liberate them from it. Even if it means fighting against my kin..."
 ABY_donkey_question:0 "The Donkey Question"
 ABY_donkey_question_desc:0 "While Sennacherib's uprising soured our relations with the southern donkeys, they are not beyond salvaging. Unless, of course, they have no interest in peaceful co-existence with us. In that case, I'm afraid we'll have no option but to resolve our fundamental differences on the battlefield. Luckily, I'm used to doing just that."
 ABY_further_beyond:0 "Further Beyond"
 ABY_further_beyond_desc:0 "While we have now secured the nation's borders, there are plenty of nations further beyond that could either prove to be hostile or friendly to us. We should seek to either engage in diplomacy with them or liberate them from potential oppression. Not only that, but veterans of the liberation army are more than eager to fight for a noble cause in distant lands, maybe even beyond Zebrica."
 ABY_goodbye_and_thanks:0 "Don't Burn Down The Country While I'm Gone"
 ABY_goodbye_and_thanks_desc:0 "Alright, I think the country's in a good state now. Its borders are secure, its society has modernized and institutions are in place to prevent the rise of slavery. At least, I think I've done all I can. If all my work becomes undone and Abyssinia falls into chaos again... I can say that I did my best to prevent it. Now, I can finally resign."
 
 ABY_launch_literacy_campaign:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Literacy Campaign"
 ABY_launch_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "With our power secured, the revolution can finally start bearing fruit.

Working together, they will ensure everycreature in the country learns to read."
 ABY_science_base:0 "Open The Polytechnic University Of Dire Pawa"
 ABY_science_base_desc:0 "Dire Pawa was the original headquarters of the Free Republic.

 ABY_research_slot:0 "Found The Academy Of Sciences"
 ABY_research_slot_desc:0 "The new national Academy of Sciences is intended to bring together the brightest and most talented people in the nation, no matter what race they are.

May the light of science illuminate a brighter future for us all, and banish the darkness of feudalism forever."
 
 ABY_revolutionary_guard:0 "Establish The Revolutionary Guard"
 ABY_revolutionary_guard_desc:0 "To safeguard our fragile revolution which already almost failed, I will form an elite military unit consisting of hoof-picked soldiers. It will replace the Crown Guard and will be loyal only to the revolution itself. Many veterans of the liberation wars will be in its ranks, no matter what their race is. They shall be the first and last line of defence."
 ABY_race_mixing:0 "A Multiracial Army"
 ABY_race_mixing_desc:0 "The term "Abyssinian" is usually synonymous with "Abyssinian cat". But many other races live here too. As such, the Liberation Army doesn't consist of just felines. Many former slaves who previously fought in the army will now be allowed to organize into proper special units to make the best use out of their unique racial abilities."
 ABY_patriotic_veterans:0 "The Patriotic Veterans"
 ABY_patriotic_veterans_desc:0 "The soldiers of the Abyssinian Patriotic Front proved to be capable combatants. As part of the Panthera peace accords, they were not disarmed and were integrated into the army. However, I think it would be beneficial to form a specialized unit consisting entirely of APF veteran highlanders. This way, they'd be able to fight most effectively."

 ABY_military_motorization_2_i_really_need_to_make_more_shared_branches_desc:0 "One of the most humiliating practices of the slave-owners was using equine slaves as steeds and beasts of burden. Thanks to modern technology however, trucks can be used instead, and they can carry much heavier loads far greater distances. I've already ordered a batch of vehicles for the logistics corps of the army."
 ABY_military_r_and_d:0 "Military Funding Of Science"
 ABY_military_r_and_d_desc:0 "Research is expensive, and intellectuals are always looking for resources to afford it. Recent history has proven that science is capable of greatly evolving warfare.

 ABY_bosanska_artilerija_desc:0 "In the Manedalusian War, it was the Maregyptian artillery that kept the relentless Abyssinian assaults at bay. And that was many years ago. Since then, artillery has only improved, becoming increasingly accurate and deadly. I would rather turn an enemy position to dust with a barrage than sacrifice even a single life in a bloody assault."
 ABY_mag_weapons_3:0 "Magic For Everycreature"
 ABY_mag_weapons_3_desc:0 "Modern technology allows almost anyone to be as powerful as a unicorn mage. All that's needed are some magical crystals and the equipment needed to channel their power. Abyssinian cats and donkeys, lacking any magical abilities to speak of, will no longer consider themselves inferior or weaker. Especially in the army."
 ABY_tonki:0 "Steel Cavalry"
 ABY_tonki_desc:0 "Assaulting an enemy position is one of the most dangerous tasks a soldier can do. I know from personal experience, and my scars prove it. But doing so while driving a heavily armoured vehicle is much safer and more effective. These so-called tanks are proving to change warfare significantly. They may be expensive, but we still need to get our hooves and paws on them."

 ABY_liberation_army_marches_on_desc:0 "The cause of liberation is a sacred one, and motivates our soldiers to endure extreme hardships and loss.

 ABY_aeroforce_desc:0 "As a pegasus, I've sometimes taken the ability of flight for granted. But thanks to modern technology, any race can now have the ability to soar in the skies. While this is a fulfillment of dreams for some, it is inevitable that our enemies will strike us from the skies, like the Storm King did. As such, our armed forces must be prepared."
 ABY_pegasus_doctrine:0 "The Pegasus Way Of War"
 ABY_pegasus_doctrine_desc:0 "As a pegasus, I was trained in the Maregyptian army to take advantage of my ability of flight. Pegasi fly close to the ground to avoid being hit and support other soldiers who cannot fly. The same method of fighting should be used by our nascent air force as well, because I doubt we can create an air force so large and strong that it can fight on its own."
 ABY_strike_from_above:0 "Strike From Above"
 ABY_strike_from_above_desc:0 "With modern transport planes, pegasi can safely move en masse behind enemy positions and drop onto them from a great height. Other races without wings can benefit from this tactic too, using gliders and parachutes to land. Our enemies won't know what hit them."
 ABY_rockets:0 "Adopt Missile Technology"
 ABY_rockets_desc:0 "Scientists abroad have made great strides in the development of rocket technology in recent years. While piloting a plane is a challenging and dangerous task, these "flying torpedoes" can be safely launched from a great distance at targets. Though their accuracy has much room for improvement, I believe adding this weapon to our arsenal would save the lives of many pilots."
 ABY_boatforce:0 "Create The [ROOT.GetAdjective] Naval Force"
 ABY_boatforce_desc:0 "While some in the navy were sympathetic to our revolutionary cause, they weren't formally organized as a navy. With the revolution finally secured, we can properly integrate the former Abyssinian navy into a part of our armed forces.

This way we can more quickly expand our naval forces to their previous size."
 ABY_marines:0 "Form The Marine Corps"
 ABY_marines_desc:0 "Abyssinia never had dedicated naval infantry, despite historically owning several islands and relying on overseas trade routes.

 ABY_defend_our_shores:0 "Protect Our Shores"
 ABY_defend_our_shores_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula has a long coastline, vulnerable to enemy landings. Our navy must ensure the enemy ships never even get close enough to shore to land.

 ABY_farms_for_herbivores:0 "Food For Herbivores"
 ABY_farms_for_herbivores_desc:0 "As Abyssinian cats are carnivores, agriculture has traditionally been used for growing cash crops or livestock fodder. After hundreds of thousands of herbivore slaves were imported, the slave owners figured it was cheapest to feed them with aforementioned fodder. Now, in our new Abyssinia, farms will grow proper food crops and vegetables, so every race is well fed."
 ABY_mechanized_mining:0 "Mechanized Mining"
 ABY_mechanized_mining_desc:0 "For a century, slaves were used extensively in Abyssinian mines, forced to do dangerous manual labour to extract valuable minerals.

 ABY_new_cooperatives:0 "New Industrial Cooperatives"
 ABY_new_cooperatives_desc:0 "Now that there is peace and political stability, the [Root.GetAdjective] economy has been developing.

This will not only boost the economy, but also help support military logistics."

Before this, Manedalusia was a subject state under Saddle Arabia, which resulted in the formation of an armed independence movement. Now this organization has managed to secure control of the former Manedalusian capital, Coltoba, proclaiming itself as the legitimate government of an independent Manedalusia. It is likely neither Abyssinia or Maregypt will tolerate its existence, so another war seems not only possible, but inevitable."

As the treaty demilitarized the surrounding province of Katkat and granted mining rights to Wingbardian companies, Wingbardy has decided to mobilize its armed forces in response to impose the treaty by force. Already, military units from both sides are moving into the disputed zone. War seems inevitable, and neither side has any interest in a diplomatic solution to the conflict."

It was originally seized by Wingbardy in 1006 under questionable circumstances and secured with the controversial Treaty of Katren. However, with the treaty no longer respected by Abyssinia, it was only a matter of time before Abyssinia would try to reassert their own claim over the settlement. Rather than giving up, the current occupiers of Katren have decided to fight back, and a larger war seems to be breaking out between the two nations."

There are reports of a massive uprising that has taken control of hundreds if not thousands of square kilometers.

These plans have failed, however, with massive revolts that have engulfed the entire country in recent weeks.

 abyssinia.1.d:0 "The steel battering ram pounded upon the gates of the royal palace and shattered them. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia, as the towering armored yeti walked inside accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three large fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""

 abyssinia.2.t:0 "A Typical Awakening"
 abyssinia.2.d:0 "King Gomez snapped awake in his bed, then realized it had just been the same reoccuring dream again. Or nightmare, except it didn't make him feel anything anymore. He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\nAfter glancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he lowered himself onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of fresh khatnip leaves. He put a pawful in his mouth, then chewed on it. He purred and rolled on the floor as his pupils dilated and he felt alive again.\nThe door opened.\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out.

Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and lowered his ears.\nDejen rolled his eyes.

A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, who were horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered in a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina of House Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," Tsahife Lam Tardar Sourpuss, muttered.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats in the Kingdom had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne. "I am glad all of you accepted my invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown.

Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and one of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati.

Rather, the demon treats the body like a puppet. Besides, we cats have inherently low magical energies and thus are very unlikely to be possessed."\n"I think a combination of ferrous iodide, arsenic, ergot, strophantin and cinchona should do the trick of curing him."\n"Opium alone should suffice."\n"No! He needs a lobotomy!"\n"What about electroshock therapy?"\n"Untested new technology sounds dangerous."\n"Hmmm... how about this then?" The doctor gave Gomez a large poster.

He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten.

We need a change of plans..."\n"We've gone past the point of no return." Tardar shrugged. "It's too late to do anything. We lost."\n"No!" Catrina hissed. "I worked too hard for this. Order your retinue to take up defensive positions! This palace is mine!"\n"Whatever," Tardar replied, but still obeyed her.\n\nThe occupants soon noticed how the palace was being surrounded from all sides by the Crown Guard. They had marched straight into a trap. Colonel Meow, the head of the Guard, stepped in front of the palace gates. "Surrender and you will not be harmed!"\n"Quick, shoot him!" Catrina ordered. But no one did.\n"Shoot the Colonel?" a defected officer, Alfie Mesfin, asked her. "But ma'am, that would be-"\nCatrina grabbed a gun and shot at him herself. She missed.\n\nThis started a fierce and brutal firefight that lasted all night. When the sun rose, the center of Panthera was in ruins and the rest of the city was in chaos.

So when Tekle invited him again, he was unsure if his advice had been of any use.\nGomez knocked on the wooden door of his house and it was soon opened by the elderly cat who smiled warmly.

But he quickly calmed down after a moment of reflection. "...I suppose you're right, yes."\n"Emotions are like fire: they are good servants but bad masters. Tell me, does the past haunt you? Do you feel sadness or anger over everything that happened to you?"\nAs much as it seemed like he did not want to answer, he did: "Yes. I even have dreams about the past... or nightmares."\nThe priest nodded thoughtfully. "Baast once said: 'Hanker not after the past, nor fantasize over the future, for the past has been left behind and the future has not been reached'. You do not live in the present, but regret the past and fear the future. How can one live like that?"\nGomez's mouth formed a strange smile. "Indeed, this is hardly a life worth living."\n"Then make it worthwhile," Tekle replied. "You must dethrone your feelings, tame your mind and become once more your own master, the King of your mind's Kingdom. I can help you, Gomez. Whether you believe it or not.

Walking and wandering helps to stimulate your body and thus your mind."\n"Ah... well, I'm not really feeling better yet."\n"Does a seed sprout into a tree in a day? No, and you have to water it often and take good care of it."\nHe sighed. "I suppose I'll have to be patient, then."\n"Exactly. You must learn self-control in general. As Baast said: 'Taming the mind to be effective is good. A tamed mind brings happiness'. It is the difference between a feral cat and an Abyssinian. I know how to train this ability, and I know you can learn it."\nGomez nodded slowly and didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked: "I thought priests like you are only good at reciting the Three Scriptures and nothing more."\n"Our duty is to be the spiritual pillar of society. Baast gifted us sapient minds, giving us the ability to escape the cycle of suffering that animals are doomed to endure. However, many cats do not know how to use their gifts.

This rock has outlasted them all, and it will outlast us too."\nGomez gulped and climbed, sitting down next to Tekle.\n"There we go. Now, this is a great place to focus on the present moment. Sit like I do, take this stance. Like that, yes. Then breathe, control it. Slow and steady. Feel your breaths, feel the air in your lungs. Next you can extend your awareness further. How does the rest of your body feel? How does your mind feel? Register emotions within you. You cannot grasp fog, you must hold solid things. As such your thoughts and feelings must become controllable. Think of something that makes you unhappy or distressed. Then think of what makes you happy. Face them. Permit them to pass over you and through you. Your feelings don't define who you are. You define yourself. Don't let the negative compounding thoughts control you. Don't judge yourself if you can't succeed at first. Don't judge yourself at all. Every sapient creature is flawed.

I wasn't sure either," Gomez replied.\n"Well, because this has taken long enough to happen, I will get straight to the point. My overview will cover the internal and external situation of the Kingdom. I will start with the former." He had placed a large map of Abyssinia behind him and had a pointing stick in his paw. "When I wrote this presentation, my largest concern was the nobility, but since then their threat has diminished. Nevertheless, many nobles remain dissatisfied with your rule for understandable reasons. They will need to be reminded of your legitimacy and competence. The second internal issue is slavery. There is every reason to outlaw it fully and emancipate our million slaves, but the aforementioned nobles strongly oppose this. Yet not doing so will lead to constant slave revolts that are costly to pacify." He pointed at Coltoba with his stick. "The third issue is Manedalusia. Tensions remain over the conflict we had with Maregypt years ago, and the local secessionist movement has utilized recent chaos to grow in strength. The fourth issue is famine. Without funds to import food, our limited domestic production isn't enough. But we have many ways to salvage the situation before it's too late. Speaking of lack of funds, that's the fifth and final internal issue, which will require extensive and quick reforms. Next, the external ones. First, conflicts in Saddle Arabia and Great Lakes have greatly reduced our trade income," he said, pointing at the two regions which appeared deceptively unified on the outdated map, "making it difficult to refill our treasury." Then he pointed at Katren. "Second, the monarchist Wingbardian government still sees us as part of their sphere of influence." His stick moved eastwards towards the Neighle. "Third, Maregypt's revanchists continue to urge their government to 'liberate' Coltoba from our rule. At this rate, they might launch a military offensive against us." He stopped for a moment, as if to think about what to say, then pointed at the lands south of Abyssinia. "Lastly, our relations with the donkey states of Asstyria and Anseruk are... fine, in fact, at least for now." He turned to look at Gomez again. "Any questions, my King?""

This has caused severe economic issues such as deflation, bank runs and a decline of economic activity. These issues are so severe, in fact, that we should've implemented reforms as soon as possible."\nGomez rubbed his forehead with his claws. "I am sorry."\n"Apology accepted. Now, you have a decision to make. I have investigated our options and consolidated them into three. Two of them are similar: we peg the value of our currency to the value of another one. This will bring financial stability and make it easy to loan funds from abroad, but will make us more dependent on whatever currency we choose. My two proposals are the Equestrian bit and the Skyfallian idol. Both are reliable, valuable and extensively used in global trade. Either of them would function as our reserve currency. The third option is to simply not have a fixed currency at all. A floating exchange rate would be a more unorthodox choice, but would allow us to recover more quickly from the crisis and enable us to increase our money supply as much as necessary. This could lead to excessive inflation, however, so we'd have to be more careful than with the other two alternatives."\n\nGomez frowned.

He thought to himself that this was all going to be a waste of time. While his servants carried his luggage and handled the renting of an apartment where he could stay (he of course could requisition or use any property at will, but he wanted to compensate the owners fairly), Gomez headed to the temples. There was a chance that Tekle wasn't there, and part of him hoped he couldn't find the old priest so he could just stay in bed all day.\n\nUnfortunately, he soon heard a familiar voice.\n"Ah, you've returned, Gomez! This means there is still hope for you."\nGomez appeared unenthusiastic. "Hello, Tekle. It was a tiring journey, so I don't know if I'll be able to do much today."\n"That is fine, that is fine, my friend. Come, let us relax by sharing some coffee."\n"I... I think I'll just go and check if my servants have rented a place for me to stay at."\n"It would be rude to refuse a polite invitation from an old cat, no?"\nGomez hesitated.

Am I actually supposed to say it's half full?"\n"No."\n"Why not? Wouldn't that be a good thing if I did?"\n"Either answer would've been wrong. Half of the cup's content is air and the other half is liquid. Whether its half empty or full is entirely up to interpretation, which in turn is colored by emotions. And you should never let your emotions cloud your vision of the world around you."\n"...What do you mean exactly?"\n"Well, you probably think that your life is terrible right now. That the world is an awful, evil place. And if I told you it is actually a wonderful place, you wouldn't believe me because that would obviously just be my own perception. The reality is that the world is what it was meant to be. There are good things and there are bad things. There is fullness and there is emptiness. There is happiness and there is suffering. There is life and there is death. There is an eternal, repeating cycle of both. You must be aware of this if you want to have a true view of the world and potentially free yourself of this cycle."\n"I... see."\n"This is why we must continue your training.

The rest of you provide cover and suppress the enemy firing positions if necessary."\nMolly nodded, then advanced towards the front door, moving nimbly with her paws and accompanied by two of her squadmates. Still, no one appeared in the windows. To her surprise, the door was not locked. But she first quietly took out a grenade and cooked it.

He struggled to open his eyes and every part of his body was telling him to go back to sleep - except his mind, which was telling him that to maintain his fixed sleep schedule, he'd have to get up now.\nThis was the start of an internal struggle as Gomez had to use everything he had learned about controlling his feelings to defeat himself. While he was primarily fighting against one desire, that of physical need, he also felt like he was fighting against the desire of pleasure of staying in bed and the desire of self-annihilation so he wouldn't have to do this every single morning. Yet his inner wisdom knew he had to strive towards the relinquishment of craving if he wanted to become his own master. Meditation and mindfulness training had prepared him for the battle, even if it was by no means easy. Yet nothing in life was ever easy. Not that any of the suffering mattered anyways, as Tekle had taught him.\nAt the end of the exhausting fight, Gomez was standing, having climbed out of his bed. He breathed a sigh of relief and thought about rewarding himself with his hidden khatnip. However, this plan was disrupted when the door to his bedroom opened. No one would ever learn to knock on it, would they?\n"Good morning, Gomez," Tekle said as he entered. "You got up even earlier than yesterday. Very good.

 abyssinia.55.t:0 "Baastism In A Nutshell"
 abyssinia.55.d:0 "Baastism is a name commonly used by outsiders to refer to the traditional racial faith of Abyssinian cats. It is centered around Baast, a legendary four-legged sapient cat who allegedly overthrew the Tyrant King Anubis of ancient Anugypt and sacrificed herself to create the Abyssinian race. As this was the end of Baast's ninth and final life, she is considered to be a dead deity. Baastism therefore focuses on following her way of life rather than praying for salvation or fearing divine retribution.\n\nThe core principle of Baastism is the cycle of rebirth, where a cat can live nine lives before facing eternal oblivion and non-existence. Baast escaped this fate through achieving everlasting metaphysical existence by eliminating desire and the self. Baastists thus seek to emulate her by purifying their minds in a similar manner. They do not believe that animals, such as house cats, are capable of this and see sapience as Baast's gift that they must use to liberate themselves from suffering and nothingness.\n\nThe religion has a priesthood who maintain isolated temples that are used for worship and meditation. The core function of the priests is teaching others to live like Baast did and help them achieve enlightenment. There are very few, if any, Baastists who are not Abyssinian cats, due to the focus on Baast's relationship with her "creations". Those non-cats who do follow Baast's way of life do so hoping to achieve similar salvation, seeking to live as virtuously as her.\n\nThere are several unorthodox variants of Baastism which have few followers. They interpret the legend of Baast's life differently, some even claiming she still exists and actively intervenes in temporal affairs like a regular god. While they are considered heretics, they are not actively persecuted most of the time."

Over the years, she had gathered as much intel as possible, learning how the Abyssinian army worked from the inside, and convinced other fellow auxiliaries to join her cause. This ensured she was swiftly accepted into the ranks of the rebels when the time came. When she finally deserted, she did not do so alone, but with dozens of other defectors. They stole hundreds of weapons and plenty of ammunition from the Abyssinian armory in Coltoba, and met with resistance fighters at a secret meeting place. There, they formally swore an oath to fight for the resistance until Manedalusia was freed or until they died. Of course, she had sworn an oath to [ABY.GetNameDef] as well, but ultimately her family had been right. She was indeed a traitor and an oathbreaker.

 abyssinia.105.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]\n--------------------\nFROM MEKLIT DUNN IN R'ATAPHET, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHour]\nAn official communique was released today by the ministry of foreign affairs of [ABY.GetNameDef], reporting that negotiations with [MGY.GetNameDef] about the status of the disputed territory of Klugetown will be suspended for an indefinite period of time. It was not made clear to the public what caused the negotiations to stall; some speculate that the Maregyptians refused to budge, others that [ABY.GetNameDef] demanded too much and refused to recognize the sovereignty of Klugetown. Whatever the reason, [ABY.GetNameDef]'s goal to change the status quo has failed, and Klugetown remains as a disputed territory free to govern itself under Maregyptian protection."

 abyssinia.106.d:0 "The government of [ABY.GetName] has demanded a return of control over our foreign policy and economy. With Maregypt no longer protecting us to counterbalance the [From.GetAdjective] threat, we are vulnerable. While we likely cannot hold off a war long-term, we may be able to preserve our independence long enough to make them give up and go away.\n\nWhat are we to do? Although Verko bowed to the Storm King to keep Klugetown autonomous, [ABY.GetLeader] hardly has the same power or authority as he did."

"Cats are a minority of the population and Abyssinian isn't even the most spoken language. When you arrive in the city, don't expect a warm welcome. You should also consider language training courses in the various trade speech creoles used in the city."\nOne of the security officers sitting in front of her raised his paw.\n"I did not say it is time for questions yet. Allow me to finish speaking."\nThe paw lowered.\n"The city was run by the crime gang of Verko for many years. Your job will be tough, as the city is not used to having any law enforcement. Order was maintained by mafioso protection rackets and a monopoly on violence. A monopoly which threatens to become an oligopoly. This gang, and any other criminal groups, will need to be brought before justice swiftly. It is especially important that the new provisional autonomous government can rule effectively and have its legislative decisions enforced. Eventually, elections may be held, but that is a long way away. The point of this briefing is to make you understand that we all have a lot of work to do. Any questions?"\nThe paw rose again.\n"Go ahead.""

With no formal state of war between our countries, the troops on the island were left confused on how to act and requested immediate orders. However, it appears the broadcast was intercepted as it arrived with a significant delay, meaning control of the islands has likely already been lost.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has already been informed and requested to make a decision about how to react to this gross violation of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty."

 abyssinia.112.d:0 "Gomez rummaged through his cabinet, his yellow eyes gleaming when he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a bleached map of northern Zebrica and spread it out on his office table. It was probably over a decade out of date by now, but should still have what he was trying to find. He scanned it and found a small realm nestled in between Chiropterra and Zumidia. There, Warzena. Despite not being that far away from Abyssinia, he had to check where it was located. The Kingdom was rather small and irrelevant, and geography had never been Gomez's strength.\n\nWith additional context, Gomez returned to his unwritten letter. "Dear King Barekzamal," he muttered as he wrote with his ink quill, then shook his head, scrapped the letter and pulled out another one. "Honored King Barekzamal. I am honored- Baast-damned repetition!" Another letter scrapped. He put aside the ink quill and took out a graphite pencil and an eraser. "Barekzamal. I am honored by the personal letter you wrote to me. You were very open with your feelings to a complete stranger, and I respect that. I agree with you, being a King is no easy task, and sometimes I wish I was a litter box cleaner instead. However, I do not have a 'solution' to depression. I don't think anycat-" He erased the word. "-anyone has. I still struggle to do anything on some days. But I keep going nevertheless, because I know I have to do it for the sake of others. I suppose that would be my advice to you: Never give up."\n\nThe rest of the letter would be dedicated to the usual dull diplomatic affairs, but now the important part had been taken care of, so the remainder was easy for Gomez to write."

He shook his head in disbelief, then put the letter aside. His eyes focused into the distance, staring at nothing in particular as he was lost in thought. After a while, he mumbled: "...No, he was right. I can't ever give up, for the sake of Warzena and the zebras who love me."\n\nHe stood up and stored the letter safely among other important personal items. Not only had he now made a new ally for Warzena, but perhaps he had made a new friend as well."

He was all too used to sycophantic nobles, but this Princess somehow radiated a pure aura of friendliness.\n"You are quite welcome," she replied and cut some cake for herself as well. "You know, this reminds me of my meeting with Queen Pawkuno, when we discussed the matter of Manedalusia and its ponies."\nGomez frowned. "...What? But she lived a thousand years ago-"\n"Yes? I am older than that," she said with another chuckle. "In any case, that meeting did not go as well as I had hoped, but in the end Pawkuno swore to treat her new pony subjects gently and fairly. You promise to do the same, yes? I've heard there are many ponies in Abyssinia who were brought there as slaves."

He looked down and saw hundreds of fires burning in the distance. "Funeral pyres," he mumbled to himself when he realized. Families and priests were cremating the bodies of the dead. While this was a relatively common occurrence, he had never seen so many at once. There was so much smoke that the setting sun itself could not be seen anymore.\n\nHe was certain most of them had fallen in the recent fighting. Yet even these hundreds of deaths represented only a fraction of the total casualties. There were thousands upon thousands of cats who were wounded, missing, or taken prisoner by the enemy.

Feline architecture takes this into account and is famously resilient during seismic events. Yet this earthquake was so exceptionally strong and violent that it was felt throughout Abyssinia and beyond. Seismologists in Panthera estimate that the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 on the Canter scale.\n\nLocal government in Catorahe has already petitioned the central [ROOT.GetAdjective] government to send immediate aid to the region, as there are thousands of cats wounded or trapped in ruins.

Already, there are reports that they have established a government that claims to be the sole rightful state authority in all of Abyssinia. This is of course absurd and ridiculous, but with our nation already stretched thin, it remains to be seen if the resistance can be crushed as quickly as it should be."

Let's head straight back home to Amhafura."\n"As you wish, m'lady," the chauffeur said and closed the door.\n\nSeveral hours later they were driving down a winding unpaved road in the western foothills. The Tsahife Lam was grumbling about the poor condition of the road and the many bumps in it. "And don't even get me started on that annoying ticking noise. The roads are so poor they've broken my expensive Equestrian car!"\nThe chauffeur frowned. "Excuse me, ma'am? A ticking noise?"\n"Can't you hear it? It's coming from inside the car.

Bontu noticed this and gazed back, her expression loudly exclaiming "I told you so!" without a single word being said.\n\nSharp Spear's breathing faltered. She looked away into the horizon. Somehow, she could swear she could see the sandy shores of Maregypt from here, even if she knew it wasn't geographically possible.\n\nAn Abyssinian priest waved his paws and recited the usual ceremonial words, despite the prisoners not being cats: "May Baast's wisdom enlighten them in their next life, so they may yet be redeemed. Otherwise, let them step unto oblivion."\nThe soldiers then pushed the slaves down from the cliff along with their rocks. All slaves fell in unison.

She looked around and saw that most of the burned buildings were being torn down and wooden frames of new constructions had already been erected. Even the old stone tower in the middle of the village was being renovated. In front of it, a space was being cleared. "Everything seems to be going on schedule. The memorial statue should be arriving soon, so it's good it can be put in place right away."\n"Of course. Some of the workers had family here, ma'am. They're personally invested in this project."\nCatrina sighed. "I am sorry for their loss."\n"We all are. If I may ask, your majesty, there's something I've been curious about."\nShe raised an inquisitive eyebrow. "Yes? You may ask."\n"When the Storm King's minions came here, how come they destroyed the village but left your mansion alone?"\nThe Queen took a deep breath, as if to build up strength to speak. Then, her claw pointed at the central tower. "That there was the storage place of ancient magico-medical scrolls. The Storm King probably thought they had some value, despite us cats not even being able to use magic like other races. Meanwhile my mansion is in poor condition and has nothing particularly valuable inside it. When the villagers refused to give the sacred scrolls, the yeti tried to take them by force. This started a fight that resulted in everything being burned down. I was the first witness of that event."\nThe forecat stared at her quietly. "It must've been a devastating sight, ma'am.

As the three approached the entrance of the main building, one of the guards stepped ahead and stopped them. "Your majesty, the entrance is ongoing renovations.

The same guard who had spoken previously opened it, revealing a dark hallway.\n"Seems quite unused," Catrina said and chuckled, then took out something from the folds of her coat. After the three entered, the door was slammed shut by one guard while the other guard took out a dagger. But as he tried to thrust the dagger into Catrina, a very strong paw grabbed his arm.

"Please, calm down, it was less than one dose, I'll make sure it gets replaced!" He quickly took the bowl from the slave and presented it to Catrina. "Here, take it!"\nShe narrowed her eyes at him and slowly took the bowl. "Fine, I'll forgive him this time." She brought the bowl to her mouth and drank all its contents, grimacing slightly from the taste. "I wasn't planning to use this potion in such a large quantity yet, but the premature invasion by Wingbardy forces me to adapt." With a sudden surge of strength, she crushed the bowl in her paws into dust and was completely unharmed by it. "Soon enough, I'll be ready to distribute this to my soldiers as well... then we will become UNSTOPPABLE!" She cackled while the slave left the room in terror and Rep stared at her, not knowing what to say."

"Did you want something?" He then appeared to brace for impact, as if Catrina would explode at him. However, that didn't happen.\nThe feline Queen rubbed her arm and glanced around nervously. She was breathing heavily and looked at him with pleading, desperate eyes. "Rep, sweetie... h-have you seen the keys to the potion storage room?"\nRep frowned. "Uh, why are you asking?"\nShe gulped. "I haven't had any of the potion for days... the withdrawal is starting to kick in..." Her voice was almost whimpering and she was on the verge of tears.\nRep appeared sad all of a sudden. "I... I think I've seen it somewhere! Wait here, I'll go look for it!" He frantically ran out of the room and headed down a hallway to his own bedroom. He pulled off the blanket on his bed, threw away his pillow and grabbed a key he had hidden there, then quickly rushed back to Catrina. "Here! I found it!"\nAs soon as he presented it to her, she grabbed it and ran on all fours to the potion storage, her paws trembling as she unlocked it. Once inside, she emptied a full vial of witchweed potion into her mouth, letting out a relaxed sigh. "Where was the key, anyways?"\n"I, uh, seems you dropped it on the floor..." Rep replied, trying to remain calm.\n"Hm, strange. I'll have to make sure to not lose it again. Thank you, Rep," she said and grinned.\nSomething about her expression made Rep's brow quiver.

"Leave us," she muttered to the generals, who bowed in respect and departed the meeting hall. The great magocat of Abyssinia then turned to face her most loyal servant. "What could possibly be more important than the plans for my next military campaign?"\n"Our relationship," Rep stated bluntly. "Frankly, I can't take this anymore, Catrina. I've done everything you've asked me to do, I've tried to be a good friend, but after I saw what happened to all our neighbouring countries, I just can't."\nCatrina's face twisted as she tried her best to control her emotions. "So you're abandoning me?"\n"N-no, no..." he sighed heavily. "I wanted to give you one last chance. To choose between me... or that Machine. I swear, after you had your slaves construct it, the witchweed potions changed you. I hardly recognize you anymore."\nShe forced a chuckle. "I can't believe you're doing this to me, Rep."\n"I am sorry, but I've reached my limit. Destroy the machine, release all your slaves and keep as much witchweed potion as you need to avoid withdrawal symptoms while you gradually stop using it, or I will resign. And probably move back to the Dragonlands, too."\nCatrina gritted her fangs and grimaced. Rep simply looked back at her, his eyes weary yet begging for her to make the right choice.

Find the troublesome Clawomons and bring them to me dead or alive." She turned to look closely at one of the operatives, glaring at his stoic face. "But it won't be easy. Their resistance is well organized and distributed across the nation. Especially in the remote highland villages, there are many civilians supporting and sheltering these terrorists and rebels. They can blend into the populace and avoid detection. They use modern radios for communication and use secret channels as well as encrypted messages. Do you understand the challenge ahead of you?"\nThe cat she was staring at replied. "Yes ma'am!"\n"Good." Catrina stepped back so all of them could see her. "Nevertheless, I believe you can do it. I will provide you all the support and resources that I can afford. I expect you to go through all of Abyssinia with a comb, searching every nook and cranny. Think of it as... hunting rats hiding in holes. If you succeed, I will reward you most generously. Understood?"\n"Yes ma'am!" they all shouted in unison.\n"Good. You are dismissed.

Countless buildings and monuments, finest displays of Arabian architecture, with its domes and towers... all damaged or in ruins. She also saw much what the state media would never dare to show to the Abyssinian populace back home: piles of charred corpses of civilians, huge holes dug for mass graves, the identification process for Abyssinian casualties where unrecognizable piles of flesh were closely inspected, field hospitals filled to the brim with wailing wounded. And worst of all was the smell. It smelled like death everywhere she went, even in the relatively undamaged parts of the city that had been spared from the fighting.\n\nEscorted by the Crown Guard, she came to the central square in front of a palace that had once belonged to the Grand Prince of Saddle Arabia. From this building, the order to invade Abyssinia had come, all those centuries ago. In the middle of the square stood a flagpole, and soldiers saluted it as the Abyssinian flag was raised. There was no wind to make it flutter, so it was like a bloodied rag hanging from a stick.\n"Will you hold your speech?" The general of the Crown Guard asked. "We've cleaned up a spot for it, and the cameras and microphones are ready to record it."\nCatrina snapped out of her thoughts. "Huh? Um... I don't... I think I'll have to cancel the speech. I don't feel like holding it."\n"Ma'am? Are you sick? Do you need medical help?"\n"No, let the doctors focus on the wounded. Tell the reporters the speech is cancelled, and escort me back to the airport."\nDespite the general's best efforts to remain emotionless, there was a brief confused frown, followed by a deep bow. "As you wish, your majesty."\nThe general then left, leaving her standing there all alone. She looked around herself and realized no one was paying attention to her.

In the courtyard, a fountain sputtered crystal clear water as couples danced around it.\n\nOn top of a stairwell leading down to the courtyard, Catrina stood hesitantly. Her hair was cut short and she wore a long dress she hadn't worn in decades. She trembled a little as a result of withdrawal from witchweed potion, but managed to keep it under control.\n"You look beautiful, Catrina," Rep said, wearing a tuxedo and a top hat.\n"Do you really think so, darling?" she asked shyly.\n"Just like the good old days!"\nA spotlight suddenly focused on Catrina, and Rep took her paw. "Go on, Catrina! Your public awaits!"\nShe frowned. "I'd be happy to, Rep, dear, but you're standing on my dress!" she hissed.\nRep looked down and realized she was correct. He lifted his leg and gave her an embarrased smile. "Excuse me."\n\nThe two walked down the stairs together as the cats below turned to look up at them and cheer.

"As such, we will now formally place our recently activated militias under your command."\n"That was the plan for this meeting, yes."\nA cat in glasses raised her paw. "Actually, the Abyssinian Socialist Party wished to also discuss preliminary post-war political plans."\n"Nice alliteration," Sharp remarked.\n"From what we've gathered, your planned policies align with our socialist values, while maintaining the republican form of government desired by the Popular League."\nShe tilted her head and raised an eyebrow.

Thousands of non-felines packed whatever belongings they had acquired since becoming free and embarked on a great journey back home. Both the Abyssinian and [From.GetAdjective] governments cooperated to ensure their travel was safe and provided whatever support they needed. Interestingly, the reaction of the native Abyssinian populace was not entirely negative. Especially the feline commoners were happy to see another race leaving their homeland, and some even helped the former slaves. However, the fact that some Abyssinians hurled sarcastic racially insensitive remarks at them as they left shows that they were more happy to get rid of them more than anything."

The transitional government responded by promising to take care of any of them and reminded them that all ex-slaves had been granted citizenship. While this calmed some of them, others decided to make a risky journey back home on their own, without any support or guarantee of safety upon their arrival. Nothing was heard of them afterwards. Interestingly, the reaction of the native Abyssinian populace was not entirely positive. Especially the feline commoners expressed sympathy for them, being equally frustrated at the [From.GetAdjective] government.

"Why is it so hard for everyone to agree on something?"\n"Such is the nature of deliberative decision-making," Dejen explained and put his papers aside. "It seems you'll have the final say on the matter, as the head of state."\n"I thought I could take it easy after all my hard work organizing the revolution, but I guess not." She sighed. "To be fair, it is a tough decision to make."\n"No it's not," Sennacherib said with a snort filled with contempt. "Kill 'em all and be done with it."\nDejen never glared at anyone, except now.\n"We have shed enough blood already," Sharp replied. "At least I have. But it is true that they are a potential threat to our security-"\nThe grey cat was quick to interrupt. "They could be useful to us. I can act as an intermediary and ensure only those without strong loyalties to the monarchy will serve you."\nSennacherib gnarled. "Are you serious? You should be grateful we spared you, and instead you just want to save your friends from justice!"\n"I assure you, I only have friends outside of work, and they are all civilians. I am not acting out of self-interest, I am simply trying to ensure a smooth transition to a new form of government."\nSharp groaned.

This is just part of my attempts to ensure the transition of power goes smoothly."\nSennacherib furrowed his brow. "And you invited us here to this confidential urgent meeting just to tell us this? Could've sent us a message instead."\n"No, the transitional government has entrusted me with the appointment of the new Commander-In-Chief of the army. And I can't think of anyone better suited for the job than you two."\n"...But we cannot share the same position," Fahd stated bluntly after spending a moment in deep thought.\n"Obviously not, you-!" Sennacherib exclaimed, then quickly reined himself in and turned to look at Sharp. "So why invite him, then?"\n"Because I struggle to decide between you two. I was hoping this meeting would help me with that."\n"Just pick me and be done with it," the donkey replied. "You know well that thanks to my meticulous planning and firm leadership, the revolutionary army wasn't just a loose gang of bandits, but a properly organized force of guerilla fighters."\n"Allow me to be honest, ma'am," Fahd said, "He is not particularly popular in the ranks. During the rebellion, I had multiple petitions of soldiers asking to be transitioned from his command to mine."\nSennacherib grunted angrily. "Bah! My discipline kept the army together, and it was still far kinder than the cruel whip of our former masters." He pointed at the scar on his lips to prove his point.\n\nSharp Spear wearily gazed off into the distance, lost in thought as she once again had to make an important decision."

Was there anything else?"\nThe messenger was turning around to leave when she asked that. "Uh... may I express an honest opinion? I think your government has allowed freedom of speech and such."\n"Go ahead," Sharp said with an encouraging nod.\nThe cat took a deep breath and looked her straight in the eyes. "With all due respect, ma'am, you claim to have brought us liberty, but in truth you have imposed upon us a political system we did not ask for."\nSharp's smile faded, and for a brief moment she did not know what to say.\nIn that moment, the messenger pulled out a concealed pistol and pointed it at her own head. "I have no desire to live in the kind of nation you're making.

Then she had dragged her hooves to a yet another meeting, this time with the transitional government. In the end, no agreement or consensus had been reached in either. Utterly exhausted, she headed out to share a drink with her friend.\n\n"You look like you went to Tartarus, wrestled a bugbear, and then came back," Fahd Al-Kasaar joked, laughed heartily and drank from his cup of coffee.\n"I sure feel like it," Sharp mumbled and sipped from her tankard of honey wine.\n"It's a shame working at a coffee plantation ruined coffee for you. Drinking it lifts your spirits!"\n"So does this," she said with a smirk and sipped again.\n"Fair enough. Say, I know you don't like talking about work, but wouldn't it ease your burden to do so?"\nShe sighed. "Oh, it's all about this Manedalusia dispute. I was going to just hoof it over to its rightful owners, but apparently neither Manedalusians nor the government agreed on that. The former wants full on independence, the latter just wants to give them autonomy."\nFahd rubbed his chin with his hoof. "Sounds tricky, yes.

We have lost contact with garrison units in multiple provinces. All we're getting are scattered reports from all over the country about armed cats attacking strategic locations. We're completely overwhelmed," he said calmly with no sign of worry or panic.\nSharp's breathing sharpened and quickened. "H-how did this happen? We had no warning or intel about this!"\nSennacherib shrugged. "You seemed pretty relaxed about things, so most of the army has been demobilized. We don't have an intelligence service and our garrisons are spread thin across the country. This was only a matter of time."\nSharp covered her face with her hoof and spoke with a quiet and weary voice. "By the gods, I'm sorry, I didn't expect such widespread resistance against us... we promised them nothing but good things, that we wanted to make Abyssinia a better place for everycreature. I guess... they didn't like that idea."\nThe donkey finally displayed emotion by snorting with contempt. "What did you expect from those feline fleabags? You can't save them, Sharp. The entire race is bent on enslaving others so they can be lazy and do nothing all day."\nShe stared at him in shock. "I... I know we've all had bad experiences with them, but you can't condemn all of them due to the actions of a small minority!"\n"This uprising is no small minority.

"We apologize for the timing and wish for no hard feelings between Abyssinia and Manedalusia."\n"I'd call you opportunists, but then I'd be hypocritical. You are not interested in aiding us?"\n"Unfortunately, we have to secure control of our newly freed homeland first."\n"Right... well, as a Maregyptian mare I hope Maregypt respects your decision like I am forced to do now." She, too, stretched out her lips in a smile that was hardly friendly.\n"We shall see what happens. In any case, we will continue to fight for our independence as long as it takes."\n"You know, I can respect that attitude.

"Good luck with your own struggles."\n"Yeah, whatever... now if you may excuse me, I have to find where my general went," Sharp said and without any further words trotted down a hallway.

"Peace is more important to me than political dogmatism. I may not be cat, but I do not want to appear like a foreigner imposing change upon Abyssinia. I've realized that to make this country a better place for every creature, every creature needs to work together.

 abyssinia.183.d:0 "The central hospital in Panthera was so full of patients that some had spilled onto the hallways and even outside. As Sharp Spear tried to enter the building to visit an old friend of hers, she had to navigate the maze of beds and stretchers full of injured, sick or famished patients. The fighting in the civil war had caused wounds, the chaos of the conflict had disrupted food logistics, and the lack of food had caused disease to run rampant. Sharp Spear did her best to focus her gaze on her path, blocking out the world of misery all around her.\n\nEventually, she entered a cramped hospital room and saw her friend. Bontu, the zebra she had known since becoming a slave, was lying on a bed with her leg in a splint. She was sleeping, so Sharp sat down on a chair next to her and waited patiently. When she eventually woke up, she was startled by the visitor. "Sharp? What in God's name are you doing here?"\n"Thought I'd pay you a visit and check how you're doing. Had a free spot in my schedule to do so."\nBontu frowned, in a mixture of confusion and frustration. "How nice of you. But you do know that ultimately, you're responsible for what happened to my leg?"\nSharp tilted her head. "What? But I thought you were injured from the shrapnel of an artillery shell."\n"And why was that shell fired? Because of you! You and your crazy dreams of making Abyssinia some sort of paradise. Instead, you've made it Tartarus!"\nSharp winced, as if she had just been stabbed. "Bontu, please, I had the best intentions. And I haven't given up yet."\n"Your stubbornness is going to be your doom," Bontu muttered.\n"No, I've learned from my mistakes. I swear, I will fix all this mess. And while I can't heal your leg, I'll make sure you get everything you need."\nBontu took a pained breath and sighed. "Remember the plantation we lived on? Life was hard, but we had each other. That was enough to make life bearable. But ever since you left to lead your revolution, everything's just gotten worse and worse. So forgive me for being sceptical."\nSharp could no longer look at her and stared at the floor instead. There was a drawn out, uncomfortable silence. It was only broken when she finally said:"

He had discovered factual evidence in the royal archives of Abyssinia that the feline Kingdom's southern lands had once not only belonged to donkeys, but had been inhabited by them. Centuries ago, the local donkey population had been expelled south and replaced by cats. Sennacherib's movement aimed to undo this injustice and reclaim their ancestral lands.\n\nNow, with the collapse of the revolutionary government, Neo-Asstyria stands triumphant. Already, vengeance has been enacted upon the perfidious cats, and donkeys have taken what is rightfully theirs. Sennacherib has sent a request to [Root.GetLeader] for annexation of Neo-Asstyrian lands. Of course, there is no reason to refuse such an offer, so [Root.GetLeader] has decided to accept. [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers and administrators are already crossing the former Abyssinian border and securing our control of the north."

They were almost all cats, pulling carts and wagons full of belongings. There were not just adults, but kittens and elderly cats too. Sharp spotted a few ponies, horses and zebras too.\n\nBut not a single donkey.\n\nShe gritted her teeth and looked south, the direction where all the refugees were coming from.

The two were standing in line at a voting booth, waiting for their turn to cast their votes. The building they were in had an artillery shell-sized hole on its wall that was being actively - and loudly - repaired by a group of workers.\n"Tamrat, I can barely hear you in this infernal noise!" the donkey replied with frustration. "But if you asked what my vote is, too bad. I'm not telling."\n"Oh come on, I'll tell you mine," Tamrat Pawit said with a smirk. "I'm voting for the republic, of course! That's why I joined this revolution in the first place."\n"Yeah, what IS that donkey voting for?" a cat behind them asked. Suddenly a lot of the other people waiting in line became curious as well.\nEnkara the donkey scowled. "Hey, I didn't fight for Sennacherib! Stop staring at me like that. I'm a high ranking officer in the army of the Republic!"\n"So you're voting for the republic, right?" Tamrat asked with an even bigger smirk.\n"My vote is none of your business! The ballots are meant to be secret, anyways."\n"I say screw the republic!" a lanky old cat, barely standing on one leg and leaning on a stick, grumbled. "They've caused nothing but chaos. We need the monarchy back to restore peace and order!"\nEnkara glared at him. "Watch your tongue, many brave fighters gave their lives to topple it!"\n"So you ARE voting for the republic too!" Tamrat said and chuckled.\n"Well, I lost a leg to restore it!" the cat with a missing leg responded and raised a clenched paw in the air. "Long live the monarchy!"\nTamrat, still smiling, gave up his spot on the line to step in between Enkara and the cat veteran. "Now calm down you two. The referendum is being held to solve this dispute. Let's all just cast our votes and see the results, shall we, friends?""
 abyssinia.186.a:0 "The REPUBLIC gets a majority of the votes!"
 abyssinia.186.b:0 "The MONARCHY gets a majority of the votes!"
 
 #Organizing a referendum right after a civil war was no easy task. The bureaucracy of the transitional government was barely functional and overstretched by the simple but gargantuan effort of keeping the civilian population alive. At the very least, the Abyssinian Patriotic Front offered to help with the vote. Their presence at voting stations helped legitimize the vote, as they were popular in many places across Abyssinia. However, their organization did not reach the south, which was devastated by Sennacherib's campaign of destruction. As such, the southern provinces would barely participate in the vote.\n\nThe voting process itself was mostly without problems, though tensions remained between republicans and monarchists among the populace, especially in the cities. Sporadic protests appeared, though violence was rare as everyone had been drained by the two recent civil wars. Observers from both the Patriotic Front and the United Republican Front tried to ensure that the vote wasn't rigged in the favour of either side. The few accusations and disputes that did appear were usually resolved peacefully.\n\nThe question presented to the voters was simple: "1. REPUBLIC or 2. MONARCHY?", with accompanying symbols of a star and a crown to make the meaning clear for illiterate voters. After several days of voting and counting ballots, Sharp Spear, as the acting head of state, would announce the results to the transitional government.
 
 abyssinia.187.t:0 "The First Citizen"
 abyssinia.187.d:0 "Hundreds of cats crowded inside a soup kitchen as meat stew was being distributed free of charge. Sharp Spear looked at the sight with a smile on her lips.\nFahd Al-Kasaar stood besides her. "I don't know much about politics, but I feel like this is going to make them vote for you in the upcoming elections."\nSharp's smile was swiftly replaced by a frown. "I'm not doing this to get votes, Fahd. You know that. I'm doing this to try and fix the mess I've caused."\nNow it was Fahd's turn to smile. "I know. I'm teasing you. Besides, pretty sure most of them were going to vote for you anyways. It's not like there's any other good options. I'm surprised the Patriot isn't running for the position of the First Citizen."\n"It's concerning. Not the Patriot, I mean. But especially the poor are starting to see me as a larger-than-life figure. I've had two military victories in a short span of time, and they still believe my promises. They're starting to forget I'm just some mare."\n"That should make your power grab smoother," Fahd said in a teasing tone.\n"Oh shut it," Sharp said without actually sounding offended. "The constitutional amendment to create the position of First Citizen combines the head of state and head of government into one, yes, but I'm fine with anycreature else having that position. I simply got tired of all the bickering in the transitional government."\nFahd shrugged. "Guess you'll be stuck here dealing with the bickering of the parliament instead, once they're elected. Don't you miss home?"\nShe sighed. "This is my home now. I'll just... have to get used to all this.""
 abyssinia.187.a:0 "She is merely first among equals."
 
 #Following the referendum, the transitional government had little trouble amending the constitution, as it would remain mostly the same. However, the head of state, Sharp Spear, had requested there to be a strong executive, in the form of a head of state and head of government sharing the same position. This was partially appeasement to monarchists who remained in the country, especially those who were part of the Patriotic Front. But she also stressed the necessity of separation of powers, with there being both a parliament and a judiciary. This way she tried to calm those who accused her of trying to grab power for herself.\n\nThus already two weeks after the referendum, the Abyssinians headed to the polls again, this time to elect a First Citizen for the first time. Everyone with sufficient amount of support was allowed to become a candidate, though by now Sharp Spear had grown into a larger-than-life figure with her military successes. Not only did she promise to favour workers and peasants over elites, but by now her leadership was a safety guarantee. As such, it was little surprise when she received over 73% of the vote.

They killed livestock everywhere down south."\n"But... why? They're non-combatants!"\nShrugging, he replied: "Donkeys don't eat meat.

It's a plan to starve us out, creating a land where only herbivores can survive."\nShe narrowed her eyes. "Those asses. Don't they know all of Abyssinia is having a food crisis? Not just the lands they claim are 'theirs'."\nHe had a pained grin on his lips. "That's the thing, isn't it? They don't care. It's collective punishment for the crimes of our ancestors.

Unfortunately, it was a rather passive-aggressive expression: a smile with sharp fangs visible. "You know, I should've been thankful for your little 'revolution'. For several reasons, in fact. First, I got to experience a civilian life free of obligations. Still was rather stressful, though. Second, I got to see someone else be an even worse ruler than I was, leaving Abyssinia in an even worse state."\nSharp winced and lowered her ears. "Y-yes, I know... you're welcome, I guess."

Now, the people have decided they want the monarchy back, and I believe both of us want to respect their wishes."\nFor a moment, Gomez just stared at her intensely.

 abyssinia.194.t:0 "A Guide To Abyssinian Names"
 abyssinia.194.d:0 "Unlike in some cultures, there are no surnames in Abyssinia. Every cat has two names: a personal name assigned to kittens at birth, and a patronymic/matronymic. Male offspring receive a patronymic, the personal name of their father, while female offspring receive a matronymic, the personal name of their mother. This means lineage is difficult to trace by name alone. In addition, it means some cats can have "double names" with the personal name and a given name of a parent being identical, though this is rare.\n\nLet us have an example: a male tomcat named Mewolde Garfield marries a female ladycat named Grimalkin Arlene. They have two kittens, one male and one female. They give the male one the personal name of Nermal, and the female one is given the name of Hissai. Thus, the full name of the male kitten is now Nermal Mewolde, while the female kitten is known as Hissai Grimalkin.\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of families and dynasties still exists in Abyssinian culture. However, only noble and royal families have distinct names, which are never included as part of an individual's full name. For example, one could say "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon", but calling him "Gomez Clawomon" is wrong and a diplomatic faux pas often done by Wingbardian diplomats, who are unfamiliar with Abyssinian culture.\n\nNames are traditionally recorded by Baastist priests and stored in temple archives. However, the expansion of state bureaucracy has meant that the state itself now keeps track of the names of its citizenry."

Someday, the sun, too, would set for the final time.\nHe took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He, too, would someday take his final breath. Chronicles recording his reign, his mistakes and his triumphs, would one day decay into dust. Abyssinia, too, would one day cease to exist, with every cat's nine lives spent. The Abyssinian race, too, would one day go extinct. All was transient and temporary. All was subject to change.\n"To become everything, one must first become nothing."\nAfter recounting these words of Baast, Gomez thought of the past. The Storm King had ruined his kingdom and taken his family's wealth, allowing Wingbardians and slaves to take advantage of his weakness. Overwhelmed, he had coped with sinful acts, sensual pleasures of substances, and had even entertained the idea of escaping suffering through self-annihilation. Yet these had only made things worse. Suffering had led to clinging, clinging had led to suffering. He had not yet known that only physical pain could cause unavoidable suffering. All other forms of suffering were subject to mental states and emotions.\nHe opened his eyes. He had to learn to let go. If his wife died tomorrow, for example, he could be sad, but he would have to accept it. It is one thing to love someone, and another thing entirely to cling onto them forever. If Panthera burned tomorrow, he would simply have to rebuild it, like ants rebuild their nests after a flood. His failures and pain were just as temporary as his successes and pleasure. And most importantly, he shouldn't always blame himself for his misfortune. The stream of water had to extinguish the flames.\nHe had a long way to go. But at least, he felt he was on the right path.

Let us excise this capitalist-feudalist tumour from the Abyssinian body!"\n"We are not violating the treaty we signed," Sharp said calmly yet sternly.\n"The one YOU signed!" the cat in glasses exclaimed and pointed an accusatory claw.\nThe pony's calmness rapidly disintegrated and she placed her hooves on the table. "You think enough Abyssinians haven't died? You have more mass graves to fill? The treaty was meant to guarantee peace and stability. I would unite with anyone to do right and with no one to do wrong!"\nBefore the communist cat could retort, the republican cat spoke. "She has a point. Let us not take things too far, then. But nevertheless, I believe we should keep them at arm's length, even if they manage to win the elections somehow. The Patriot cannot be trusted. We need to avoid any cooperation with them."\n"...Is that a demand?" Sharp asked.\n"Sounds too harsh," he replied. "More of a... request. But if you cannot fulfill our humble request, accept this offer of compromise, then I do not see how the United Republican Front can remain united."\nWith a heavy sigh, Sharp said:"

"I really thought this would've been easy to push through parliament," she muttered to herself bitterly. When it became quiet, she perked up and actually paid attention.\n"Ms. Spear," a feline representative said loudly and clearly, standing up from his seat, "The APF believes there is no need to erase traditional province boundaries. They do not merely represent dominions of nobility, but also cultural and geographical boundaries. While we have nothing against provincial councils being elected democratically, adjusting these centuries-old province borders would cause nothing but disarray."\nThe argument threatened to erupt again when another representative also stood up, her fangs bared. "The APF simply wants to use this to their advantage! Their support base is in the countryside, and by keeping rural areas divided into small provinces, they can dominate local politics!"\n"It is not your turn to speak," Sharp remarked, then turned to the APF representative. "Do you have anything to add?"\n"Allow me to say that the fewer provinces Abyssinia is divided into, the less provincial councils will represent local interests. Is the goal of your party not to make Abyssinia more democratic and equal?"\nShe nodded thoughtfully. "Thank you. I shall therefore reconsider my proposal.

 abyssinia.203.d:0 "Fahd and Sharp were lying down, legs folded underneath them as they were quietly reading books. While Sharp's eyes darted quickly, Fahd's eyes moved slower as he tried to decipher the mystical symbols commonly known as letters. After a short time, he let out a tired sigh. "Reading's exhausting. Can I stop for a little?"\nSharp smiled at him warmly. "Of course." She glanced at his opened book while he stood up to get some coffee. "You've made good progress today. Three pages in an hour! The more you read, the less tiring it will get."\n"I hope you're right," Fahd said, then poured a cup of coffee with his mouth.\nSharp, too, took a break, placing her bookmark on the opened pages and closing the book. "For me, it's not tiring at all. Relaxing, in fact. It's nice to take a break from all the politicking."\nFahd returned, holding a tray with a steaming hot cup of coffee and a mug of honey wine with his hoof. As he offered Sharp the mug, he noticed the title of the book she had been reading, though it took him effort to read it. "'Capital. The Political Economy of Equestria'... hm, wasn't that written by that one pony? Curl Mark or whatever?"\nSharp nodded while drinking her wine. "Yeah, the Abyssinian communists can't stop talking about her."\n"Hm, I see..." Fahd lied back down and took a sip from his cup. "You know, Sharp, what's the appeal of this whole 'socialism' thing anyways? I thought you would've been happy just ending slavery in Abyssinia and being done with it."\n"Well, I wanted to ensure the permanent eradication of any forms of slavery in Abyssinia, and I soon realized that required figuring out why slavery existed and how I could prevent it entirely. Not long before I met you, I got in touch with the republican and socialist rebels. I learned a lot from both of them. They opposed monarchy, feudalism and slavery and saw them as intertwined. All three are built on exploitation of the unfree peasants and slaves. The answer is empowering the masses by giving them control over politics and economics, displacing the entrenched elite."\n"Aah, um, right. But... I heard socialism was slavery, everything is public property and that in Stalliongrad nohor- I mean nopony owns their clothes or even toothbrushes?"\nSharp frowned. "What..? That's nonsense, though Stalliongrad has its fair share of problems. I don't intend to be a glorified bandit or enforce my ideals on anyone. But... slaves were property, I was property. And I sure as Tartarus don't want anyone to be treated like property ever again!" She stood up and started holding a speech. "It makes no difference if the owner is a feudal lord, a businessperson or the state government. Every creature deserves freedom to live without work if they so desire, and to fully control their own destiny. I am a warrior for not just socialism, but liberty as well in equal measure! Others may sacrifice democracy for the sake of socialism, or vice versa, but I do my best to avoid such a fate."\nFahd stared at her, surprised by how emotional she got. "Wow. That's... you've always been a mare of ideals, heh. Sadly, I think I only understood half of that.""

Here were buried the donkeys, ponies, horses and zebras who had perished during the civil wars.\n\nSharp and Fahd stopped in front of a small burial mound. The purple mare took a deep breath, gathering strength to look at it, while Fahd placed a supportive hoof on her shoulder. "A year has passed since it ended," Sharp mumbled. "I know you died after the fighting had stopped, but the wound that ended up killing you was caused by the conflict. Indirectly, I am responsible for your death. At least... at least I got to say sorry before it was too late." Sharp tried to smile, but her mouth quivered and she started weeping. "I'm sorry, Bontu, I still am..." she whispered bitterly. Fahd embraced her.\n\nAfter she had calmed down, the stallion took out items needed for a veneration ritual originating from Bontu's homeland. Together, the two sprinkled the grave mound with palm oil and salt. On that moment, a strong gust of wind blew from the south. Sharp turned to face it, then smiled again.

They informed us that the leader of the revolution, Sharp Spear, was reverting many of the more radical policies that had been implemented before the counter-revolution.\n\nIt is a shame the victory of the Abyssinian socialists turned out to be a pyrrhic one, because their leadership decided to compromise with fascists and reactionaries.

I can actually understand most of what you all wrote... though I see Scratchy still needs to work on his paw writing."\nScratchy pouted and crossed his arms while the others laughed.\nThe teacher took the cloth and wrapped it around his neck like a cape.

"You are certain you do not wish to stay?"\n"It was nice to live in the countryside, but I must return to my duties in the capital. But perhaps I'll come and visit someday.

The monarch of Abyssinia has fled, practically ending any hopes of retaining monarchical rule.\n\nAggressive [Root.GetAdjective] policies against Abyssinia were long justified by their institution of slavery, but it has now de facto been abolished.

Yet things like civilization and morality are inherently unnatural, and they differentiate us from wild beasts. Where in nature can slavery even be found?"\n"It is indeed curious how the greater majority of those who defend the practice of slavery have never experienced slavery themselves."\n"When Emperor Grover I abolished slavery in the Griffonian Empire, it was quickly replaced with serfdom, which was little better. When Queen Mewodora II abolished the enslavement of Abyssinian cats, they were quickly replaced with slaves of other races. No matter what, the slave-owners will always try to find a legal loophole that allows them to continue their oppression."\n"If slavery is good for the slaves, then slave revolts wouldn't have repeatedly occurred throughout history all across the world."\n"Slavery isn't 'redeemed' by outlawing the mistreatment of slaves. If anything, such a ban simply acknowledges that slaves have rights, and cannot be treated like inanimate objects. Ultimately, limiting the freedom of an individual is a kind of mistreatment as well."\n"There is no economic justification for slavery, especially after the invention of factories and machines."\n"Slavery is the ultimate form of social stratification and inequality. Thus, the only way to guarantee the permanent end of slavery is creating a society where all individuals are as free and equal as practically possible.""

As he climbed down the winding tunnel, the lamp became increasingly unnecessary as he approached a source of light. Finally, he entered a large illuminated chamber that had been converted into a small base of operations. Dozens of cats were there, maintaining equipment, preparing food, playing dice games and discussing plans. The cat in robes sighed from relief and put down his bag on the cavern floor with a loud thump.\nA female tabby cat sat upon a carved throne of stone when she heard it. Immediately, she stood up and walked to the new arrival. "Oh finally, what took you so long?"\n"Queen Catrina, I am sorry, but I had to take another route," the bag-bearer replied, "As I suspected I was being followed."\nShe motioned for other cats to go open the bag for her, then turned to glare at him. "You made sure you weren't being followed from above?"\n"...From above?"\n"They have pegasi! That can fly! Were you being followed by one or not?!"\n"I... I'm not sure," he replied with increasing anxiety.\n"Ugh, whatever. I suppose we should move to another base to avoid being found. I am sick of this dank cave anyways. I miss my manor, with all its luxuries..." She sighed melodramatically.\n\nAlmost without making a sound, a group of cats, ponies, zebras, donkeys and horses suddenly appeared from the shadows behind them. They were armed to the teeth. "PAWS UP!" one of them shouted, pointing a submachine gun at Catrina. "You are all under arrest. Do not resist or you will face consequences."\nWhile every other cat inside the secret lair obeyed, Catrina hissed and reached for a vial of liquid that was hanging around her neck. But before she could even touch it, a loud shot rang out with an echo and a bullet whizzed by her whiskers.\n"I SAID PAWS UP!

 abyssinia.211.t:0 "A Guide To [Root.GetAdjective] Political Parties"
 abyssinia.211.d_urf_split:0 "RLM - Revolutionary Liberation Movement\nThe RLM was founded by Sharp Spear after the dissolution of the URF. It is very much a personalist party, both representing and supporting the policies of its founder and leader. Abolitionism is thus the core principle of the party, and everything else is in service of it. Sharp Spear believes both socialism and democracy are needed to permanently prevent the re-emergence of the institution of slavery, but is willing to compromise with her opponents in the name of peace.\n\nASP - Abyssinian Socialist Party\nThe Abyssinian Socialist Party was founded in 998 ALB, two years after the Winter Revolution took place in Equestrian Severyana. It is heavily influenced by Stalliongradian socialism and wished to repeat their success. However, the party was almost immediately banned by the Clawomonic monarchy due to its radical anti-monarchist stance. It has a small support base, mostly coming from the ranks of Abyssinia's urban proletariat, and thus has always relied on cooperation with other factions to survive. The party advocates for a centrally planned state-owned economy and the rapid modernization of Abyssinia, which would allow it to transition to communism.\n\nPL - Popular League\nThe Popular League is the first and oldest political party in the country, being formed by urban intellectuals and merchants in 979 ALB. Inspired by the Griffonian Revolution, it is radically anti-monarchist and advocates for the creation of a liberal democracy with a free market. Ironically, it was never particularly popular. Like ASP, PL was also banned by the Clawomonic monarchy shortly after its founding, but it managed to survive underground. After the revolution, it has become a fierce opponent of the government's socialist policies.\n\nAPF - Abyssinian Patriotic Front\nLittle is known about the APF's origins, as it started as a guerrilla resistance movement opposing the revolutionary transitional government of Abyssinia. It is clear that a mysterious figure called "The Patriot" is its founder and leader, though his true identity is unknown. After allowing to enter party politics, the APF was quick to rally nationalist and right-wing supporters among Abyssinia's native feline populace. Though officially the APF condemns radicalism after peace was made and tries to rein in extreme ideas, there are anti-revolutionary pro-slavery reactionaries among its ranks. The APF advocates for either the restoration of the monarchy or a strong executive government. Economically, it seeks to protect the rights of both merchants and landowners."
 abyssinia.211.d_urf_no_split:0 "URF - United Republican Front\nThe URF was formed when the Abyssinian Socialist Party and the Popular League merged to create a united front against monarchist forces. As an unofficial third group, the slave liberation army led by Sharp Spear also belonged to the URF, and she was given command of military operations thanks to her experience and accomplishments. The URF is thus a big tent party of sorts, including communists, socialists, centrists and liberals among its ranks. These disparate groups have always been unified by the principles of anti-monarchist republicanism and abolitionism.\n\nAPF - Abyssinian Patriotic Front\nLittle is known about the APF's origins, as it started as a guerrilla resistance movement opposing the revolutionary transitional government of Abyssinia.

Hmpf!"\n"No you di-" Sharp tried to say.\n"Quiet, you!" her mother interrupted and hugged her tighter, squeezing the air out of her.\n"A-and who the heck is this horse then?" her father asked, pointing at the tall stallion next to them.\nFahd bowed. "I am Fahd Al-Kasaar, from Yemane."\n"...What are you selling?" the father asked, narrowing his eyes.\nSharp chuckled while catching her breath. "He's not a saleshorse. That's my coltfriend. We're planning to get married."\nImmediately, Blunt stumbled backwards, his eyes wide open and mouth agape. "W-what! Did you come back just to give me a heart attack?!""

 abyssinia.236.d_has_agency:0 "Agents of the RSIS emptied their suitcases and poured a mountain of evidence on Sharp Spear's desk. Decrypted messages, photographs, transcripts of radio communications... if it had all been forged, it would've been a monumental and flawless effort. She simply stared at it all in disbelief.\n"You wanted to know why we arrested those people," one of the agents, a cat wearing sunglases, said. "Here is your answer."\nSharp shuffled through the pile, reading and examining it all with widened eyes. "So it really is true. These socialists wanted to execute a coup."\n"They could've succeeded too, without us," the agent replied.\nShe looked up at him with a stern gaze. "What's the motive? Why'd they do this? Why does someone always want to backstab and betray me?"\n"Quite simple. In their correspondence it becomes quite clear they believed you and your government to be traitors to the revolution, especially after the recent denouncement of Stalliongrad. To quote, they claimed you had 'sold the country to bourgeois pig scum' and 'embraced social feudal-fascism' and plotted to 'turn the working class into wage slaves'."\nShe blinked several times, then exhaled sharply. "They have a way with words, for sure."\n"Indeed. But all the lead conspirators have been arrested. We are taking down their wider network too, finding everyone involved. It will take time, but we will find them all."\nSharp nodded and smiled. "Thank you, agent. Now uh, could you please clean up my desk? I have work to do...""
 abyssinia.236.d_no_agency:0 "Gunfire rang out on the streets of Panthera. Sharp Spear's snoring was interrupted and she leaped out of bed, immediately drawing out a knife she kept near her bed. Looking around the dark bedroom in confusion, she saw no threats inside. She yawned and walked groggily to the window, which was the source of the echoing rattle of gunshots. Outdoors, there was an ominous glow of orange illuminating the sky. A large fire was burning somewhere nearby.\nIn her bed, a stallion stirred. "Mhm... what's wrong, Sharpie?" Fahd Al-Kasaar asked, mumbling.\nShe frowned. "Nothing good."\n\nThen the door of her bedroom slammed open, startling her and making her raise her knife again, but she lowered it once she saw Tamrat Pawit, one of her generals, standing in the doorframe. The cat's eyes darted around the room, analyzing it. "You're safe," he said with a nod.\n"Of course I'm safe," Sharp replied with exasperation. "What's going on outside?"\n"Not sure, it's chaos out there. But I've heard reports that it's a coup attempt?"\nHer drowsy eyes widened. "A coup? By whom? The Patriotic Front?"\nHe shook his head. "I think one attacker was captured and said he was a socialist."\nSomehow she managed to widen her eyes even more. "Socialist? Radical socialists are trying to coup me?"\n"That's all the information I have."\nSharp was quiet for a moment. "Is it because of the whole denouncement of Stalliongrad thing? Did I really upset some of them that much?"\nTamrat shrugged. "Maybe. But the good news are that their attempt seems to be failing, at least last I heard."\nSharp nodded. "Alright. Let's go clean up the rest, then."\nFahd grumbled in bed and buried himself in the blankets. "One more minute, Sharpie...""

 abyssinia.237.t:0 "The Dam Proposal"
 abyssinia.237.d:0 "As the cabinet meeting continued, Sharp Spear glanced at the clock on the wall. Fifteen minutes past twelve.\nA zebra minister of economy spoke. "These two dams are absolutely vital. Think of how many hectares of farmland can be irrigated, think of how many houses can be provided with electricity, think of how much water we can store for the dry season!"\n"And what of the consequences?" a feline foreign minister said. "Tiger and Panther rivers both flow into the lands of the donkeys. The more water we claim, the less they will have."\nA donkey interior minister nodded. "The donkey minority would not accept. They already suffer from discrimination after Sennacherib's revolt, and this would alienate them even more."\n"But think of how many jobs it will provide," a pony minister of labour spoke.\n"And how many factories it will power!" a horse minister of industry added.\n"I would rather say: think of the environmental damage," a feline environment minister replied. "And how many people will be displaced by the reservoirs!"\n\nSharp looked at the clock again. Twenty past twelve. She then groaned and slid down her chair."
 abyssinia.237.a:0 "We need these dams to become a truly modern nation."
 abyssinia.237.b:0 "It's not worth the cost."
 
 abyssinia.238.t:0 "Shadow Of The Past"
 abyssinia.238.d:0 "Sharp Spear shifted in her chair uncomfortably.\n\nOn the opposite end of the table, a young female cat she was having a meeting with continued to talk endlessly. "As you know, there have been 37 instances of racially motivated crime just in the past month. According to investigations, most of these are driven not only by paranoia, but by the majority feline population seeing the now-equal racial minorities as a threat to their livelihood and as economic and social competition. This competition has had further, more indirect repercussions, like discrimination in employment and housing. This in turn has contributed to the formation of ethnic enclaves in Panthera, which I'm sure you're familiar with. There is a real danger of tensions escalating further, into lynchings and race riots, if something is not done about this issue. Legal equality isn't enough to address the problem of distrust between our nation's many races. Therefore I am proposing decisive action by our government to address the problem." She took out a thick stack of papers and slammed them on Sharp's desk. "First, we need to make changes to our education to promote social cohesion and racial harmony by creating a national identity at a young age that is detached from race. Classes should be mixed, having members of different races. Multilingualism should also be encouraged, to facilitate communication between races. Second, we should have an ethnic integration policy for our housing and zoning planning, to ensure racial diversity in neighbourhoods and preventing the formation of self-segregated enclaves. Third, compulsory conscription for all races, with mixed-race military units, could help with the formation of a common identity. These three are not sufficient on their own, but I believe it's the best we can afford with our current resources. And that's all I had to say for now," she concluded and took a very deep breath. "What do you think?"\n\nSharp Spear winced painfully and glared at her seat. "The chair I'm sitting on has got to be the most uncomfortable chair in the world. It's violating my backside.""

He tried to catch the last thoughts of his dream as they slipped away, but failed. He sighed and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\nIt was ten in the morning. He had slept for seven hours.\nHe pushed himself up, yawned and stretched his arms, legs and tail. Then he got up, and headed out into the hallway.\nQueen Morticia sat at a large dinner table, enjoying a lavish meal of caviar, salmon and lobster. Her eyes lit up when she saw Gomez enter the room. After swallowing, she said: "Oh, there you are! I knew it was a good idea to delay breakfast by an hour."\nGomez sat down on the opposite end of the table, where his food was already waiting for him. "Yeah, I actually made it in time..." His pupils dilated and he licked his fangs when he saw the meal. "Seems we're not sparing expenses today?"\n"Nothing wrong with indulging every now and then. Consider it... a reward of sorts." Morticia smiled and chuckled.\nHe smiled back at her and grabbed a silver fork and knife. "I feel like I've earned it, for once. Thank you, Tish."\n"You're welcome, my darling. Enjoy.""

The glasswearer simply sat back in her chair and smirked as she waited for the shouting to die down.\n\n"You are calling for the death of our fledgling democracy!" a young cat in a suit said loud and clear as soon as the noise stopped. "I will continue to support the position of my predecessor. Elections must be free and fair and fully represent the will of the people, even if it results in the election of a non-socialist candidate."\nThe socialist cat bared her fangs. "If we allow a non-socialist get elected, they will do everything in their power to dismantle what little socialism remains in our government."\n"The parliament remains a counterweight," interjected a zebra, "so there is nothing to worry about."\nShe remained unconvinced. "And what if the new head of government changes that and concentrates power in their own paws? Or hooves, or whatever."\n\nWhat followed was several hours of heated arguing, until finally, the caretaker government reached a decision:"

 abyssinia.241.d:0 ""While I'm glad us candidates were allowed to vote," Tamrat Pawit said with a smile, "I wish we could've voted for ourselves, too." The cat then laid back on his chair and took a sip from his mug of tella.\n"Yes, as if any of us besides you would've done it," Enkara replied bitterly, but followed his example and also drank.\n"'Twas merely a suggestion," Merkurioz Zoba replied. "As the ballot is secret, they cannot enforce it as a rule." Then the zebra, too, drank.\nTamrat frowned. "Ah crap, you're right." Then he shrugged. "Ah well. Not like one vote decides anything."\nThe donkey turned to look at Zoba with a raised eyebrow. "...Did you vote for yourself, then?"\nHe smirked. "Come now, secrets are secrets, best not shared."\nWhile Enkara glared at him, Tamrat laughed. "Well, whatever the case, I'm pretty sure one of us won. After all, we're all Sharp Spear's close associates and veterans of the slave liberation army. So our chances are pretty darn good, I'd say."\n"Yes, but which one of us won?" Enkara said, rubbing her chin in thought.\n"I care not for victory or defeat. I merely found it an entertaining contest. If I won, so be it. I will do my utmost. If I lost, so be it. I will still do my utmost, just on the battlefield, not in the office."\nThe cat shook his head. "Oh yeah, the paperwork... I was so blinded by the promise of wealth and power that I completely forgot about that... Well, now I hope I didn't win."\nEnkara chuckled. "Whatever the case, let us toast to our futures." She raised her mug, and the other two did the same."
 abyssinia.241.a:0 "Merkurioz Zoba got the most votes!"

Y'know, the cave down to the right, remember?"\n"Right, thanks!" she said and continued running. Soon enough she peeked inside an illuminated cave that had been turned into a makeshift office. Inside, a hooded figure sat behind a table. "There you are! I have good news!"\nThe mysterious cat's yellow eyes looked up at her silently.\n"You won the vote! I can't believe it, I thought they were gonna rig it or something! I'm surprised they even let you be a candidate in the first place!" She laughed giddily.\nThe Patriot sighed.\nShe calmed down a little. "Oh, uh, I got a question though. The candidates had to use actual names. Is um... Mawkonnen your real name? Or just a fake name you made up because you had to?"\n"It is real," the Patriot replied, his voice gravelly and deep.\n"Oh. Well um, I assume we should still call you by your 'nom de guerre'? Pardon my Aquileian, hehehe."\nHe nodded.\nThe young cat saluted him. "Very well, Patriot! I am glad I could deliver these news to you. Sorry if I interrupted anything, I'm sure you got a lot of work to do. Bye!" She then ran away as quickly as she had come."

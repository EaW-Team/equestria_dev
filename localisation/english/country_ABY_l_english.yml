### Characters

 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewodora the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father King Mawkonnen ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her for a long time due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and, with his royal authority, was able to immediately marry Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned and he had lost a part of his right ear, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."
 ABY_slave_leader:0 "Sharp Spear"
 ABY_slave_leader_desc:0 "Sharp Spear was a young soldier in the Maregyptian army when the Manedalusian War broke out in 988. In the fervor of nationalism that followed the Kingdom's proclamation of independence from Saddle Arabia, she eagerly went to fight in the frontline against the perfidious felines. Yet in the chaos of battle, she was wounded and taken prisoner by the enemy. Not long after a ceasefire was declared, and like many other prisoners of war, she was enslaved.\n\nAs a healthy and able-bodied mare, she was a valuable slave and changed owners several times. She ended up working at a coffee plantation in the highlands of Catorahe, where she befriended a zebra slave called Bontu. Their owner was a cruel aristocat who saw them as little more than property and treated them poorly. Bontu warned that many escapee slaves died quickly, but Sharp Spear did not heed her warning and managed to escape the plantation, promising to one day return and free her friend.\n\nSurviving alone was difficult, but she eventually met a group of other runaway slaves. They lived a life of aimless banditry, seeking to do nothing more than to survive. But Sharp Spear was burning with ambition. She convinced the group to conduct raids to free other slaves and increase their numbers, while also contacting other groups of rebellious slaves. Within years, she had become a leader of thousands of slaves who desired nothing more than to keep their freedom. Yet it was not enough for her to free all slaves. She dreamt of making Abyssinia a better place, where all races were equal and decisions made by democratic vote. It remains to be seen if she can make her dream into a reality."

 ABY_catrina_catwe:0 "Catrina Tabby"
 ABY_catrina_catwe_desc:0 "Catrina is a direct descendant of the Catwe kings and queens who once ruled Abyssinia for two hundred years. While this makes her technically a noble, she has no special legal privileges or formal status as the Clawomons stripped her family of any such things. Nevertheless, she is far more wealthy and influential than any mere common cat. While her relatives were kept in check by a strong central government, Catrina was able to use the recent chaos as a ladder to climb up in Abyssinian society. With many blaming the Clawomons for the numerous problems that plagued the Kingdom, she proposed herself as a tempting alternative. The nobles were especially dissatisfied with the Clawomons due to their modernizing reforms, and many of them quickly rallied behind Catrina, as out of all pretenders to the throne, she has by far the strongest claim to the throne.\n\nBut Catrina has no intention of being a mere lackey of the nobles. The invasion of the Storm King opened up her eyes to a simple truth of life: it is better to be among the mighty than caged at someone's command. Abyssinia had long been dominated by foreign powers and other races, but she had ambitious plans that would change everything. Underneath her family mansion, she conducts secret experiments that may well change the fate of catkind forever..."
 ABY_catra_meowmeow:0 "Catra Meowmeow"
 ABY_queen_morticia:0 "Morticia Addisu"
 ABY_queen_morticia_desc:0 "Being born as a daughter of King Mawkonnen's sister Addisu meant that Morticia was privileged from the start as one of the members of the House of Clawomon. Yet unlike some of her relatives, she never let it inflate her ego. A kittenhood friendship with a servant ensured she'd feel empathy for those who were deemed "commoners" in Abyssinian society. After her mother's death, she used her inherited wealth for philanthropy and buying freedom for slaves owned by the Kingdom's nobility. While she had to firmly stand her ground against most of her family, her cousin Gomez admired her generosity and kindness. As the two lived under the same roof, they had long been familiar with each other. However, it came as a shock to their relatives when they announced that they were lovers. Gomez's father King Mawkonnen disapproved of the relationship and forbade their marriage. The two had to wait until his death to finally hold a private wedding ceremony by themselves. Thus, Morticia became Queen consort of Abyssinia.\n\nDespite the controversy with her husband and the fact that the nobility look down upon her, Morticia is very popular among the common cats. This is because she genuinely cares for their well-being and, thanks to her confidence, acts as the public face of the monarchy while Gomez is more withdrawn. Nevertheless, some radicals still believe she is just acting or pretending and that she only gave out wealth to increase her own popularity and influence."
 ABY_nathaniel_claw:0 "Nathaniel Claw"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen_desc:0 "Ever since being a kitten, Dejen has been fascinated with statecraft. He was born to a middle-class family and his parents poured all their savings to afford a good education for him. Thankfully, he was naturally gifted at absorbing and handling information, even if his peers saw him as distant and emotionless. As Abyssinia modernized, it started to develop a fledgling modern bureaucracy which was always in need of cats like Dejen, who loved nothing more than dull paperwork. Within a few years, King Mawkonnen recognized Dejen's talents and appointed him as the new Minister of the Pen, Tsehafe Taezaz. This made him the King's right-paw cat, who ensured all his commands would be fulfilled in practice. He served Mawkonnen for only a short time however before he passed away and his son Gomez inherited the throne. Despite all the difficulties during his reign, Dejen tolerated him and focused on doing his job. Yet after the Storm King's invasion broke Gomez's mind completely, he wondered if someone more competent could replace him. After all, he always cared more about Abyssinia than about the monarch."
 ABY_colonel_meow:0 "Meow Frown"
 ABY_colonel_meow_desc:0 "While formally being the General of the Crown Guard, Meow Frown is widely known as "The Colonel". He is the highest ranking professional soldier in the Kingdom, having served in the Guard for many years and proving his devotion to the Kingdom of Abyssinia. During the Storm King's invasion, he led the defence of Panthera and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy despite being outnumbered. The Crown Guard stood by Gomez's side even as he surrendered to the invader.\n\nOutside of his military career, Meow is known for holding the world record for longest cat fur. Despite his scowl, he is rather friendly off-duty, especially after he has drunk some of his favourite scotch."
 ABY_ras_tardar:0 "Tardar Sourpuss"
 ABY_ras_tardar_desc:0 "As Tsahife Lam, she is the second highest ranking military officer (see: "The Mesafint (And The Royalty) In A Nutshell"). Maintaining the role of the nobility as leaders of the military is a vital goal for her. She is known for her grumpy and pessimistic personality."

 ABY_ras_thurston:0 "Thurston Waffles"
 ABY_ras_thurston_desc:0 "The Ras of Tigeray can be described as a sycophant, always trying to earn the favour of the monarchy. This does not mean that he always approves of his liege's actions. In fact, he can protest quite loudly."

 ### National Spirits
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which, according to the Abyssinian version of the treaty, stipulated that Abyssinia "temporarily leased" the island of Purrsia in exchange for development aid and trade agreements. However, it was later discovered the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed the island was permanently transferred to them, which soured relations. Things became even worse when the Storm King sacked and burned Abyssinia. Rather than being a potential ally on Zebrica, Abyssinia now appeared more like a weak and helpless country. Wingbardy took advantage of this, forcing King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the recent Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewodora II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses. Following the Storm King's invasion, many of them rose up against their owners, starting a spiral of deadly violence that could escalate out of control."
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership:0 "Paralyzed Government"
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in times of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them. As a result, Abyssinia is becoming increasingly chaotic and the aristocats are beginning to question Gomez's ability to rule."
 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. As cats are also obligate carnivores, the rest of arable land is used for cattle fodder. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of importing tonnes of meat from abroad, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia. This treaty was seen as fair. However, after the Storm King invaded and greatly weakened Abyssinia, Wingbardy forced King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat.\n\nThe Abyssinian government has taken action to mitigate the effects of the treaty at the expense of reduced cooperation with Wingbardy."
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_3:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_3_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia.

This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat.\n\nDue to the recent actions by the Abyssinian government, the treaty is now little more than ink on paper."

 ABY_HIP_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Hippogriffia"
 ABY_HIP_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing trade agreement has made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Hippogriffia. Unlike most neighbouring countries, hippogriffs do consume meat, and the seaponies are expert fishers. As such, they have an infrastructure in place to produce enough meat for export at a relatively low price."
 ABY_WNG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Wingbardy"
 ABY_WNG_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing economic ties have made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Wingbardy. Unlike most neighbouring countries, griffons do consume meat, and the Wingbardians are more than happy to export some to Abyssinian markets. However, they are also trying to profit as much as possible while knowing Abyssinia's desperate need for food, so the prices aren't fair in the slightest."
 ABY_KLG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Klugetown"
 ABY_KLG_food_imports_desc:0 "Despite not recognizing Klugetown's sovereignty, Abyssinia has been forced to import food from it. How the Klugetowners are able to provide so much meat for export is a mystery, however, and it is hard to say what sort of creatures were butchered for their flesh."
 ABY_mild_famine:0 "Food Shortages"
 ABY_mild_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen greatly recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. However, government intervention has ensured that food doesn't completely run out and that the hungry are able to get at least something to survive the difficult times."
 ABY_famine:0 "Famine"
 ABY_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen exponentially recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. Despite some government intervention, hundreds of thousands of cats are unable to acquire food and some are even resorting to hunting rats and birds. Rural cats are fleeing the countryside into cities, hoping to find food, only to end up starving to death on the streets."
 ABY_apocalyptic_famine:0 "Apocalyptic Famine"
 ABY_apocalyptic_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen to absurd numbers recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. With no government intervention, millions of cats are unable to acquire food and many are resorting to hunting rats and birds. Rural cats are fleeing the countryside into cities, hoping to find food, only to end up starving to death on the streets. There are so many corpses that mass graves are being dug all across Abyssinia."
 ABY_a_good_friend:0 "A Good Friend"
 ABY_a_good_friend_desc:0 "During an event where [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap] Gomez met with commoners at the central market of Panthera, a dark blue cat saw it as a great opportunity to show how rebellious she was by bonking him on the head with a baseball bat (albeit without much force). When the Crown Guard attempted to catch her, she climbed atop a lamp pole with remarkable dexterity, resulting in a miniature siege. The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap] himself intervened, and, contrary to what anyone was expecting him to say, thanked her for hitting him. He then ordered the guard to stand down. The dark blue cat descended and apologized to the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap], offering him a pretzel out of all things. Gomez had no idea where she had gotten Griffonian food from, especially as cats were carnivores and did not eat baked goods, but accepted the apology nonetheless. This was the start of a rather peculiar friendship."

 ABY_brrrrrrrr_desc:0 "The State Bank of Abyssinia controls the monetary supply of the realm.

 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "During his reign, King Mawkonnen had founded the Bank of Abyssinia, a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. With the recent economic instability, I advise that this near-bankrupt bank is liquidated and replaced with a fully state-owned bank that will give us greater control of the economy."
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard:0 "Abandon The Gold Standard"
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "For about a century now, the Abyssinian purr has been a gold standard currency, backed by the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] treasury of the monarchy. Unfortunately, the Storm King's recent unauthorized permanent loan has caused rapid deflation due to lack of gold. I've been saying this for a while now, but it is finally time to move away from the gold standard."
 ABY_seek_trade_partners:0 "Seek New Trade Partners"
 ABY_seek_trade_partners_desc:0 "Abyssinia has long been a trading nation, yet the Storm King's invasion and resulting regional instability have left many merchants idle. The Negadras, head of the merchants, has proposed we try to sign trade agreements with more countries to open up new markets for us. Exporting goods such as coffee will help us refill our treasury."
 ABY_refill_treasury:0 "Refill The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Treasury"
 ABY_refill_treasury_desc:0 "With foundations for economic recovery laid, we can now focus on our crippling lack of funds. There are several options to weigh against each other, each of them with positive and negative aspects. You will have to decide which method we shall use to restore some of your lost wealth."
 ABY_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 ABY_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Public spending is one way to recover from economic disasters. Until now, we've lacked the funds, but thanks to the recent endeavours we can finally launch infrastructure projects across the realm. This will provide jobs for thousands of cats. I also recommend we do not employ any slaves, as their salaries would likely be seized by their owners."
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program:0 "[Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Reconstruction Program"
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Everything is finally in place. Now it is time to launch a large-scale nationwide effort to fully recover from the Storm King's invasion. It will be expensive enough to almost empty our treasury again, but afterwards we will be able to refill it much more easily than before."
 
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet:0 "Expand Fishing Fleet"
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet_desc:0 "With how dry the Abyssinian peninsula is, many cats rely on fishing to feed themselves especially on the coast. To improve food security, I recommend we invest our recently expanded funds into our fisheries. They will be able to hire more fishercats expand their infrastructure to build more fishing vessels. Of course, this infrastructure could have other uses as well."
 ABY_import_food:0 "Import Food"
 ABY_import_food_desc:0 "Abyssinia hasn't been self-reliant on food for many decades now, after much of our limited farmlands were dedicated to growing cash crops like coffee. Now that we've attempted to establish new trade routes, our merchants have the capital they need to restart food imports. Unfortunately, most of our neighbours are herbivores and we need meat more urgently than cattle feed, so our options are limited."
 ABY_distribute_food:0 "Open Soup Kitchens"
 ABY_distribute_food_desc:0 "The main cause of hunger is not necessarily food production, but distribution. Due to feudal taxation, many peasants cannot afford to buy food when they are unable to produce enough themselves. To increase societal food security, [ROOT.ABY_queen_loc_cap] Morticia proposes that we should establish food distribution centers or "soup kitchens" to provide free meals for the hungry cats."
 ABY_repurpose_plantations:0 "Plantations Into Pastures"
 ABY_repurpose_plantations_desc:0 "Much of the arable land in Abyssinia is currently used for growing cash crops, especially coffee. While it brings great wealth to merchants and landowners, it means we do not produce enough food domestically. With various laws and economic incentives, we can push plantations to be slowly turned into pastures for cattle. Not everycat will be happy with this arrangement."
 
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus:0 "Slave Pacification Operations"
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus_desc:0 "The unfortunate truth is that we cannot allow the slaves to run rampant, even if their grievances are justified. The only method of quickly restoring law and order is by force, as any attempts to negotiate or promise reforms have failed. Nevertheless, we only do this because we must. After peace has returned, I strongly recommend we attempt to abolish slavery."
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli:0 "Outlaw Mistreatment Of Slaves"
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli_desc:0 "Abyssinian law is written with the assumption that slavery is outlawed entirely, even if it is only true for cats. As such, there are no clauses regarding the treatment of slaves. To quell dissatisfaction of enslaved persons, I recommend you to decree that their mistreatment becomes a punishable crime. Some nobles won't be happy, but the slaves will be."
 ABY_ban_slave_trade:0 "End The Slave Trade"
 ABY_ban_slave_trade_desc:0 "After feline slavery was brought to a sudden end, imports of slaves into Abyssinia increased drastically as trade of non-feline slaves had not been forbidden. Banning all trade of slaves would be a controversial move, as it would largely end the lucrative business (which would also no doubt continue illegally), but I still recommend we do it."
 ABY_ban_slave_baby:0 "Freedom Of Wombs"
 ABY_ban_slave_baby_desc:0 "So far, slave owners have assumed that any offspring of slaves inherit their status from their parents, similarly to how offspring of cattle instantly become property of the parents' owner. However, if we pass a law where all sapient creatures in the realm are born free, then the slave population will stop growing naturally."
 ABY_emancipation_act:0 "The Emancipation Act"
 ABY_emancipation_act_desc:0 "With the gradual erosion of the institution of slavery, we can finally deliver the final death blow to this ancient practice. The Emancipation Act will rewrite Queen Mewodora II's slavery act by clearly stating the following: "All persons held as slaves in the realm shall forever be free, and their freedom shall be guaranteed by the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap].""
 
 ABY_revised_plan:0 "Revised Modernization Plan"
 ABY_revised_plan_desc:0 "King Mawkonnen's economic development plan, which you continued to follow until the Storm King's forceful restructuring of our economy, relied heavily on cooperation with Wingbardy. Now that they have shown their true colors, we need to formulate a new plan for the modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_noble_council:0 "Cooperate With Aristocats"
 ABY_noble_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local governors who manage economic affairs. While most nobles are content maintaining agrarianism focused on export of cash crops, some of them have more ambitious plans and would be more than willing to work together with us."
 ABY_protectionist_taxation:0 "Protectionist Taxation"
 ABY_protectionist_taxation_desc:0 "Your predecessors trusted the griffons, and in return they immediately sought to exploit our nation. So far, foreign companies have been given concessions to conduct business freely, but this gives them an unfair advantage. By introducing new taxes, we will force them out of Abyssinia and allow our domestic businesses to grow."
 ABY_merchant_council:0 "Summon The Negadrases"
 ABY_merchant_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local merchants who are most directly impacted by our policies. The negadrases, heads of merchants, are influential figures largely responsible for running our economy. They are far more eager about the prospects of industrialisation and foreign trade than the conservative nobles are."
 ABY_centralized_development:0 "Invest In The Catital"
 ABY_centralized_development_desc:0 "The city of Panthera, along with its hinterland, is already the most developed region in the realm, only rivaled by Coltoba. As such, there is a solid foundation to build upon. With the provinces under the control of local nobles, putting funds into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] capital is a guaranteed way to empower your central authority."
 ABY_catpany:0 "Sign Contract With CAT Incorporated"
 ABY_catpany_desc:0 "It is difficult to overstate how many construction projects are required to create a modern nation. All of them require immense resources which in turn need well-organized logistics. Working together with nascent construction equipment manufacturers is a vital step towards the full modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_decentralized_development:0 "Invest In The Provinces"
 ABY_decentralized_development_desc:0 "While Panthera can be called a somewhat modern city, the same cannot be said for the outlying provinces, many of which are ruled by nobles who either lack the will or the funds to develop their own lordships. For Abyssinia to truly modernize, we must distribute development more evenly across the realm."
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection:0 "Improve The Tigray-Panthera Connection"
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection_desc:0 "The port city of Tigray is Panthera's gate to the wider world. Existing transportation infrastructure is sufficient for our current needs, but if we want to further grow the capital then it is vital to expand it. The railway will be improved, the harbour shall be expanded and new paved roads will be built."
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company:0 "Invest In The General Goods Company"
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company_desc:0 "I have recently learned about a successful small business called the General Goods Company. Yes, the name doesn't have a cat pun. They manufacture a wide variety of goods that are purchased both by our civilians and the military. If we provided them with increased funds, they could greatly expand their production, benefitting the entire nation."
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces:0 "Connect The Provinces"
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces_desc:0 "A railway was built years ago to connect Tigray, Panthera and Aspurra. Though this has secured the logistics of the capital, the rest of our country has been neglected. Therefore I recommend we undertake a great project to expand the railway network across the entire realm, connecting all notable settlements."
 ABY_car_company:0 "Subsidize Hissan Motors"
 ABY_car_company_desc:0 "Hissan Motors is a fledgling and struggling car manufacturer that has difficulty competing with oversears imports of vehicles. If we provided them with subsidies, they would gain a competitive advantage that could help them gain a pawhold on the market."
 ABY_ship_company:0 "Establish A State-Owned Dockyard"
 ABY_ship_company_desc:0 "So far, the needs of the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy are fulfilled by various small shipping companies as well as foreign imports. If we used our funds to found a dockyard, personally owned by you, we could have a more reliable supplier for all naval needs."
 ABY_airplane_company:0 "Sign A Deal With Leopardo Holdings"
 ABY_airplane_company_desc:0 "Leopardo Holdings is a company owned by a noble who is fascinated with aircraft. Under her personal patronage, the company has been able to compete against imported planes. However, the noble does not have an infinite supply of money to sustain the company. We should approach her and sign a deal where Leopardo will get the exclusive right to make planes for us."
 ABY_panthera_dam:0 "Build The Grand Panthera Dam"
 ABY_panthera_dam_desc:0 "Modern industries and households consume immense amounts of energy. Energy that could be easily generated by damming the Panther river that flows next to the capital. Of course, it would reduce the amount of water flowing downstream and create a large reservoir, but a single dam would be enough to power the country for years to come."
 ABY_desert_irrigation:0 "Irrigating The Desert"
 ABY_desert_irrigation_desc:0 "While vast irrigation projects were conducted in the past century along the Panter river, the same cannot be said for the eastern Tiger river. It would only be fair to invest in the poorer eastern provinces as well. Irrigation would not only increase rural productivity, but provide local industries with more vital water."
 ABY_textile_factory:0 "Support The Yarn Industry"
 ABY_textile_factory_desc:0 "Yarn production is one of the mainstays of the Abyssinian economy. It is a sensible investment for us, and would help ensure all of our citizens and soldiers get any clothing they desire or need. This in turn would provide increased employment and boost the economy in general."
 ABY_salt_mine:0 "Open The Dollo Salt Mine"
 ABY_salt_mine_desc:0 "The dry endorheic basin of Dollo is one of the largest deposits of salt on Zebrica. Any rainwater that flows into it from the mountains ends up evaporating, which over the millennia has created a great source of salt. If we invested into opening a salt mine, we could provide plenty of this vital resource which can be used to conserve fish and other foods."
 ABY_steel_foundry:0 "Construct The Panthera Steel Foundry"
 ABY_steel_foundry_desc:0 "Modernization requires truly vast amounts of refined high-grade steel. This in turn needs a large-scale industrial operation that converts coal, flux stone and iron en masse into steel. Therefore I recommend we launch a construction project in Panthera with the intention to build one of the largest foundries on Zebrica."
 ABY_expand_mines:0 "Expand Mining Operations"
 ABY_expand_mines_desc:0 "There are many mines scattered across the ore-rich mountains of Abyssinia. Most of them are operated by private individuals such as nobles, and utilize manual labour to arduously extract minerals. The state clearly needs to intervene to expand and modernize these mines, and in exchange receive a share of the profits."
 ABY_modern_healthcare:0 "Provide Modern Healthcare"
 ABY_modern_healthcare_desc:0 "Industrial work is prone to accidents, and increased pollution causes many health issues. As such, workers are increasingly demanding better access to healthcare. There is no reason for us to not provide them with what they want. I suggest we begin establishing a state-owned healthcare system, staffed by skilled professionals."
 ABY_elektirsity:0 "Electrify The Nation"
 ABY_elektirsity_desc:0 "While cats don't need electric lamps to light up the streets, electricity can be used for countless different purposes. It can be said that electricity is the foundational pillar of truly modern societies. Not only will our industry utilize it, but the citizens as well, to power their household appliances. The military can get a use out of it, too."
 ABY_r_and_d_center:0 "Center Of Research and Technological Development"
 ABY_r_and_d_center_desc:0 "In cooperation with the leading companies of Abyssinia, we should establish a centralized facility for conducting scientific research. This would not only lead to new, innovative products, but give us a place among the advanced nations of the world."
 
 ABY_ban_child_labour:0 "Outlaw Kitten Labour"
 ABY_ban_child_labour_desc:0 "While the literacy program of King Mawkonnen, your father, has been very successful at rapidly increasing the literacy rate of adults, we can't forget about the kittens too. Many youth do not attend school as they work as employees instead. It is finally time we ban the use of underaged workers and make school attendance mandatory."
 ABY_support_royal_academy:0 "Found The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Academy"
 ABY_support_royal_academy_desc:0 "To cultivate intellectualism in Abyssinia, we should create a national academy under your patronage. It will promote enlightenment, preservation of traditional values and research to increase the prosperity and well-being of your subjects. Its duty will also be to ostracize intellecuals with excessively radical or dangerous ideologies."
 ABY_standardized_language:0 "Standardize The Abyssinian Language"
 ABY_standardized_language_desc:0 "The Abyssinian language and its script are both almost a thousand years old. However, especially in the provinces other dialects and even languages are spoken. Through education, we should ensure our tongue is used identically across Abyssinia to faciliate communication and enforce the unity of the realm."
 ABY_university_of_panthera:0 "Establish The Panthera University"
 ABY_university_of_panthera_desc:0 "Abyssinia has so far lacked a public institution of tertiary education. Now that we are civilized enough, it is time to create one. The new state university will be located in the capital, spread out across multiple campuses, and admit only those who pass the challenging entrance exams to prove their worth."
 
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion:0 "Analyze The Storm King's Invasion"
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion_desc:0 "While our defeat to the Storm King was a bitter drop to swallow, we must not get stuck in the past. Instead, we need to investigate what went wrong and draft plans for improving our armed forces, so we can repel any other invaders in the future. Failures are to be learned from, after all."
 ABY_modernizing_navy:0 "Modernize The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy"
 ABY_modernizing_navy_desc:0 "Modernizing our naval forces means not only refitting our ships, but also updating our combat stratagems. The long coast and many overseas trade routes of our country can only be secured by a navy that knows how to fight against advanced and well-organized opponents."
 ABY_professional_army:0 "Professionalize The Army"
 ABY_professional_army_desc:0 "Most of the Abyssinian army, besides the small contingent of Crown Guard, consists of feudal levies drafted from the provinces. Their lack of training meant that they melted away before a superior foe. Replacing them with proper full-time professional soldiers would not only reduce our reliance on nobles, but improve the quality of the army as well."
 ABY_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Catscription"
 ABY_mass_conscription_desc:0 "One explanation for our military weakness is our relatively small population, which results in a lack of catpower for the army. This issue can be addressed by expanding conscription and making it every subject's sworn duty to serve in the army if needed. Of course, conscription has traditionally been the duty of nobility, so we must be careful with them."
 ABY_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 ABY_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "Instead of trying to fix our own army, we could simply hire experienced soldiers from abroad. There are plenty of options available on the mercenary market. Unfortunately, they are rather expensive and they are only loyal to money, not you. But they are well worth the price."
 ABY_establish_air_force:0 "Establish The Abyssinian Air Force"
 ABY_establish_air_force_desc:0 "One of the primary reasons for our defeat against the Storm King was the complete lack of an air force, meaning we had no counter to the yeti airships. Thankfully, the hippogriffs proved the world that modern air planes rule the sky. We must simply follow their example and lay the foundations of a proper air force."
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare:0 "Asymmetric Naval Warfare"
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare_desc:0 "If we ever have to face a larger enemy navy, let's say, one belonging to an expansionist overseas griffon kingdom, then we should not try to face them in a direct confrontation. Rather, we should follow the suggestion of one of our admirals and invest in affordable yet effective submarines that can utilize hit-and-run tactics."
 ABY_convert_convoys:0 "Convert Merchant Ships"
 ABY_convert_convoys_desc:0 "As a trading nation, our mercantile class owns a substantial number of cargo vessels. We could purchase some of them at a low price, then go through the effort of converting them into warships. This would be a far more economical way to expand our navy compared to building ships from scratch."
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Officer Corps"
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion_desc:0 "While we don't lack capable leaders for our army, many officers are still aristocrats who gained their positions through inheritance. We should consider making our officer corps entirely meritocratic, meaning military positions have to be earned through exemplary service."
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons:0 "Reinforce Local Garrisons"
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons_desc:0 "Protection of provinces has traditionally been the duty of local nobles who maintain their own retinues. Relying on these private armies is unwise, as was proven by their ineffectiveness during the invasion of the Storm King. We should send soldiers from the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army to not only aid the nobles, but to better defend our country."
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes:0 "Purchase Hippogriff Planes"
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes_desc:0 "The hippogriffs did what we could not, defeating the Storm King's fearsome armada of airships with nimble fighters and other planes. We should acquire some of these technological marvels for our own use, so no one can ever threaten Abyssinia from the skies again."
 ABY_pilot_training:0 "Train Pilots"
 ABY_pilot_training_desc:0 "Without the industrial capacity to build a large air force, we must instead focus on improving the quality of the personnel. Rigorous training will ensure only the finest pilots will defend the skies of Abyssinia from the enemy. Hopefully, they will be able to face off against greater numbers and even seemingly impossible odds."
 ABY_cattier:0 "A Converted Cattier"
 ABY_cattier_desc:0 "During the reign of your father, construction began on a Mawkonnen-class dreadnought that was never finished and was left abandoned. It can be put to use again. However, modern naval warfare appears to rely heavily on air support, so it'd make more sense to make it into a carrier, I mean, cattier instead."
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs:0 "Steal Wingbardian Torpedo Designs"
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs_desc:0 "Our former friends in Wingbardy are known for their advanced torpedoes. Years of cooperation means our own ships make extensive use of the same weapon. I normally don't suggest questionable action such as this, but perhaps some industrial espionage would enable us to upgrade our torpedo designs, if you understand what I mean."
 ABY_establish_general_staff:0 "Establish General Staff"
 ABY_establish_general_staff_desc:0 "An army without proper leadership is like a headless chicken. While command of the army is centralized in you, the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap], you cannot be everywhere at once, and neither can the generals. They need organized staff groups to assist them in their role of command and control. With a meritocratic foundation hopefully in place, creating such staff should be easy."
 ABY_military_motorization:0 "Military Motorization"
 ABY_military_motorization_desc:0 "For almost a century now, the Abyssinian army has made extensive use of slaves for transportation and logistics. With slavery being phased out and domestic production of motor vehicles established, the army can now utilize trucks instead. While they do consume fuel and are prone to breaking down, they don't rebel against their owners."
 ABY_improved_occupation:0 "Counterinsurgency Experience"
 ABY_improved_occupation_desc:0 "Prolonged conflict with Manedalusian resistance has given our armed forces plenty of experience related to fighting against insurgents. This experience should be analyzed and combined with foreign military theory to greatly improve the effectiveness of our garrison units."
 ABY_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 ABY_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Ships have traditionally ruled the waves, but it appears aircraft are attempting to dethrone them. A proper modern navy must combine both sea and air power to thrive against its enemies. As such, we need to invest time and resources into naval aircraft."
 ABY_anti_air_defence:0 "Anti-Aircraft Defences"
 ABY_anti_air_defence_desc:0 "With limited industrial production capacity, we cannot necessarily build a large enough air fleet to defend the skies of the realm. As such, we need to invest in ground-based defences to protect our cities and our troops from aerial attacks."
 ABY_special_forces_shit:0 "Formalize The Special Forces"
 ABY_special_forces_shit_desc:0 "Traditionally, experienced highlanders have acted as the "special forces" of the Abyssinian army, fighting in difficult terrain and conducting challenging operations. But if we want to further expand and develop our special forces, we need to properly organize them as a modern subsection of the larger military."
 ABY_tonk:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 ABY_tonk_desc:0 "The flat desert terrain that is common in Abyssinia is ideal for armoured warfare. These so-called "tanks" can quickly overrun unprepared enemy infantry with ease, able to withstand small-arms fire. While expensive, we should still consider utilizing them in the army."
 ABY_mag_weapons:0 "Magical Stun Weapons"
 ABY_mag_weapons_desc:0 "While cats are unable to utilize magic, unicorns often use stun spells to incapacitate opponents. New technology based on crystals allows spells to be cast by any creature. Our garrisons would greatly benefit from such magical weapons. Of course, that is true for the rest of the army as well, assuming we set up the required production lines."
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent:0 "The Ultimate Deterrent"
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent_desc:0 "It is entirely possible, even likely, that our sovereignty will be threatened again and again. To secure our independence against the great powers of the world, we need the most powerful weapon in existence. Thankfully, the theories of famed physicist Alpurrt Catstein have laid the groundwork for the development of such a weapon."
 
 ABY_convene_council:0 "Convene The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_convene_council_desc:0 "The Council of Nobility is an advisory body consisting of the most influential nobles of Abyssinia. Its meetings have in recent years been organized by the aristocats themselves, but you, as the [ROOT.ABY_king_cap], also have the right to do so. I think it's time to summon them to the catital and remind them who is truly in charge of the country."
 ABY_assert_authority:0 "Assert Absolute Authority"
 ABY_assert_authority_desc:0 "In Abyssinia, there are traditionally no limits on the monarch's power. As much as the nobles tried to subvert this fact during the reign of the Catwe dynasty, it remains true to this day. So remember, you are not just above the law; you ARE the law."
 ABY_power_to_people:0 "Power To The People"
 ABY_power_to_people_desc:0 "You and the commoners have a common enemy: the scheming nobility. So why not forge an alliance with them? Delegate some of your [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority to competent commonfolk like me. After all, I have proven that we "mudblooded" cats can be relied upon, as we earn our wealth and power through hard work rather than just inheriting them from our parents."
 ABY_expand_crown_guard:0 "Expand The Crown Guard"
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_desc:0 "While regional levies often have secondary loyalties to their feudal liege lords, the Crown Guard is a dedicated professional force loyal to you alone. To further strengthen [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority over the nation, you should consider recruiting more members to your personal armed retinue."
 ABY_land_reform:0 "Implement Land Reform"
 ABY_land_reform_desc:0 "Almost all arable land in Abyssinia is owned by a small number of magnates, most of whom are part of the Mesafint. As such, most tenants pay high rents and can barely afford any taxes. Of course, ultimately all land in Abyssinia belongs to the crown. As such, you have extensive authority to redistribute land as much as necessary."
 ABY_estates_assembly:0 "Establish The Assembly Of Estates"
 ABY_estates_assembly_desc:0 "As a legislative body to counterbalance the Council of Nobility, we shall organize the Assembly of Estates, consisting of deputies elected from all social classes. For now, their power remains limited. But if you so desire, they can be gradually given the ability to propose and pass legislation even without your approval."
 ABY_blessed_of_baast:0 "The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap] Who Turns The Wheel Of Virtue"
 ABY_blessed_of_baast_desc:0 "While the priesthood care little about politics, preferring the seclusion of their temples, great legitimacy and influence can be gained by earning their blessing. Thanks to your previous interactions with the late Abuna of Felibela, you could relatively easily proclaim yourself a divine monarch who follows the path to enlightenment."
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies:0 "Outlaw Private Armies"
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies_desc:0 "Traditionally, the Mesafint have had the privilege of raising personal retinues to guard their estates. These small private armies give the aristocats military power that can be used against the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] government. As such, I highly recommend we disband these forces and integrate them into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army."
 ABY_empower_mekwanint:0 "Empower The Mekwanint"
 ABY_empower_mekwanint_desc:0 "The Abyssinian upper class has traditionally been divided into two categories: the Mesafint, hereditary elites, and the Mekwanint, the appointed officials who are often commoners. I, of course, belong to the latter group, so I may be biased. Nevertheless, I still strongly believe that we should take over some of the responsibilities of the fickle nobles."
 ABY_progressive_taxation:0 "Introduce Progressive Taxation"
 ABY_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "It is common sense that those with more wealth can afford to give a larger share of it away. However, nobles aren't known for their appreciation of common sense. Nonetheless, taxing the wealthier more and the poorer less would be a controversial reform, yet would greatly affect wealth inequality in favour of the masses."
 ABY_advisory_council:0 "Abolish The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_advisory_council_desc:0 "The Council of Nobility was originally supposed to have a purely advisory role, providing counsel to the ruling monarch. Since the reign of the Catwe dynasty however, they've had the privilege of being able to elect a new monarch at will. This dangerous political body can now finally be disbanded with a new decree. All you have to do is sign it."
 
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty:0 "Unilaterally Repeal The Treaty Of Katren"
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_desc:0 "The Katren concession is a dagger pointed at the heart of Abyssinia. However, it is protected by the Treaty of Katren, which you were pressured to sign under duress. As its legality itself is questionable, you have the right to repeal it, but know that Wingbardy might response with military force. We must be ready to fight if necessary."
 ABY_try_to_negotiate:0 "Attempt To Negotiate With Wingbardy"
 ABY_try_to_negotiate_desc:0 "You once said that "The only thing we have in common with griffons are feline rears". While that may be true, we should still seek to avoid triggering a risky armed confrontation that could end in our defeat. Diplomacy is thankfully an option, as Wingbardians haven't yet become completely unreasonable."
 ABY_liberate_katren:0 "Liberate Katren"
 ABY_liberate_katren_desc:0 "The time has come for us to reassert our sovereignty and reclaim Katren for ourselves. Of course, as the occupiers see the town as rightfully theirs, they will likely put up a fight. But chances are we can negotiate a peace treaty with them if we manage to firmly expel them from the Abyssinian mainland."
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren:0 "Request The Return Of Katren"
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren_desc:0 "The current occupiers of Katren seem to be open for negotiations. Perhaps we can convince them to vacate our territory peacefully. If not, we will still have to reclaim Katren by force, but hopefully they will listen to reason and understand that the town was seized illegally."
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia:0 "Contact The Ras of Purrsia"
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia_desc:0 "According to the deal made with Wingbardy, the Rasdom of Purrsia is temporarily under protectorate status. Of course, the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed this status is permanent, but they also agreed to respect our territorial sovereignty. Seeing how they violated this treaty, it's clear we can violate it as well."

 ABY_purchase_purrsia_desc:0 "While the Rasdom of Purrsia was legally ceded to Wingbardy, there's no reason why we couldn't legally buy it back. I'm sure that if we offer enough currency, the owners of the island would gladly sell it to us. However, the sum might end up being rather large, so we must prepare our treasury for that."

 ABY_liberate_les_meridiennes_desc:0 "Our anti-colonial efforts have been successful. Why not continue them? Not far to the northwest, the island chain of Les Meridiennes was an Aquileian colony for well over a century. By liberating them from griffon minority rule, we not only improve our reputation, but gain strategically valuable islands."
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters:0 "Liberate Trots And Canters"
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters_desc:0 "The Trots and Canters islands were colonized by Hippogriffia some centuries ago. It has a small indigenous pony population, which is enough of a justification to militarily occupy, or "liberate", the island chain. All we need is a window of opportunity for a swift and secretive overseas operation. Perhaps when the owners of the islands are busy with conflict?"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs:0 "Military Cooperation With Mount Aris"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs_desc:0 "In recent years, Wingbardy displayed some degree of hostility towards [HIP.GetNameDef]. As such, it is in the strategic interest of both of our nations to support each other militarily, to improve security in northern Zebrica. I'm sure both of us have much to learn from each other."
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo:0 "Liberate Puerto Caballo"
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "The island of Puerto Caballo was under Equestrian dominion for a long time, but the island can hardly be called Equestrian. Yet remnants of foreign minority rule persist, despite the island nation regaining its lost freedom. It is clear they need a gracious country like Abyssinia to provide them with much-needed liberty."
 ABY_approach_equestria:0 "An Alliance With Equestria"
 ABY_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria remains the undisputed superpower, despite not exerting its influence too much abroad. Yet judging by events in Hippogriffia, Kiria and Griffonstone, this is changing. If we managed to secure an alliance with this massive nation, our own security would be guaranteed for many years to come."

 ABY_manedalusia_is_abyssinia_desc:0 "Manedalusia was part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia from 12 ALB to 672 ALB. Based on historical records, Abyssinia controlled it longer than any other country. Thus, our claim to the region is the strongest one. Of course, the previous war over the region ended in a bloody stalemate, so trying again might be risky."
 ABY_cede_manedalusia:0 "Cede Manedalusia"
 ABY_cede_manedalusia_desc:0 "With Manedalusia, we might be suffering from sunk cost fallacy. The brutal war of 988 with Maregypt and two decades of expensive occupation have been a great drain on our resources. Not only that, but our relations with the current occupiers of Manedalusia have been ruined. While controversial, abandoning Manedalusia would be a quick way to cut our losses."

 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_desc:0 "Tensions with Maregypt over Manedalusia have lasted for two decades. Rather than continuing to fight over the region, we could turn Manedalusia into a buffer state, similar to Klugetown's de facto status. It would mean both sides giving up their claims on the region in the name of mutual peace and coexistence."
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia:0 "The Province Of Manedalusia"
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia_desc:0 "In the past, Manedalusia was governed as an integral part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia, despite lacking a feline majority population. This meant the region was treated same as any other province, with local governance being the responsibilty of a noble, the Basha. Integrating the region will require some degree of cooperation from the locals, however."
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia:0 "The Federal Act"
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia_desc:0 "The Manedalusians have shown that they will not easily accept a return to the previous status quo. Much has changed in the 300 or so years since we lost Manedalusia. Pro-Abyssinian ponies have proposed the formation of a federation, with Manedalusia having both extensive self-rule and some power in the central government."

 ABY_manedalusian_auxiliaries_desc:0 "After regaining Coltoba in 988, some recruitment among the local ponies was started to make use of their unique abilities such as flight and use of magic. While seen as more unreliable, ponies can nonetheless be a very effective supplement for the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army. As such, we should consider greatly expanding their recruitment."
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY:0 "Form An Alliance With Maregypt"
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY_desc:0 "With our disputes with Maregypt resolved and the relations between our two nations greatly improved, we should consider further deepening our ties to the eastern ponies.

 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2:0 "Negotiate About The Status Of Klugetown"
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2_desc:0 "Klugetown was founded as a trade outpost on an oasis in Abyssinian territory in 467 ALB. Ever since, they have done their best to act independent from us, which culminated in 947 when any Abyssinian officials were expelled and they stopped obeying our laws. After the 988 conflict, Maregypt has supported them. We should negotiate with them to have any chance in reclaiming Klugetown."
 ABY_support_ovingoland:0 "Support The Ovingoland Movement"
 ABY_support_ovingoland_desc:0 "After the Storm King's rampage, southern Maregypt was filled to the brim with zebra refugees. With Maregypt itself suffering from internal instability, these zebras have been neglected and demand better treatment. We could use these tensions to our advantage by supporting the creation of an independent zebra state which would be reliant on our aid."
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown:0 "Reassert Sovereignty Over Klugetown"
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown_desc:0 "De jure, Klugetown has been part of [ABY.GetNameDef] for centuries. De facto, it has acted like a rogue city-state ever since Saddle Arabia turned us into a tributary. It is time law and order is restored in this crime-infested oasis city. Ideally, [KLG.GetLeader] will be willing to negotiate, but if not, we must be ready to use force."
 ABY_trade_with_alliance:0 "Trade With Allies"
 ABY_trade_with_alliance_desc:0 "Our new alliance enables us to establish new commercial ties with other countries. These ties would not only provide our merchants with additional profits, and thus the treasury with additional taxes, but also strengthen our bond with our new allies, thus guaranteeing peace between us."
 ABY_research_with_alliance:0 "Scientific Cooperation With Allies"
 ABY_research_with_alliance_desc:0 "Scientific advancement often requires the sharing and exchange of knowledge, as well as cooperation between researchers. Abyssinian intellectuals have proposed that we create the administrative, legal and logistical groundwork necessary for international scientific cooperation with our new allied states."
 ABY_topple_mgy_government:0 "Topple Unfriendly Maregyptian Government"
 ABY_topple_mgy_government_desc:0 "The current ruling government in Maregypt clearly has no interest in having a peaceful and friendly relationship with us. As such, to secure our eastern border, we have no choice but to use military force to reorganize Maregyptian politics and replace [MGY.GetLeader]'s government with a more cooperative one."
 ABY_restore_law_and_order_in_KLG:0 "Restore Law And Order In Klugetown"
 ABY_restore_law_and_order_in_KLG_desc:0 "As an independent city-state, Klugetown was ruled by the ruthless mafia boss Verko and was a hotspot for all kinds of crimes. Now that we've regained control of the wayward city, I highly recommend we send in all law enforcement officials available to clean up the mess. Then, we will hold elections for a new Kantiba, lord mayor."
 ABY_the_kloog_connection:0 "The Klugetown Connection"
 ABY_the_kloog_connection_desc:0 "Klugetown grew as a city thanks to its central location and became a nexus for desert trade routes, like the ones between Abyssinia and Maregypt or the one crossing from Coltoba to Farasrah, connecting the Manedalusian Bay to the Arabian Sea. These traditional caravans can now be replaced with modern railways and trains."
 ABY_ally_donkeys:0 "Seek An Alliance With The Donkeys"
 ABY_ally_donkeys_desc:0 "The donkey states that exist downstream on the Tiger and Panther rivers were once subjects of Abyssinia, but in these modern times we can develop a more equal and amicable relationship. We should invite them to our newly formed alliance, for together we will be stronger, perhaps strong enough to resist superpowers like Saddle Arabia."
 ABY_dominate_donkeys:0 "Dominate The Donkeys"
 ABY_dominate_donkeys_desc:0 "In 150 ALB, Abyssinia subjugated the donkeys of the south under its rule. This lasted until the 5th century when Saddle Arabia seized the lands from us, but during that time the vassal states prospered. The donkeys have been independent since 989, but history tells us that they are unable to rule themselves. Most importantly, we can secure our wide and defenceless southern border."
 ABY_liberate_farasrah:0 "Liberate Farasrah"
 ABY_liberate_farasrah_desc:0 "The port-city of Farasrah is disputed between the donkeys and the state of Yemane. While having a mixed population of horses and donkeys, it was historically part of Anseruk before Yemane seized it with military force in the aftermath of Saddle Arabia's withdrawal from the region in 989. This gives us the casus belli we need to secure our connection to the Arabian Sea."

At least, use them in moderation like other cats do. I recommend you dispose of that hidden bag of yours that you hide under your bed.

 ABY_remake_the_crown_desc:0 "After losing your crown to the Storm King, you never ordered it to be remade. I am assuming you associate bad memories with crowns. However, it is an important status symbol, and having it remade would stop cats from calling you "The Crownless King". I'm sure that would improve your mood."
 ABY_have_sex:0 "Produce An Heir"
 ABY_have_sex_desc:0 "Despite being married for many years, you still have not produced an heir to the throne.

 abyssinia.1.d:0 "The steel battering ram pounded upon the gates of the royal palace and shattered them. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia, as the towering armored yeti walked inside accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three large fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""

 abyssinia.2.t:0 "A Typical Awakening"
 abyssinia.2.d:0 "King Gomez snapped awake in his bed, then realized it had just been the same reoccuring dream again. Or nightmare, except it didn't make him feel anything anymore. He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\nAfter glancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he lowered himself onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of fresh khatnip leaves. He put a pawful in his mouth, then chewed on it. He purred and rolled on the floor as his pupils dilated and he felt alive again.\nThe door opened.\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out. "W-what in the... why didn't you knock?" he mumbled with khatnip in his mouth. His trusted right paw cat, Tsehafe Taezaz, Minister of the Pen, Scribe by Command, Dejen Rees-Moggy, stood in the doorway, completely unfazed.\n"I did, my King, but you didn't seem to hear it. I wanted to ask you if you've finally decided when we can have a meeting."\nGomez spat out the khatnip and straightened himself. "I... haven't. Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and lowered his ears.\nDejen rolled his eyes. "Also, I wanted to remind you that your wife has prepared a meal for you. She's been waiting for a while."\nGomez's eyes widened. "Oh, Tartarus! I forgot about it!" He rushed out of the bedroom, running past his advisor, leaving him alone.\nDejen shrugged and headed back to his office."

She knew that he was probably sleeping and regretted not being able to sleep at the same time due to his... changed sleep schedule. At least he usually woke up in time for dinner.\n\nKing Gomez barged into the room. "I-I am so sorry, Tish, I completely forgot about this!"\nMorticia raised an eyebrow. "But we have dinner every day?"\n"Uuuh... yes, but... ah, it doesn't matter." He sat down on the opposite end of the table, his shoulders slumped. "What are we having today."\n"In solidarity with our hungering subjects, we are only having a little bit of kibble. I even arranged for a cat to take a photograph of our meal so it could appear in the newspapers, but... he had to leave after waiting for an hour."\nGomez groaned and rubbed his forehead. "That's my fault, sorry."\nMorticia forced a smile. "It's fine! We can still enjoy the meal."\nThe khatnip was making Gomez's mind foggy. "Sorry, but I'm not really hungry."\n"But you haven't eaten since yesterday?"\n"I know..."\n\nThere was an extended moment of silence as Morticia looked at her husband with concern. Things were only getting worse and worse, she thought. "My darling, you need help. You are sick."\n"Am I? Or do I just see things more clearly than others?" he muttered.\nMorticia sighed. "I understand you better than anyone else, and I can tell something is wrong. And I just want you to be happy again."\nGomez stared blankly into his plate of kibble, then replied:"

 abyssinia.4.t:0 "The Gathering Of The Nobles"
 abyssinia.4.d:0 "The decrepit stone mansion of the Catwe dynasty was usually a quiet place, yet now it was filled with hundreds of cats, most of whom were servants. A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, who were horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered in a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina of House Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," Tsahife Lam Tardar Sourpuss, muttered.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats in the Kingdom had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne. "I am glad all of you accepted my invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown. "Unlike Gomez, I keep my promises, dear Tardar. Now listen, I have much to explain...""

 abyssinia.5.d:0 "Gomez was slumped in his chair as he listened to his wife explain her plans. While he admired her hopefulness and enthusiasm, he also felt jealous. Why couldn't he feel the same way anymore?\n\n"So I've contacted the best doctors in the Kingdom," Morticia said, "and they said they'd be more than happy to diagnose your condition. Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and one of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati. I sent a message to the priests there and they'd be more than happy to welcome you. If you leave, I could stay here and act as regent. Lastly, we have plenty of relatives who are concerned about you. We could hold a family gathering and see if they can help you feel any better. How do these options sound, my darling? Which one do you think is best?"\n\nGomez blinked slowly. "Uuuuh... they're all fine, I guess."\nMorticia's smile faded slightly. "Well, you have to pick one, as we can't do all of them at once."\nHe rubbed his aching forehead. "Ugh, alright. Let me think...""

"Who are you and who granted you permission to be seated in my workspace?"\nThe stranger chuckled and steepled her paws. "I granted permission to myself. I am the rightful owner of this place, after all."\nHe raised an eyebrow. "...Catrina of House Catwe?"\n"Mhm, you know your history, at least. Let me cut to the chase: I want to acquire information."\nHis eyes narrowed. "Of what kind?"\n"Oh, you see, I have certain plans, and to fulfill them, I need some... incriminating facts about our beloved King and liege. With evidence, preferably."\n"And why would I give you anything?"\n"Tell me, are you pleased with the rule of King Gomez? You can be honest with me."\nDejen hesitated rather than answering.\n"None of us are," Catrina hissed. "And you can help me to replace him with someone better."\n"Yourself?"\nCatrina laughed. "Hah, that is besides the point! Just give me what I want, and I'll take care of the rest."\nDejen took a deep breath. He had a tough decision to make."

 abyssinia.7.t:0 "Professional Diagnosis"
 abyssinia.7.d:0 "The finest cat doctors of Abyssinia had gathered in the palace, ready to serve their lord and liege. King Gomez was subjected to several hours of careful analysis, questioning and diagnosis as they checked every part of his body and wanted to hear his entire life story. By the end of it, he was completely exhausted, but at least the medical experts had enough data now to come to some sort of conclusion. They all agreed that he had depression or melancholia. However, they did not agree what the cause was or how he should be treated.\n"He clearly has an imbalance of humours in his body, an excess of black bile!" one doctor said. "Some bloodletting should do the trick."\n"Nonsense, this is clearly a case of demonic possession!"\n"Possession has scientifically been proven to not cause depression! Rather, the demon treats the body like a puppet. Besides, we cats have inherently low magical energies and thus are very unlikely to be possessed."\n"I think a combination of ferrous iodide, arsenic, ergot, strophantin and cinchona should do the trick of curing him."\n"Opium alone should suffice."\n"No! He needs a lobotomy!"\n"What about electroshock therapy?"\n"Untested new technology sounds dangerous."\n"Hmmm... how about this then?" The doctor gave Gomez a large poster. It had an animal cat hanging from a tree branch, accompanied by the text "Hang in there!".\nGomez groaned. Everything they proposed sounded terrible.\n"I'm sorry my darling," Morticia said, "but we couldn't afford to get better doctors from Equestria to come here. How about we try something else?""

 abyssinia.8.t:0 "A Rocky Road"
 abyssinia.8.d:0 "King Gomez had long known about the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela as they were famous, but he had never realized how remote they were. There was no railroad in the region, so he and his entourage had arrived by boat in Catemte, then taken a winding unpaved road up the mountains. He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten. "Here, have this. Go buy some food for yourself, it must be expensive these days.""

At least, the Storm King hadn't emptied the pantry, though Queen Morticia had wished for them to eat less food so she could instead donate some of it to hungry peasants. Her relatives didn't listen.\n\nThe constant chatter and noise of cats of all ages was deafening, and King Gomez felt like he was going to get a headache. His already minimal appetite had become non-existent.\n"What's wrong Gomy?" his old uncle asked. "Not going to touch your food?"\n"It's probably because he's 'depressed'!" his cousin thrice removed said.\n"Depression isn't real," his sister-in-law said. "Snap out of it!"\n"He has it easy!" his brother-in-law hissed. "I lost my home, my leg and my wealth during the Storm King's invasion, but you don't see me frowning!"\n"Yeah, don't be sad, Gomy!" his aunt said. "Just look on the bright side of life and appreciate all the good things in it!"\n"It's all in your head," mother-in-law said. "Why do you let it affect you so much?"\nHis half-drunk godfather drank some katikala and laughed. "He needs to have more fun in life, that's all!"\n\nGomez groaned and visibly shrunk. His wife, who was sitting next to him, noticed this. "Can all of you be quiet?!" she hissed at their relatives, then turned to whisper into Gomez's ear. "This was a mistake.

So it was a surprise to Gomez when the council gathered again for the first time in many moons.\n\nReluctantly, he dragged himself to the council chambers, even though he would've rather stayed in bed. He saw that all the important nobles in the Kingdom had come, so they probably had something important to say. He lowered his ears and sat down at the end of the table.\n"His Majesty finally bothered to arrive, so let us begin," Tsahife Lam Tardar Sourpuss said. "We have a guest speaker here today, so let's get that out of the way."\nCatrina of House Catwe stood up and smiled. "Thank you, honoured Tsahife Lam. We have all gathered here today to discuss the Crownless King's current pathetic condition. He is clearly incapable of ruling his Kingdom anymore, which begs the question: why does that disgusting cousin-marrier cling on to the throne? Does he really think we want to see his mopey face every time we discuss vital political matters?"\nSome nobles laughed, while those who were loyal to the King frowned. Gomez himself appeared unnerved, but remained silent.\nCatrina continued. "May I remind you that his inbred dynasty seized power from MY family, and then proceeded to trample on your ancient rights and privileges. And for what? Our Kingdom lies in ruins, but the Clawomons clearly do not care!"\nAs more and more nobles laughed and cheered, Gomez had enough. He stood up and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Catrina grinned."

It was Gomez's hidden stash.\nThe room erupted into laughter and shouting. Gomez's eyes widened in shock. Someone close to him had betrayed him and exposed his secret. His lips quievered and he stood up. The room went silent. "You know what, you are right about everything. I give up.

The date was called "Enkutatash", which meant "Gift of Jewels", in reference to a legend where Queen Mewkeda was gifted precious gems by her husband, King Clawomon, the mythical founder of the Kingdom of Abyssinia. Families first visit the local temples, then share a meal of chicken meat covered in sauce. As the sun begins to set, cats don their finest clothes, gather flowers and offer bouquets to their friends while singing songs. In recent years, foreign influences such as firework displays have also become more common especially in cities.\n\nDespite the hard times, the celebrations were jubilant and cats were happy to take a break from the difficulties of life."

The crowd went silent.\n\n"The King has made a very important decision which will now be revealed to the public. He is in no condition to hold a speech so I will do it on his behalf, reading what he has written." He raised the paper and read:\n\n""My beloved subjects,\n\nAfter much deliberation, I have finally made a painful but necessary decision. I declare that I have voluntarily abdicated in favour of my very beloved and dear wife, Queen Morticia. This I do with all my heart.\n\nI want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country which, as King of Abyssinia, I have for nine years tried to serve. But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King. And I want you to know that the decision I have made has been mine and mine alone. This was a thing I had to judge entirely for myself. I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of what would, in the end, be best for all.\n\nAnd now, we all have a new Queen. I wish her and you, her people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. Long live the Queen!""\n\nThe crowd remained silent, appearing both shocked and confused.

They had been carved directly into the stone centuries ago by King Felibela of the Catwe dynasty who wanted to create a holy city for his Kingdom. The temples and the nearby town had been named after him, but since the Clawomons had deposed his dynasty, the area had been mostly neglected. The town was insignificant and the temples were maintained only by the priests who continued to live in them. However, recently the location had become famous and rejuvenated by visitors.\n\nUnlike Felibela, King Gomez was not feeling rejuvenated. Now that he had seen the temples, he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. It all started to feel like a waste of time, so he sat down on a rock. Nearby, an old statue of Baast stood, the four-legged creator goddess of catkind. He looked at it and wondered if she had made a mistake granting sapience to his ancestors. Maybe he'd be happier if he was a wild cat, chasing mice and what not?\n\n"And who are you?"\nGomez turned his head and saw an old grey cat adorned in pure white robes. "You don't recognize me?" he replied. "I'm the King of Abyssinia... unfortunately."\n"I did not ask for your title. Titles are imaginary and meaningless."\nThe King frowned. "My name is Gomez Mawkonnen."\n"Names are also imaginary and meaningless. Who really are you?"\nGomez blinked in confusion.\n"You clearly need help with answering that question. How about we talk over a hot cup of coffee?"\nGomez hesitated accepting an invitation from this peasant priest, but ultimately nodded."

They weren't for the Crown Guard or the local garrison, those were in a separate report. Who had even approved these?\n\nHe sprang back to life, digging hastily through his carefully stacked piles of paper. There was a report of the arrival of the retinue of Tsahife Lam Tardar a week ago. But where was the report of their departure? Had the supplies been requisitioned for them? Then he found several other reports of nobles bringing their armed retinues as "bodyguards" for the council they had recently held. Those bodyguards still hadn't left, and their numbers were strangely high. What were they waiting for?\n\nHis eyes widened as he realized their purpose. He stood up from his chair and ran to the imported telephone hanging from the wall. But right as he was about to call the head of the Crown Guard, the Colonel, he hesitated.

I am the Queen!"\n"Calm down, sweetheart," Catrina purred. "While Gomez designated you as his successor, your claim to the throne is very weak as you are his cousin. The nobles have decided to hold an emergency meeting to elect a better candidate for the throne."\n"And who would that be?" Morticia asked, knowing the answer already.\n"Me, of course!" Catrina said and laughed. "I am a direct descendant of King Felibela. And the nobles are quite sick of Clawomon rule. Besides, your ancestor deposed my family in quite the illegal fashion."\n"The Catwes were the ones who seized the Kingdom without any right to do so!"\n"Tsk tsk, how about we leave history to the chroniclers. What matters is the present moment. Let us proceed with the vote! Every noble who wishes for me to succeed Gomez to the throne, raise your paw."\nMajority of the nobles did so. A few did not, and they looked at Morticia apologetically, powerless to do anything.\n"Then it is decided!" Catrina said and clasped her paws. "Unless you'd like to contest my claim to the throne, Morticia. In which case I'm sure my supporters would imprison you immediately, right here and now."\nMorticia glared at her.

So when Tekle invited him again, he was unsure if his advice had been of any use.\n\nWhen Gomez arrived, Tekle was already seated, so he lied down on the bed.\n"Good to see you, Gomez," the priest said. "How have you been?"\n"I... fine, I suppose."\n"Did anything change after you stopped thinking about Kingship?"\n"Well..." he frowned and pondered, examining his own emotions. "I do feel a little... less stressed."\n"Good. So your mood is linked to your responsibility. You worry about the troubles you face. Yet also, I feel like you blame yourself for what happened."\n"What do you mean?"\n"You tried to defend the Kingdom but failed. I know that much. But no one could've defeated the Storm King except for the Hippogriffs. This feeling is not rational either. And I believe that the root causes of your anguish are ultimately doubt and hatred of the self."\nGomez stared at him and said nothing.\n"Am I right? The mind is a difficult thing to decipher."\nThe King let out a long, drawn out sigh. "Yes."\nTekle smiled. "Excellent. Now the treatment can begin.

I've learned not to make swift judgements. Besides, you're here on vacation, no? It was good for your mind to take it easy for a while."\n"...Right," Gomez replied. "Where are we going, anyways?"\n"Nowhere. Walking helps to stimulate your body and thus your mind. One treatment is exercise."\n"Ah... well, I'm not really feeling better yet."\n"Does a seed sprout into a tree in a day? No, and you have to water it often and take good care of it."\n"I see."\n"But while we're walking, we might as well be talking! The problems of your mind are two-pronged. Self-doubt comes from being too worried about being good enough for others, when you should focus on being good enough for yourself. Self-hatred comes from preferring to blame yourself rather than others, and not letting go of the past. Thankfully, it is possible to treat these unwholesome thoughts through Baast's gifts of self-awareness and self-control, but these abilities need to be trained. Your case is far from hopeless."\nGomez nodded slowly and didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked: "You're a priest. I thought you would've only been good at reciting the Three Scriptures and nothing more."\n"Our duty is to be the spiritual pillar of society. Baast gifted us sapient minds, giving us the ability to escape the cycle of suffering that animals are doomed to endure. However, many cats do not know how to use their gifts. It is our responsibility to tend to these minds and treat them when they are sick." The old cat sighed. "But I know that the world is changing.

Gomez asked.\nThe priest sat down on the rock and crossed his legs. "Come, sit down next to me. The view from here is wonderful!"\nGomez hesitated.\nTekle turned around and looked at him. "What, are you afraid of falling and dying?"\nGomez didn't answer.\n"We have nine lives, just like regular cats. Nine chances... but it is entirely possible these are our last lives. Yet does this mean we should live as a slave of fear?"\n"I'm not afraid," Gomez said. "Sometimes... I think about jumping off a cliff. But I just... want to decide when it happens."\n"So you are afraid, then. Otherwise you would've already done it. Come, there's nothing to fear. This rock has been here for thousands of years."\nGomez gulped and climbed, sitting down next to Tekle.\n\n"There we go. Now, this is a great place to focus. Sit like I do, take this stance. Like that, yes. Then breathe, control it. Slow and steady. Feel your breaths, feel the air in your lungs. Next you can extend your awareness further. How does the rest of your body feel? How does your mind feel? Register emotions within you. You cannot grasp fog, you must hold solid things. As such your thoughts and feelings must become controllable. Think of something that makes you unhappy or distressed. The burning city of Panthera, for example. Then think of what makes you happy, or what made you happy before. Like your wife. What emotions do they cause, if any? Face them. Permit them to pass over you and through you. Your feelings don't define who you are. You define yourself. Don't let the negative compounding thoughts control you. Don't judge yourself if you can't succeed at first. Don't judge yourself at all. Every sapient creature is flawed. Only Baast was perfect, and she is long dead."\n\nGomez quietly stared into the distance."

Nevertheless, he still didn't feel happy, an he doubted if he was ever going to be. But he didn't feel too unhappy either. He had always wanted to learn how to control his emotions. Maybe this was the way.\n\n"We have made good progress", the priest, who sat on the opposite end of the table, said. "But I doubt it is anywhere near enough."\n"I'm afraid I'll have to leave. I've spent too long here already."\n"What, you don't want to procrastinate on your duties anymore?" he asked with a smirk.\nThe King sighed. "I just want to see my Queen again."\n"Good. But if you do decide to return to your regular life, remember that you need to muster the courage to face your problems. If you don't, they will only get worse and worse."\n"I've noticed," Gomez mumbled and drank more coffee.\n"We all have to do things we don't want to do. This is as true for a King as it is true for a slave. Yet do not let your duty overcome you. When work is over, you are just a cat like me. Remember that."\n"But my resposibility is far greater than anycat else's." He thought of the famished kitten at that village and felt guilty about it.\n"You are right. But the responsibility isn't exclusively yours. Never hesitate to ask others for help. Learn to divide your tasks into smaller parts and share them with others, to ease the burden."\nGomez nodded and finished his coffee. "...I appreciate having someone who can actually help me.

 abyssinia.29.d:0 ""I will be honest, your Majesty, I wasn't certain if you'd be here," Dejen said as he was preparing his presentation.\n"It's fine. I wasn't sure either," Gomez replied.\n"Well, because this has taken long enough to happen, I will get straight to the point. My overview will cover the internal and external situation of the Kingdom. I will start with the former." He had placed a large map of Abyssinia behind him and had a pointing stick in his paw. "When I wrote this presentation, my largest concern was the nobility, but since then their threat has diminished. Nevertheless, many nobles remain dissatisfied with your rule for understandable reasons. They will need to be reminded of your legitimacy and competence. The second internal issue is slavery. There is every reason to outlaw it fully and emancipate our million slaves, but the aforementioned nobles strongly oppose this. Yet not doing so will lead to constant slave revolts that are costly to pacify." He pointed at Coltoba with his stick. "The third issue is Manedalusia. Tensions remain over the conflict we had with Maregypt years ago, and the local secessionist movement has utilized recent chaos to grow in strength. The fourth issue is famine. Without funds to import food, our limited domestic production isn't enough. But we have many ways to salvage the situation before it's too late. Speaking of lack of funds, that's the fifth and final internal issue, which will require extensive and quick reforms. Next, the external ones. First, conflicts in Saddle Arabia and Great Lakes have greatly reduced our trade income," he said, pointing at the two regions which appeared deceptively unified on the outdated map, "making it difficult to refill our treasury." Then he pointed at Katren. "Second, the monarchist Wingbardian government still sees us as part of their sphere of influence." His stick moved eastwards towards the Neighle. "Third, Maregypt's revanchists continue to urge their government to 'liberate' Coltoba from our rule. At this rate, they might launch a military offensive against us." He stopped for a moment, as if to think about what to say, then pointed at the lands south of Abyssinia. "Lastly, our relations with the donkey states of Asstyria and Anseruk are... fine, in fact, at least for now." He turned to look at Gomez again. "Any questions, my King?""

This has caused severe economic issues such as deflation, bank runs and a decline of economic activity. These issues are so severe, in fact, that we should've implemented reforms as soon as possible."\nGomez rubbed his forehead with his claws. "I am sorry."\n"Apology accepted. Now, you have a decision to make. I have investigated our options and consolidated them into three. Two of them are similar: we peg the value of our currency to the value of another one. This will bring financial stability and make it easy to loan funds from abroad, but will make us more dependent on whatever currency we choose. My two proposals are the Equestrian bit and the Skyfallian idol. Both are reliable, valuable and extensively used in global trade. Either of them would function as our reserve currency. The third option is to simply not have a fixed currency at all. A floating exchange rate would be a more unorthodox choice, but would allow us to recover more quickly from the crisis and enable us to increase our money supply as much as necessary. This could lead to excessive inflation, however, so we'd have to be more careful than with the other two alternatives."\n\nGomez frowned.

 abyssinia.55.d:0 "Baastism is a name commonly used by outsiders to refer to the traditional racial faith of Abyssinian cats. It is centered around Baast, a legendary four-legged sapient cat who allegedly overthrew the Tyrant King Anubis of ancient Anugypt and sacrificed herself to create the Abyssinian race. As this was the end of Baast's ninth and final life, she is considered to be a dead deity. Baastism therefore focuses on following her way of life rather than praying for salvation or fearing retribution.\n\nThe core principle of Baastism is the cycle of rebirth, where a cat can live nine lives before facing eternal oblivion and non-existence. Baast escaped this fate through achieving everlasting metaphysical existence by eliminating desire and the self. Baastists thus seek to emulate her by purifying their minds in a similar manner. They do not believe that animals, such as house cats, are capable of this and see sapience as Baast's gift that they must use to liberate themselves from suffering and nothingness.\n\nThe religion has a priesthood who maintain isolated temples that are used for worship and meditation. The core function of the priests is teaching others to live like Baast did and help them achieve enlightenment. There are very few, if any, Baastists who are not Abyssinian cats, due to the focus on Baast's relationship with her "creations". Those non-cats who do follow Baast's way of life do so hoping to achieve similar salvation, seeking to live as virtuously as her.\n\nThere are several unorthodox variants of Baastism which have few followers. They interpret the legend of Baast's life differently, some even claiming she still exists and actively intervenes in temporal affairs like a regular god. While they are considered heretics, they are not actively persecuted most of the time."

That is why he had to keep going, no matter what.\n\n"Gomez?" Morticia, who was lying in a nearby hospital bed, asked with a weary voice.

In 988, when Maregypt declared independence from Saddle Arabia, Manedalusia was left isolated, allowing Abyssinian forces to move in to reclaim the region. However, Maregyptians contested the feline claim and moved forces into the area, triggering a short yet bloody conflict that left Manedalusia divided after a ceasefire.\n\nSince then, much of Manedalusia remains in foreign occupation. Nevertheless, the central government decided to hold a national holiday celebrating the historical event. If anything, it reminded the citizens of the strength Abyssinia had once had, and of the historical unity between the Abyssinian and Manedalusian peoples. Cats and ponies were perfectly capable of living together in harmony and peace, despite claims to the contrary. Passionate public speeches were held by several pro-Abyssinian Manedalusian exiles and there were displays of traditional Manedalusian culture.

He is very pleasant to be around."\n"You will invite me to your wedding, right?"\n"I've already drafted the invitations, no need to worry.

 abyssinia.119.d:0 "When Gomez was at the palace, his mood wasn't terrible and he wasn't too busy, he liked to stand on the balcony of the royal palace in the evening and admire the sunset. And while the red clouds this time were indeed pleasant to look at, he was distracted by the vast pillar of smoke rising from the outskirts of Panthera. He looked down and saw hundreds of fires burning in the distance. "Funeral pyres," he mumbled to himself when he realized. Families and priests were cremating the bodies of the dead. While this was a relatively common occurence, he had never seen so many at once. There was so much smoke that the setting sun itself could not be seen anymore.\n\nHe was certain most of them had fallen in the recent fighting. Yet even these hundreds of deaths represented only a fraction of the total casualties. There were thousands upon thousands of cats who were wounded, missing, or taken prisoner by the enemy. Some who died would never receive a cremation. And not all of them were soldiers, either.\n\nGomez walked away from the balcony with heavy steps. Was war really worth it? Was this not his responsibility? Were not his paws covered in the blood of his subjects? He shook his head, as if trying to shake off these thoughts from his mind, then headed towards Morticia's quarters."

 abyssinia.121.d:0 "Just as the sun was rising above the mountains of Catorahe, the ground began to shake and tremble. The rumbling became increasingly violent and within minutes, houses in villages and towns began to collapse one by one. The shaking continued for minutes that felt like hours as cats fled their homes and took refuge in open spaces, and in the end hundreds of buildings were reduced to ruins, burying thousands of cats under the rubble.\n\nEarthquakes are a common occurence in the mountains of Abyssinia, as the peninsula is located near a subduction zone. Feline architecture takes this into account and is famously resilient during seismic events. Yet this earthquake was so exceptionally strong and violent that it was felt throughout Abyssinia and beyond. Seismologists in Panthera estimate that the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 on the Canter scale.\n\nLocal government in Catorahe has already petitioned the central [ROOT.GetAdjective] government to send immediate aid to the region, as there are thousands of cats wounded or trapped in ruins. Swift action could save many lives, but would be expensive."

### Events ###
maciegna.1.t:0 "Remembrance Of The Past"
maciegna.1.d:0 "#TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)" #NavyMongoose
maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
maciegna.2.d:0 "#TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past." #NavyMongoose
maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy upon the pigs, for we shall have none!"

maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna.3.d:0 "#TODO - Before I give the TODO here, a brief term explanation. The name of the event is a play on the Bedouin term 'The Great Skulls of Arabia' which denotes the great aka the most powerful clans of Arabia. Thus the term 'Grand Mules' denotes the same for Macigena (There are four: Zekuris, Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha). In this event, the Prophet meets with his sister Safinata and the rest of the three major clan chiefs to discuss the upcoming war - Informing them that there will unfortunately be bloodshed, but that they shall be rewarded for their services both in this world and in the afterlife. For their part, the Chiefs are fully loyal to him." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.3.a:0 "God is great!"

maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
maciegna.4.d:0 "#TODO - A quiet event between the Prophet and his daughter Zulaihat where they're sitting around in his modest home and drinking tea. Overall it's just a father and his daughter discussing life, with the Prophet giving sagely advice and in the end asking his child to give him judgement on whether she believes that his goal of waging war for what he perceives as a just war - To his surprise Zulihalit believes that not only is it just, backign up her words with scripture (Hadiths) from the Revealed Texts (Think, mix between the Quran and the Bible), but that it is a necessity." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.4.a:0 "To believe is to struggle against oneself and the world."

maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
maciegna.5.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet quietly observing a Sufi-esque performance by his son Ochen and his Zariqa Order (Effectively a Sufi order), it's effectively the Community's take upon the Griot traditions of the Great Lakes, with the entire ceremony involving a lot of music, the channeling of spirits to prove one's mastery over the self and frenzied exaltations of God. For his part, the Prophet is proud of his son for having found such a beautiful use of his oratory and musical arts, recognising the importance such public displays have upon a people's morale in times of hardship." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in his image, it is only proper to exalt his creation."

maciegna.6.t:0 "The Death Of A Heathen"
maciegna.6.d:0 "#TODO - With the defeat of Zar-Hay, it's found out Zonni was killed in the fighting and as such the Prophet is brought before his corpse to pass judgement - The offer to burn his body on a pyre is presented, but the Prophet ultimately decides that Zonni was righteous in life and although a heathen deserves a proper burial mound as per is tradition for people not of the Community. Ultimately this is meant to be a show of respect towards the fallen Warlord." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.6.a:0 "Memento mori."

maciegna.7.t:0 "Of Mystics And Scripture"
maciegna.7.d:0 "#TODO - The first event in which we see a crack in the relationship between Ochen and Zulaihat. Basically by most definitions in the Revelead Texts, the various Mystics of the city of Zao are technically heathens. Ochen, being what is effectively a Mystic himself and the founder of what is more or less zebra Sufism wants to integrate them and use their talents for the sake of glorifying God, aka integrate them into the Zariqate, his sister on the other hand who has an almost slavish dedication to the concept of moral law wants to punish them for their part in glorifying amoral behaviour (The punishment is mostly just lashings). Both of them use the Revealed Texts to back up their words and it is ultimately up to the Prophet to decide upon the matter - Entire event should have the style of a debate." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.7.a:0 "God is merciful, let their voices sing praise upon his glory."
maciegna.7.b:0 "God is just, although their intent was not malevolent it is the act that must be punished."

maciegna.8.t:0 "The Custodianship"
maciegna.8.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Issa and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm." #NavyMongoose
maciegna.8.a:0 "God is great!"

maciegna_flavour.1.t:0 "Under God's Sky"
maciegna_flavour.1.d:0 "#TODO - A quiet moment between the Prophet and Issa, where the two simply sit under the night time sky, sharing a skin of water under the light of a bonefire and discussing the past. The two met while Issa was still a slave soldier in Mazwi and she had subsequently become one of the Prophet's first followers, his companion and his genuine friend, so this is just meant to show how much the both of them respect eachother and just how willing Issa is to uphold his vision of a just world" #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.1.a:0 "You are a fistful of incense over the embers and the scent of a pure soul Issa."

maciegna_flavour.2.t:0 "The Minute Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna_flavour.2.d:0 "#TODO - Much like the Great Mules of Macigena, there are the Minute Mules of Macigena, although they're more often than not called the Servile Clans due to their obedience to one or more of the Great Mules. This event is more meant to show the Prophet meeting with the leader of one such servile clan and offering them the same respect he would to any other person showing just how much simple kindness and a smidge of charisma have allowed him to gather such a large following." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.2.a:0 "Respect is the foundation of belief."

maciegna_flavour.3.t:0 "The Lesser Struggle"
maciegna_flavour.3.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet and his son Ochen having a discussion on the nature of the concept of 'Struggle' in the faith, as his father had by that point only discussed the notion of an inner Struggle that strives for a sinless existence. The Prophet for his part tries to explain that sometimes there is a need to Struggle against the evil of others for the Community to have a chance at a faithful and happy life. Ultimately his son comes away satisifed with the explanation, but the entire interaction leaves a bad taste in the Prophet's mouth." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.3.a:0 "God willing, the violence shall end one day."

maciegna_flavour.4.t:0 "From Timbucktu With Love"
maciegna_flavour.4.d:0 "#TODO - One of the few events not featuring the Prophet, this event is effectively a few of the Prophet's followers from Timbucktu traversing the desert to reach Mareshi to supply the Community with weapons for self-defence. Event is meant to show that although he has no personal presence in Timbucktu there are still people out there either preaching his message or following in his footsteps" #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.4.a:0 "From one to all."

maciegna_flavour.5.t:0 "The House Of Worship"
maciegna_flavour.5.d:0 "#TODO - The raising of the first official house of worship in the Community's existence. This is a great occasion as up until this point they have been using various abandoned palaces and temples as prayer halls. The House of Worship is built using materials such as adobe and features something that the architect of the project had dubbed the 'Tower of Silence', effectively an elevated circular platform/tower next to the House of Worship which is exposed to the elements thus granting the ability for the Community to finally host sky burials without any fear." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.5.a:0 "The first tree has grown."

maciegna_flavour.6.t:0 "The Giving Of Zebkat"
maciegna_flavour.6.d:0 "#TODO - Obvious reference to the idea of giving Zakat in Islam, this event is mostly about a poor family being given alms and a place to stay by the state. The house they are given is not a grand thing nor is it particularly oppulent, but in a land as ravaged by war as the Great Lakes, it is an act of kindness that would turn even the most ardent of skeptics into zealots." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.6.a:0 "We are all family in the eyes of God."

maciegna_flavour.7.t:0 "Subsidiary Agriculture"
maciegna_flavour.7.d:0 "#TODO - A scholar arriving in a small village near the outskirts of Mareshi, the peasants/farmers working the fields there know the usual shtick with Mazwi was 'Get the orders from some city slicker bureaucrat who knows fuck all about what he is talking about, and wait until he leaves so we can go back to our business in peace'. They're pleasantly surprised when the scholar sent over from Mareshi goes around actually talking to them to figure out how to resolve local issues with irrigation, and based upon that provides them actual solutions to their various problems. Over the course of the month they become a valued member of the community." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.7.a:0 "All must work together for a better world."

maciegna_flavour.8.t:0 "First Steps"
maciegna_flavour.8.d:0 "#TODO - Generally a small wholesome event about a female warrior from the Clan of Diawadou (Which has been resettled into the region of Zarabara) gradually falling in love with a Griot from the town of Anzongo, showing that there is something to the Prophet's message after all." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.8.a:0 "To love one another is to love God."

maciegna_flavour.9.t:0 "A Story Of Family"
maciegna_flavour.9.d:0 "#TODO - A flavour event about the Prophet meeting with representatives from the Re'emite enclave in Anzongo. Considering these are the Great Lakes and they're used to having to engage in a little bit of bribery they brought gifts of gold and such to ingratiate themselves with their newest Overlord - To their surprise they're actually greeted with a semblance of respect and invited by the Prophet to discuss scholarly matters of theology and philosophy as he considers the Re'emites to be if nothing else on the right path by virtue of being Monotheists and possessing a profound respect for God." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.9.a:0 "In the end the gift of knowledge outweighted the gold."

maciegna_flavour.10.t:0 "The Call To Prayer"
maciegna_flavour.10.d:0 "#TODO - Small wholesome event about two members of bickering clans which had only recently converted to the teachings of the Community going to the newly built House of Worship in their area. When it comes to the Prophet's brand of religion there are technically no clergy just learned members of the Community who preach the texts and lead prayers (These individuals are called Guides, which is the equivalent of an IRL Imam). In this particular case, the Guide, as a neutral party doesn't actually lead a prayer but instead focuses on trying to reconcile the two clans, showing that at the end of the day the Community is as important to the Prophet as God." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.10.a:0 "As they focused upon the words, their hearts began to mellow."

maciegna_flavour.11.t:0 "The Act Of Governance"
maciegna_flavour.11.d:0 "#TODO - Event with Zulaihat in which she is leading public trials for the various aristocrats, former slave owners and general degenerates of Zao. The event is meant to give general insight into her as a person and how she perceives the world - The general gist is that she is a genuine believer in God and almost singlemindedly obsessed with the idea of justice to the point of being seen as ruthless for it, think Stannis from Game of Thrones just a tiny bit more sociable and a great deal less entitled; She is one of the Community's Judges her duty is to disperse proper justice after all." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna_flavour.11.a:0 "Let justice be done although the heavens may fall upon our heads."

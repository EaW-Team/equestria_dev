maciegna.1.d:0 "#TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)" #NavyMongoose
maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
maciegna.2.d:0 "#TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past." #NavyMongoose
maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy upon the pigs, for we shall have none!"

maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna.3.d:0 "Before the Prophet sat the three chiefs of clans Tatam, Diawadou, and Katoucha respectively, and to his side sat his dear sister, Safinata Zekuris. Courtesies and pleasantries had been exchanged, and all now remained await for his addressment. Around the small room and throughout their assembly location stood their personal contingents of bodyguards patrolling, watching, and readied for the many dangers undoubtingly at roam. This was, after all, the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Prophet exhaled through his nostrils, for indeed it this was the nature of these lands. “God’s message is good...God’s message is kind...but our enemies we now must face are, sadly, not. There will be another war once again in our homeland – another bloody and brutal war – and all because the evils of this world want it to happen; the very nature of sin is forcing this to happen. If there was another way, I would wholeheartedly accept it and rejoice in His name, but it is by the nature of sin that God’s message is sought to be manipulated against we, His stewards.”\n\nThe Prophet shared a glance with Safinata before looking to each of the chiefs. “Our clan plans to soon bring war against these leaders, but unlike the wars of the past, we shall fight in the name of God, for the will of His message and its deliverance upon we of today and Macigena’s future beyond us. I have gathered all of you here to ask for the help from each of your clans, though if any shall decide to not, I understand. God is good, but this war we must fight is not, and even dying for Him is still death.”\n\nThe three chiefs now exchanged contemplative looks as the Prophet finished his words. Safinata reached over and placed a firm hoof on his to give reassurance, but not a moment more had passed before the three chiefs slowly stood. All of them held their gazes with his, and one by one, they answered." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
maciegna.4.d:0 "“My sister has told me you are dating.” Almami’s smile grew wider at the immediate outtake of sputtering tea and coughs from Zulaihat, all the while gracefully sipping his own. "And please do not attempt to dodge the topic, let us remain on this, for it is one that matters a lot to me." His smile was saintly, even as she went beet red and murmured that auntie Safinata needed to mind her own business. He chuckled at his daughter’s embarrassment and savored the atmosphere around them.\n\nShared moments such as these, calm and relaxing, were becoming further apart. Here, in his daughter’s modest little home and sharing their mutual  favorite tea, he could lay to rest his duties as Prophet and be a father... or at least attempt so again. Zulaihat and her brother Ochen, had to take care of their lives without him after Aissata’s death. He always regretted period of self-estrangement, but with conflict approaching, it continued to bother him further. Zulaihat must have noticed it, for she reached out to place a hoof on his.\n\n"You seem deep in thought father, what is the matter? Are you thinking on your self-estranging again?” Almami merely sipped his tea and glanced out the room’s window. “We’ve been over this," Zulaihat told him. "You were in no condition after mother’s death, so you did the next practical thing and had Auntie Safinata and our clan look after me and Ochen.”\n\n"Perhaps so," Almami conceded the point. "Yet I have regrets all the same. We will march to war soon, and I have already had a lifetime of regrets to fill up. I ask of your love life as I do not wish to miss any more than I already have. Now...or in the future. Whatever comes, I pray that I will be allowed to sit with you after all this." " #Ardent Custodian and badass revision from Sweet Chrysallis
maciegna.4.a:0 ""As do I, father.""

maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
maciegna.5.d:0 "The amphitheater in Sorgo was alight with movement and filled with tune, and among the many spectators watched the Prophet in quiet awe. In the center performed his son, Ochen Zekuris, who had donned recreated garbs of the Griot of the Great Lakes, and around him sprang the zebras of the Zariqa Order. All around they moved with rehearsed finesse and guile and traditional Griot instruments rang out to the crowd. The performance itself was an interpretation of the ceremonies the Griot, though accentuated with channeling of spirits to prove one’s mastery of their own self and continuous frenzied exaltations of God.\n\nIn amusement, Almami wondered if his divine revelation God had given him would’ve been much easier on his body if he had known how to apply the techniques that his son displayed.\n\nAll around he could see the audiences captivated by the procession. Not one zebra, foal or grown, dared to take their eyes off of the rapid movements and gestures seemingly reaching into the air and drawing them inwards. They were enthralled, they were uplifted, and, above all else, they had faith.\n\nThe Prophet himself was impressed. Ochen had used his oratory skills and musical arts to create something so profound and beautiful that it embraced all who heard it. Faith was being conveyed through its public display, and in these times of strenuous hardships, access to faith was perhaps the greatest need of all." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in His image, it is only proper to exalt His creation."

maciegna.6.t:0 "The Death Of A Heathen"
maciegna.6.d:0 "The sky above Zao was skewered by a long blacken trail of smoke billowing from the massive pyre outside the city, but even so far, the putrid odour of burning flesh fell upon the populace, and all but the Macigenan forces washing the bloodied streets retreated into their homes in attempts to escape the acrid stench.\n\nAlmami stoically observed more and more corpses added to the flames, all belonging to the Zar-Hay garrison stationed in Zao. It was a grim task that had to be done, but such was not what brought the Prophet here; the dead body of Zar-Hay’s former leader, Zonni, was sprawled before him. Judging by what remained, it was evident that Zonni died fighting.\n\n“The body should burn like the rest,” the general who had recovered the body spoke, “the zebras here will make a martyr of the heathen otherwise.”\n\nAlmami’s hooves dug into the ground as he controlled his inner convictions. “Prepare a proper burial mound and lay him when readied." The taken aback general showed the faintest of confusion, but the Prophet continued. “Zonni righteously led as best as he believed, even if he was grossly misguided by sin and turned heathen in the end; we of God and His message ought to acknowledge this.”\n\n“He wouldn’t have done the same for you, for any of us.”\n\n“Indeed,” Almami said, “but we are not him - we are not heathens.”" #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.6.a:0 "Memento mori."

maciegna.7.t:0 "Of Mystics And Scripture"
maciegna.7.d:0 "A slight pain thrummed at the sides of Almami’s head as he continued listening to both his fervent son and resolute daughter argue on. The sun barely began its rise before the two of them had approached him with urgency, but now with midday having finally arrived, the Prophet’s morning plans were being crammed into his afternoon schedule, and perhaps also his evening ones. Still, the matter brought before him was nonetheless important, but it was evident that the zebra had to mediate between his two children.\n\n“Those Mystics in Zao are heathens, brother!” Zulaihat said, “The Revealed Texts even say so!”\n\n“They do not whatsoever, Zulaihat!” Raising up both forehooves, Ochen stomped the ground in anger. “If so, you are insinuating me as a heathen as well!”\n\nZulaihat huffed and bore into her brother. “Your Zariqate Order spreads God’s message to everyzebra, whereas those Mystics spread lies with their twisted practices. If that doesn’t sound heretical, Ochen, then I urge you to reread the Revealed Texts; they are heathens and should be punished as such!”\n\n“Lashings for methods that have managed to sway zebras for generations?! If we integrated them into the Zariqate, their ways can be readapted to better spread God’s message in areas where our own means have fallen short. What benefits do you fail to see here?”\n\n“God’s message is good, therefore His teachings are too, so there can be no “benefit” gained in warping His ways! Those practices are as poisonous as the sinful corruption that filled Zar-Hay, if not its source!”\n\nAlmami at last raised a hoof, and his children lapsed into silence. The Prophet had decided, the verdict establishing precedence henceforth." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna.8.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Issa and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm." #NavyMongoose

maciegna_flavour.1.t:0 "Under God's Sky"
maciegna_flavour.1.d:0 "Nothing but distant cicadas and the crackling flames filled the calm quiet between the two friends sharing a waterskin cooled by the night. In the distance beyond their campfire glowed the lights of Mareshi, and above it shimmered the stars upon the nighttime veil. Finishing a swig, Almami passed the waterskin back to his friend, Issa, who in turn sipped as she gazed back up at the stars.\n\n“How much do you think the stars have seen?” Almami asked.\n\nIssa lowered the waterskin. “Everything.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Ancient works make plenty mention of them,” she said and pointed a hoof towards one of the many flickering stars. “All I can say for sure is that they were up there when I was a foal, when I was with Mazwi, when I met you, and when God freed me.” A lulling moment passed with a breath. “They’ll even be up there when God’s vision of a just world finally comes to pass.”\n\nAlmami reflected on her words and his friendship with Issa, his first follower. She was but a slave soldier of the Mazwi when he first found her after his divine revelation over 20 years ago, and there and then, she had become his first follower – the first true disciple of God's message for a more just and united world. Even since, Issa’s staunch faith in God and His plan for the world had been unwavering, even perhaps more than the devotion of the Prophet himself. Almami had at least been given His revelation to help make him believe, but Issa’s belief drew from her alone. She was, in Almami Zekuris’ eyes, God's true first believer.\n\n“We will make God’s world into a reality, neither of us wouldn’t have made it this far if His message wasn’t true,” Issa affirmed, “and when we do, the stars will be up there to see it, all will be right, all will be free, and I’ll be there to see it, like the stars above us.”\n\nAlmami let his friend’s belief soothe his lightened head." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna_flavour.2.t:0 "The Minute Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna_flavour.2.d:0 "The Prophet stepped out from the back of the vehicle outside the adobe buildings around Ogardu. The sun bleating down upon the land, and everything around them deceitfully shimmered like the waters of the Great Lakes.\n\nMotioning to his cohorts, the Prophet and his guards cross up to the pale homestead’s entrance and stepped into its courtyard. This was the home of one of the many clans of the Minute Mules, or “servile” clans, as they had been labelled for their utmost obedience to one or more of the Great Mules in Macigena. The denotation of their status was made evermore present when the clan’s head zebras met him and pressed themselves and their robes onto the courtyard’s sandy grounds, bowing on all four hooves. Wanting to return the gesture, the Prophet forced his older self to bow just the same. When he lifted his head, he could see all the clan members regarding him with thinly obscured astonishment.\n\n“Is something the matter?”\n\nThe clan leader stammered and bowed his head again. “N-no, great Prophet, it’s just-no, nothing of matter, forgive me.”\n\n“Very well then,” the Prophet said. Letting out a groan, he lifted his frame up from the ground. The sands caught in his clothes would be a hassle to remove, but that could be done later, and preferably in some shade. “God gave us light, indeed, but I can’t help but wonder if He gave us a little too much.”\n\nA few of the clan zebras broke out in coughs to suppress their amusement, which earned a smile from the Prophet.\n\n“If we may, shall we enter inside to discuss matters? The waterskins we brought taste much better in shade.”\n\n“Waterskins? F-for us, great Prophet?”\n\n“Yes, I think we brought enough for every zebra - forgive my memory, your clan has thirty members, right?”\n\nThe astounded clan leader of exactly thirty zebras opted to calmly led the Prophet into his home." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna_flavour.3.t:0 "The Lesser Struggle"
maciegna_flavour.3.d:0 "“Why must God’s message face struggle, father?”\n\nAlmami lowered his favorite tea and turned to face Ochen. “It is because our bodies are impure, my son, so we must strive every day to compose ourselves so that we can receive Him.”\n\n“Yes, but what of others?” Ochen asked. “Those who don’t believe or just point their weapons at us, what about them? I believe in God’s message, father, I’ve felt His message work through me, but despite His love and justice, there still remain those who wish me dead.”\n\n“You?” Almami chuckled, “Whatever have you done?”\n\n“I chose to believe,” Ochen said, “Why must my belief in God’s message led to struggling against the world?”\n\nAlmami fell quiet and turned to ponder at empty space. Why does God’s will, eternally benevolent and good for all, face so much adversity? If His message is by Him and of Him, why must it inherently struggle against the world? Were they destined into a ceaseless cycle of struggle? The more these questions danced around Almami’s head, the more it began to hurt.\n\n“Father?”\n\n“This place, this region, is of sin.” Almami’s hooves fidgeted with his teacup. “The Great Lakes have been saturated with evil for so long that when it is confronted by God’s message, it withers and burns against His will. All this violence, all this struggle, it is perhaps God’s way of…cleansing that evil.”\n\n“We struggle today for the peace of tomorrow, and if not for us, then for those after.” Ochen turned his gaze out the window. “I think I understand what you mean.”\n\nAlmami forced a dour smile through the rebounding pain of uncertainties." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna_flavour.4.d:0 "CRACK!\n\nNo sooner had his hindquarters landed in his seat,  Asante craned his torso around to catch a glimpse at the caravan’s cargo - one of the containers had been jolted over, and its metallic contents had tumbled out onto the flatbed.\n\n“Safest road my hoof, this isn’t even a road, it’s desert!” The driver worked the wheel and avoided running over another patch of jagged rocks, only for the suspension to buckle from a surprise pothole. The sleek items in the back clamored some more.\n\n“I think you just un-zeroed every one of those things.”\n\n“God, damn this road.”\n\n“Be right back.” Asante unbuckled his seatbelt and hauled himself over the back and onto the flatbed. Pushing past the other crates, the zebra knelt down and began scooping up the cargo. Another rupture jolted the vehicle and forced Asante’s hooves to seize the open container before it spilled again, but the lurch still caused a few others to smack against his sides. Ow.\n\nAsante resumed putting the rifles back into their box. These were the weapons for the great Prophet and his Community – God’s Community. By association and belief, Asante was part of this Community too; all of them throughout the clandestine trail of caravan trucks were. They of God’s Community in Timbucktu were more than willing to provide the means for self-defense against the very evils that plague their fellow brothers and sisters in Mareshi – the very same evils that had forced them onto this forsaken path through the desert.\n\n“Less chances of getting raided.”\n\nAsante smiled and managed to reseal the container before yet another bump threw the vehicle upward and slammed everything back down hard. The vehicle trailing them buckled in the same manner. From his view, Asante could see the occupants of said vehicle behind start to lividly shout, scramble, and slam their hooves against the dashboard.

Generally speaking, the §2Legalist§! dogma can be described as the outward study of §3God§! which primarily focuses on jurisprudence, legalism, scholastic learning and the obligation of the one towards the §3Community§!.\n\nThe other, by far more obscure strain of dogmatic thought are the the mystical §6Purists§!. Originating as the §3Community§!'s answer to the §YGreat Lakes§!' long standing traditions of mysticism, and personal experience with the spiritual and the divine, the §6Purists§! seek to enlighten themselves and better understand the nature of §3God§! through the rigorous study of the §3Revealed Texts§!.

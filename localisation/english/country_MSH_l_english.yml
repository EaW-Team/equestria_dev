### Focuses ###
MSH_the_prophet_speaks:0 "The Call For Struggle"
MSH_the_prophet_speaks_desc:0 "We are the faithful followers of the one true God, and Almami Zekuris is his Prophet. Beyond the borders of our sacred realm are the agents of sin, decay, and death, but surely this cannot remain so if the word of God is to find root. The Prophet has summoned the faithful to hear his proclamation, and surely he knows of what God has planned for us." #NavyMongoose
MSH_rally_the_tribes:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
MSH_rally_the_tribes_desc:0 "The Prophet leads his tribe, the Zekurids, with the firm but loving grasp of a father, but the faithful also belong to other tribes who have their own leaders. He intends to speak with the other great tribes - of Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha - and have them affirm their devotion to the cause. Only together can we hope to drive back the infidel and protect the faithful." #NavyMongoose
MSH_freedom_under_gods_sky:0 "No Master But God"
MSH_freedom_under_gods_sky_desc:0 "Our battle against the wicked needs able warriors who can serve the Prophet will courage and skill. Among the zebras of the tribes should be enough brave chargers whom we can form into the core of what, by God's grace, would become a great army. Let the creatures of the Great Lakes know: only God can be master, and only God's Prophet can lift the sword for him." #NavyMongoose
MSH_rally_the_servile:0 "The Servile Clans"
MSH_rally_the_servile_desc:0 "Besides the four great clans there are lesser clans who have served them for many generations. They have been more uncertain about the truth and authority of the Prophet's message, but the Prophet surely knows the way to open hearts to God's word. In the light of faith they might see how can prepare for the conflict to come, and bring to bear their numbers for the sake of all the faithful." #NavyMongoose
MSH_the_great_struggle:0 "The Struggle Of The Sword"
MSH_the_great_struggle_desc:0 "The tribes are rallied, the warriors are prepared, and the faithful find solace in the protection of the Prophet's chosen ones. Who can hope to stand against the power of God? Indeed, the Great Struggle before us is set on a path, bloody and brutal, that will ultimately bring about true Peace under the rule of the Almighty." #NavyMongoose
MSH_from_timbucktu_with_love:0 "From Timbucktu With Love"
MSH_from_timbucktu_with_love_desc:0 "As the Prophet's decree spreads throughout the Great Lakes, we must call upon the faithful throughout the region to assist us. Macigena, sadly, is greatly lacking in modern infrastructure, but we know that in Timbucktu they are more well off, and more importantly there are believers there who can provide for us. If we send messengers they will surely aid us with arms and munitions." #NavyMongoose
MSH_maintain_jurisprudence:0 "There Shall Be Law"
MSH_maintain_jurisprudence_desc:0 "Prophet Almami must ready the faithful for the wars to come, so he cannot be distracted by the routine affairs of law. Thankfully, he has been training several zebras in the art of jurisprudence and interpretation, and over the years they have become quite skilled in determining the meaning and application of divine law. They shall do well in keeping order during the chaos of war." #NavyMongoose
MSH_support_the_zariqa:0 "The Zariqa Orders"
MSH_support_the_zariqa_desc:0 "Among the many societies that have developed among the believers, the Zariqa Order has become quite prominent. Well known for their mysticism, the Zariqa believe in the exaltation of God through the glorification of the bodies which he created for us. It would do us well to seek a closer rapport with them." #NavyMongoose
MSH_elevate_mareshi:0 "Raise The First House Of Worship"
MSH_elevate_mareshi_desc:0 "It is unfitting that the faithful be forced to worship God in cellars and amidst ruins. They must have a suitable house of worship, one whose very design and arrangement would glorify the Almighty and the empyrean in which he dwells. Here, in the city of Mareshi, we shall erect the first of many to come. Summon the craftszebras! The work must be done at once." #NavyMongoose
MSH_care_for_the_poor:0 "The Giving Of Zebkat"
MSH_care_for_the_poor_desc:0 "Among the teachings of the Prophet is one of the great pillars of belief: Zebkat, the giving of alms. In particular, there are many in our lands who have been displaced by strife and disorder across the region, and it would behoove us to see to their care. Within the bounds of our Community and protected by the warriors of the faithful, even the least among us can find comfort and peace." #NavyMongoose
MSH_the_principle_of_subsidiarity:0 "Agricultural Subsidiarity"
MSH_the_principle_of_subsidiarity_desc:0 "The farmers of Macigena make a hard-scrabble living amidst marginal conditions. By God's grace, however, we have many experts in agriculture among the faithful who are eager to serve the creatures of this land in whatever way they can. Surely their knowledge and wisdom can be put to use to improve the lives and livelihood of our hard-working planters." #NavyMongoose
MSH_the_first_step:0 "A Righteous Heathen, But Still A Heathen"
MSH_the_first_step_desc:0 "Near to us are the old lands of the Zar-Hay, ruled by their regent Zonni Zolon. We hear that he has brought order and peace within his realm, but he governs with the ruthlessness of a heathen. It is unjust for us to allow him to continue as such. If the true faith is to find root in the heart of the Great Lakes, Zolon must repent and submit to the word of the Prophet... or face the sword." #NavyMongoose
MSH_settle_the_tribes:0 "Settle The Clans"
MSH_settle_the_tribes_desc:0 "With our victory over Zar-Hay accomplished, we find ourselves in control of a more fertile and productive land, but one denuded of many of its inhabitants who died fighting against us. Some of the clans in our care grow restless from the anticipation of exploiting these new pastures. We can use this opportunity to resettle them and thus spread our influence there." #NavyMongoose
MSH_people_of_the_book:0 "The People Of The Book"
MSH_people_of_the_book_desc:0 "Among the peoples of Zar-Hay are some Re'emites, a tribe - no, a nation - of horses who maintain a strong tradition of written knowledge. Their understanding of the finer points of science is well known, but the Prophet is also aware of their fascinating theological views, one that closely resembles his own. This might be a chance to develop a deeper, more intimate relationship." #NavyMongoose
MSH_of_griots_and_the_zariqate:0 "Of Mystics and Scripture"
MSH_of_griots_and_the_zariqate_desc:0 "In the midst of our present trials, yet another has arisen in the form of a debate over the spiritual practices of our new subjects. The Griot mystics engage in deeply superstitious practices, supposing to appease spirits, yet despite this there is much good in it, as the Zariqa have shown in adapting such practices to worship the true God. It comes to the Prophet to decide on the right balance." #NavyMongoose
MSH_from_the_ashes:0 "Risen From The Ashes"
MSH_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "With the overthrow of Zar-Hay's heathen regime we can at last establish true justice as commanded by the Revealed Texts. Not only the judicial but also the economic system can be realized in a form closer to the ideal that the Prophet envisions. Let us not delay in giving the faithful the peace that is theirs by right, and have them see the wisdom of the Almighty in action." #NavyMongoose
MSH_brothers_under_gods_grace:0 "Unity And Brotherhood Under Gods' Grace"
MSH_brothers_under_gods_grace_desc:0 "As our leadership over the faithful continues to solidify and develop, we turn towards the pressing issue of persistent tribal loyalities and rivalries that might harm the Community. Are we not all brothers and sisters under God? The Prophet already has plans, and can instruct the Guides at the Houses of Worship on how to promote peace and unity within their herds." #NavyMongoose
MSH_the_center_of_an_empire:0 "The Heart Of God's Realm Upon The World"
MSH_the_center_of_an_empire_desc:0 "At long last, we have established a true state of the faithful in the heart of the Great Lakes. No longer are we merely tribeszebras at the edge of civilization but rather a real nation, a Community of believers bound together under God's mercy and God's law. This will be a nation unlike any other, one that acknowledges no king except God himself." #NavyMongoose

MSH_industry_2:0 "The Concept of Jaati" #Roughly equivalent to the Islamic conception of Public Property as per the Maliki school of judicial thought - All kinds of natural resources are state-owned, this includes minerals, water, and undeveloped land, basically the state acts as the guardian of these areas with the entire community having the right to use said areas within reason.

This focuses essentially establishes the laws for granting the Yerda which are fairly simple - Person granting it has to be an adult, must be sound of mind, not going bankrupt and must be capable of handling finances. The chief aspect of this focus is determining how the Yerda is treated within the context of the law which is either as local communal property or as national/state property.

MSH_purist_politics_2:0 "Codify The Principles Of The Zariqate" #Ochen setting up a proper system for anyone who wishes to create their own Zariqate as he can no longer act in both his duties as the Almami and the Custodian of the various Zariqate orders that have already begun to form. This is a very difficult concept to explain so to briefly explain it when it comes to Sufi orders the way that Tariqas are established is through a Guide (Murshid) forming a spiritual connection to Allah through the personage of Muhammed, he then transfers this spark of the divine to their students (Murid) through their teachings and actions. Ochen is doing the same, effectively eliminating his own role as the chief of all of the Zariqates and allowing for multiple orders to form. The Teachers in this new system are called Hierarchs and their students are called Seekers

### Events ###
maciegna.1.t:0 "Remembrance Of The Past"
maciegna.1.d:0 "Night rose up from the hazy horizon as Almami yearned for days past, for a simpler time of routines and companionship. He remembered those peaceful days ensconced in the bureaucracy of Ziani, content as he had been in a life of letters. Above all he thought of Aissata, and how she always smiled so sweetly: when they sat by the city fountain together, or took long walks outside the walls. He remembered how they had raised their children, and as one family shared all their joys.\n\nHe recalled how she had become afflicted by an illness of the lungs, and how she smiled as she lay in bed, holding his hoof, as she breathed her last.\n\nThen came the wilderness of isolation, and the collapse of the world. He journeyed a long way from the city; day and night ceased to have real meaning. He had wandered far into the desolation of mind, aimlessly searching for satisfaction, for an answer. The voices of the profane physical reality had become strangers to him, and so he turned away. He turned it all away and became a ghost along the lake shores.\n\nIt was then, five years hence, that he saw Truth. It was then that he heard His voice, the voice of the one true Divinity. Such wonders were revealed to him! Even now he remembered with vivid clarity the delirious aftermath of that revelation: his denunciation of the Manza and other tyrants, the following days of zeal and persecution and exile, that score of years spent preaching by the shores of the Great Lakes. From a mere bureaucrat he had rose up to become something more: a seer, a scholar, a Prophet.\n\nBut for now the zebra known as Almani Zekuris had stepped aside to nurture his longing, and remember the smile of his beloved." #NavyMongoose, with contribution by Argent Custodian, #TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)
maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
maciegna.2.d:0 "In the days before Almami had called for a gathering at this very spot at first light. As the growing embers of the day filtered through the crisp dark of night he could see them all - his followers, his Faithful - as in a great throng they strode towards him. On a hillock he sat, looking over the gathering crowd through the murky dim of the dawn, his most trusted advisors having already taken their places close to him. Then, as the first rays of the sun rose up through the vanishing black, he too arose and gazed upon his people, their eyes rapt with attention upon him.\n\n"Everyzebra who has ears, let them hear!" he began. "For too long false power has held sway in our lands. For too long has injustice and depravity ruled in this corner of Creation. Who can stand this? Who can behold such vice?" He paused, looking down at the crowd, seeing the building fervour in their faces. "Not we, my companions, my friends! You have through my testimony that the true Divinity looks unkindly upon such evils. Dare we not take up the task of cleansing this land, and purging it of darkness and desecration?" He lifted up his hoof, sweeping it around to point towards the great cities of the Lakes, far beyond in the distance. "Remember what we have left, what we escaped: a life of sin and death! Remember those creatures who call themselves lords and clerics, who pretend to hold dominion over the free peoples of the land. No, we can stand their pretensions no longer! The one God, merciful and glorious is He, demands satisfaction for their offences! I, therefore, as the messenger of the Most High, speak this: the Faithful must do the work of God, and destroy the evil works of the infidels, and give what they possess to the righteous!"\n\nAmong the Prophet's Faithful, the zeal could be held back no longer as they suddenly burst forth in cheers. One cry came out from their many voices: "God is great! God is great!"" #NavyMongoose, #TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past. 
maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy upon the pigs, for we shall have none!"

maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna.3.d:0 "Before the Prophet sat the three Tarkhans of clans Tatam, Diawadou, and Katoucha, and to his side sat his dear sister Safinata. Courtesies and pleasantries had been exchanged, and now, everyone sat awaiting his address. Around the small room, and throughout their assembly location, personal contingents of bodyguards were patrolling and watching, ready for any of the many dangers that could strike. This was, after all, the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Prophet exhaled through his nostrils, for indeed this was the nature of these lands. "God’s message is good...God’s message is kind...but the enemies we must now face are, sadly, not. There will be another war once again in our homeland – another bloody and brutal war – all because the evils of this world want it to happen. If there was another way, I would wholeheartedly accept it and rejoice in His name, but it is by the nature of sin that God’s message is sought to be manipulated against us, His stewards."\n\nThe Prophet shared a glance with Safinata before looking to each of the Tarkhans. "Our clan plans to soon bring war against these leaders, but unlike the wars of the past, we shall fight in the name of God, for the will of His message and its deliverance upon us today and Macigena’s future beyond us. I have gathered all of you here to ask for the help of each of your clans, though if any shall decline, I understand."\n\nThe three Tarkhans now exchanged contemplative looks as the Prophet finished his words. Safinata reached over and placed a firm hoof on his to give reassurance, but not a moment more had passed before the three Tarkhans slowly stood. All of them held their gazes with his, and one by one, they answered." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
maciegna.3.a:0 "God wills it."

maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
maciegna.4.d:0 ""My sister has told me that you are dating now." Almami’s smile grew wider at the immediate outtake of sputtering tea and coughs from Zulaihat, all the while gracefully sipping his own. "And please do not attempt to dodge the topic, let us remain on this, for it is one that matters a lot to me." His smile was saintly, even as she went beet red and murmured that auntie Safinata needed to mind her own business. He chuckled at his daughter’s embarrassment and savored the atmosphere around them.\n\nShared moments such as these, calm and relaxing, were becoming further apart. Here, in his daughter’s modest little home, sharing their mutual favorite tea, he could pause his duties as Prophet and go back to just being a father... or at least attempt to. Zulaihat and her brother Ochen had to take care of their lives without him after Aissata’s death. He always regretted his period of self-estrangement, but with conflict approaching, it continued to bother him further. Zulaihat must have noticed it, for she reached out to place a hoof on his.\n\n"You seem deep in thought father, what is the matter? Are you thinking on your self-estranging again?" Almami merely sipped his tea and glanced out the room’s window. "We’ve been over this," Zulaihat told him. "You were in an awful state after mother’s death, so you did the most practical thing and had Auntie Safinata and our clan look after me and Ochen."\n\n"Perhaps so," Almami conceded the point. "Yet I have regrets all the same. We will march to war soon, and I have already had a lifetime of regrets to fill up. I ask of your love life because I do not wish to miss any more than I already have, now, or in the future. Whatever comes, I pray that I will be allowed to sit with you after all this." " #Ardent Custodian and badass revision from Sweet Chrysalis, and edited by Cunard
maciegna.4.a:0 ""As do I, father.""

maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
maciegna.5.d:0 "The amphitheater in Sorgo was alight with movement and filled with tunes, and among the many spectators, the Prophet watched in quiet awe. In the center performed his son, Ochen, who had donned the traditional garbs of a Griot of the Great Lakes, and around him sprang the zebras of the Zariqa Order. All around they moved with rehearsed finesse and guile as traditional Griot instruments rang out to the crowd. The performance itself was an interpretation of the ceremonies of the Griot, though accentuated with channeling of spirits to prove one’s mastery of their own self and continuous, frenzied exaltations of God.\n\nIn amusement, Almami wondered if the divine revelation God had given him would’ve been much easier on his body if he had known how to apply the techniques that his son displayed.\n\nAll around he could see the audience captivated by the procession. Not one zebra, foal or grown, dared to take their eyes off of the rapid movements and gestures seemingly reaching into the air and drawing them inwards. They were enthralled, they were uplifted, and, above all else, they had faith.\n\nThe Prophet himself was impressed. Ochen had used his oratory skills and musical arts to create something so profound and beautiful that it embraced all who heard it. Faith was being conveyed through its public display, and in these times of strenuous hardships, access to faith was perhaps the greatest need of all." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in His image, it is only proper to exalt His creation."

maciegna.6.t:0 "The Death Of A Heathen"
maciegna.6.d:0 "The sky above Zao was skewered by a long blacken trail of smoke billowing from the massive pyre outside the city, and, despite being so far out, the putrid odour of burning flesh fell upon the populace regardless, and all but the Macigenan forces, washing the bloodied streets, retreated into their homes in an attempt to escape the acrid stench.\n\nAlmami stoically observed as more and more corpses were added to the flames, all belonging to members of the city's garrison. It was a grim task that had to be done, but that was not what had brought the Prophet here; the dead body of Zar-Hay’s former leader, Zonni, was sprawled before him. Judging by what remained, it was evident that Zonni had died fighting.\n\n"The body should burn like the rest," the general who had recovered the body spoke, "the zebras here will make a martyr of the heathen otherwise."\n\nAlmami’s hooves dug into the ground as he controlled his inner convictions. "Prepare a proper burial mound and lay him when readied." The general, taken aback, had showed the faintest of confusion, but the Prophet continued. "Zonni righteously led as best as he believed, even if he was grossly misguided by sin and turned heathen in the end; we of God and His message ought to acknowledge that."\n\n"He wouldn’t have done the same for you, nor for any of us."\n\n"Indeed," Almami said, "but we are not him - we are not heathens."" #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
maciegna.6.a:0 "Memento mori."

maciegna.7.t:0 "Of Mystics And Scripture"
maciegna.7.d:0 "A slight pain thrummed at the sides of Almami’s head as he continued listening to both his fervent son and resolute daughter argue on. The sun had barely began to rise before the two of them had approached him with urgency, but now with midday having finally arrived, the Prophet’s morning plans were being crammed into his afternoon schedule, and perhaps also his evening ones. Still, the matter brought before him was nonetheless important, but it was evident that the zebra had to mediate between his two children.\n\n"Those Mystics in Zao are heathens, brother!" Zulaihat said, referring to the local priests who were known as Wind-Singers. "The Revealed Texts even say so!"\n\n"They do not whatsoever, Zulaihat!" Raising up both forehooves, Ochen stomped the ground in anger. "If so, you are insinuating me as a heathen as well!"\n\nZulaihat huffed and bore into her brother. "Your Zariqate Order spreads God’s message to everyzebra, whereas those Mystics spread lies with their twisted practices. If that doesn’t sound heretical, Ochen, then I urge you to reread the Revealed Texts; they are heathens and should be punished as such!"\n\n"Lashings for methods that have managed to sway zebras for generations?! If we integrated them into the Zariqate, their ways can be readapted to better spread God’s message in areas where our own means have fallen short. What benefits do you fail to see here?"\n\n"God’s message is good, therefore His teachings are too, so there can be no "benefit" gained in warping His ways! Those practices are as poisonous as the sinful corruption that filled Zar-Hay, if not its source!"\n\nAlmami at last raised a hoof, and his children lapsed into silence. The Prophet had decided, the verdict establishing precedence henceforth." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
maciegna.7.a:0 ""God is merciful, and He works in many ways.""
maciegna.7.b:0 ""God is just, and no action is above His judgment, even if unintended.""

maciegna.8.t:0 "The Custodianship"
maciegna.8.d:0 "As he had done many moons ago, Almani Zekuris, Prophet of God, stood before a crowd, ready to impart upon them his wisdom and judgement. Unlike in the past, however, he stood not only before his fellow believers but also the newly subjugated peoples of Zao, the great city of Zar-Hay, once a bastion of heathen kings and warlords. Today, the Zar-Hayans were subjects, but soon, Almani hoped, they would become his brothers and sisters in faith.\n\n"He who has ears, let him hear!" he began. "What we have begun in this place will not be finished here, for the great work will only be done once every land beneath the sun knows the truth of God's Law. Look around you, people of Zao! The ones who ruled here are no aberration, but partook of the sin and vice that infects all the Great Lakes. Mighty monarchs and cruel warlords lay heavy burdens on their people, taking much and leaving little for them to make a living. Can anyone who is just stand for this? Can the people of faith turn aside as wickedness and avarice keep dominion over those whose hearts yearn for justice? It cannot be so, and it shall be not so, for I, the Prophet of the most high God, will send forth the warriors of the faithful and strike them all down!"\n\nAt once, the people began to cheer, the awful power of repression and tyranny having at last been dissolved of their final bondage upon their souls. Then, one from among them strode forth and approached the Prophet, a zebra resplendent in her warrior's garb. It was Issa, his close friend, and on her back she bore an object wrapped in fine linen that she set before his feet. Gingerly she unwrapped it to reveal a great artifact: the crown of Zar-Hay. "O great Prophet," she said. "Will you take up the office you have earned?"\n\nThe Prophet gazed upon the crown sternly. Then, with a great sweep of his hoof, he thrust the crown from the podium, its golden fittings and jewels clattering upon the ground like foals' toys. "There is no king except God!" he declared. "Let the unbelievers have their tyrants. We shall be governed by a Custodianship of the faithful!"" #NavyMongoose, The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Issa and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm.

maciegna.9.t:0 "Dereliction Of Duty" #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
maciegna.9.d_1:0 "A metallic crash was met with rifles as the Aorandan stronghold made its last stand against the Custodian forces pouring into the smashed gateway. All it took were a few brutal minutes for the holdout defenses to collapse and retreat further inwards away from the breach, paving way for the Custodianship’s commander, Safinata Zekuris – sister of the Prophet, to enter safely. She treaded over the blood and bodies of fallen enemy and ally undeterred, passing by the bullet-riddled truck wreckage that had been their battle ram, and advanced further into the falling stronghold with her vanguards.\n\nBy the next day, the Aorandan Republic’s flag atop the stronghold had been replaced with the colors of Macigena’s, and all outside now bore witness to the horrific ends to the Custodianship’s enemies – bodies, hung by the necks, hugged the outside walls of the stronghold, many still dripping from open wounds. The heads were mercifully obstructed by burlap sacks, but the hurdling stench of the lofted corpses searing beneath the sun suffocated the air all over. Inside the compound, should a zebra dare approach, fared an even worse sight of the defeated and their leaders.\n\nSafinata cast one last look at the grim hoofwork and motioned for the vanguard to depart with her. Nothing remained in this obliterated hold but a warning to the region's worshippers of false idols." 
maciegna.9.d_2:0 "The gates of the Aorandan stronghold swung open for Sanusi Katoucha, a Grand Mule of Macigena and commander of the Custodian forces now controlling the compound. Ochen Zekuris, son of the Prophet, had specifically urged the Custodians seize the remnants of the Aorandan Republic here with efficiency and the least casualties possible, so that is what Sanusi had them do. A week prior, their scouts entered into the stronghold disguised as recruits, and within the span of four days, the Custodian force had fully infiltrated the ranks, familiarized themselves with every passageway, and stockpiled hidden weapons caches all throughout.\n\nAll it took was a single order the night before and the new day dawned upon a fallen stronghold.\n\nSanusi entered into the courtyard and beheld the captured enemy - rows of hogtied zebras clustered everywhere under the guard of watchful Custodians. In total, the remnant forces had only suffered five deaths; the rest were now POWs. All that remained for the Custodian forces was to wait for the trucks to arrive to transport the POWs to Zao to stand trial and finish emptying out the stronghold. God willing, other resistance-affiliated zebras in the region would investigate the place, so that they could be trailed to their hideouts, providing the Custodians another location to infiltrate all over again." 
maciegna.9.d_3:0 "Issa silently prayed that her plan would work. The families of the Aorandan Republic's remnants had been dispatched into the stronghold a mere ten minutes ago, but each ticking moment felt like an eternity. The enemy stronghold was surrounded by her Custodian force on all sides and ready to assault on her order. There was no doubt that they would succeed in the attack, but the victory would come at a bloody cost. Thus, in an effort to avoid paying its price, Issa had gathered the families of the enemy and sent them in to plea for their loved ones to surrender. It was a double-edged plan though, as now the stronghold harbored innocents within its walls, and should the remnants refuse, Issa knew very well that they would unintentionally be caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe leader of the stronghold knew this too, apparently, as the front gates were opened and the commander himself trotted out before the surrounding Custodian forces. Issa stepped forth, and the two met in the dawn’s light.\n\nThe commander’s tone was one of defeat. “Why did you bring them here?”\n\n“Surrender, and every zebra will be spared; refuse, and your families will bear witness to the death of their loved ones,” Issa stated. “We will not harm them if you choose the latter, but I don’t believe they’ll willingly keep their distance from the crossfire when the battle begins.”\n\nThe ultimatum and consequences were laid bare. The commander handed over his weapon, and no sooner had Issa taken it, a zebra foal ran out from the stronghold’s gates and clung to the commander’s hind leg. Relieved, Issa returned to her Custodian officers and gave the order to enter and detain. No zebra would be dying here today."

maciegna.10.d_1:0 "#TODO - The Prophet delivering a sermon and or fatwa in the newly conquered city of Kamarala (Former capital of Ugabi), in this case due to the player's Legalist focus, the Prophet is giving a very much fire and brimstone speech on the arrogance of the Nnabakyalas (Title of Ugabi's rulers) for claiming that they alone had a monopoly upon God's grace and calls upon the people of Ugabi to spit upon a statue of the deceased Nnabakyala Mukisa (Who was executed after the conquest of Ugabi). Most are reluctant, but the Prophet nevertheless manages to whip up enough people into a frenzy to make his point clear." 
maciegna.10.d_2:0 "#TODO - The Prophet delivering a sermon and or fatwa in the newly conquered city of Kamarala (Former capital of Ugabi), in this case due to the player's Purist focus, the Prophet is giving a much more subdued speech in this situation, calling out the arrogance of the Nnabakyalas for claiming themselves the link between God and mortals. Unlike the Legalist speech this is more him explaining that the Ugabians do not need the Clergy nor any Kings to dictate to them their piety, for they are all made in God's image and it is only their personal piety that matters. This is by far more effective than either the Legalist or Reformist approach."

If it helps, though, I know that pacing one’s breaths is a very practical method for easing one’s nerves.” The two chieftains slowly released all pretenses of calm and gracefully took to his advice. Ochen let about a minute pass before he resumed speaking.\n\n“As I said, you needn’t worry about those in your tribes. The Custodianship has examined your past dealings with Gulu and the actions taken since. Despite not believing in God, you have acted righteously and fulfilled His message, thus your beliefs and worshippers have been deemed tolerable by the Custodianship. We will be establishing a small, but manageable, tax for worshippers who do not wish to convert to the Community, but I can assure you that those earnings will be financed towards reconstruction in the region. Definitely not the worst thing to happen, right?”\n\nBoth Ekikunta and Okusaba nodded in agreement.

maciegna.12.d_1:0 "Ale Kijambiya quietly did his best to conceal his seething anger amidst the crowd of zebras, consciously straying away from Custodianship patrols throughout the trade post. Just days ago, he had been a commander of what he once thought was the strongest and most dependable army in all of the Great Lakes, but rather than bravely hold out against the fanatic forces of the Custodianship, his ranks collapsed like dying slaves.\n\n‘Worse,’ he thought as he shied away from another patrol, ‘At least dying slaves just collapse and don't sell you out!’ Kijambiya’s mind raced back to the names and faces of his former lieutenants, the ones who betrayed him and turned his mighty force into pathetic shambles. How he wished he could personally execute them with his own bare hooves right now, instead of seeking an escape route to Klugetown.\n\nThe ex-warlord stopped and scanned the waiting caravans and airship pilots nearby. There had to be at least one zebra he could cut a deal with, preferably one that wouldn’t immediately sell him out and-\n\nSomething hard struck the back of his head, causing him to slump to the ground as his vision faded away. Desperately, he tried to fight whatever was happening, but, dazed and numbly feeling his skin scrape against the ground, all his attempts were in vain. The dragging of the ex-warlord’s body away from the trade post ended with a stumbling crash of vertigo, and the ex-warlord’s vision finally returned in time to see a Custodianship patrol lining up with muzzles aimed.\n\nThe rifles opened fire."

Those on the other side of the door were the last of her one-hundred bodyguards, and the battered Custodianship soldiers pouring through the doorway all but indicated that it was over for her. With a sigh, the old Mazwi commander and surveyor of Aoranda rose from her seat and gracefully approached her enemies securing the room, taking the littlest of satisfaction at the apprehension in each solders’ stance caused by her presence.\n\n“So be it then,” Nyiragonez said, “Please take me to your commander so that I may properly surrender.”\n\nTwo zebras hesitantly moved to secure her and she was soon led out into the bloodied corridors littered with corpses and cartridges, passing several of the Custodianship’s units moving throughout the building. The sight of it all would have been more shocking if it hadn’t been what she had expected from a typical clash of forces. Eventually, she was brought out to who she assumed was the commanding officer of the attack and properly gave herself up. “If I may ask, what shall happen now?”\n\n“Imprisonment until trial,” the commander said, “Same as with any other puppet of Mazwi. Beyond that? We shall see.” Nyiragonez nodded before being escorted away."

Lying before them were the bullet-riddled bodies of President Uwineza Mbonyu and her second-in-command, Nehle Zuri, slumped in dried pools of blood. Even from just a first glance, it was more than evident that this wasn’t some last stand that they had made; they had been executed.\n\n“My Prophet,” an approaching comms officer greeted and bowed, “We have received confirmation that the nation’s treasury had been looted before we arrived. Surviving workers at the location say the warlords pretended to be under orders from the President to secure the coffers, but forced them at gunpoint before anyzebra could confirm anything.”\n\nAlmami regarded the bodies again. “Instruct our generals to immediately search for those warlords in the region and beyond.

Fortifications and contingencies could only do so much against the superior tactics and terrifying zeal of the purported Army of the Righteous. Given the intensity of every day and night as both sides battled to gain and regain ground through the city, it came to no surprise that the average Ugabian soldiers began to lay down their weapons and surrender.\n\nYet the Spirit Warriors refused to yield, and here and now in the battered palace grounds of the Nnabakyala, they would fulfill their sworn duty. Kill zones and traps were laid everywhere, all weapons were steadied, and every Warrior silently awaited their fate. Some allowed their tears to flow while others struggled to suppress the instinct to run, but all of them braced their hooves against the ground, and when the Army of the Righteous at last converged and assaulted the palace, the Spirit Warriors unleashed their final war cry.\n\nThe palace fell within days, and no zebra of the royal line nor of the Spirit Warriors would evermore leave its tomb."

They had finally forced enough defenders from the walls to enable enough time to create a breach, and now the Army would face the surmounting challenge of urban warfare – surmounting, but not impossible. They would take Kamarela. They were ready.\n\nWhat they weren’t ready for was to see Amanyi and the Spirit Warriors waiting patiently for their arrival instead of repelling their attack. So caught off guard, the surging Army of the Righteous' front skidded to a halt and caused a clamor of zebras crashing into each other from behind. Confusion began to arise from the attackers, but the general managed to push through to the front of clustered fighters to see what was happening. The two opposing forces stared each other down, and Amanyi himself looked the general in the eyes.\n\nAmanyi stepped into the wide empty space between the two and silently began to remove his ornate cloaks and attire. After staring for a while in disbelief, the general finally approached Amanyi just as the legendary Pearl Sword was drawn and laid upon the elegantly discarded pile of clothes.\n\n“I hereby give myself and all of Kamarela to the Army of the Righteous,” Amanyi announced. “I only ask that my subjects and this beautiful city be spared.” Behind the surrendering zebra, all of the Spirit Warriors began to lay down their weapons in the same manner.

From what a few of her “land tenants” – destitute zebras and their families she permitted to live on her homestead in exchange for them taking care of it – had informed her, these newcomers were agents of the Prophet who had just taken over. The industrial magnate was apprehensive – she was aware of the viciousness they dealt towards former officials of capitulated governments, but she had also heard rumors of kind treatment generously dolled out to the subjugated populaces. Hearsay aside, she could only levy annoyance towards them – the whole ordeal throughout the region had put a considerable hamper on her businesses.\n\n“May I help you?” \n\n“Sheebah Nakiyemba,” the lead agent greeted courteously, “our Prophet wishes to extend an invitation to join his government, as your economic expertise would be greatly beneficial, in terms of both financial gains and helping the common zebra.” He nodded to one of the agents, who retrieved a closed letter from a bag. “The terms and conditions of your employment are defined, but negotiable. Should this offer be of interest, there is a date, time, and location enclosed on the back of the letter. Regardless, the Prophet thanks you for being so considerate of the poor in your business practices. We look forward to your response. Good day, ma’am.”\n\nSheebah watched them politely bow and depart before looking at the invitation placed before her hooves. Picking up the sealed letter, she would have to look over the details enclosed carefully before deciding.

It is only just to wash it away with my own.”\n\n“The Prophet wishes to provide you with an alternative means for redemption,” Issa said. “Your experience with armored vehicles would be invaluable for the services of our military.\n\n“When I said your reputation preceded you, it wasn’t because of your status as an officer – it was because of the decency you’ve managed to keep when all others happily threw it away. That is why I am here, and that is what makes you worthy of redemption. So, I personally ask you again, as a fellow zebra trying to make this world a better place for others, to accept the Prophet’s offer, lest the Great Lakes lose another innocent soul.”\n\nThe zebra finally rose. “But...I'm not innocent.”\n\n“Neither am I.”"

These officials are achieved scholars in their fields and in their faith, and they shall answer only to the Community, God, and law. They shall not answer to money or reputation like the aristocracies of old, and full cooperation with them will result in a return to proper order and simpler integration into the Custodianship as a whole.”\n\nGlancing around the chamber, Zulaihat offered a silent prayer and braced herself. “I trust each of you have brought documentation of your city’s administrative organizations and laws as requested?” The zebras who had presented folders and briefcases of legal paperwork to offer their assigned professional cadres.

Attempts to integrate these zebras had been more than difficult, though when it became clear that they would continue to insidiously scramble for authority and power by whatever means necessary, Zulaihat easily turned to the law for the only right solution. All that remained was for her father to give word for their executions.\n\n“They are nothing but manipulative liars,” she said and passed the list to the Prophet. “They pretended to accept God’s message and righteousness while planning in secret to undermine His laws and restore the sinful institute of slavery. They are unrepentant and persist in criminality; God’s laws are clear on what sentence they must receive.”\n\nHer father accepted her reasoning with a sip of his tea. "

If they don’t, we can simply arrest them in the same manner – quietly and without notice.”\n\nIt was the least disruptive method Ochen and Sanusi could think of that would avoid stirring much resistance and still render God’s judgment.\n\n“See it done,” the Prophet said, “I have faith in you, my son.”"

Not every zebra listed was equal in terms of the severity of atrocities committed, despite her past crying out for blind righteous vengeance against all of them. The line between justice and retaliation was a blurry one, but she thanked God for her ability to distinguish between the two.\n\n“All of them are guilty of crimes, especially the slavers, and I would see all of them arrested,” Issa said. “As for what should be done with them, they should stand justice like any other zebra – fair and unbiased as possible in a court of law.

She was enjoying herself, truthfully, though perhaps not to the degree other zebras would consider as normal.\n\nHer friend – the Prophet – was definitely having a good time.

Safinata Zekuris - sister of the Prophet – was preceded by her stringent reputation for her staunch beliefs in God’s laws and explicit actions against heathens who refused to adhere. Her hoofwork was well known, and it all added to the impending aura that seemed to permeate the room.\n\n“The Prophet’s work must be done for the glory of God’s message throughout the Great Lakes,” Safinata said and placed a hoof on the table. “This will undoubtedly bring forth more conflicts, but if you align your tribes with us, I can promise all who fight will be gloriously rewarded with God. A heavy decision, as my brother would say, but given everything that has happened around here, God’s will for the Great Lakes is nigh.”\n\nEager to partake in something greater, the tribe leaders agreed."

Aside from obscure repute, there was little known about Sanusi save for his penchant for secrecy and involvement in seemingly everything conducted in the shadowy corners of the Great Lakes. What they did know was that the zebra held a position of sway and – if being truthful with themselves – was slightly unnerving.\n\n“Everything about the Great Lakes is definitely changing,” Sanusi said with a little too much smoothness for their comfort, “And as any zebra knows, it’s always best to be on the winning side. A guaranteed commitment to our side – to this image of faith – and it can easily be arranged for your tribes to conveniently have positions of influence and wealth. No zebra could fault your pragmatism, but an opportunity missed is, well, an opportunity missed, right?"\n\nSeeing the opportunity indeed, the tribe leaders agreed."

The least they could do was listen to her proposal.\n\n“It is obvious the Prophet is bringing about God’s message throughout the Great Lakes,” Issa said, “And what shall come with it will be Salvation for all in fertile lands and peace. No zebra, no matter how misfortunate or downtrodden, will be treated any less than any other, and the future promised will be for all.

As per his instructions, this city, and its neighbors in the region, had been completely spared of looting and ransacking, and the intact structures and amicable behavior of the populace proved it. Just as Almami wanted, all of it had been spared from the worst; even the makeshift town hall they were approaching had been preserved.\n\nThe Prophet’s arrival was welcomed kindly by none other than Agil Agamal, and the two soon began chatting as if they were old friends. The “negotiation” swayed back and forth between discussing the state of the region’s affairs and colloquial pleasantries regarding what had changed since the Prophet had last studied in Timbucktu, though the discussion eventually achieved its objective of reaching an agreement.\n\n“The Custodianship shall grant you authority over all of Timbucktu’s educational facilities,” Almami said as he passed the official papers, “which shall in no way supersede that of the former nor be used for treason, though you shall be acknowledged and included in all matters regarded on their premises.”\n\n“Of course,” Agamal looked over the conditions with a smile. “No need for us to busy our institutions elsewhere when there’s plenty to handle here.

Slinging her rifle, Issa drew her own sword and charged.\n\nThe two zebras clashed in the middle of the street, trading blows and parrying attacks underneath the sweltering sunlight. The King’s skill was refined, but Issa’s muscles bore enough strength to match, and soon she found herself weathering through his strikes and pressing her advantage. It soon became evident as to who was to win this duel.\n\nUndeterred, King Euzegoar let out a war cry with his valiant attacks, desperately lunging at an opening in Issa’s stance – one that his defiant self realized all too late was a feint.\n\nHer blade moved swiftly and cut through the King’s neck. The royal zebra’s body slumped to the ground, his hooves clutching at the cut now gushing red, and, whether stoic or unable to speak, Euzegoar wordlessly faded from life.\n\nWhen the battle at last concluded, Issa and her soldiers stood victorious, but not before she had ordered the King’s body be given an honorable funeral in accordance with the kingdom’s traditions. Despite his misdeeds, he had tried to lead his subjects and his kingdom as best as he knew how, and thus he died doing what he thought was right."

Though disjointed resistance efforts continued in the hillsides, many commanders and their fellow soldiers were surrendering. Undoubtedly, it was a blessing, though Issa suspected that this was likely to happen after Mazwi fell. Many were victims of the Great Lakes’ slave system just like her, and the ranks were filled with either conscripts or zebras born as Sofas just as she was once – slaves bred for nothing but war. The zebra commander now before her was one such slave, which made the whole scenario rather odd.\n\n“General Kelece,” she greeted and invited him to sit, “Surrendering was the last thing I expected from you, given your history with the Storm King.”\n\nThe uniformed zebra remained rigid. “The Custodianship may have routed my forces, but I won’t have the fine Mazwians subordinate to me perish in a last stand. They very much deserve to return home, and I thank you for sparing them. Your nation’s handling of enemies is well known to us.”\n\n“Of course,” Issa said and sat behind the desk provided for her, “Though I thank you for not issuing that order. There is more good in living than in dying for wars.”\n\n“Yet you waged war against us - your own birthplace.”\n\nThe room fell silent between the two Sofa-borns’ unwavering stares, but Issa wasn’t about to allow it to derail her. “The Custodianship fights for God, and if not for Him, then for the betterment of all zebras of the the Great Lakes, now and in the future. We both have endured far too much injustice in our homelands, and the Custodianship is clearing away the wrongs of the past to make things right - no more slavery, no more corruption, and no more wars. Our side fights for justice for all, including Mazwi, and to accomplish this, please, I ask for your help.”\nThe acclaimed veteran regarded her quietly as she waited for his response.\n\nGeneral Kelece sat down, his expression stoic all throughout."

maciegna.29.d:0 "Buckure was finally under control. A few arduous days of fighting was all it took for Safinata to topple the region’s institutions, eliminate Mazwi remnants, and liberate all the zebras enslaved. They only needed to deal with the many captured Province-Masters and bureaucrats – the very ones who were in charge of those wretched mines they had found – but Safinata saw to it that they wouldn’t just be callously killed on the spot.\n\nMany, which she had convicted through impromptu trials, were sentenced with public flogging, while others received harsher punishments. Everything was proceeding smoothly until, at last, the root of all this was dragged before her – the self-proclaimed “Golden Bug”, Legranx. The changeling offered her a smile and claimed repentance, but when none were swayed, he tried to bargain and soon, he was desperately begging for his life in any way he could muster. Unstirred, Safinata was lost in thought over how they would execute the Golden Bug. Finally, an idea came to her.\n\nLegranx was dragged out to a nearby forge in chains. He cursed vilely and thrashed furiously against his metal bindings, but his words quickly fell into frantic desperation as a large glowing ladle was ferried over containing nothing but his melted gold. A single gesture was all it took, and the ladle careened over the shrieking changeling.\n\nThe molten gold seared down Legranx’s skin, the crisp crackles of burning eyes and flesh melding with the changeling’s screams gurgling as the glowing liquid leaked into his mouth. Bound limbs violently morphed and thrashed until the gold scorched enough of the changeling to finally end him, but the ladle continued to pour over the corpse. Soon what remained of Legranx was but a gold rendering on the floor, protruded with whatever was left of the burnt limbs and body that had finally stopped twitching.\n\nSafinata allowed herself to smile amidst the whiffs of the charred changeling."

Sometime between all of her duties of ensuring order and law throughout the Great Lakes, Zulaihat had requested for the Custodianship’s best Guides and lawmakers to write up a functional bureaucratic system that would adhere to, and derive from, God and His Revealed Texts, and now before her was the surmounting result – three massive stacks of paper that codified the legalities of Jurisprudence and how they would all be upheld.\n\nShe had just finished signing off on the first stack, and it was already well into the evening.\n\nZulaihat rose from the desk and went for tea before beginning to examine the next stack.

The son of the Prophet had finally reached an understanding, and all the flaws that came with it.\n\n“If we were to copy Equestria, we would be copying many of its shortcomings,” Ochen said. “All which would only be exacerbated by the contentions in the Great Lakes. You do realize that, right?”\n\n“Well yes,” Zanga Senghore said, “but if those were no more, then Equestria’s model of governance would surely be the best fit for all zebras.”\n\n“Its principles, perhaps, but I’m pretty sure Equestria’s success relied on specific factors that are just not present in our region, and I don't think we could fully copy them successfully with our circumstances.” Ochen let the fact settle among them before continuing. “What we can do, however, is build a better form of government that would succeed in the Great Lakes where Equestria’s would fail, yes?”\n\nThe Zebritude members, although agreeing with his argument, proceeded to delve into the principles that would have to be maintained.

"N-no, great Prophet, it’s just-no, nothing of matter, forgive me."\n\n"Very well then," the Prophet said. Letting out a groan, he lifted his frame up from the ground. The sand caught in his clothes would be a hassle to remove, but that could be done later, and preferably in some shade. "God gave us light, indeed, but I can’t help but wonder if He gave us a little too much."\n\nA few of the clan zebras broke out in coughs to suppress their amusement, which earned a smile from the Prophet.\n\n"If we may, shall we enter inside to discuss matters? The waterskins we brought taste much better in shade."\n\n"Waterskins? F-for us, great Prophet?"\n\n"Yes, I think we brought enough for every zebra - forgive my memory, your clan has thirty members, right?"\n\nThe astounded clan leader of exactly thirty zebras opted to calmly lead the Prophet into his home." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard

Almami chuckled, "Whatever have you done?"\n\n"I chose to believe," Ochen said, "Why must my belief in God’s message lead to struggling against the world?"\n\nAlmami fell quiet and turned to ponder at empty space. Why does God’s will, eternally benevolent and good for all, face so much adversity? If His message is by Him and of Him, why must it inherently struggle against the world? Were they destined into a ceaseless cycle of struggle? The more these questions danced around Almami’s head, the more it began to hurt.\n\n"Father?"\n\n"This place, this region, is of sin."

The driver worked the wheel and avoided running over another patch of jagged rocks, only for the suspension to buckle from a surprise pothole. The sleek items in the back clamored some more.\n\n"I think you just un-zeroed every one of those things."\n\n"God, damn this road."\n\n"Be right back." Asante unbuckled his seatbelt and hauled himself over the back and onto the flatbed. Pushing past the other crates, the zebra knelt down and began scooping up the cargo. Another rupture jolted the vehicle and forced Asante’s hooves to seize the open container before it spilled again, but the lurch still caused a few crates to smack his sides. Ow.\n\nAsante resumed putting the rifles back into their box. These were the weapons for the great Prophet and his Community – God’s Community. By association and belief, Asante was part of this Community too; all of them throughout the clandestine trail of caravan trucks were. They of God’s Community in Timbucktu were more than willing to provide the means for self-defense against the very evils that plague their fellow brothers and sisters in Mareshi – the very same evils that had forced them onto this forsaken path through the desert.\n\n"Less chances of getting raided out here."\n\nAsante smiled and managed to reseal the container before yet another bump threw the vehicle upward and slammed everything back down hard. The vehicle trailing them buckled in the same manner. From his view, Asante could see the occupants of said vehicle behind start to lividly shout, scramble, and slam their hooves against the dashboard.

Agame and his family had been lucky to escape as the village was set ablaze and its residents kidnapped or massacred, and like many other zebras who had fallen victim to this cruel normalcy, they had been forced to roam across the threat-ravaged lands of the Great Lakes festered with marauding bandits, combat zones, vicious warlords, famine, and death.\n\nSo much death.\n\nAgame leaned back against the mud bricks that served as one of their hut’s walls, pressing his shaking coat against its warm surface. Everything was different now. The now ruling government of Macigena had instituted Zebkat – a social program run by the donations of God’s worshippers – and saw that these funds were used to provide for wandering destitutes such as them. \n\nThrough these Zebkat donations, Macigena’s landscape now beheld clusters of walled-off communities crammed with makeshift mud brick huts and guarded by the military. Occupants of these homes were given the tiniest of stipends and rations, and it wasn’t uncommon for a single-family home to host five or more families, but Agame and his wife had no complaints, nor would they allow any from their twin foals.\n\nThey had food, water, shelter, and protection – and every night before cramming into their corner for sleep, Agame’s family and the two other families living with them would gather in the center of the shack and pray for their blessings.

Initially, little was said on the farmer’s end, aside from some general explanations of the area, but when the topic of farming itself came up, the farmer's tone with the visitor – who he learned was a scholar in agricultural studies - became much livelier. The two of them began speak on the types of crops present and planting methods, and soon the farmer found himself detailing the entire process, to which the scholar responded with genuine questions. The scholar even listened to the farmer’s complaints over the area’s lack of general irrigation due to nearby situations.\n\nA few days later, the scholar returned, brimming with more questions and specific solutions he wanted input on, and rather than just one farmer answering, the others were drawn in to offer their comments on developing the village’s farms.\n\nA week after, the scholar returned with means to help apply their collaborated solutions, even showing all his legal paperwork, and from then on, the scholar oversaw the area's subsidized farmlands, always open to feedback and suggestions from its inhabitants.\n\nEventually, the scholar would ask if he could purchase a hut in the village to live in, but the village of farmers simply gifted him one for free.

Every muscle of hers wanted to turn away and race off to somewhere she could galivant freely, surviving off nothing but her mettle, but years of experience throughout the conflicted Great Lakes grounded her whims, and Imani reluctantly approached the zebra coming out to meet her – a Griot, judging by the way he dressed.\n\n"Thank God you made it, I was beginning to worry when you didn't arrive with the others," he said and bowed in greeting. "My name is Okoro, I’m one of the advisors of this village. Your journey must’ve been long, here." He offered a waterskin from his satchel.

The Re’emite enclave have historically endured and integrated through many, if not almost all, regime changes throughout the Great Lakes. How the Re’emites had survived for so long was not determined by which faction was supported; it had been determined by how much tribute they offered to the next overlord after.

Even those who sought retribution against the enclave could easily be swayed by the amount of wealth and a guaranteed source for homage, both of which were extremely hard to find throughout the Great Lakes. Even if this Prophet was far kinder and respectful than those before, he was only another zebra taking charge of them.\n\nThat was until he refused to accept their tribute with a smile and a wave of his hoof.\n\n"There is no need," the Prophet said. "I am far more interested in your philosophies and theological interpretations of God which your enclave has managed to preserve throughout history."\n\nThat was what brought them to the evening dusk now, and the representatives talked animatedly about their monotheistic beliefs as the Prophet spoke respectfully and drank his tea.

Issa watched Safinata casually move away before addressing the two culprits. “Which of you two started it?”\n\n“He did,” they both said in unison. Issa raised her eyebrow between them before one spoke. “You slanderous bastard!”\n\n“Says the sand munching—!” An audible whack silenced the zebra before he could finish and slumped him to the floor, legs and hooves flailing to his gasping throat.

She crossed over to the other zebra, his scowl turned to panic, and swiveled to elegantly repeat the process.

Textile industry is only 2 years behind the capital, but heavy industry is close to a decade behind. Literacy rate approximately 10% higher than Great Lakes average, but close to 15% behind  Zano region. Patchwork school and recordkeeping system from federal era makes accurate statistics difficult to acquire.\n\nMajor agricultural products: indigo dye, groundnuts, cassava, millet. Subsistence agriculture largely disappeared. Basic mechanisation achieved, but tractors and automatic threshers rare. Plantations still highly labour intensive.\n\nMajor resources: Salt mining, primarily for use in food processing industry. Minor coal deposits. Land surveys have indicated possibility of larger coal deposits. Railway connection established between mining hubs and city-states, but each city-state had a slightly different gauge, which makes expansion difficult. Terrain flat and relatively easy to administer.\n\nLocal population has grown accustomed to paying regular taxes, and the assistance of local potentates e.g. former Queen Bamina "The Chainbreaker" renders the region docile. Overhead costs for security expected to be minimal."

MSH_community_of_god_txt:0 "While our §3Community§! is united under the worship of the one §3God§!, the exaltation of his §3Prophet§! and the study of the §3Revealed Texts§!, several dogmatic schools have already arisen among the faithful.\n\nFirst and foremost of these schools are the §2Legalists§!, to whom the §3Revealed Texts§! are not only a set of moral laws and obligations to follow, but also a legalistic document, which deserves both study and elaboration by the §3Community§!. Generally speaking, the §2Legalist§! dogma can be described as the outward study of §3God§! which primarily focuses on jurisprudence, legalism, scholastic learning and one's obligation towards the §3Community§!.\n\nThe second, by far more obscure, school of dogmatic thought is the the mystical §6Purists§!. Originating as the §3Community§!'s answer to the §YGreat Lakes§!' long standing traditions of mysticism, and personal experience with the spiritual and the divine, the §6Purists§! seek to enlighten themselves and better understand the nature of §3God§! through the rigorous study of the §3Revealed Texts§!. Overall, the dogma of the §6Purists§! can be described as the inward study of §3God§!, as it focuses primarily on personal piety, ritualism, ascetic living and the relationship of one with §3God§!.\n\nThe final school of thought among the §3Community§! if it can be called as such are the §CReformists§!. Comprised of a loose conglomerate of heterodoxical §YGuides§!, §YScholarchs§! and various unsorted social activists, the §CReformists§! seek to strike a balance between the legalistic and mystical traditions of the §3Community§! in order to achieve a sense of social Harmony and equality among all creatures who accept §3God§! into their hearts."

MSH_subsidiary_economics_category:0 "The Baitulmaal"
MSH_subsidiary_economics_category_desc:0 "While the §3Revealed Texts§! are both a religious and political text in their nature, the fact of the matter is that the §3Prophet§! himself seldom published any form of commentary upon the concept of socio-economic organisation. The texts themselves do proscribe specific forms of taxation and prohibit certain amoral practices such as usury and gambling. However, anything beyond these basic notions has been left up to the interpretation and extrapolation of the §3Custodianship§!'s many §YScholarchs§!. The ultimate conclusion of this academic effort has been the conceptualisation of the §3Subsidiary Economy§! which can in the simplest possible terms be described as a middle road between free market capitalism, socialist economic planning, and a progressive welfare state. To this end many vital assets such as water infrastructure, mineral fields, and undeveloped land have been fully nationalised by the §3Synod of the Faithful§! and put under the control of the §YBaitulmaal§! which exercises almost total control over said assets. In addition to its wide reaching developmental obligations, the §YBaitulmaal§! is also responsible for subsidising the private sector of the economy and setting specific regional economic policies as to better synergise the economic supply chains of the §3Custodianship§!.\n\nThere are a total of §Ynineteen§! potential §YEconomic Regions§! which you can unlock over the course of the game, with the exception of a few whose modes of production are already pre-set, each of them can be made to focus on one of four sectors: §GAgriculture§!, §8Resource Extraction§!, §gIndustrial Development§! and §CAcademic Advancement§!.

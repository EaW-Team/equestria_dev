MSH_prophets_call:0 "The Word of the Prophet"
MSH_prophets_call_desc:0 "There are too many interpretations of the divine, too many conflicting beliefs and practices in the Great Lakes. The Prophet, however, knows the sacred truth. He preaches the only true way of worshipping God, the spirits and the ancestors, and his Word is written down in scripture. He is organizing a formal priesthood around him, burning heathen shamans with holy flames. At the same time, he is both guardian of sacred tradition and an ambitious reformer. Under his guidance, the faith of the western zebras will at last become a proper, organized religion."
MSH_prophets_warriors:0 "The Sword of the Prophet"
MSH_prophets_warriors_desc:0 "There are many who will refuse to accept the Prophet's word willingly. God has given us divine mandate to enforce the true way upon those who refuse it, to instate unity and order in the Great Lakes, forgiving our warriors, while the spirits and the ancestors will give them strength to smite their foes."

 MSH_melee_equipment_0:0 "Iron-Tipped Bows & Spears"
 MSH_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 MSH_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 MSH_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 MSH_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 MSH_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 MSH_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 MSH_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 MSH_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initially used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 MSH_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 MSH_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 MSH_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

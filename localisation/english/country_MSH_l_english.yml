### Focuses ###
 MSH_the_prophet_speaks:0 "The Call For Struggle"
 MSH_the_prophet_speaks_desc:0 "We are the faithful followers of the one true God, and Almami Zekuris is his Prophet. Beyond the borders of our sacred realm are the agents of sin, decay, and death, but surely this cannot remain so if the word of God is to find root. The Prophet has summoned the faithful to hear his proclamation, and surely he knows of what God has planned for us." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_rally_the_tribes:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
 MSH_rally_the_tribes_desc:0 "The Prophet leads his tribe, the Zekurids, with the firm but loving grasp of a father, but the faithful also belong to other tribes who have their own leaders. He intends to speak with the other great tribes - of Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha - and have them affirm their devotion to the cause. Only together can we hope to drive back the infidel and protect the faithful." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_freedom_under_gods_sky:0 "No Master But God"
 MSH_freedom_under_gods_sky_desc:0 "Our battle against the wicked needs able warriors who can serve the Prophet with will, courage and skill. Among the zebras of the tribes should be enough brave chargers whom we can form into the core of what, by God's grace, would become a great army. Let the creatures of the Great Lakes know: only God can be master, and only God's Prophet can lift the sword for him." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_rally_the_servile:0 "The Servile Clans"
 MSH_rally_the_servile_desc:0 "Besides the four great clans there are lesser clans who have served them for many generations. They have been more uncertain about the truth and authority of the Prophet's message, but the Prophet surely knows the way to open hearts to God's word. In the light of faith they might see how to prepare for the conflict to come, and bring to bear their numbers for the sake of all the faithful." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_the_great_struggle:0 "The Struggle Of The Sword"
 MSH_the_great_struggle_desc:0 "The tribes are rallied, the warriors are prepared, and the faithful find solace in the protection of the Prophet's chosen ones. Who can hope to stand against the power of God? Indeed, the Great Struggle before us is set on a path, bloody and brutal, that will ultimately bring about true Peace under the rule of the Almighty." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_from_timbucktu_with_love:0 "From Timbucktu With Love"
 MSH_from_timbucktu_with_love_desc:0 "As the Prophet's decree spreads throughout the Great Lakes, we must call upon the faithful throughout the region to assist us. Macigena, sadly, is greatly lacking in modern infrastructure, but we know that in Timbucktu they are more well off, and more importantly there are believers there who can provide for us. If we send messengers they will surely aid us with arms and munitions." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_maintain_jurisprudence:0 "There Shall Be Law"
 MSH_maintain_jurisprudence_desc:0 "Prophet Almami must ready the faithful for the wars to come, so he cannot be distracted by the routine affairs of law. Thankfully, he has been training several zebras in the art of jurisprudence and interpretation, and over the years they have become quite skilled in determining the meaning and application of divine law. They shall do well in keeping order during the chaos of war." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_support_the_zariqa:0 "The Zariqa Orders"
 MSH_support_the_zariqa_desc:0 "Among the many societies that have developed among the believers, the Zariqa Order has become quite prominent. Well known for their mysticism, the Zariqa believe in the exaltation of God through the glorification of the bodies which he created for us. It would do us well to seek a closer rapport with them." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_elevate_mareshi:0 "Raise The First House Of Worship"
 MSH_elevate_mareshi_desc:0 "It is unfitting that the faithful be forced to worship God in cellars and amidst ruins. They must have a suitable house of worship, one whose very design and arrangement would glorify the Almighty and the empyrean in which he dwells. Here, in the city of Mareshi, we shall erect the first of many to come. Summon the craftszebras! The work must be done at once." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_care_for_the_poor:0 "The Giving Of Zebkat"
 MSH_care_for_the_poor_desc:0 "Among the teachings of the Prophet is one of the great pillars of belief: Zebkat, the giving of alms. In particular, there are many in our lands who have been displaced by strife and disorder across the region, and it would behoove us to see to their care. Within the bounds of our Community and protected by the warriors of the faithful, even the least among us can find comfort and peace." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_the_principle_of_subsidiarity:0 "Agricultural Subsidiarity"
 MSH_the_principle_of_subsidiarity_desc:0 "The farmers of Macigena make a hard-scrabble living amidst marginal conditions. By God's grace, however, we have many experts in agriculture among the faithful who are eager to serve the creatures of this land in whatever way they can. Surely their knowledge and wisdom can be put to use to improve the lives and livelihood of our hard-working planters." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_the_first_step:0 "A Righteous Heathen, But Still A Heathen"
 MSH_the_first_step_desc:0 "Near to us are the old lands of the Zar-Hay, ruled by their regent Zonni Zolon. We hear that he has brought order and peace within his realm, but he governs with the ruthlessness of a heathen. It is unjust for us to allow him to continue as such. If the true faith is to find root in the heart of the Great Lakes, Zolon must repent and submit to the word of the Prophet... or face the sword." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_settle_the_tribes:0 "Settle The Clans"
 MSH_settle_the_tribes_desc:0 "With our victory over Zar-Hay accomplished, we find ourselves in control of a more fertile and productive land, but one denuded of many of its inhabitants who died fighting against us. Some of the clans in our care grow restless from the anticipation of exploiting these new pastures. We can use this opportunity to resettle them and thus spread our influence there." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_people_of_the_book:0 "The People Of The Book"
 MSH_people_of_the_book_desc:0 "Among the peoples of Zar-Hay are some Re'emites, a tribe - no, a nation - of horses who maintain a strong tradition of written knowledge. Their understanding of the finer points of science is well known, but the Prophet is also aware of their fascinating theological views, one that closely resembles his own. This might be a chance to develop a deeper, more intimate relationship." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_of_griots_and_the_zariqate:0 "Of Mystics and Scripture"
 MSH_of_griots_and_the_zariqate_desc:0 "In the midst of our present trials, yet another has arisen in the form of a debate over the spiritual practices of our new subjects. The Griot mystics engage in deeply superstitious practices, supposing to appease spirits, yet despite this there is much good in it, as the Zariqa have shown in adapting such practices to worship the true God. It comes to the Prophet to decide on the right balance." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_from_the_ashes:0 "Risen From The Ashes"
 MSH_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "With the overthrow of Zar-Hay's heathen regime we can at last establish true justice as commanded by the Revealed Texts. Not only the judicial but also the economic system can be realized in a form closer to the ideal that the Prophet envisions. Let us not delay in giving the faithful the peace that is theirs by right, and have them see the wisdom of the Almighty in action." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_brothers_under_gods_grace:0 "Unity And Brotherhood Under Gods' Grace"
 MSH_brothers_under_gods_grace_desc:0 "As our leadership over the faithful continues to solidify and develop, we turn towards the pressing issue of persistent tribal loyalities and rivalries that might harm the Community. Are we not all brothers and sisters under God? The Prophet already has plans, and can instruct the Guides at the Houses of Worship on how to promote peace and unity within their herds." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_the_center_of_an_empire:0 "The Heart Of God's Realm Upon The World"
 MSH_the_center_of_an_empire_desc:0 "At long last, we have established a true state of the faithful in the heart of the Great Lakes. No longer are we merely tribeszebras at the edge of civilization but rather a real nation, a Community of believers bound together under God's mercy and God's law. This will be a nation unlike any other, one that acknowledges no king except God himself." #NavyMongoose
 MSH_a_dash_of_modernity:0 "Progress Tempered By Faith" #Ardent Custodian and Cunard
 MSH_a_dash_of_modernity_desc:0 "Development unchecked too often causes insatiable greed and sinful devotion to false icons. To avoid such temptations, faith in God must guide the way forward. Thus, any progress looking to begin must adhere to this."
 MSH_the_army_of_the_faithful:0 "The Army Of The Righteous"
 MSH_the_army_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "As the Custodianship grows across the Great Lakes, so too must its military. This “Army of the Righteous” shall be composed of zebras from all avenues of life and, united in belief and profession, will bring about the deliverance of the Great Lakes."
 MSH_rifle_standardisation:0 "The Macigena Rifle Drill"
 MSH_rifle_standardisation_desc:0 "Tensions are bound to occur in regiments from mixed regions, but that must not hinder the Army of the Faithful. Such differences will be ironed out through indiscriminate training and shared conditioning. To do God’s will requires not to be born of any specific place, but rather, the faith and skill to act."
 MSH_artillery_implementation:0 "Modernise The Bombard"
 MSH_artillery_implementation_desc:0 "When correctly used, artillery can effectively decimate an enemy and rout their forces. Learning how to apply and incorporate modern artillery and barrage tactics in the Custodianship’s military stratagem is but all necessary - and for God’s sake, always verify your coordinates."
 MSH_utilise_support_equipment:0 "Motorise The Supply Trains"
 MSH_utilise_support_equipment_desc:0 "Trains across the region can only carry supply so far with their limitations. If the Custodianship’s forces are to fight across the Great Lakes swiftly, then its transportation must be swifter."
 MSH_an_army_marches_on_its_stomach:0 "An Army Marches Upon Its Stomach"
 MSH_an_army_marches_on_its_stomach_desc:0 "What warlords in the Great Lakes tend to forget is that a battle force depends on logistics and supply. The Custodianship is not a band of warlords, and the Army of the Righteous must be properly fed. Utilizing traditionally styled cuisines found across the regions should accommodate everyzebra’s tastes well enough."
 MSH_the_vanguard_of_the_faithful:0 "The Vanguard Of The Faithful"
 MSH_the_vanguard_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "There are those within the Army of the Righteous that have displayed not only absolute faith in God, but also potential that ranges above their peers. They shall be chosen, tried, and tested, and if God wills it, they may stand amongst the rank of the elite."
 MSH_the_hub_of_a_nation:0 "The Hub Of A Nation"
 MSH_the_hub_of_a_nation_desc:0 "Macigena’s lands are strategically located to become the Custodianship’s centerpiece as we expand. Populations, pilgrimages, resources, and our armies may move across this area, but the land must be made proper to sustain such passage."
 MSH_modernise_the_satellite_townships:0 "Create The House Of Wealth"
 MSH_modernise_the_satellite_townships_desc:0 "Centralizing the flow of currency and societal development will grant more control and oversight. Educated economists and adept industrialists will be employed at this institution, and their expertise shall bring forth the prosperity as willed."
 MSH_tax_breaks_for_industrial_developers:0 "Codify The Five Taxes"
 MSH_tax_breaks_for_industrial_developers_desc:0 "Zebkat, Cizya, Zhanimah, Zharaj, and Yushr - these are the only righteous motives for taxation as derived from the Revealed Texts. To stray from their purpose is to beckon corruption. To guide the nation’s future, these taxes must be definitively written."
 MSH_develop_mareshi:0 "Redevelop The City Of Zao"
 MSH_develop_mareshi_desc:0 "Despite being the mainstay of Zar-Hay’s corruption, it would be insanity to completely raze the city of Zao to the ground. With the historical city now under our control, let us mend its structural damages and uproot the sinners that have taken advantage of the innocent. The Great Lakes shall look to Zao as proof of the Almighty’s intent."
 MSH_land_reform:0 "Architectural Synthesis"
 MSH_land_reform_desc:0 "Buildings aren’t just mere block dwellings – they are the literal cornerstones of architecture and thriving cultures. To signify that a new age has begun, designing a blend of historical imagery and functionality to display living prosperity is the Custodianship’s next step."
 MSH_fullblown_urban_revitalisation:0 "Urban Revitalisation"
 MSH_fullblown_urban_revitalisation_desc:0 "With more regions now under the Custodianship, disconnected tribes and farms in the Great Lakes are beginning to interact more, especially in cities. Society at large still has a long way to go before reaching its height prior to the Storm King’s invasion, but allocating effort toward making towns and major farms the epicenters of progress will bring more unity and identity to these scattered lands."
 MSH_support_weapon_manufacturers:0 "Incentivise Armament Manufacturers"
 MSH_support_weapon_manufacturers_desc:0 "To produce more weapons, there must be spurring reason. The House of Wealth has decided to set aside guaranteed contracts for interested businesses capable of producing the quantity and quality of weapons the Custodianship needs. The military-industrial complex shall serve its purpose until it is needed no more."
 MSH_the_black_hoof:0 "The Thousand Blades Of God"
 MSH_the_black_hoof_desc:0 "Raise your swords unto God’s light. Aim true your rifles with prayer of deliverance. The evils of the world beseech our gates, but the Custodianship has found them wanting! Send forth a thousand infernos! Unsheathe the steel steadied for the grace of God’s might! Let dark sins descend, for they shall only face impalement upon the thousand blades of God!"
 MSH_mandatory_zebkat:0 "Mandatory Zebkat"
 MSH_mandatory_zebkat_desc:0 "For all our efforts, we are still of sin and thus susceptible to its pull. It is not enough for us to trust that everyzebra will have the good will to give to the poor, so charity must become part of the Custodianship’s livelihood."
 MSH_the_conquest_continues:0 "The Ceaseless Struggle"
 MSH_the_conquest_continues_desc:0 "War and strife proliferate everywhere around the Custodianship. If God’s message is to be delivered unto the rest of the Great Lakes, it has no choice but to face struggle for the liberation of everyzebra. This is the true purpose of the Custodianship. This is our ceaseless struggle."
 MSH_push_against_ZWA_and_ZUG:0 "The Horrors Of The South"
 MSH_push_against_ZWA_and_ZUG_desc:0 "To the very south of us lies the Republic of Aoranda and Ugabi, the former overrun by violently corrupt warlords and the latter misguided by delusional royalty. The very Great Lakes themselves are rife with injustice and wicked selfishness here. As the Almighty wills, as the Prophet proclaims, they shall be no more."
 MSH_against_hollow_modernity:0 "The False Gods Of Modernity"
 MSH_against_hollow_modernity_desc:0 "Even with the collapse of their republic, a few warlords and their forces cling to their masquerade. Whatever republicanism could have been has long since become twisted for selfish gain, and in turn these warlords delude themselves as gods of modernity and the future. They are nothing but false idols."
 MSH_against_heathen_barbarity:0 "The Arrogance Of The Nnabakyala"
 MSH_against_heathen_barbarity_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala who ruled over Ugabi were far too disassociated in their beliefs and the realities of their nation. To further demonstrate this, the Prophet plans to conduct a thorough investigation of the Nnabakyala and proclaim to all the faults of Ugabi’s royalty in detail."
 MSH_the_golden_fields_of_ugabi_and_aoronda:0 "Nurture The Golden Fields"
 MSH_the_golden_fields_of_ugabi_and_aoronda_desc:0 "Not everyzebra living around the waters of the Great Lakes is corrupt and evil. Innocent lives in Aoranda have been liberated thanks to the Custodianship. As such, it is the Custodianship’s duty to tend to this land and those who call it home. These efforts will perhaps in turn bring more to join our cause, if not at least to allow these fields to grow again."
 MSH_judgement_has_come:0 "The Righteous Among The Chaff"
 MSH_judgement_has_come_desc:0 "Not everyzebra who held authority here was corrupt as was led to believe. Spoken by both POWs and innocent inhabitants, rumors of a few morally sound government officials of the past and uncorrupt soldiers have been mentioned. Locating these particular zebras shouldn’t be too hard...if they still exist."
 MSH_the_breadbasket_of_the_great_lakes:0 "The Breadbasket Of The Great Lakes"
 MSH_the_breadbasket_of_the_great_lakes_desc:0 "Inspection of the soil around Aoranda and Ugabi by agriculturalists has revealed how richly saturated they are. With proper effort and cultivation, farmlands organized here could potentially yield more than enough produce to sustain everyzebra."
 MSH_push_against_ZEL_and_HAY:0 "An Unfortunate Task"
 MSH_push_against_ZEL_and_HAY_desc:0 "Eastward grows a partnership of misguided zebras and the oldest kingdom standing as an affront to God’s Great Lakes. Though eradicating Gelon-Zornu’s decadence is absolute, the task of breaking the ignorance that shackles Hayzeb sadly falls to us."
 MSH_end_the_charade_of_autonomy:0 "Centralise The City-States"
 MSH_end_the_charade_of_autonomy_desc:0 "Many of the towns functioned as if they were their own separate entities, marginally pledging themselves to whatever greater ruler laid claim to the area. The Custodianship’s governance must not just be abided by, but upheld and applied throughout."
 MSH_implement_the_nonbeliever_tax:0 "The Protected Peoples"
 MSH_implement_the_nonbeliever_tax_desc:0 "There are a few morally-well communities in the area that refuse to convert or give up their religious practices. Let it be law that these zebras are to permitted peace for their ways, albeit with lenient concessions to the government in exchange."
 MSH_butcher_the_landlords:0 "Power Begets Parasites"
 MSH_butcher_the_landlords_desc:0 "As with any change, there are those that, even now, seek to manipulate the workings of the holy Custodianship in an effort to selfishly preserve their old, evil ways. They shall receive nothing but righteous deliverance!"
 MSH_dash_the_crown_upon_the_ground:0 "Dash The Crown Upon The Ground"
 MSH_dash_the_crown_upon_the_ground_desc:0 "The royal crown of Gelon-Zornu is but a symbol of all the sins and falsehoods that have proliferated the Great Lakes since time immemorial. Historical or not, keeping around such an artifact spits in the very face of God and His teachings, for only the Almighty is the true king over all, and He needs not gold."
 MSH_eager_conversion:0 "The Basic Principle Of Liberty"
 MSH_eager_conversion_desc:0 "God teaches us that all creatures are made equal in spirit. Thus it is the responsibility of the Custodianship to bring about this fundamental truth to all."
 MSH_educate_the_slaves:0 "Intellectual Emancipation"
 MSH_educate_the_slaves_desc:0 "With liberation comes freedom from past fallacies and cyclic trappings. Through His teachings, the truth is revealed, and in His truth can more begin to think anew. After all, education is the best deliverance from ignorance, and there are many eager to learn."
 MSH_a_new_class_of_freezebras:0 "The New Zebras Of Hayzeeb"
 MSH_a_new_class_of_freezebras_desc:0 "If generations are to live in Hayzeb, then the Custodianship must tend to its current population. Squalor and poverty continue to plague the region and doom zebras to knowing naught but endless strife. It is time to put an end to this. It is time to bring about the new."
 MSH_legacy_of_the_slave_queen:0 "The Legacy Of Queen Bamina"
 MSH_legacy_of_the_slave_queen_desc:0 "In a way, the former Queen similarly desired the same changes for her land, albeit misguided in faith and implementation. It only seems right for the Custodianship to acknowledge her efforts and safeguard her legacy as one whose cause was righted by God. The zebras who appreciate her intents, similar as they were, may support the Custodianship's endeavors in turn."
 MSH_push_against_TIM_and_ALO:0 "The Northern Campaign" #Ardent Custodian and Cunard approaching
 MSH_push_against_TIM_and_ALO_desc:0 "Down the Neighle lies Timbucktu and the desert Kingdom of Alwani. This trove of erudite studies and knowledge must not fall into the hooves of the brutal glory-seeker, King Euzegoar, nor can we trust the rest of the Great Lakes to not raze Timbucktu to the ground. By the will of the Prophet, these regions must be saved!"
 MSH_the_city_of_scholars:0 "The City Of Scholars"
 MSH_the_city_of_scholars_desc:0 "Our Prophet himself once studied within Timbucktu’s lecture halls and archives. To preserve its academic credibility, the Prophet has set out to negotiate the city’s integration into the Custodianship. Perhaps great minds tend to think alike?"
 MSH_a_nexus_of_trade:0 "A Nexus Of Trade"
 MSH_a_nexus_of_trade_desc:0 "Timbucktu isn’t just renowned for its institutions of higher education amidst the flowing Neighle – it is a hub for the flow of trade and commerce. There is no benefit in stifling this node, but there can be much potential gained by protecting its trade routes and sanctioning further businesses."
 MSH_a_beacon_of_faith:0 "A Beacon Of Faith"
 MSH_a_beacon_of_faith_desc:0 "Material goods and services are not the only currencies that pass through Timbucktu’s nexus point; it also facilitates the exchange of cultures and beliefs. As tourists, scholars, and merchants travel throughout, so must God’s message for all. May all who are drawn here come to know the faith, and may the faith become known to all."
 MSH_faith_and_reason:0 "Faith And Reason" #Effectively Madrasa schools
 MSH_faith_and_reason_desc:0 "There is no reason for these two concepts to forever exist juxtaposed. Science is but the lens to discovering all that God has created. As the faithful grow, so too must the reasonable. Such is easier when the two are shared."
 MSH_faith_and_prosperity:0 "The Pan-Zebharan Joint Venture Company"
 MSH_faith_and_prosperity_desc:0 "Trade has historically been limited to land routes, but by sponsoring a conglomerate of aerodynamic innovators to provide air transport for merchants and travelers, we can easily change this. If not to allow goods and services to fly across the entire Zebhara, then to at least yield possible military applications."
 MSH_the_first_house_of_widsdom:0 "Codify The Janngirde System" #Effectively Madrasa schools
 MSH_the_first_house_of_widsdom_desc:0 "Across the liberated regions are impoverished zebras too poor to afford proper education. Officially setting up the facilities and curriculum for the Janngirde System can resolve this issue. Zebras who attend shall be taught the basics of reading, writing, and math, though perhaps the most important skills they shall learn is how to read the Revealed Texts and learn of God’s message."
 MSH_the_fertile_valleys:0 "Rebuild The Upper Neighle Irrigation Canals"
 MSH_the_fertile_valleys_desc:0 "Many old irrigation systems have laid in ruin since Mazwi’s collapse, forcing many farms to survive on massive numbers of zebras as water carriers. Restoring these complex irrigation canals will free up the number of laborers needed to run farms, who may in turn find work elsewhere within the ranks of the Custodianship."
 MSH_reemite_support:0 "Resettle The Anzongo Re'emites"
 MSH_reemite_support_desc:0 "The Re’emite Enclaves in Anzongo have developed into herds hardened through toil. We can’t change their adapted ways, but that shouldn’t mean we ought to treat them with any less respect than the other Enclaves we have managed in the past. Their particular skillsets can be put to great use, but first they must be moved to better lands not located in the hot desert."
 MSH_the_bounties_of_the_river:0 "The Bounties Of The Neighle"
 MSH_the_bounties_of_the_river_desc:0 "As the saying goes, we have reaped what we have sown: the region once more prospers through God’s deliverance. The zebras here shall no longer be famished, and in this new life they may come to know of the Almighty and His Custodianship."
 MSH_tribes_of_the_desert:0 "The Tribes Of Alwani"
 MSH_tribes_of_the_desert_desc:0 "With the death of King Euzegoar, Alwani’s tribes have been left with no central figurehead. Their leaders will undoubtingly wish to keep their tribal identities, but dispatching a representative to offer them a place in the Custodianship will make strides toward integrating the Alwani region."
 MSH_an_offer_of_glory:0 "An Offer Of Grace And Glory"
 MSH_an_offer_of_glory_desc:0 "The Alwani tribe leaders have accepted our representative’s proposal. Now all that is left is for Tarkhan Safinata to depart and officially commemorate the status of their positions within the Custodianship."
 MSH_land_of_faith:0 "Land Of Faith"
 MSH_land_of_faith_desc:0 "At last, the Custodianship has nearly cleansed all the sinful ways that had defiled the Great Lakes and our Community. These lands now teem with but lawful order, beautiful life, and righteous justice. Yet above all, this land is one of faith, safeguarded by God’s Custodianship evermore."
 MSH_the_fall_of_mazwi:0 "The Final Struggle"
 MSH_the_fall_of_mazwi_desc:0 "The last vestiges of the Mazwi empire remain in the west - the progenitors of all wrongs that soiled the Great Lakes during its decadent reign. The devastation wrought by the Storm King was a sign of God’s deliverance upon the empire, but the imperialists still writhe to sinful visions of blind restoration. By order of the Prophet and as all that God wills, let us put an end to the Mazwi’s evils once and for all!"
 MSH_integrate_the_army:0 "Redemption For Service"
 MSH_integrate_the_army_desc:0 "Unlike the other regions and the Mazwi of past, Imperial Mazwi’s forces were led and disciplined by General Kelece – a legendary warrior of his own. This has resulted in nearly all of Mazwi’s former ranks behaving as professional soldiers instead of bloated raiders. There is righteousness in this practice, and perhaps if they are willing to serve God, there can be redemption."
 MSH_buckure_mines:0 "The Horrors Of Buckure"
 MSH_buckure_mines_desc:0 "Further inspection into Buckure’s goldmines has revealed dozens of foul mineshafts brimming with corpses. The gaunt slaves freed here testify that these are the bodies worked to death in the mines, Mazwi’s dissidents, or victims of racketeers. The atrocities speak for themselves: death is the only mercy for these monsters!"
 MSH_ziani_concordant:0 "The Ziani Concordant"
 MSH_ziani_concordant_desc:0 "Relations with Re’emite Enclaves throughout the Great Lakes have yielded nothing but benefit to zebras and horses alike. It is time to reach out to the official state of Re’em to offer the same courtesies we have given to their Enclaves, bringing them friendly concordat of sorts."

### Events ###
 maciegna.1.t:0 "Remembrance Of The Past"
 maciegna.1.d:0 "Night rose up from the hazy horizon as Almami yearned for days past, for a simpler time of routines and companionship. He remembered those peaceful days ensconced in the bureaucracy of Ziani, content as he had been in a life of letters. Above all he thought of Aissata, and how she always smiled so sweetly: when they sat by the city fountain together, or took long walks outside the walls. He remembered how they had raised their children, and as one family shared all their joys.\n\nHe recalled how she had become afflicted by an illness of the lungs, and how she smiled as she lay in bed, holding his hoof, as she breathed her last.\n\nThen came the wilderness of isolation, and the collapse of the world. He journeyed a long way from the city; day and night ceased to have real meaning. He had wandered far into the desolation of mind, aimlessly searching for satisfaction, for an answer. The voices of the profane physical reality had become strangers to him, and so he turned away. He turned it all away and became a ghost along the lake shores.\n\nIt was then, five years hence, that he saw Truth. It was then that he heard His voice, the voice of the one true Divinity. Such wonders were revealed to him! Even now he remembered with vivid clarity the delirious aftermath of that revelation: his denunciation of the Manza and other tyrants, the following days of zeal and persecution and exile, that score of years spent preaching by the shores of the Great Lakes. From a mere bureaucrat he had rose up to become something more: a seer, a scholar, a Prophet.\n\nBut for now the zebra known as Almani Zekuris had stepped aside to nurture his longing, and remember the smile of his beloved." #NavyMongoose, with contribution by Argent Custodian, #TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)
 maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

 maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
 maciegna.2.d:0 "In the days before Almami had called for a gathering at this very spot at first light. As the growing embers of the day filtered through the crisp dark of night he could see them all - his followers, his Faithful - as in a great throng they strode towards him. On a hillock he sat, looking over the gathering crowd through the murky dim of the dawn, his most trusted advisors having already taken their places close to him. Then, as the first rays of the sun rose up through the vanishing black, he too arose and gazed upon his people, their eyes rapt with attention upon him.\n\n"Everyzebra who has ears, let them hear!" he began. "For too long false power has held sway in our lands. For too long has injustice and depravity ruled in this corner of Creation. Who can stand this? Who can behold such vice?" He paused, looking down at the crowd, seeing the building fervour in their faces. "Not we, my companions, my friends! You have through my testimony that the true Divinity looks unkindly upon such evils. Dare we not take up the task of cleansing this land, and purging it of darkness and desecration?"\n\nHe lifted up his hoof, sweeping it around to point towards the great cities of the Lakes, far beyond in the distance. "Remember what we have left, what we escaped: a life of sin and death! Remember those creatures who call themselves lords and clerics, who pretend to hold dominion over the free peoples of the land. No, we can stand their pretensions no longer! The one God, merciful and glorious is He, demands satisfaction for their offences! I, therefore, as the messenger of the Most High, speak this: the Faithful must do the work of God, and destroy the evil works of the infidels, and give what they possess to the righteous!"\n\nAmong the Prophet's Faithful, the zeal could be held back no longer as they suddenly burst forth in cheers. One cry came out from their many voices: "God is great! God is great!"" #NavyMongoose, #TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past.
 maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy, for we shall have none."

 maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
 maciegna.3.d:0 "Before the Prophet sat the three Tarkhans of clans Tatam, Diawadou, and Katoucha, and to his side sat his dear sister Safinata. Courtesies and pleasantries had been exchanged, and now, everyone sat awaiting his address. Around the small room, and throughout their assembly location, personal contingents of bodyguards were patrolling and watching, ready for any of the many dangers that could strike. This was, after all, the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Prophet exhaled through his nostrils, for indeed this was the nature of these lands. "God’s message is good...God’s message is kind...but the enemies we must now face are, sadly, not. There will be another war once again in our homeland – another bloody and brutal war – all because the evils of this world want it to happen. If there was another way, I would wholeheartedly accept it and rejoice in His name, but it is by the nature of sin that God’s message is sought to be manipulated against us, His stewards."\n\nThe Prophet shared a glance with Safinata before looking to each of the Tarkhans. "Our clan plans to soon bring war against these leaders, but unlike the wars of the past, we shall fight in the name of God, for the will of His message and its deliverance upon us today and Macigena’s future beyond us. I have gathered all of you here to ask for the help of each of your clans, though if any shall decline, I understand."\n\nThe three Tarkhans now exchanged contemplative looks as the Prophet finished his words. Safinata reached over and placed a firm hoof on his to give reassurance, but not a moment more had passed before the three Tarkhans slowly stood. All of them held their gazes with his, and one by one, they answered." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
 maciegna.3.a:0 "God wills it."

 maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
 maciegna.4.d:0 ""My sister has told me that you are courting now." Almami’s smile grew wider at the immediate outtake of sputtering tea and coughs from Zulaihat, all the while gracefully sipping his own. "And please do not attempt to dodge the topic, let us remain on this, for it is one that matters a lot to me." His smile was saintly, even as she went beet red and murmured that auntie Safinata needed to mind her own business. He chuckled at his daughter’s embarrassment and savored the atmosphere around them.\n\nShared moments such as these, calm and relaxing, were becoming further apart. Here, in his daughter’s modest little home, sharing their mutual favorite tea, he could pause his duties as Prophet and go back to just being a father... or at least attempt to. Zulaihat and her brother Ochen had to take care of their lives without him after Aissata’s death. He always regretted his period of self-estrangement, but with conflict approaching, it continued to bother him further. Zulaihat must have noticed it, for she reached out to place a hoof on his.\n\n"You seem deep in thought father, what is the matter? Are you thinking on your isolation again?" Almami merely sipped his tea and glanced out the room’s window. "We’ve been over this," Zulaihat told him. "You were in an awful state after mother’s death, so you did the most practical thing and had Auntie Safinata and our clan look after me and Ochen."\n\n"Perhaps so," Almami conceded the point. "Yet I have regrets all the same. We will march to war soon, and I have already had a lifetime of regrets to fill up. I ask of your love life because I do not wish to miss any more than I already have, now, or in the future. Whatever comes, I pray that I will be allowed to sit with you after all this." " #Ardent Custodian and badass revision from Sweet Chrysalis, and edited by Cunard
 maciegna.4.a:0 ""As do I, father.""

 maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
 maciegna.5.d:0 "The amphitheater in Sorgo was alight with movement and filled with tunes, and among the many spectators, the Prophet watched in quiet awe. In the center performed his son, Ochen, who had donned the traditional garbs of a Griot of the Great Lakes, and around him sprang the zebras of the Zariqa Order. All around they moved with rehearsed finesse and guile as traditional Griot instruments rang out to the crowd. The performance itself was an interpretation of the ceremonies of the Griot, though accentuated with channeling of spirits to prove one’s mastery of their own self and continuous, frenzied exaltations of God.\n\nIn amusement, Almami wondered if the divine revelation God had given him would’ve been much easier on his body if he had known how to apply the techniques that his son displayed.\n\nAll around he could see the audience captivated by the procession. Not one zebra, foal or grown, dared to take their eyes off of the rapid movements and gestures seemingly reaching into the air and drawing them inwards. They were enthralled, they were uplifted, and, above all else, they had faith.\n\nThe Prophet himself was impressed. Ochen had used his oratory skills and musical arts to create something so profound and beautiful that it embraced all who heard it. Faith was being conveyed through its public display, and in these times of strenuous hardships, access to faith was perhaps the greatest need of all." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard
 maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in His image, it is only proper to exalt His creation."

 maciegna.6.t:0 "The Death Of A Heathen"
 maciegna.6.d:0 "The sky above Zao was skewered by a long blacken trail of smoke billowing from the massive pyre outside the city, and, despite being so far out, the putrid odour of burning flesh fell upon the populace regardless, and all but the Macigenan forces, washing the bloodied streets, retreated into their homes in an attempt to escape the acrid stench.\n\nAlmami stoically observed as more and more dead were added to the flames, all belonging to members of the city's garrison. It was a grim task that had to be done, but that was not what had brought the Prophet here; the dead body of Zar-Hay’s former leader, Zonni, was sprawled before him. Judging by what remained, it was evident that Zonni had died fighting.\n\n"The body should burn like the rest," the general who had recovered the body spoke, "the zebras here will make a martyr of the heathen otherwise."\n\nAlmami’s hooves dug into the ground as he controlled his inner convictions. "Prepare a proper burial mound and lay him when readied." The general, taken aback, had showed the faintest of confusion, but the Prophet continued.

The sun had barely began to rise before the two of them had approached him with urgency, but now with midday having finally arrived, the Prophet’s morning plans were being crammed into his afternoon schedule, and perhaps also his evening ones. Still, the matter brought before him was nonetheless important, but it was evident that the zebra had to mediate between his two children.\n\n"Those Mystics in Zao are heathens, brother!" Zulaihat said, referring to the local priests who were known as Wind-Singers. "The Revealed Texts even say so!"\n\n"They do not whatsoever, Zulaihat!" Raising up both forehooves, Ochen stomped the ground in anger. "If so, you are insinuating me as a heathen as well!"\n\nZulaihat huffed and bore into her brother. "Your Zariqate Order spreads God’s message to everyzebra, whereas those Mystics spread lies with their twisted practices. If that doesn’t sound heretical, Ochen, then I urge you to reread the Revealed Texts; they are heathens and should be punished as such!"\n\n"Lashings for methods that have managed to sway zebras for generations?! If we integrated them into the Zariqate, their ways can be readapted to better spread God’s message in areas where our own means have fallen short. What benefits do you fail to see here?"\n\n"God’s message is good, therefore His teachings are too, so there can be no "benefit" gained in warping His ways! Those practices are as poisonous as the sinful corruption that filled Zar-Hay, if not its source!"\n\nAlmami at last raised a hoof, and his children lapsed into silence.

 maciegna.8.d:0 "As he had done many moons ago, Almani Zekuris, Prophet of God, stood before a crowd, ready to impart upon them his wisdom and judgement. Unlike in the past, however, he stood not only before his fellow believers but also the newly subjugated peoples of Zao, the great city of Zar-Hay, once a bastion of heathen kings and warlords. Today, the Zar-Hayans were subjects, but soon, Almani hoped, they would become his brothers and sisters in faith.\n\n"He who has ears, let him hear!" he began. "What we have begun in this place will not be finished here, for the great work will only be done once every land beneath the sun knows the truth of God's Law. Look around you, people of Zao! The ones who ruled here are no aberration, but partook of the sin and vice that infects all the Great Lakes. Mighty monarchs and cruel warlords lay heavy burdens on their people, taking much and leaving little for them to make a living. Can anyone who is just stand for this? Can the people of faith turn aside as wickedness and avarice keep dominion over those whose hearts yearn for justice? It cannot be so, and it shall be not so, for I, the Prophet of the most high God, will send forth the warriors of the faithful and strike them all down!"\n\nAt once, the people began to cheer, the awful power of repression and tyranny having at last been dissolved of their final bondage upon their souls. Then, one from among them strode forth and approached the Prophet, a zebra resplendent in her warrior's garb. It was Ese, his close friend, and on her back she bore an object wrapped in fine linen that she set before his feet. Gingerly she unwrapped it to reveal a great artifact: the crown of Zar-Hay. "O great Prophet," she said. "Will you take up the office you have earned?"\n\nThe Prophet gazed upon the crown sternly. Then, with a great sweep of his hoof, he thrust the crown from the podium, its golden fittings and jewels clattering upon the ground like foals' toys. "There is no king except God!" he declared. "Let the unbelievers have their tyrants. We shall be governed by a Custodianship of the faithful!"" #NavyMongoose, The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Ese and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm.

 maciegna.9.d_1:0 "A metallic crash was met with rifles as the Aorandan stronghold made its last stand against the Custodian forces pouring into the smashed gateway. All it took were a few brutal minutes for the holdout defenses to collapse and retreat further inwards away from the breach, paving way for the Custodianship’s commander, Safinata Zekuris – sister of the Prophet, to enter safely. She treaded over the blood and bodies of fallen enemy and ally undeterred, passing by the bullet-riddled truck wreckage that had been their battle ram, and advanced further into the falling stronghold with her vanguards.\n\nBy the next day, the Aorandan Republic’s flag atop the stronghold had been replaced with the colors of Macigena’s, and all outside now bore witness to the horrific ends to the Custodianship’s enemies – bodies, hung by the necks, hugged the outside walls of the stronghold. The heads were mercifully obstructed by burlap sacks, but the hurdling stench of the lofted searing beneath the sun suffocated the air all over. Inside the compound, should a zebra dare approach, fared an even worse sight of the defeated and their leaders.\n\nSafinata cast one last look at the grim hoofwork and motioned for the vanguard to depart with her. Nothing remained in this obliterated hold but a warning to the region's worshippers of false idols."
 maciegna.9.d_2:0 "The gates of the Aorandan stronghold swung open for Sanusi Katoucha, a Grand Mule of Macigena and commander of the Custodian forces now controlling the compound. Ochen Zekuris, son of the Prophet, had specifically urged the Custodians seize the remnants of the Aorandan Republic here with efficiency and the least casualties possible, so that is what Sanusi had them do. A week prior, their scouts entered into the stronghold disguised as recruits, and within the span of four days, the Custodian force had fully infiltrated the ranks, familiarized themselves with every passageway, and stockpiled hidden weapons caches all throughout.\n\nAll it took was a single order the night before and the new day dawned upon a fallen stronghold.\n\nSanusi entered into the courtyard and beheld the captured enemy - rows of tied zebras clustered everywhere under the guard of watchful Custodians. In total, the remnant forces had only suffered five deaths; the rest were now POWs. All that remained for the Custodian forces was to wait for the trucks to arrive to transport the POWs to Zao to stand trial and finish emptying out the stronghold. God willing, other resistance-affiliated zebras in the region would investigate the place, so that they could be trailed to their hideouts, providing the Custodians another location to infiltrate all over again."
 maciegna.9.d_3:0 "Ese silently prayed that her plan would work. The families of the Aorandan Republic's remnants had been dispatched into the stronghold a mere ten minutes ago, but each ticking moment felt like an eternity. The enemy stronghold was surrounded by her Custodian force on all sides and ready to assault on her order. There was no doubt that they would succeed in the attack, but the victory would come at a bloody cost. Thus, in an effort to avoid paying its price, Ese had gathered the families of the enemy and sent them in to plea for their loved ones to surrender. It was a double-edged plan though, as now the stronghold harbored innocents within its walls, and should the remnants refuse, Ese knew very well that they would unintentionally be caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe leader of the stronghold knew this too, apparently, as the front gates were opened and the commander himself trotted out before the surrounding Custodian forces. Ese stepped forth, and the two met in the dawn’s light.\n\nThe commander’s tone was one of defeat. “Why did you bring them here?”\n\n“Surrender, and every zebra will be spared; refuse, and your families will bear witness to the death of their loved ones,” Ese stated. “We will not harm them if you choose the latter, but I don’t believe they’ll willingly keep their distance from the crossfire when the battle begins.”\n\nThe ultimatum and consequences were laid bare. The commander handed over his weapon, and no sooner had Ese taken it, a zebra foal ran out from the stronghold’s gates and clung to the commander’s hind leg. Relieved, Ese returned to her Custodian officers and gave the order to enter and detain. No zebra would be dying here today."

Just days ago, he had been a commander of what he once thought was the strongest and most dependable army in all of the Great Lakes, but rather than bravely hold out against the fanatic forces of the Custodianship, his ranks collapsed like dying slaves.\n\n‘Worse,’ he thought as he shied away from another patrol, ‘At least dying slaves just collapse and don't sell you out!’ Kijambiya’s mind raced back to the names and faces of his former lieutenants, the ones who betrayed him and turned his mighty force into pathetic shambles. How he wished he could personally execute them with his own bare hooves right now, instead of seeking an escape route to Klugetown.\n\nThe ex-warlord stopped and scanned the waiting caravans and airship pilots nearby. There had to be at least one zebra he could cut a deal with, preferably one that wouldn’t immediately sell him out and-\n\nSomething hard struck the back of his head, causing him to slump to the ground as his vision faded away. Desperately, he tried to fight whatever was happening, but, dazed and numbly feeling his skin scrape against the ground, all his attempts were in vain.

They shall only answer to God and the Community. This will not be like the old aristocracy - we are trying to create a greater change that will last beyond any of our lifetimes for the betterment of the Great Lakes. To do this, we ask for your aid in these upcoming reforms. It only seems proper that we do what we can to make it right the first time, for tomorrow and for everyzebra after us.” The chamber, no longer weary of her blade, found themselves agreeing."

Attempts to integrate these zebras had been more than difficult, though when it became clear that they would continue to insidiously scramble for authority and power by whatever means necessary, Zulaihat easily turned to the law for the only right solution. All that remained was for her father to give word for their executions.\n\n“They are nothing but manipulative liars,” she said and passed the list to the Prophet. “They pretended to accept God’s message and righteousness while planning in secret to undermine His laws and restore the sinful institute of slavery. They are unrepentant and persist in criminality; God’s laws are clear on what sentence they must receive.”\n\nHer father accepted her reasoning with a sip of his tea. "
 maciegna.17.d_2:0 "The midday sun waned fervently across the cloudless blue sky over their home.\n\nOchen Zekuris watched his father glance over the list of names once again, noting the names circled and others boxed – all belonging to Hayzeb’s old aristocracy and landlords. He waited for the Prophet to set down his tea before elaborating on the plan.\n\n“Sanusi has taken the liberty of circling the most prominent and influential of the zebras on there,” he said with a motion to his spymaster. “Unsurprisingly, those affluential zebras are, well, the worst of sinners.”\n\n“Not every zebra listed there needs to be removed,” Sanusi added. “A full purge would cause more instability and problems for us in the future. If we were to quietly arrest the main offenders I’ve marked and bring them before the Community to be judged, the lesser aristocrats and landowners would be far more willing to conform. If they don’t, we can simply arrest them in the same manner – quietly and without notice.”\n\nIt was the least disruptive method Ochen and Sanusi could think of that would avoid stirring much resistance and still render God’s judgment.\n\n“See it done,” the Prophet said, “I have faith in you, my son.”"
 maciegna.17.d_3:0 "Ese bristled beneath her calm demeanor, though not from the cool evening that had settled across the land just beyond the camp. The Prophet had passed Ese the list of Hayzeb’s old aristocracy and landowners, a number of whom had been slavers or possessed slaves. Her horrid memories suddenly resurfaced in her mind, but the sound of her friend drinking his tea drew Ese back to reality.\n\n“What do you believe should be their fate?” the Prophet asked.\n\nCalming herself, Ese let her mind think rationally. Not every zebra listed was equal in terms of the severity of atrocities committed, despite her past crying out for blind righteous vengeance against all of them. The line between justice and retaliation was a blurry one, but she thanked God for her ability to distinguish between the two.\n\n“All of them are guilty of crimes, especially the slavers, and I would see all of them arrested,” Ese said. “As for what should be done with them, they should stand justice like any other zebra – fair and unbiased as possible in a court of law. We cannot let God’s justice be compromised by our personal whims.”\n\nAlmani, her friend, agreed."

The vicious cycle of conquerors and warlords was indeed a deciding factor, but every Gelon-Zornu monarch knew that the wisest action was to simply offer submission; it would only be a matter of time before another warlord or conqueror arose to overthrow their liege anyways. Mai Gounama knew this well and had everything prepared. He would submit to the Prophet, who in turn would leave his kingdom alone, and the status quo would carry on.\n\nSo there in his lavish homestead, he bowed respectfully before the Prophet and submitted...and completely missed the Prophet giving a nod to his vanguard.\n\nForces slammed into him, and the Mai of Gelon-Zornu found his body pressed to the floor, his fine wardrobe tarnished and thrashing hooves tied. The royal zebra cried for an explanation, but his voice was restrained with a rag being shoved down his throat.\n\nThe Prophet's voice held nothing but contempt. “No longer will your sins taint this land, Mai Gounama, and no more shall this false moniker of a kingdom exist to defy God. Your redemption begins in death, and may His salvation be enough to cleanse all of your sins.”\n\nThe dethroned king’s curses and pleas were muffled as the vanguards dragged him away."

She would be dragged out before a crowd of zebras and executed like the rest. Her hooves and body trembled at the thought, but she tried to calm herself; tried. The least she could do was face her death with a shred of dignity as a Queen, right?\n\nEverything stilled, and the guards finally brought her into a simple room – simple, save for the rug sprawled on the floor and the Prophet himself awaiting her. The guards moved to the corners of the room without a word, and Queen Bamina found herself too frozen to react.\n\n“I hope the trip wasn’t too bad,” the Prophet said and gestured at her to sit down. “I am confident enough to assume that both of us have had more than enough troubles these past few days. Care to sit and take a break from it all?”\n\nBamina hesitated for a moment before she decided to sit on the rug. The infamous Prophet, to her surprise, behaved far more amicably than she had been led to believe, making the situation feel surreal. The Prophet spoke about his faith to God, considerate enough to even ask and listen to her perspective on the beliefs and ideals she held as a ruler. Similarities gave way to them talking about the future of the Great Lakes, and to her delighted surprise, much of what the Prophet wanted was – in a way – what she had wanted too. Yet where she had failed, the Prophet guided by God was miraculously succeeding. It came to no surprise when she found herself pondering aloud.\n\n“Do you think there is room in God’s plan for me?”"

Eventually, at the insistence of her father, they made their way to the shade of a café and settled themselves at a table.\n\nHer father rubbed his eyes and remarked, “It’s all a very bright sight, isn’t it?”\n\nZulaihat took in everything around them. How much had been preserved because her father sought peace instead of prideful conquest? How many wise decisions had been made only because the Prophet actually listened and sought counsel from different viewpoints united by her father’s vision given by God?

Safinata Zekuris - sister of the Prophet – was preceded by her stringent reputation for her staunch beliefs in God’s laws and explicit actions against heathens who refused to adhere. Her hoofwork was well known, and it all added to the impending aura that seemed to permeate the room.\n\n“The Prophet’s work must be done for the glory of God’s message throughout the Great Lakes,” Safinata said and placed a hoof on the table. “This will undoubtedly bring forth more conflicts, but if you align your tribes with us, I can promise all who fight will be gloriously rewarded with God. A heavy decision, as my brother would say, but given everything that has happened around here, God’s will for the Great Lakes is nigh.”\n\nEager to partake in something greater, the tribe leaders agreed."

What they did know was that the zebra held a position of sway and – if being truthful with themselves – was slightly unnerving.\n\n“Everything about the Great Lakes is definitely changing,” Sanusi said with a little too much smoothness for their comfort, “And as any zebra knows, it’s always best to be on the winning side. A guaranteed commitment to our side – to this image of faith – and it can easily be arranged for your tribes to conveniently have positions of influence and wealth.

Just as Almami wanted, all of it had been spared from the worst; even the makeshift town hall they were approaching had been preserved.\n\nThe Prophet’s arrival was welcomed kindly by none other than Agil Agamal, and the two soon began chatting as if they were old friends. The “negotiation” swayed back and forth between discussing the state of the region’s affairs and colloquial pleasantries regarding what had changed since the Prophet had last studied in Timbucktu, though the discussion eventually achieved its objective of reaching an agreement.\n\n“The Custodianship shall grant you authority over all of Timbucktu’s educational facilities,” Almami said as he passed the official papers, “which shall in no way supersede that of the former nor be used for treason, though you shall be acknowledged and included in all matters regarded on their premises.”\n\n“Of course,” Agamal looked over the conditions with a smile. “No need for us to busy our institutions elsewhere when there’s plenty to handle here.

Though disjointed resistance efforts continued in the hillsides, many commanders and their fellow soldiers were surrendering. Undoubtedly, it was a blessing, though Ese suspected that this was likely to happen after Mazwi fell. Many were victims of the Great Lakes’ slave system just like her, and the ranks were filled with either conscripts or zebras born as Sofas just as she was once – slaves bred for nothing but war. The zebra commander now before her was one such slave, which made the whole scenario rather odd.\n\n“General Kelece,” she greeted and invited him to sit, “Surrendering was the last thing I expected from you, given your history with the Storm King.”\n\nThe uniformed zebra remained rigid. “The Custodianship may have routed my forces, but I won’t have the fine Mazwians subordinate to me perish in a last stand.

We both have endured far too much injustice in our homelands, and the Custodianship is clearing away the wrongs of the past to make things right - no more slavery, no more corruption, and no more wars.

Everything was proceeding smoothly until, at last, the root of all this was dragged before her – the self-proclaimed “Golden Bug”, Legranx. The changeling offered her a smile and claimed repentance, but when none were swayed, he tried to bargain and soon, he was desperately begging for his life in any way he could muster. Unstirred, Safinata was lost in thought over how they would execute the Golden Bug. Finally, an idea came to her.\n\nLegranx was dragged out to a nearby forge in chains. He cursed vilely and thrashed furiously against his metal bindings, but his words quickly fell into frantic desperation as a large glowing ladle was ferried over containing nothing but his melted gold. A single gesture was all it took, and the ladle careened over the shrieking changeling.\n\nSafinata allowed herself to smile amidst the crisp stentch."

The son of the Prophet had finally reached an understanding, and all the flaws that came with it.\n\n“If we were to copy Equestria, we would be copying many of its shortcomings,” Ochen said. “All which would only be exacerbated by the contentions in the Great Lakes. You do realize that, right?”\n\n“Well yes,” Zanga Senghore said, “but if those were no more, then Equestria’s model of governance would surely be the best fit for all zebras.”\n\n“Its principles, perhaps, but I’m pretty sure Equestria’s success relied on specific factors that are just not present in our region, and I don't think we could fully copy them successfully with our circumstances.” Ochen let the fact settle among them before continuing. “What we can do, however, is build a better form of government that would succeed in the Great Lakes where Equestria’s would fail, yes?”\n\nThe Zebritude members, although agreeing with his argument, proceeded to delve into the principles that would have to be maintained. Ochen simply let them talk, seeing no harm in discussing the similar values he had roughly been striving towards."

 maciegna.32.d:0 "Just another sunny day in Re'em marred by the violence in the Great Lakes region. At least it would have been had the rise of the Custodianship, once known as Macigena, not occurred. Many Re’emite Enclaves spoke of prosperous development and newfound peace in the territories brought into the Custodianship’s rule, but every outsider knew that this was often preceded by the nation’s ruthless conquest. Now sharing a border with the Custodianship, the unconquered Re’emites anxiously awaited their fate.\n\nThe wait wasn't long, however, as one day the border guards were greeted by fellow Enclave emissaries hailing from the Custodianship's lands with a proposition for a ‘concordat’ of sorts. Promptly, they were taken to Re’em’s capital, and before the audience of Yonatan Suss and his officials, they told of the agreements made between the Re’emite Enclaves and the Custodianship.\n\nBy all accounts, these arrangements seemed reasonably fair and pleasant, but this in turn prompted a debate the Re’emite government had put off for so long. “If we integrate into the Custodianship, we could spare many lives,” reasoned a council member, “Our culture and traditions could be preserved and we would be securing the safety of generations.”\n\n“Assuming we aren’t just assimilated,” interjected another council member calmly, “Agreements with our Enclaves is one thing, but the entire submission of our state is another. Do we believe it is the right choice to give up our autonomy after everything we’ve endured in the Great Lakes?”\n\nOne way or another, Yonatan Suss knew that they would have to reach an agreement sooner or later, though as his council weighed the pros and cons of such choices, the horse thought back to the Custodianship’s political relationship with Re’em."

Go now to your deserved rest. I shall send for you when the treaty is ready so you may have the honor of delivering it.”\n\nThe Re’emite delegation nodded and departed, and the Prophet went about coordinating his assembly in what they needed to do to officiate the Custodianship’s decision."

 maciegna.34.d_1:0 "Every step within the Mazwi-styled palace brought back memories of the old empire, and each one of them filled Safinata with unbridled anger. The furnishings and artworks being removed by her Chargers echoed of Imperial Mazwi’s wretched past built upon the countless lives of slaves. Had it been her decision, Safinata would have ordered the entire structure razed in the hottest of fires, but her brother insisted the place still could be used.\n\n“You brutes!” a desperate voice cried, “Stop! Stop!” Safinata glanced down the hall and spotted a gaudy zebra pleading with some Chargers as they carried away items. Safinata figured he was of no threat seeing that he wasn’t restrained yet, but her ire still grew tenfold when he spotted her approach. “Are you in charge? Please order these chattel beasts to relinquish my inheritance at once! I can reward you beyond imagination if you do.”\n\nSafinata now recognized the zebra, “You are...Mahud, correct?”\n\n“Yes, I am.” The now former leader of Imperial Mazwi stood proudly in the sunlight filtering through the stained-glass window behind him. “And through my royal and well-deserved birthright, I can promise—”\n\nSafinata reared around and lashed out both her hindlegs. Sounds of Mahud’s sternum cracking were inaudible to the window shattering. The breathless zebra fell from view, followed by the fracturing of stone a moment later. An easy glimpse below revealed the sight of a few Chargers staring at the body lying in the ruins of a fountain.\n\nThe Sister of the Prophet paid her subordinates no mind and smiled."
 maciegna.34.d_2:0 "Zulaihat silenced the court and gazed down upon the zebra in chains. By all accounts, the zebra she was judging shared a similar past as a former bureaucrat like that of her father. However, unlike the Prophet, Braahima Zeydu’s actions ever since abandoning Mazwi had been nothing but utter disgrace, to himself and everyzebra he had wronged.\n\n“I cut my ties from the Mazwi and fought against them, just like the Prophet!” Braahima spat, “Yet I am the one the Custodianship condemns? What impartial favoritism this is.”\n\n“Yes, be it the Custodianship and its Community to favor the innocent and offer redemption to the ignorant,” The Master of Jurisprudence did the best she could to not let contempt get to her. “But you are neither innocent nor ignorant, and you are nothing like our Prophet. He stayed righteous to God’s message; you and your cadre openly turned to banditry, senseless atrocities, and exploitative evils equal to that of Imperial Mazwi. Thus, in accordance with the Revealed Texts, I sentence you to death by stoning, as you deserve.”\n\n“What choices did I have?!” A final motion stirred the bailiffs and other guards forward, and the shouting Braahima Zeydu was dragged to his fate. “What choices did I have?!"\n\nZulaihat leaned back in her seat, her disparaging glare unwavering."
 maciegna.34.d_3:0 "Zenguella felt the shackles around his hooves dig into his skin, but there was nothing he could do now. His defiance against Imperial Mazwi and everything he had fought for had been put to ruin by the Custodianship’s Army of the Righteous. Forced to kneel before a court of the Custodianship’s officials, it only seemed fitting that his ventures would end like this. Such was the fate of benevolence in the Great Lakes.\n\n“Zenguella,” the judge of the court, Zulaihat, spoke, “The standard punishment for acts of banditry would warrant you a death by stoning, however...” The courtroom stirred in whispers, but Zulaihat continued. “After having received a number of pleas from the families in the region and testimonies from your subordinates freed from Buckure’s gold mines, the Custodianship has decided to grant you pardon based on your righteous deeds, despite your lack of faith.”\n\nOne of the guards nearby stepped forward, and Zenguella felt the metal bindings unclamp from his skin. The zebras in the courtroom began moving about, but none spoke out against the Master of Jurisprudence’s hoof motioning for him to leave. Hesitantly, Zenguella took a step backwards, and then a few more. When it was evident that no zebra was attempting to stop him, he quickly turned and exited the courtroom.\n\nOnly when he had left the building and stood in the midday sun did Zenguella fully grasp what just happened, and he smiled to himself.\n\n"Guess only I could've pulled it off.""
 maciegna.34.d_4:0 "They were surrounded. On every side of the market square, Sassouma and her contingent of warriors were surrounded by the Custodianship’s forces. It was evident that her rule was soon to be over. The reign of the former mercenary and rightful princess of Mazwi was about to brutally end. She had read the reports of what the Custodianship did to other Monarchs across the Great Lakes. She turned to her fellow fighters. If tradition still meant anything to the Custodianship enclosing, she could bid for one last gambit.\n\n“Listen here, Sword of the Prophet!” Sassouma unsheathed her blade to the gleaming sun above. “Step forth and face me!”\n\nThe Custodianship’s forces stilled, and a full minute passed before the Sword of the Prophet, Ese Jalloh, finally emerged before her. With her sword, Sassousma motioned behind for her subordinates to not shoot. “If I win, we depart unharmed.”\n\n“If this is how you wish to die yourself, God has willed it.” The Sword of the Prophet leveled her blade.\n\nSassousma gave a short laugh before they began to circle one another. Both sides watched the two face off, but all bore witness to the princess attacking first. Their two blades clashed and parried off each other. Swift steps gave way to swipes as feints led into slashes, but neither side seemingly had the advantage in skill, speed, or strength.\n\nOr at least that was how it seemed until a clash suddenly forced her opponent to backpedal, and Sassousma ferociously speared forward in a battle cry. Throughout her adrenaline-charged assault, the princess failed to notice what her opponent was doing, and only when her opponent’s blade impaled through her chest did she finally realize too late. Yet even as she succumbed to the bleeding cuts across her body and immobilizing blade through her heart, Sassousma clutched her own sword and struggled to will her body to continue fighting.\n\nThe last thing she felt was the Sword of the Prophet’s blade leaving her body, followed by her body slumping to the ground."

With the stars as witness, the Great Lakes lay unified under God, and its future heralded in pressed silence. The Prophet Almami Zekuris sat by himself upon the warm burial grounds not too far from Ziani, and after so many years the zebra was finally able to return to the grave of his wife. Almami smiled and murmured, “My Aissata, your handsome fool has been busy.”\n\nWhat would his beautiful Aissata have to say about all of this? She never saw what her husband became or the beliefs he preached to all. Almami gazed to the distant lights. Out here in the quiet reaches of his mind with only himself and his wife’s grave to confide with, Almami grimaced at the minuscule possibility that all he believed and preached was but ravings of a madzebra.\n\nHad a divine monotheistic entity given him visions?\nWas he but a charismatic warlord who simply led Macigena to conquer the Great Lakes?\n\nHis eyes watered from pain at the thought of him conquering the Great Lakes for a God that was never there... yet for his doubts, it could be said he ended the practice of slavery throughout and given the Community the means to govern justly. This would be what God truly wanted from a Prophet, right?\n\nThe zebra winced. Even if Almami was not the Prophet that God desired, he had faith that God's will, one way or another, would use everything for good. A gentleness settled over him.\n\nBidding a quiet farewell to his wife’s grave, Almami made the slow journey back to his residence in Ziani. Many things still required his attention, but they would have to wait. Once home, Almami said his prayers and retired for the night. His last thoughts before sleep were of bliss and what God would use the Custodianship for next.\n\nWhen morning broke, a trusted caretaker entered to tend to the home. There, unmoved in bed, the remains of the Prophet were finally found."

Her writing pretty much flayed the parchments with whatever ounce of composure she could muster, and without wasting seconds to seal the letters, she passed them to the nervous courier. Her voice felt grimly foreign and harsh, but Zulaihat gave direct instructions to the courier, who then all but charged out of her home in urgency.\n\nMoved by instinct, Zulaihat numbly followed the departed courier’s trail, leaving behind her breakfast and her auntie’s letter, and soon she stood in Ziani’s streets facing roughly in the direction of her father’s residence. She began to trot, but spurned by raw emotion beneath the suffocating detachment, her hooves gradually broke into a blind gallop.\n\nThe Prophet was dead.\n\nHer father was dead."

Sanusi took these moments to distract himself while the versed Ochen smoothly balanced talking and time management with them. Yet, as if harking upon a sudden omen in the air, Ochen turned his gaze to the sight of a frazzled courier pushing  towards them through the crowds.\n\nBraced for the tugging of administrative responsibilities, Ochen found himself surprised when the exhausted courier delivered but a simple letter. His smile faded as he read the message, and amidst the moving crowds, Ochen stilled. His eyes stiffly went over the letter again and again, his desperate mind refusing to recognize his sister’s writing.\n\nWordlessly, he gave the letter to Sanusi and moved past the courier, and by the time Sanusi had finished reading, Ochen was already several blocks away, moving through the crowds towards where his father once resided."

After everything they had endured, the two former Sofas now lived to see the Great Lakes free for all. There was still much to do across the region, of course, but the zebras of the Great Lakes now had a new beginning to make things right.\n\nIssa and Kelece sat reminiscing and sharing war stories, laughing and trading lighthearted quips over everything they had experienced. Yet when a gaunt and rasping courier trudged through the command tent’s flaps, Ese and Kelece stood in unison.\n\nThe wheezing zebra limped over to Ese and shakily offered her a wrinkled letter before his eyes rolled and his body collapsed.

The unshed tears anyzebra held was kept back by their grueling wait for answers. Then there were hoofsteps approaching, and the entering doctor found himself beset by their gazes.\n\n“I performed the autopsy in the least invasive manner I could,” the haggard doctor sighed, “He suffered from a brain hemorrhage, and the lacking signs of struggle indicate that he passed in his sleep. I suppose...it is fitting that God would grant His Prophet a peaceful death in the Great Lakes of all places.”\n\nThe rest of the room drew their expressions away as Safinata offered the doctor a tentative hoof, one which the doctor flinched from with a bashful wave. “There is no need to apologize for seizing me on the way to work.

Ese moved to stand next to Safinata while Sanusi remained in his corner with distant eyes focusing on the floor. Ochen and Zulaihat remained where they were, their grieving minds trying to think.

Through the tears and grief, the crowds parted to bear the way, and the four silently proceeded forward. Ochen and Zulaihat silently carried their father at the lead, both doing their best to maintain their sullen gazes ahead and set the pace. Behind the siblings walked Safinata and Ese, their demeanors hardened and grim as they carried the rear. The pathway forward was belayed with tears and sobs, and as the four carried the body forward, the two sides slowly closed and followed in wake.\n\nTheir destination was just outside of Ziani, but soon the procession arrived to a small Tower of Silence, built in such short notice but ever so beautifully made besides the grave of the Prophet’s wife. The four carefully passed under the threshold of the Tower, and with the utmost of grace, they placed the Prophet’s body upon the stone slab in place. A waiting Guide approached, and with an outstretched hoof he muttered the Prophet’s final rites.\n\nIn the times that followed, squads of the Custodianship’s Chargers would rotate watch of the site.

Ever since, Ese’s staunch faith in God and His plan for the world had been unwavering, even perhaps more than the devotion of the Prophet himself. Almami had at least been given His revelation to help make him believe, but Ese’s belief drew from her alone. She was, in Almami Zekuris’ eyes, God's true first believer.\n\n"We will make God’s world into a reality, neither of us wouldn’t have made it this far if His message wasn’t true," Ese affirmed, "and when we do, the stars will be up there to see it, all will be right, all will be free, and I’ll be there to see it, like the stars above us."\n\nAlmami let his friend’s belief soothe his lightened head." #Ardent Custodian

The sun bleating down upon the land, and everything around them deceitfully shimmered like the waters of the Great Lakes.\n\nMotioning to his cohorts, the Prophet and his guards moved up to the pale homestead’s entrance and stepped into its courtyard. This was the home of one of the many clans of the Minute Mules, or "servile" clans, as they had been labelled for their utmost obedience to one or more of the Great Mules in Macigena. The denotation of their status was made evermore present when the clan’s head zebras met him and pressed themselves and their robes onto the courtyard’s sandy grounds, bowing on all four hooves. Wanting to return the gesture, the Prophet forced his older self to bow just the same. When he lifted his head, he could see all the clan members regarding him with thinly obscured astonishment.\n\n"Is something the matter?"\n\nThe clan leader stammered and bowed his head again. "N-no, great Prophet, it’s just-no, nothing of matter, forgive me."\n\n"Very well then," the Prophet said. Letting out a groan, he lifted his frame up from the ground. The sand caught in his clothes would be a hassle to remove, but that could be done later, and preferably in some shade. "God gave us light, indeed, but I can’t help but wonder if He gave us a little too much."\n\nA few of the clan zebras broke out in coughs to suppress their amusement, which earned a smile from the Prophet.\n\n"If we may, shall we enter inside to discuss matters? The waterskins we brought taste much better in shade."\n\n"Waterskins? F-for us, great Prophet?"\n\n"Yes, I think we brought enough for every zebra - forgive my memory, your clan has thirty members, right?"\n\nThe astounded clan leader of exactly thirty zebras opted to calmly lead the Prophet into his home." #Ardent Custodian, edited by Cunard

Why does God’s will, eternally benevolent and good for all, face so much adversity? If His message is by Him and of Him, why must it inherently struggle against the world?

Asante unbuckled his seatbelt and hauled himself over the back and onto the flatbed. Pushing past the other crates, the zebra knelt down and began scooping up the cargo.

By association and belief, Asante was part of this Community too; all of them throughout the clandestine trail of caravan trucks were.

Agame and his family had been lucky to escape as the village was set ablaze and its residents kidnapped or massacred, and like many other zebras who had fallen victim to this cruel normalcy, they had been forced to roam across the threat-ravaged lands of the Great Lakes festered with marauding bandits, combat zones, vicious warlords, famine, and death.\n\nSo much death.\n\nAgame leaned back against the mud bricks that served as one of their hut’s walls, pressing his shaking coat against its warm surface. Everything was different now. The now ruling government of Macigena had instituted Zebkat – a social program run by the donations of God’s worshippers – and saw that these funds were used to provide for wandering destitutes such as them. \n\nThrough these Zebkat donations, Macigena’s landscape now beheld clusters of walled-off communities crammed with makeshift mud brick huts and guarded by the military. Occupants of these homes were given the tiniest of stipends and rations, and it wasn’t uncommon for a single-family home to host five or more families, but Agame and his wife had no complaints, nor would they allow any from their twin foals.\n\nThey had food, water, shelter, and protection – and every night before cramming into their corner for sleep, Agame’s family and the two other families living with them would gather in the center of the shack and pray for their blessings.

Initially, little was said on the farmer’s end, aside from some general explanations of the area, but when the topic of farming itself came up, the farmer's tone with the visitor – who he learned was a scholar in agricultural studies - became much livelier. The two of them began speak on the types of crops present and planting methods, and soon the farmer found himself detailing the entire process, to which the scholar responded with genuine questions. The scholar even listened to the farmer’s complaints over the area’s lack of general irrigation due to nearby situations.\n\nA few days later, the scholar returned, brimming with more questions and specific solutions he wanted input on, and rather than just one farmer answering, the others were drawn in to offer their comments on developing the village’s farms.\n\nA week after, the scholar returned with means to help apply their collaborated solutions, even showing all his legal paperwork, and from then on, the scholar oversaw the area's subsidized farmlands, always open to feedback and suggestions from its inhabitants.\n\nEventually, the scholar would ask if he could purchase a hut in the village to live in, but the village of farmers simply gifted him one for free.

Every muscle of hers wanted to turn away and race off to somewhere she could galivant freely, surviving off nothing but her mettle, but years of experience throughout the conflicted Great Lakes grounded her whims, and Imani reluctantly approached the zebra coming out to meet her – a Griot, judging by the way he dressed.\n\n"Thank God you made it, I was beginning to worry when you didn't arrive with the others," he said and bowed in greeting. "My name is Okoro, I’m one of the advisors of this village. Your journey must’ve been long, here." He offered a waterskin from his satchel.

Even those who sought retribution against the enclave could easily be swayed by the amount of wealth and a guaranteed source for homage, both of which were extremely hard to find throughout the Great Lakes. Even if this Prophet was far kinder and respectful than those before, he was only another zebra taking charge of them.\n\nThat was until he refused to accept their tribute with a smile and a wave of his hoof.\n\n"There is no need," the Prophet said.

Ese raised her eyebrow between them before one spoke. “You slanderous bastard!”\n\n“Says the sand munching—!” An audible whack silenced the zebra before he could finish and slumped him to the floor, legs and hooves flailing to his gasping throat.

 maciegna_flavour.18.d:0 "Days? Weeks? Months? Amanyi had lost track long ago inside the confines of his home. He had been given the mercy of living, but could one really consider his situation a mercy? Nothing but the restraints of house arrest, long moments haunted by his memories, and fate’s silent mockery of his dreams for a better Ugabi?\n\nThe former ruler sighed and stared once more out his window. Absently, Amanyi gazed over to one of his potted plants and pushed around the specs of stray dirt with a hoof, thinking back to a time before all of this: a time before he was even the ruler of his nation. The zebra thought back to his adolescent days of studies and his invested interest in the mundane intricacies of soil. Oh how things were simpler then, his passion unburdened and unbroken by politics and responsibility...\nThere was a knocking at his front door. “Mr. Amanyi?”\n\nHe forced himself to glance away from the plant and his blissful past, and the zebra went to receive his guest. Within moments, Amanyi found himself staring at the very Son of the Prophet, Ochen Zekuris, and his entourage of bodyguards. Taken aback, he fumbled for his voice. “Yes? That is me.”\n\nHis visitor respectfully remained outside the front door. “The Custodianship has been reviewing Ugabi’s historical records stored in the Nnabakyala palace grounds, and my father came across an old document belonging to you: a report card,” Ochen explained, “And despite your mediocre grades, my father noted that you held consistently top marks in your agriculture science electives. On behalf of the Custodianship, the Prophet wishes to extend an offer for a research position overseeing the newly subsidized farmlands in the Ugabi region. The position would entail the general responsibilities of a Custodianship official, though it will mainly focus on soil development. Would this be of interest to you?”\n\nThe former ruler didn’t even hear his own voice or what he had said, but soon they all had left the confines of the house arrest, and Amanyi found himself walking beside the Son of the Prophet elaborating on the position’s documenting procedures."

 maciegna_flavour.19.t:0 "Land Of Faith"
 maciegna_flavour.19.d:0 ""Mercy to the merciful, judgment to the sinner,” Almami mulled behind closed eyes, "And by divinity of God’s grace, deliverance to all...”\n\nHis suddenly heavy head drew his eyes open, and the Prophet found himself in the quietness of his home with the silent echo of his prayers. Thoughts pooled into a painful contemplation, and Almami found himself in meek reflection. Was everything done up to this point justified? The lives spared by his command? The deaths ordered by his voice? Was everything he had done truly in accordance with what God wanted? Or was he, Almami Zekuris, but a sinner using God’s divine will to enact war upon the Great Lakes for mere territorial conquest?\n\nThe zebra slowly rolled up his prayer mat. Only the western regions of the Great Lakes remained unconquered; the lands controlled by the remnants of the Mazwi. The Custodianship tended to its newly controlled as much as they could, but its forces were preparing for the final push. If victorious, the Great Lakes would be unified once more, and then all within the Community could transform their homelands all together. With this thought, the Prophet’s pain subsided.\n\nThe blatant sins of the Mazwi were what saturated these lands with evil to begin with and compelled the Prophet to preach out against all those years ago. Now, its festering remnants were all that remained. Almami thought about the deliverance to come...and what form of deliverance God may have planned just for him.\n\nEverything felt light. Alami eased himself against a nearby wall with a sigh.\n\n'May God be merciful if everything I did was wrong,' he languidly thought."

 maciegna_flavour.20.t:0 "The Slave Queen"
 maciegna_flavour.20.d:0 "Following the recent victories, one rather crucial consideration was missing; specifically, one crucial zebra. The Prophet spared no expense and ordered for this zebra to be found, and days and nights the Custodianship’s soldiers search everywhere.\n\nQueen Bamina had disappeared not too long before the Custodianship had taken over, but she nevertheless remained at large. If not to help integrate these new territories, the Custodianship could at least bring everyzebra of Hayzeb some peace of mind to whatever befell their former ruler.\n\nInitially, valid sources from former resistance cells pointed to the Queen hiding the slums of Zano, but she never was found, to the concern of the Community and the worry of Hayzeb's population. The Prophet urged everyzebra to keep searching. Such persistence finally paid off when a messenger would reach the Prophet weeks later when he was consulting with the Custodianship’s military leaders. Upon hearing the news, the Prophet gave the messenger his attention.\n\n“We found her barely alive in the southernmost forests in yeti territory,” the messenger reported, “The few others that were with her said they had been on the run and in hiding since the Hayzeb Federation’s capitulation.”\n\n“What of Bamina herself?”\n\n“Banima’s condition is stable now after we brought her and her entourage to the nearest settlement with available medical resources. She is recovering.” The messenger shifted on his hooves. “She...also wished to express her gratitude and, um, has requested to be left alone until she is ready. She wishes to help us with her homeland, if allowed, and gives her word to not take up any future actions against the Custodianship.”\n\nThe Prophet sagged his head in a long contemplation. Biting back a grimace, he finally spoke. “May God be with her, so as long as she keeps her word.”"

 maciegna_flavour.21.d:0 "Ochen and Zulaihat listened to the words of the newcomer Abyssinian who somehow gained an audience with them in advance. The feline introduced himself as an petitioner of the Community in Kludgetown, and a quick glance exchanged between the siblings conveyed their skepticism. Since when did Community have an outreach all the way in Kludgetown?\n\n“Your patience to meet with us is commendable, Muezz Hurairah,” Ochen said.\n\n“Yes, Son of our Prophet,” the feline said with another bow, “Patience is but one virtue of our spirit, but Muezz Hurairah’s heart weeps that we must struggle to manifest it.”\n\nZulaihat was about to dismiss him before a curious Ochen interjected. “Elaborate?”\n\nThe feline's tail swished. “It is a virtue of our spirit, but why must everycreature struggle in practice? Muezz Hurairah has pondered this on many spare nights.”\n\n“The struggle is lessen by acceptance of law.” Zulaihat moved closer to the conversation. “If believers cannot accept what is written in the Revealed Texts, then they cannot accept God.”\n\n“But law and spirit must coincide on this plane of existence,” He stood with twitching ears. “And Muezz Hurairah believes its tethers are in the material, as reflected by Zebkat. God's will can tend the Community through management of the material, including its means of production and destruction to guide all equally and—”\n\nOchen raised a confused hoof. Zulaihat, also confused, cleared her throat, “Your ideas are...foreign to us, but you seem to have practical expertise which may be used in the Custodianship. If need arises, we will ask for your advising, if you haven’t returned to back Klugetown by then.”\n\n“Muezz Hurairah shall remain where needed, Daughter of our Prophet,” the feline bowed, “On behalf of the Community in Klugetown, Muezz Hurairah thanks you both and God for the time.”\n\nOchen and Zulaihat watched the Abyssinian gather his belongings and depart."

Textile industry is only 2 years behind the capital, but heavy industry is close to a decade behind. Literacy rate approximately 10% higher than Great Lakes average, but close to 15% behind  Zano region. Patchwork school and recordkeeping system from federal era makes accurate statistics difficult to acquire.\n\nMajor agricultural products: indigo dye, groundnuts, cassava, millet. Subsistence agriculture largely disappeared. Basic mechanisation achieved, but tractors and automatic threshers rare. Plantations still highly labour intensive.\n\nMajor resources: Salt mining, primarily for use in food processing industry. Minor coal deposits. Land surveys have indicated possibility of larger coal deposits. Railway connection established between mining hubs and city-states, but each city-state had a slightly different gauge, which makes expansion difficult. Terrain flat and relatively easy to administer.\n\nLocal population has grown accustomed to paying regular taxes, and the assistance of local potentates e.g. former Queen Bamina "The Chainbreaker" renders the region docile. Overhead costs for security expected to be minimal."

 MSH_community_of_god_txt:0 "While our §3Community§! is united under the worship of the one §3God§!, the exaltation of his §3Prophet§! and the study of the §3Revealed Texts§!, several dogmatic schools have already arisen among the faithful.\n\nFirst and foremost of these schools are the §2Legalists§!, to whom the §3Revealed Texts§! are not only a set of moral laws and obligations to follow, but also a legalistic document, which deserves both study and elaboration by the §3Community§!. Generally speaking, the §2Legalist§! dogma can be described as the outward study of §3God§! which primarily focuses on jurisprudence, legalism, scholastic learning and one's obligation towards the §3Community§!.\n\nThe second, by far more obscure, school of dogmatic thought is the the mystical §6Purists§!. Originating as the §3Community§!'s answer to the §YGreat Lakes§!' long standing traditions of mysticism, and personal experience with the spiritual and the divine, the §6Purists§! seek to enlighten themselves and better understand the nature of §3God§! through the rigorous study of the §3Revealed Texts§!. Overall, the dogma of the §6Purists§! can be described as the inward study of §3God§!, as it focuses primarily on personal piety, ritualism, ascetic living and the relationship of one with §3God§!.\n\nThe final school of thought among the §3Community§! if it can be called as such are the §CReformists§!. Comprised of a loose conglomerate of heterodoxical §YGuides§!, §YScholarchs§! and various unsorted social activists, the §CReformists§! seek to strike a balance between the legalistic and mystical traditions of the §3Community§! in order to achieve a sense of social Harmony and equality among all creatures who accept §3God§! into their hearts."

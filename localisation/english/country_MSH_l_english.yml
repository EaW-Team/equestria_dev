maciegna.1.d:0 "#TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)" #NavyMongoose
maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
maciegna.2.d:0 "#TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past." #NavyMongoose
maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy upon the pigs, for we shall have none!"

maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna.3.d:0 "Before the Prophet sat the three chiefs of clans Tatam, Diawadou, and Katoucha respectively, and to his side sat his dear sister, Safinata Zekuris. Courtesies and pleasantries had been exchanged, and all now remained await for his addressment. Around the small room and throughout their assembly location were personal contingents of bodyguards patrolling, watching, and readied for the many dangers undoubtingly at roam. This was, after all, the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Prophet exhaled through his nostrils, for indeed it this was the nature of these lands. "God’s message is good...God’s message is kind...but our enemies we now must face are, sadly, not. There will be another war once again in our homeland – another bloody and brutal war – and all because the evils of this world want it to happen; the very nature of sin is forcing this to happen. If there was another way, I would wholeheartedly accept it and rejoice in His name, but it is by the nature of sin that God’s message is sought to be manipulated against we, His stewards."\n\nThe Prophet shared a glance with Safinata before looking to each of the chiefs. "Our clan plans to soon bring war against these leaders, but unlike the wars of the past, we shall fight in the name of God, for the will of His message and its deliverance upon we of today and Macigena’s future beyond us. I have gathered all of you here to ask for the help from each of your clans, though if any shall decide to not, I understand."\n\nThe three chiefs now exchanged contemplative looks as the Prophet finished his words. Safinata reached over and placed a firm hoof on his to give reassurance, but not a moment more had passed before the three chiefs slowly stood. All of them held their gazes with his, and one by one, they answered." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.3.a:0 "God wills it."

maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
maciegna.4.d:0 ""My sister has told me you are dating." Almami’s smile grew wider at the immediate outtake of sputtering tea and coughs from Zulaihat, all the while gracefully sipping his own. "And please do not attempt to dodge the topic, let us remain on this, for it is one that matters a lot to me." His smile was saintly, even as she went beet red and murmured that auntie Safinata needed to mind her own business. He chuckled at his daughter’s embarrassment and savored the atmosphere around them.\n\nShared moments such as these, calm and relaxing, were becoming further apart. Here, in his daughter’s modest little home and sharing their mutual  favorite tea, he could lay to rest his duties as Prophet and be a father... or at least attempt so again. Zulaihat and her brother Ochen, had to take care of their lives without him after Aissata’s death. He always regretted period of self-estrangement, but with conflict approaching, it continued to bother him further. Zulaihat must have noticed it, for she reached out to place a hoof on his.\n\n"You seem deep in thought father, what is the matter? Are you thinking on your self-estranging again?" Almami merely sipped his tea and glanced out the room’s window. "We’ve been over this," Zulaihat told him. "You were in no condition after mother’s death, so you did the next practical thing and had Auntie Safinata and our clan look after me and Ochen."\n\n"Perhaps so," Almami conceded the point. "Yet I have regrets all the same. We will march to war soon, and I have already had a lifetime of regrets to fill up. I ask of your love life as I do not wish to miss any more than I already have. Now, or in the future. Whatever comes, I pray that I will be allowed to sit with you after all this." " #Ardent Custodian and badass revision from Sweet Chrysallis
maciegna.4.a:0 ""As do I, father.""

maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
maciegna.5.d:0 "The amphitheater in Sorgo was alight with movement and filled with tune, and among the many spectators watched the Prophet in quiet awe. In the center performed his son, Ochen Zekuris, who had donned recreated garbs of the Griot of the Great Lakes, and around him sprang the zebras of the Zariqa Order. All around they moved with rehearsed finesse and guile and traditional Griot instruments rang out to the crowd. The performance itself was an interpretation of the ceremonies the Griot, though accentuated with channeling of spirits to prove one’s mastery of their own self and continuous frenzied exaltations of God.\n\nIn amusement, Almami wondered if his divine revelation God had given him would’ve been much easier on his body if he had known how to apply the techniques that his son displayed.\n\nAll around he could see the audiences captivated by the procession. Not one zebra, foal or grown, dared to take their eyes off of the rapid movements and gestures seemingly reaching into the air and drawing them inwards. They were enthralled, they were uplifted, and, above all else, they had faith.\n\nThe Prophet himself was impressed. Ochen had used his oratory skills and musical arts to create something so profound and beautiful that it embraced all who heard it. Faith was being conveyed through its public display, and in these times of strenuous hardships, access to faith was perhaps the greatest need of all." #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in His image, it is only proper to exalt His creation."

maciegna.6.t:0 "The Death Of A Heathen"
maciegna.6.d:0 "The sky above Zao was skewered by a long blacken trail of smoke billowing from the massive pyre outside the city, but even so far, the putrid odour of burning flesh fell upon the populace, and all but the Macigenan forces washing the bloodied streets retreated into their homes in attempts to escape the acrid stench.\n\nAlmami stoically observed more and more corpses added to the flames, all belonging to the Zar-Hay garrison stationed in Zao. It was a grim task that had to be done, but such was not what brought the Prophet here; the dead body of Zar-Hay’s former leader, Zonni, was sprawled before him. Judging by what remained, it was evident that Zonni died fighting.\n\n"The body should burn like the rest," the general who had recovered the body spoke, "the zebras here will make a martyr of the heathen otherwise."\n\nAlmami’s hooves dug into the ground as he controlled his inner convictions. "Prepare a proper burial mound and lay him when readied." The taken aback general showed the faintest of confusion, but the Prophet continued. "Zonni righteously led as best as he believed, even if he was grossly misguided by sin and turned heathen in the end; we of God and His message ought to acknowledge this."\n\n"He wouldn’t have done the same for you, for any of us."\n\n"Indeed," Almami said, "but we are not him - we are not heathens."" #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.6.a:0 "Memento mori."

maciegna.7.t:0 "Of Mystics And Scripture"
maciegna.7.d:0 "A slight pain thrummed at the sides of Almami’s head as he continued listening to both his fervent son and resolute daughter argue on. The sun barely began its rise before the two of them had approached him with urgency, but now with midday having finally arrived, the Prophet’s morning plans were being crammed into his afternoon schedule, and perhaps also his evening ones. Still, the matter brought before him was nonetheless important, but it was evident that the zebra had to mediate between his two children.\n\n"Those Mystics in Zao are heathens, brother!" Zulaihat said, "The Revealed Texts even say so!"\n\n"They do not whatsoever, Zulaihat!" Raising up both forehooves, Ochen stomped the ground in anger. "If so, you are insinuating me as a heathen as well!"\n\nZulaihat huffed and bore into her brother. "Your Zariqate Order spreads God’s message to everyzebra, whereas those Mystics spread lies with their twisted practices. If that doesn’t sound heretical, Ochen, then I urge you to reread the Revealed Texts; they are heathens and should be punished as such!"\n\n"Lashings for methods that have managed to sway zebras for generations?! If we integrated them into the Zariqate, their ways can be readapted to better spread God’s message in areas where our own means have fallen short. What benefits do you fail to see here?"\n\n"God’s message is good, therefore His teachings are too, so there can be no "benefit" gained in warping His ways! Those practices are as poisonous as the sinful corruption that filled Zar-Hay, if not its source!"\n\nAlmami at last raised a hoof, and his children lapsed into silence. The Prophet had decided, the verdict establishing precedence henceforth." #Ardent Custodian

maciegna.8.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Issa and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm." #NavyMongoose

maciegna.9.t:0 "Dereliction Of Duty" #Ardent Custodian
maciegna.9.d_1:0 "A metallic crash was met with rifles as the Aorandan stronghold made its last stand against the Custodian forces pouring into the smashed gateway. All it took were a few brutal minutes for the holdout defenses to collapse and retreat further inwards away from the breach, paving way for the Custodianship’s commander, Safinata Zekuris – sister of the Prophet, to enter safely. She treaded over the blood and bodies of fallen enemy and ally undeterred, passing by the bullet-riddled truck wreckage that had been their battle ram, and advanced further into falling stronghold with her vanguards.\n\nBy the next day, the Aorandan Republic’s flag atop the stronghold had been replaced with the colors of Macigena’s, and all outside now bore witness to the horrific ends to the Custodianship’s enemies – bodies hugged the outside walls of the stronghold hung by the necks and many still dripping from open wounds. The heads were obstructed by burlap sacks, mercifully, but the hurdling stench of the lofted corpses searing beneath the sun suffocated the air all over. Inside the compound, should a zebra dare approach, fared an even worse sight of the defeated and their leaders.\n\nSafinata casted one last look at the grim hoofwork and motioned for the vanguard to depart with her. Nothing remained in this obliterated plinth but a warning to region's worshippers of false idols." 
maciegna.9.d_2:0 "The gates of the Aronandan stronghold swung open for Sanusi Katoucha, a Grand Mule of Macigena and commander of the Custodian forces now controlling the compound. Ochen Zekuris, son of the Prophet, had specifically urged the Custodians seize the remnants of the Aronandan Republic here with efficiency and the minimalist of casualties possible, so that is what Sanusi had them do. A week prior, their scouts entered into the stronghold under the guise of recruits, and within the span of four days, the Custodian force had fully infiltrated the ranks, familiarized with every passageway, and stockpiled hidden weapons caches all throughout.\n\nAll it took was a single order the night before and the new day dawned upon a fallen stronghold.\n\nSanusi entered into the courtyard and beheld the captured enemy - rows of hogtied zebras clustered everywhere under the guard of watchful Custodians. In total, the remnant forces had only suffered five deaths; the rest were now POWs. All that remained for the Custodian forces was wait for the trucks to arrive to transport the POWs to Zao to stand trial and finish emptying out the stronghold. God willing, other resistance-affiliated zebras in the region will investigate this place, to which they would be trailed to their hideouts, providing the Custodians another location to infiltrate all over again." 
maciegna.9.d_3:0 "Issa silently prayed that she her plan would work. The families of the Aronandan Republic remnants had been dispatched into the stronghold a mere ten minutes ago, but each ticking moment felt like waiting in eternity. The enemy stronghold was surrounded by her Custodian force on all sides and ready to assault on her order. There was no doubt that they would succeed in the attack, but its cost would be bloody. Thus, in effort to avoid paying its price, Issa had gathered the families of the enemy and sent them in to plea for their loved ones to surrender. It was a double-edged plan though, as now the stronghold harbored innocents within its walls, and should the remnants refuse, Issa knew very well that they would unintentionally be caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe leader of the stronghold knew this too, apparently, as the front gates were opened and the commander himself trotted out before the surrounding Custodian forces. Issa stepped forth, and the two met in the dawn’s light.\n\nThe commander’s tone was one of defeat. “Why did you bring them here?”\n\n“Surrender, and every zebra will be spared; refuse, and your families will bear witness to the death their loved ones,” Issa stated. “We will not harm them if you choose the latter, but I don’t believe they’ll willingly keep their distance from the crossfire when the battle begins.”\n\nThe ultimatum and consequences were laid to bare. The commander handed over his weapon, and no sooner had Issa taken it, a zebra foal ran out from the stronghold’s gates and clung to the commander’s hindleg. Relieved, Issa returned to her Custodian officers and gave the order to enter and detain. No zebra would be dying here today."

maciegna.10.d_1:0 "#TODO - The Prophet delivering a sermon and or fatwa in the newly conquered city of Kamarala (Former capital of Ugabi), in this case due to the player's Legalist focus, the Prophet is giving a very much fire and brimstone speech on the arrogance of the Nnabakyalas (Title of Ugabi's rulers) for claiming that they alone had a monopoly upon God's grace and calls upon the people of Ugabi to spit upon a statue of the deceased Nnabakyala Mukisa (Who was executed after the conquest of Ugabi).

Unlike the Legalist speech this is more him explaining that the Ugabians do not need the Clergy nor any Kings to dictate to them their piety, for they are all made in God's image and it is only their personal piety that matters. This is by far more effective than either the Legalist or Reformist approach."

Fortifications and contingencies could only do so much against superior tactics and terrifying zeal of the purported Army of the Righteous. Given the intensity of every day and night as both sides battled to gain and regain ground through the city, it came to no surprise that the average Ugabian soldiers began to lay down their weapons and surrender.\n\nYet the Spirit Warriors refused to yield, and here and now in the battered palace grounds of the Nnabakyala, they would fulfill their sworn duty. Kill zones and traps were laid everywhere, all weapons were steadied, and every Warrior silently awaited their fate. Some allowed their tears to flow while others struggled to perish the instinct to run, but all of them braced their hooves against ground, and when the Army of the Righteous at last converged and assaulted the palace, the Spirit Warriors unleashed their final war cry.\n\nThe palace fell within days, and no zebra of the Nnabakyala nor of the Spirit Warriors would evermore leave its tomb."

They would take Kamarela. They were ready.\n\nWhat they weren’t ready for was the very sight of Amanyi and the Spirit Warriors awaiting patiently for their arrival instead of repelling their attack. So caught off guard, the surging Army of the Righteous front skidded to a halt and caused a clamor of zebras crashing into each other from behind. Confusion began to arise from the attackers, but the general managed to push through to the front of clustered fighters to see what was happening. The two opposing forces stared each other down, and Amanyi himself looked the general in the eyes.\n\nAmanyi stepped into the wide empty space between the two and silently began to remove his ornate cloaks and attire. The unbelieving general finally approached Amanyi just as the legendary Pearl Sword was drawn and laid upon the elegantly discarded pile of clothes.\n\n“I hereby give myself and all of Kamarela to the Army of the Righteous,” Amanyi announced. “I only ask that my subjects and this beautiful city be spared.” Behind the surrendering zebra, all of the Spirit Warriors began to lay down their weapons in the same manner.

Hearsay aside, she could only levy annoyance towards them – the whole ordeal throughout the region had put a considerable hamper on her businesses.\n\n“May I help you?” \n\n“Sheebah Nakiyemba,” the lead agent greeted courteously, “our Prophet wishes to extend an invitation to join his government, as your economic expertise would be greatly beneficial, in terms of both financially gains and helping the common zebra.” He nodded to one of the agents, who protruded a closed letter from a bag. “The terms and conditions of your employment are defined, but negotiable.

Attempts to integrate these zebras had been more than difficult, but when it became clear that they would continue to insidiously scramble for authority and power by whatever means, Zulaihat easily turned to the law for the only right solution. All that remained was for her father to give word for their executions.\n\n“They are nothing but manipulative liars,” she said and passed the list to the Prophet. “They pretended to accept God’s message and righteousness while planned in secret to undermine His laws and restore the sinful institute of slavery. They are unrepentant and persist in criminality; God’s laws are clear on what sentence they must receive.”\n\nHer father accepted her reasoning with a sip of his tea. "

If we were to quietly arrest the main offenders I’ve marked and bring them before the Community to be judged, the lesser aristocrats and landowners will be far more willing to conform to us. If they don’t, we can simply arrest them in the same manner – quietly and without notice.”\n\nIt was the least disruptive method Ochen could think of with Sanusi that could possibly avoid the resistance that often comes with changes and still render God’s judgment.\n\n“See it done,” the Prophet said, “I have faith in you, my son.”"

Not every zebra listed was equal in terms of the severity of atrocities committed, despite her past crying out for blind righteous vengeance against all of them. The line between justice and retaliation was a blurry one, but she thanked God for her ability to distinguish the two.\n\n“All of them are guilty of crimes, especially the slavers, and I would see that all of them are arrested,” Issa said. “As for what should be done with them, they should stand justice like any other zebra – fair and unbiased as possible in a court of law.

They only needed to deal with the many captured Province-Masters and bureaucrats – the very ones who were in charge of those wretched mines they had found – but Safinata saw to it that they wouldn’t just callously be killed on the spot.\n\nMany she convicted through impromptu trials were sentenced with public flogging while others received harsher punishments. Everything was proceeding smoothly until at last the root of all this was dragged before her – the self-proclaimed “Golden Bug”, Legranx. The changeling offered her a smile and claimed repentance, but when none were swayed, the changeling bargained, but soon he was anxiously begging for his life in whatever form he could muster. Unstirred, Safinata was lost in thought over how they would execute the Golden Bug. Finally, an idea came to her.\n\nLegranx was dragged out to a nearby forge in chains. He cursed vilely and thrashed against his metal bindings in multitude of forms, but his words fell into frantic desperation as a large glowing ladle was ferried over containing nothing but his melted gold. A single gesture was all it took, and the ladle careened over the shrieking changeling.\n\nThe molten gold seared down Legranx’s skin, the crisp crackles of burning eyes and flesh melding with the changeling’s screams gurgling with the glowing liquid leaking into his mouth. Bounded limbs violently morphed and thrashed until the gold scorched enough of the changeling to finally end him, but the ladle continued to pour over the corpse. Soon what remained of Legranx was but a gold rendering on the floor, protruded with whatever was left of the burnt limbs and body that had finally stopped twitching.\n\nSafinata allowed herself to smile amidst the whiffs of the charred changeling."

The son of the Prophet had finally reached an understanding, and all the flaws that came with it.\n\n“If we were to copy Equestria, we would be copying many of its shortcomings,” Ochen said. “All which would only be exacerbated by the contentions in the Great Lakes. You do realize that, right?”\n\n“Well yes,” Zanga Senghore said, “but if those were no more, then Equestria’s model of governance would surely be the best fit for all zebras.”\n\n“Its principles, perhaps, but I’m pretty sure Equestria’s success relied on specific factors that are just not present in our region, nor could we copy them in full successfully or could they handle our circumstances.” Ochen let the fact settle among them before continuing. “What we can do, however, is build a better form of government that would succeed in the Great Lakes where Equestria’s would fail, yes?”\n\nThe Zebritude members, although agreeing with his argument, proceeded to delve into the principles that would have to be maintained.

"They’ll even be up there when God’s vision of a just world finally comes to pass."\n\nAlmami reflected on her words and his friendship with Issa, his first follower. She was but a slave soldier of the Mazwi when he first found her after his divine revelation over 20 years ago, and there and then, she had become his first follower – the first true disciple of God's message for a more just and united world. Ever since, Issa’s staunch faith in God and His plan for the world had been unwavering, even perhaps more than the devotion of the Prophet himself. Almami had at least been given His revelation to help make him believe, but Issa’s belief drew from her alone. She was, in Almami Zekuris’ eyes, God's true first believer.\n\n"We will make God’s world into a reality, neither of us wouldn’t have made it this far if His message wasn’t true," Issa affirmed, "and when we do, the stars will be up there to see it, all will be right, all will be free, and I’ll be there to see it, like the stars above us."\n\nAlmami let his friend’s belief soothe his lightened head." #Ardent Custodian

This was the home of one of the many clans of the Minute Mules, or "servile" clans, as they had been labelled for their utmost obedience to one or more of the Great Mules in Macigena. The denotation of their status was made evermore present when the clan’s head zebras met him and pressed themselves and their robes onto the courtyard’s sandy grounds, bowing on all four hooves. Wanting to return the gesture, the Prophet forced his older self to bow just the same. When he lifted his head, he could see all the clan members regarding him with thinly obscured astonishment.\n\n"Is something the matter?"\n\nThe clan leader stammered and bowed his head again. "N-no, great Prophet, it’s just-no, nothing of matter, forgive me."\n\n"Very well then," the Prophet said. Letting out a groan, he lifted his frame up from the ground. The sands caught in his clothes would be a hassle to remove, but that could be done later, and preferably in some shade. "God gave us light, indeed, but I can’t help but wonder if He gave us a little too much."\n\nA few of the clan zebras broke out in coughs to suppress their amusement, which earned a smile from the Prophet.\n\n"If we may, shall we enter inside to discuss matters? The waterskins we brought taste much better in shade."\n\n"Waterskins? F-for us, great Prophet?"\n\n"Yes, I think we brought enough for every zebra - forgive my memory, your clan has thirty members, right?"\n\nThe astounded clan leader of exactly thirty zebras opted to calmly led the Prophet into his home." #Ardent Custodian

Almami chuckled, "Whatever have you done?"\n\n"I chose to believe," Ochen said, "Why must my belief in God’s message led to struggling against the world?"\n\nAlmami fell quiet and turned to ponder at empty space. Why does God’s will, eternally benevolent and good for all, face so much adversity? If His message is by Him and of Him, why must it inherently struggle against the world? Were they destined into a ceaseless cycle of struggle? The more these questions danced around Almami’s head, the more it began to hurt.\n\n"Father?"\n\n"This place, this region, is of sin."

Asante unbuckled his seatbelt and hauled himself over the back and onto the flatbed. Pushing past the other crates, the zebra knelt down and began scooping up the cargo. Another rupture jolted the vehicle and forced Asante’s hooves to seize the open container before it spilled again, but the lurch still caused a few crates to smack his sides. Ow.\n\nAsante resumed putting the rifles back into their box. These were the weapons for the great Prophet and his Community – God’s Community. By association and belief, Asante was part of this Community too; all of them throughout the clandestine trail of caravan trucks were.

Everything was different now. The now ruling government of Macigena had instituted Zebkat – a social program run by the donations of God’s worshippers – and saw that these funds were used to provide for the wandering destitute likes such as them. \n\nThrough these Zebkat donations, Macigena’s landscape now beheld clusters of walled-off communities crammed with makeshift mud brick huts and guarded by the military. Occupants of these homes were given the tiniest of stipends and rations, and it wasn’t uncommon for a single-family home to host five or more families, but Agame and his wife had no complaints, nor would they allow any from their twin foals.\n\nThey had food, water, shelter, and protection – and every night before cramming into their corner for sleep, Agame’s family and the two other families living with them would gather in the center of the shack and pray for their blessings.

Initially, little was said on the farmer’s end aside from general explanations of the area, but when discussing farming itself, the farmer spoke lively with the visitor – who he then learned was a scholar in agricultural studies. The two of them began speak on the types of crops here and planting methods, and soon the farmer found himself detailing the entire process, to which the scholar responded with genuine questions. The scholar even listened to the farmer’s complaints over the area’s lack of general irrigation due to nearby situations.\n\nDays later, the scholar returned brimming with more questions and specific solutions he wanted input on, and rather just one farmer answering, the many others were drawn in to offer their comments on developing the village’s farms.\n\nA week after, the scholar returned with means to help apply their collaborated solutions, even  showing all his legal paperwork, and from then on, the scholar oversaw the area's subsidized farmlands, always open to feedback and suggestions from its inhabitants.\n\nEventually, the scholar would ask if he could purchase a hut in the village to live in, but the village of farmers simply gifted him one for free.

The Re’emite enclave have historically endured and integrated through many, if not almost all, regime changes throughout the Great Lakes. How the Re’emite had survived for so long was not determined by which faction was supported; it had been determined by how much tribute they offered to the next overlord after. A generation or two would often save all earnings to pay homage to whatever new warlord demanded the Re’emite’s loyalty. Even those who sought retribution against the enclave could easily be swayed by the amount of wealth and a guaranteed source for homage, both which were extremely hard to find throughout the Great Lakes. Even if this Prophet was far kinder and respectful than those before, he was only another zebra taking charge of them.\n\nThat was until he refused to accept their tribute with a smile and a wave of his hoof.\n\n"There is no need," the Prophet said.

### Events ###
maciegna.1.t:0 "Remembrance Of The Past"
maciegna.1.d:0 "#TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)"
maciegna.1.a:0 "God willing, one day I shall be with her."

maciegna.2.t:0 "The Dream Of A Just Future"
maciegna.2.d:0 "#TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past."
maciegna.2.a:0 "May God have mercy upon the pigs, for we shall have none!"

maciegna.3.t:0 "The Grand Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna.3.d:0 "#TODO - Before I give the TODO here, a brief term explanation. The name of the event is a play on the Bedouin term 'The Great Skulls of Arabia' which denotes the great aka the most powerful clans of Arabia. Thus the term 'Grand Mules' denotes the same for Macigena (There are four: Zekuris, Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha). In this event, the Prophet meets with his sister Safinata and the rest of the three major clan chiefs to discuss the upcoming war - Informing them that there will unfortunately be bloodshed, but that they shall be rewarded for their services both in this world and in the afterlife. For their part, the Chiefs are fully loyal to him."
maciegna.3.a:0 "God is great!"

maciegna.4.t:0 "The Master Of Jurisprudence"
maciegna.4.d:0 "#TODO - A quiet event between the Prophet and his daughter Zulaihat where they're sitting around in his modest home and drinking tea. Overall it's just a father and his daughter discussing life, with the Prophet giving sagely advice and in the end asking his child to give him judgement on whether she believes that his goal of waging war for what he perceives as a just war - To his surprise Zulihalit believes that not only is it just, backign up her words with scripture (Hadiths) from the Revealed Texts (Think, mix between the Quran and the Bible), but that it is a necessity."
maciegna.4.a:0 "To believe is to struggle against oneself and the world."

maciegna.5.t:0 "The Custodian Of The Zariqa"
maciegna.5.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet quietly observing a Sufi-esque performance by his son Ochen and his Zariqa Order (Effectively a Sufi order), it's effectively the Community's take upon the Griot traditions of the Great Lakes, with the entire ceremony involving a lot of music, the channeling of spirits to prove one's mastery over the self and frenzied exaltations of God. For his part, the Prophet is proud of his son for having found such a beautiful use of his oratory and musical arts, recognising the importance such public displays have upon a people's morale in times of hardship."
maciegna.5.a:0 "God has made us in his image, it is only proper to exalt his creation."

maciegna_flavour.1.t:0 "Under God's Sky"
maciegna_flavour.1.d:0 "#TODO - A quiet moment between the Prophet and Issa, where the two simply sit under the night time sky, sharing a skin of water under the light of a bonefire and discussing the past. The two met while Issa was still a slave soldier in Mazwi and she had subsequently become one of the Prophet's first followers, his companion and his genuine friend, so this is just meant to show how much the both of them respect eachother and just how willing Issa is to uphold his vision of a just world"
maciegna_flavour.1.a:0 "You are a fistful of incense over the embers and the scent of a pure soul Issa."

maciegna_flavour.2.t:0 "The Minute Mules Of Macigena"
maciegna_flavour.2.d:0 "#TODO - Much like the Great Mules of Macigena, there are the Minute Mules of Macigena, although they're more often than not called the Servile Clans due to their obedience to one or more of the Great Mules. This event is more meant to show the Prophet meeting with the leader of one such servile clan and offering them the same respect he would to any other person showing just how much simple kindness and a smidge of charisma have allowed him to gather such a large following."
maciegna_flavour.2.a:0 "Respect is the foundation of belief."

maciegna_flavour.3.t:0 "The Lesser Struggle"
maciegna_flavour.3.d:0 "#TODO - The Prophet and his son Ochen having a discussion on the nature of the concept of 'Struggle' in the faith, as his father had by that point only discussed the notion of an inner Struggle that strives for a sinless existence. The Prophet for his part tries to explain that sometimes there is a need to Struggle against the evil of others for the Community to have a chance at a faithful and happy life. Ultimately his son comes away satisifed with the explanation, but the entire interaction leaves a bad taste in the Prophet's mouth."
maciegna_flavour.3.a:0 "God willing, the violence shall end one day."

maciegna_flavour.4.t:0 "From Timbucktu With Love"
maciegna_flavour.4.d:0 "#TODO - One of the few events not featuring the Prophet, this event is effectively a few of the Prophet's followers from Timbucktu traversing the desert to reach Mareshi to supply the Community with weapons for self-defence. Event is meant to show that although he has no personal presence in Timbucktu there are still people out there either preaching his message or following in his footsteps"
maciegna_flavour.4.a:0 "From one to all."

maciegna_flavour.5.t:0 "The House Of Worship"
maciegna_flavour.5.d:0 "#TODO - The raising of the first official house of worship in the Community's existence. This is a great occasion as up until this point they have been using various abandoned palaces and temples as prayer halls. The House of Worship is built using materials such as adobe and features something that the architect of the project had dubbed the 'Tower of Silence', effectively an elevated circular platform/tower next to the House of Worship which is exposed to the elements thus granting the ability for the Community to finally host sky burials without any fear."
maciegna_flavour.5.a:0 "The first tree has grown."

maciegna_flavour.6.t:0 "The Giving Of Zebkat"
maciegna_flavour.6.d:0 "#TODO - Obvious reference to the idea of giving Zakat in Islam, this event is mostly about a poor family being given alms and a place to stay by the state. The house they are given is not a grand thing nor is it particularly oppulent, but in a land as ravaged by war as the Great Lakes, it is an act of kindness that would turn even the most ardent of skeptics into zealots."
maciegna_flavour.6.a:0 "We are all family in the eyes of God."

maciegna_flavour.7.t:0 "Subsidiary Agriculture"
maciegna_flavour.7.d:0 "#TODO - A scholar arriving in a small village near the outskirts of Mareshi, the peasants/farmers working the fields there know the usual shtick with Mazwi was 'Get the orders from some city slicker bureaucrat who knows fuck all about what he is talking about, and wait until he leaves so we can go back to our business in peace'. They're pleasantly surprised when the scholar sent over from Mareshi goes around actually talking to them to figure out how to resolve local issues with irrigation, and based upon that provides them actual solutions to their various problems. Over the course of the month they become a valued member of the community."
maciegna_flavour.7.a:0 "All must work together for a better world."

MSH_community_of_god_desc:0 "While our §3Community§! is united under the worship of the one §3God§!, the exaltation of his §3Prophet§! and the study of the §3Revealed Texts§! several dogmatic strains have already arisen among the faithful.\n\nFirst and foremost of these strains are the §2Legalists§! to whom the §3Revealed Texts§! are not only a set of moral laws and obligations to follow, but a legalistic document which deserves both study and elaboration by the §3Community§!.

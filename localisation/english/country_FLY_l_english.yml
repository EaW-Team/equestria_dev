 ### M6 + Starlight Glimmer // Scriped localisation relating to the events too

  fillydelphia_manesix.1.t:0 "Gathering Shadows"
  fillydelphia_manesix.1.d:0 "Starlight Glimmer, enveloped in the dim, flickering light of the hideout, stood motionless before the corkboard. The map of Equestria, a nation torn asunder, bore silent witness to her inner turmoil. She was a leader thrust into the throes of rebellion, a role that felt like an ill-fitting garment, chafing at her every move every passing day. Her heart raced with anxiety, her breathing increasingly frantic as she struggled to compose herself.\n\nThe ghosts of her past, once relatively dormant, now whispered incessantly, their words like thorns. 'Would you even be here if not for Twilight?' they taunted, a question that gnawed at her with the persistence of a lingering shadow. The burden of her newfound authority weighed heavily. Each decision, each action, felt like a step through a minefield, her mind a labyrinth of second-guesses and what-ifs.\n\nWith a trembling hoof, she pinned Rarity's photo to Manehattan, the city's name a stark reminder of the reality that faced them all. The other Elements, her friends, were scattered – disconnected in a time when unity was their greatest strength. She looked at their faces, her gaze lingering on each one. The thought of their separation, the uncertainty of their fates, was a jagged pill to swallow.\n\nTurning back to the map, Starlight's eyes traced the lines that divided Equestria, each one a scar upon the land she loved. The conflict between Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon had turned the country into a chessboard of power plays and suffering. Ponies, innocent and scared, caught in the crossfire of ambitions too great and too cruel.\n\nYet a resolve began to crystallize within Starlight. This was no longer about her insecurities or Twilight. This was about Equestria, about bringing together those who stood as its truest hope. The Elements of Harmony were more than just her friends; they were the key to healing a fractured land."

  FLY_fillydelphia_manesix_2_d_rainbow_with_fluttershy:0 "In the makeshift outpost, barely holding against the shifting frontlines, Starlight Glimmer stood defiant. Warnings of danger fell on deaf ears; Fillydelphia's fate, and possibly hers, hung in worsening balance. Yet, Starlight, with her unparalleled magic, remained steadfast—until an aide, bearing a backpack radio, interrupted. "Miss Starlight, comms requested for you."\n\nConfusion gave way to recognition as she connected. "This is Site Patience. Q-R-Z?"\n\n"Q-R-Z? Starlight, it's me!" The voice crackled through, unmistakably vibrant and filled with an energy that could only belong to one pony. Before Starlight could even form a reply, her ears perked up, a smile curving her lips as warmth flooded her heart. "And Fluttershy's here too! We're about to land... now!" \n\nTrue to her word, Rainbow Dash arrived in an instant, crashing down on the ground with such force that Starlight's mane whipped wildly around her face. Fluttershy followed closely behind, her descent much more gentle by comparison. Rainbow, ever the dynamo, then greeted the troops with casual hoof-bumps as she eventually turned back to Starlight. "Looks like we've grown from a ragtag bunch to a force to reckon with!"\n\nStarlight's heart leapt. "I-I can't believe it! Rainbow? Fluttershy? It's incredible to see you!"\n\nFluttershy added softly, her voice carrying a mix of sorrow and hope, "The sooner we can end this, Starlight, the better."\n\nThe presence of the Elements among them sparked a wave of murmurs; here stood two embodiments of Equestria's ideals—loyalty and kindness. Rainbow shared tales of her escapades. Fluttershy, with empathy, connected with those burdened by loss.\n\nFor Starlight, this reunion was a beacon of hope, far from the dreary administrative tasks that had consumed her. Surrounded by friends, the outpost transformed from a mere military holdout to a symbol of resistance fueled by the very essence of hope."

  fillydelphia_manesix.3.t:0 "Fidelity"
  fillydelphia_manesix.3.d:0 "Sergeant Clean Pick found himself and his squad wading through a dense, mist-enshrouded forest—another search for Loyalty yielding no results. Despite their vigilance and efforts against those loyal to the alicorn tyrants, they knew well that firepower and magic alone wouldn't suffice. However, the sudden rustle of a bush quickly redirected their rifles towards the potential threat, only for the tension to break at the sound of crackling flames.\n\n"Woah, woah!" The voice pierced the mist with its familiarity, halting Pick in his tracks. Memories of his foal's ecstatic joy at securing her autograph after a Wonderbolts show flooded his mind. Beyond the bush, there she was: Rainbow Dash, ensconced within a makeshift shelter, her unmistakable grin and wing swathed in bandages in view as she stirred a humble daisy stew over a cleverly concealed campfire. "Nice trigger discipline, guys!"\n\nPick's response came slow, relief washing over him. "Nice camp, Miss Dash." With a silent command, his squad began securing the area. "We're glad to find you safe."\n\n"Just call me Rainbow!" she exclaimed, her eyes swiftly scanning the squad, assessing their condition and morale in a momentary, yet thorough, glance. Satisfied with their readiness, her attention then turned back to the warmth of her makeshift camp. "Like the setup? Had to fix this up after those crazies grazed one of my wings." She eyed the badge on his sleeves, her gaze sharp and inquisitive. "Lemme guess: you'll take me to Fillydelphia, right? Is... is Fluttershy safe?"\n\n"She's safe," Pick assured, heart lifting as Rainbow emerged from her shelter, her wings catching the light despite their injury.\n\n"Awesome! Starlight, Equestria—they're counting on me. And you all have my back!" Her spirit, undimmed by adversity, was infectious. Highly infectious, as smiles spread throughout Pick's entire squad."

As quickly as the storm erupted, it ceased, leaving behind a dizzy Starlight grappling with confusion and a rapidly shutting door. Rainbow Dash, with her signature grin, was suddenly there beside her, amidst the disarray of maps and mementos. That, and a tattered wing, wrapped in loosening bandages.\n\n"Heh-heh, gotta admit the entrance was pretty cool. Glad my patented Rainblow Dry still does the trick," Rainbow boasted, unfazed by the havoc.\n\n"Rainbow!" Starlight exclaimed, relief washing over her. "We sent search parties, I... I guess they weren't needed."\n\n"It's no big deal!" Rainbow shrugged, wincing while she adjusted her bandaged wing. "Took a bit of a hit, but I've been laying low. I'll be back in action soon."\n\nStarlight eyed her friend, concern laced with a touch of reprimand. "You're late, Rainbow. We've been on edge."\n\n"And that's why you've got me—the fastest flier in Equestria!" Rainbow declared, her confidence undiminished. Embracing Starlight, she then turned her attention to the map strewn with friends' photos. Fluttershy was marked safe, but the others' fates were shrouded in rumors and uncertainty. Rainbow's resolve hardened; despite the odds, her focus remained unshaken on reuniting with her friends.\n\nRainbow's shining determination filled the room, a silent vow to bridge the distances and face the unknown, together. She then let go."

Keep moving," she ordered, leading her team further into the stronghold's heart. The corridors seemed to stretch on endlessly, but the resistance from the thestrals waned as they moved deeper, indicating that the main force had been stationed closer to the entrance, perhaps as a final line of defense. It was in a secluded part of the building, far from the entrance's chaos, that they found a secured room, one further modified with a guard post on the outside and all entrances secured within. Inside, to their astonishment, was Generosity herself—Rarity, looking decidedly out of place with her poise intact despite the grim surroundings.\n\n"Non-thestrals for once? To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"  Rarity remarked with a mix of surprise and composure as the cell door swung open. "This must be the reason for all that dreadful noise outside."\n\n"We’re liberating Manehattan," Mint Fluff explained, somewhat awkwardly, realizing the importance of their accidental find. "You’re free to go, Miss Rarity."\n\nWith the cell door open, Rarity stepped out, her elegance undimmed by her captivity. "Good! This place has been dreadfully... boring." The last word came out like a sigh, the momentary pause in her sentence giving Mint Fluff the anxious thought that she was putting more of a confident face than she let on. As they escorted her through the building, Rarity's presence seemed to casually soften the harshness of a crumbling Manehattan around them. "Such an awful way to treat a great city. I presume there's a plan?"\n\n"We could use your talents in our forces," admitted Mint Fluff, acknowledging her spirit. "Equestria's gonna need it."\n\nRarity smiled at the thought, scanning her squad. "First thing is to do something about those plain uniforms.

The resistance from the thestrals waned as they moved deeper, a sign that the main force had been stationed closer to the entrance, possibly as a desperate attempt to protect something—or somepony—of value within. It was deep in the bowels of this surprisingly fortified building that they stumbled upon an unexpectedly reinforced cell, more akin to a vault than a typical prison chamber.

  fillydelphia_manesix.x.d:0 "Today, like every day, Fluttershy's ward in Fillydelphia was filled with the wounded and weary, each carrying stories of the conflict that had torn Equestria apart. Fluttershy moved among them, a soft presence of comfort and care in a world that had grown too accustomed to war.\n\nHer tasks were many, but Fluttershy approached each one with a grace and kindness that seemed to soothe even the deepest of wounds. Despite her lack of medical knowledge compared to the doctors she worked with, she still tried her best. She changed bandages with gentle hooves, whispered encouraging words to those who woke from nightmares, and shared smiles that, for a moment, made the harshness of the outside world fade away.\n\nIn one corner lay a young stallion, his leg wrapped in bandages, eyes tracing the patterns on the ceiling as if trying to read in them a story different from his own. Fluttershy approached, her voice barely above a whisper. "How are you feeling today?" she asked, her concern genuine, and her demeanor calm and reassuring.\n\n"Could've been better," he admitted, offering a weak smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "But your visits... they help."\n\nFluttershy returned the smile, sitting beside him. "I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to talk about it, or maybe I could get you something to read? Or, we could just sit in silence... if you want."\n\nThe stallion seemed to ponder for a moment, then nodded. "Maybe silence... with a bit of company," he said, his gaze shifting from the ceiling to meet Fluttershy's kind eyes.\n\nAnd so they sat, the room around them bustling with activity, yet within their small bubble, a tranquil silence prevailed. Fluttershy's presence brought a sense of peace, a reminder that amid the chaos of war, her kindness and compassion remained undiminished."

  fillydelphia_manesix.x.d:0 "Having the most awesome pony in the world to scout and patrol with was beyond anything Changed Gears could've imagined just years ago. Just to have the Element of Loyalty on her side, on Equestria's side screamed awesome. "...yeah, kid," Rainbow went on—flashing that self-assured smile of hers while her eyes soaked in every detail— "Officers stuff me in a chair for meetings, but kicking the baddies outta here is a million times better!" Her searching eyes widened. "Wait, where's Loopy? I haven't seen him and his—"\n\nThe air rippled. Dark spots rumbled in the horizon ahead in unnatural, "pegasi, enemy scouts and a fighter," she recited, then pushed Gears away, shielding her partner from the opposition's sight. "Hold on!"\n\nShe blasted off. Wind whiplashed against her face: her hooves whiplashed against theirs. Their wings went limp, falling adrift in her rainbow blur. That cursed plane remained in play, its engine roaring like a devil, obsessed with its sole target: one frightened and screaming Loopy Hoops, doing loops to dodge enemy fire—\n\nRainbow rushed into the bullet storm, forcing Loopy into her hooves,. Together, they crashed into the cockpit... at least the pilot ejected, his falling plane scarring the sky. A blue feather she then found on Loopy's mane, tainted with blood. "Rainbow!" her rescuee cried out. "You're...?"\n\nBrushing off the worry, Rainbow scanned the horizon, her mind already on the next move. "Heh, this? It's nothing. Now, where's your buddy? Give me a location, and we're on it," she urged, determination clear in her voice. Despite Loopy's shaken state, he managed to provide a last known position.\n\nWith a nod, Rainbow was back in the air, this time pulling a startled but resolute Gears along for the rescue. Their mission was clear: no one gets left behind. In that moment, Rainbow Dash embodied the very essence of loyalty, proving through action that heroes aren't just born—they're made in the moments that count."

 FLY_word_filter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: July 17th, 974, Whinnyapolis \n\n§YBiography§!: Daughter of brewsters, Word Filter didn't grow up as a radical revolutionary. The earth pony earned her cutie mark writing an article to the school paper which led to her career as a local journalist. Her first (in)fame came from her scathing piece after the 997 Mill Disaster and on the financiers of the industries who'd esched regulations. This forced Word Filter to move into Fillydelphia where she worked for the newspaper Inquirer. She regularly targeted the incompetent elites in her writings while advocating for democratic reform across Equestria. In particular she was inspired by her work travels in Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, where she came into contact with local republicans. Few times she directly targeted the royal government in the articles, even daring to criticize Celestia for maintaining the status-quo at the expense of the common pony.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War began Word, like other ponies, were blindsided by the chaos and put her faith, ironically, in Celestia to restore peace. But when the princess became Daybreaker and remaining Equestria reformed into the Solar Empire, Word FIlter had enough. She joined the other ponies in raising the banner of rebellion to preserve harmony and putting her old travel skills to good use for the republican cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

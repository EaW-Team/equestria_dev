Flags of old Equestria flow but wih the alicorn symbols ripped. Their leaders espouse ideals of harmony and decry how the alicorn princesses have betrayed the common ponies. PoV would be Solar Empire and/or NLR."

    fillydelphia_civil.2.t: "Lyre and Cloud"
    fillydelphia_civil.2.d: "In the unsettling quiet of Fillydelphia's streets, Lyra Heartstrings wandered, her nerves deeply frayed. She had been cooped up indoors for days to avoid the ongoing conflicts outside. Since participating in the Million Mare March, she now found herself stranded far from home amidst a city at war. Concern for Bon Bon's safety constantly weighed on her, but her worry was abruptly cut short by a cold splash of paint that dripped down her forehead. Startled, Lyra glanced up as a pegasus mare wielded a spray can.\n\n"What are you doing?" she asked, her voice carrying an undertone of confusion and slight irritation.\n\nSplattered with paint and slightly disoriented, Lyra watched as Cirrus, her mane sticking to her wet face, continued her work unfazed. "I'm reclaiming what they took," Cirrus responded, her voice resolute against the backdrop of drizzling rain. "Celestia and Luna—they turned their backs on us, along with the rest of Equestria."\n\nAs Cirrus spoke, her hooves moved with deliberate precision, reshaping the mural. The serene faces of Celestia and Luna were now marred by dark streaks, their once-kind eyes narrowed into sinister glares under her spray. Each burst from the can added layers of shadow and distortion, turning the regal figures into images of tyranny. Around them, she sprayed sharp, jagged lines, like cracks in their armor, symbolizing their fall from grace. As she worked, the drifting fog caught the spray, blurring and smearing the colors, making the princesses appear as if emerging from a mist.\n\n"And you really think this will change anything?" Lyra asked, her skepticism hanging heavily in the air, yet she couldn’t help but feel a pull towards the fervor in Cirrus’s actions.\n\nCirrus paused for a moment, deep in thought, then reached for a fresh can of paint and offered it to Lyra."

Loyalists to both DB and NMM also still lurk around, hiding or actively fighting the republic's forces. Still, the peace has given rise for celebrations as the congress has relocated to Canterlot, ready to establish a government for the peacetime. Matters are not helped by great swathes of the population calling upon Twilight Sparkle to take the throne, causing disunity among the congress ranks. The princess, alongside her friends and marshal Starlight have retreated from public eye which doesn't help the situation. Similarly the former alicorn rulers themselves have vanished, not been since fall of their respective regimes. Opinions are mixed on them, as some recognize Celestia and Luna would never be tyrants, so something must be controlling them or have corrupted them.

Instead it reminds everypony present of their duty, to Equestria and its people. Something that the Wonderbolts forshook when they remained loyal to Daybreaker, and no longer worthy of their pride. Soarin should definately be bitter here, since he and other defectors must fight against their former wing partners. He re-iterates that this is why the S.P.S carry their badge; in memory of the vaunted Wonderbolts legacy yet also in remembrance of their downfall — and the duty the S.P.S to Equestria to not fail them again. He bellows out the old Wonderbolts motto and the recruits salute."

    fillydelphia_manesix.1.t: "Gathering Shadows"
    fillydelphia_manesix.1.d: "Starlight Glimmer stood in the dim light of the hideout, her eyes fixed on the corkboard in front of her. The map of Equestria, now a nation divided by war, highlighted the gravity of it all. As a reluctant commander of the rebellion's military, she felt the weight of her responsibilities more with each passing day. Anxiety quickened her heartbeat, and she fought to control her breathing as she tried to calm herself.\n\nThe memories of her past now haunted her more persistently, echoing a question: 'Would you even be here if not for Twilight?' Each decision, each action, felt like a step through a minefield, her mind a labyrinth of second guesses and what-ifs.\n\nWith a steady hoof, she pinned Rarity's photo over Manehattan on the map. The city's current state underscored the harsh realities they all faced. Twilight's smiling photo was pinned over Canterlot while photos of the rest of the Elements surrounded the princess. Starlight's friends were dispersed across the land, their separation a heavy burden to bear. She paused to look at each of their faces on the map, the uncertainty of their well-being weighing on her.\n\nShe then surveyed the lines dividing Equestria, each a clear mark of the ongoing conflict between Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon. The struggle had transformed the country into a battleground where innocent ponies suffered under the ambitions of tyranys.\n\nYet a resolve began to crystallize within Starlight. This was no longer about her insecurities or Twilight. This was about Equestria, about bringing together those who stood as its truest hope. The Elements of Harmony were more than just her friends; they were the key to healing a fractured land."

    FLY_fillydelphia_manesix_2_d_fluttershy_alone: "Magnet’s ears flattened against his head. A mangy dog had followed the patrol since they left town. The captain chased it away, but it always returned. Magnet Bolt was prepared for Lunarists but not insistent wildlife. The other ponies did their best to ignore the barking. The patrol continued up a hill, giving them a good view of the countryside. He grew up here, avoiding snakes in the grass and playing in the woods. Now, the plains became a supply hub, and tents were set up where the treeline used to be. The captain shouted again, and Magnet’s head hurt. He reached into his bag and took a biscuit.\n\n“If you feed it, it’s just going to keep following us,” a private mumbled.\n\n“I’m buying us a second of silence,” Magnet looked back at the dog, sitting at the foot of the hill. The hound perked as he approached and sniffed over the biscuit. Then, it stepped past his hoof and around him, nipping at his heels and nudging him forward. He looked back at the Captain.\n\n“Let's go,” he hopped back down the hill, “It must be leading us somewhere.” Hazel nodded, and the Captain gestured for the rest to follow him. It led them back the way they came and split into a forest. The treeline was burnt and littered with foxholes. Magnet Bolt squinted as the dog led them towards a stone structure, now reclaimed by nature, half buried in the ground. An old Lunarist bunker, maybe? He could see a flickering light through the doorway. Magnet watched as the Captain fidgeted with his revolver.\n\nThey slowly approached the bunker. Magnet held his breath as he looked through the doorway. Inside were animals drinking from small water bowls and eating nuts and berries. An animal sanctuary? A quiet, feminine voice echoed throughout the bunker from deeper inside. Magnet glanced over the animals as he stepped in more. They weren’t skittish. He inched towards the corner and peeked around it. Crouching over a bunny, a yellow pegasus stroked it soothingly. Her long, pink mane was twisted and messy. She looked familiar. He stepped forward, and the mare turned towards him.\n\n“Do you have any medicine?” Fluttershy asked, “Please, Angel’s sick.”"

    FLY_fillydelphia_manesix_2_d_rainbow_with_fluttershy: "In the makeshift outpost, barely holding against the shifting frontlines, Starlight Glimmer stood defiant. Warnings of danger fell on deaf ears; Fillydelphia's fate, and possibly hers, hung in worsening balance. Yet, Starlight, with her unparalleled magic, remained steadfast—until an aide, bearing a backpack radio, interrupted. "Miss Starlight, comms requested for you."\n\nConfusion gave way to recognition as she connected. "This is Site Patience. Q-R-Z?"\n\n"Q-R-Z? Starlight, it's me!" The voice crackled through, unmistakably vibrant and filled with an energy that could only belong to one pony. Before Starlight could even form a reply, her ears perked up, a smile curving her lips as warmth flooded her heart. "And Fluttershy's here too! We're about to land... now!" \n\nTrue to her word, Rainbow Dash arrived in an instant, crashing down on the ground with such force that Starlight's mane whipped wildly around her face. Fluttershy followed closely behind, her descent much more gentle by comparison. Rainbow, ever the dynamo, then greeted the troops with casual hoof-bumps as she eventually turned back to Starlight. "Looks like we've grown from a ragtag bunch to a force to reckon with!"\n\nStarlight's heart leapt. "I-I can't believe it! Rainbow? Fluttershy? It's incredible to see you!"\n\nFluttershy added softly, her voice carrying a mix of sorrow and hope, "The sooner we can end this, Starlight, the better."\n\nThe presence of the Elements among them sparked a wave of murmurs; here stood two embodiments of Equestria's ideals—loyalty and kindness. Rainbow shared tales of her escapades. Fluttershy, with empathy, connected with those burdened by loss.\n\nFor Starlight, this reunion was a beacon of hope, far from the dreary administrative tasks that had consumed her. Surrounded by friends, the outpost transformed from a mere military holdout to a symbol of resistance fueled by the very essence of hope."

    fillydelphia_manesix.3.d: "The aide slipped into the tent, his voice cutting through the murmur of the command. “Starlight, she’s here now.” Starlight followed him to the secluded camp corner, stepping into the tent where Fluttershy waited. Weeks of survival had taken their toll—her fur hung loose on her thin frame, her mane tangled. Still, her attention stayed fixed on the small rabbit nestled in her lap. Angel seemed untouched by the ordeal, oblivious to the exhaustion in Fluttershy’s eyes./n/n“Oh, Starlight! It’s so good to see you,” Fluttershy beamed, though her gaze flicked downward. “I’d hug you, but...” she glanced at Angel resting peacefully./n/n“Don’t worry, I get it,” Starlight replied with a soft smile. “You alright? The past weeks must’ve been rough.”/n/n“I’m fine, but...” Fluttershy glanced around the camp before meeting Starlight’s gaze again. “You’ve done so much here; I can only imagine how overwhelming it must be.”/n/n“It’s been a lot, but I’m managing. We all are.” Starlight’s tone was steady, though her exhaustion was visible in the flicker of her eyes./n/n“Is there anything I can do to help?” Fluttershy began to rise, but Starlight placed a gentle hoof on her shoulder./n/n“Please, you’ve been through enough.”/n/n“I can’t sit back!” Fluttershy’s voice cracked, her hoof freezing mid-pet as tears welled in her eyes. “Everypony has lost so much- and Rainbow...” Her voice trembled, Angel curling closer in her lap. “We were being hunted. She led them away. I-I didn’t know what to do, so I ran east, but I left her behind.”/n/nThe weight of her words hit Starlight, tightening her chest. She swallowed hard, trying to keep her voice steady. “Do you know where Rainbow went?”/n/n“Amethyst Basin... I think. Oh, I hope she's okay...” Fluttershy’s voice faltered, a soft whimper escaping her."

By some arcane spell, a small artificial sky hung overhead, keeping the sun forever at noon. No shadows to hide in.\n\nYet Rainbow Dash was talking to their weakest link, a guard in the know: Vapor Trail, a Wonderbolt in training last they'd met—a sign that the guards were getting complacent. They'd bagged Rainbow Dash, so the hard part must be over. Vapor's lips quivered. "Are you sure this is gonna work out?" she asked over the faked beatings of her night stick on Rainbow's head.\n\n"Trust me," Rainbow said in between equally faked groans, "next thing you know... we'll be out of here."\n\n"Then everypony flees east to Fillydelphia, we fight, we win, and... what happens after we win?" After Vapor looked up, she went on, "I mean, we're going to save so many ponies, sure, but we'll lose so many. A-and things can't get back to normal because Princess Cel..."\n\nRainbow's frown hardened. Celestia and Luna—the fabric tying Equestria, tying harmony together... Still, she put up a smile. The beatings in the other cells would mask her reply: "Think of it like, I don't know, training wheels? They've taken them off, and now? We gotta do our best. In their memory, you know? It's gonna be up to us... ow, ow, hey!" she then shouted, faking the pain. "Come on, Vapor, crashing into the wall gave me more injuries than you ever could!"\n\nVapor looked past that equally fake smile as she walked away—her curfew's up, her beating quota's done, so she returns to the watchtower, waiting for the signal."

It was Sky Stinger, former Wonderbolt trainee and now prison guard in disguise—he'd been in on the escape plan for a few days now. That made Rainbow ask, "How's everything going?"\n\n"We've got the keys for the tunnels, and the loopy drugs from that drunk thestral? Saffron Masala's stashed them in the cafeteria kitchen." A frown, though, came across his face. "Look, Rainbow, I'm sure this will work, but waiting around's gotten me thinking. When we stick it to Nightmare Moon and show what we go, what's next after we leave this place?"\n\nThat was the uncomfortable, uncertain future Rainbow hadn't thought about. Or didn't want to think about. She wasn't sure, though her voice boasted confidence. "We'll figure it out. We've got the whole 'republic' thing going on over there, so it's a start."\n\n"Yeah. I just never really thought that we'll be the ones in charge. Like, normal ponies. We'll be on our own once the flight's over."\n\n"Hey, Sky, chill!" Rainbow said, perhaps a tad too forcefully. "We've got wingponies all around us! I've got zero doubts about us saving the day. You ARE talking to the Rainbow Dash, right?""

That was, until a rustle in the bushes and the sudden focus of spotlights revealed a group of figures, armed and weary.\n\n"Woah there, it's just me!" The familiar country twang of Applejack's voice dispelled the tension as she stepped forward, her iconic hat looking much worse for wear and her hoof raised disarmingly. "Sent a letter, but it seems it got lost."\n\n"Intercepted, more likely. But you're here now," Clean Pick responded, his posture relaxing.\n\nBehind Applejack, the younger Pears, rugged from hardship, and Grand Pear, worn but unbroken, made their presence known. "We've been surviving, that's for darn sure. Any chance we can join y'all, help out where we can?" Applejack asked, her voice carrying a blend of relief and determination that reignited the hopes of Pick's squad.\n\nClean Pick, considering the multitude of tasks at hand and the prospect of rebuilding, saw an opportunity. "You picked the right time to come out of hiding. We've got plenty that needs doing, and your help could make a real difference."\n\nApplejack tipped her hat back, a determined spark lighting her eyes. "Well then, reckon it's time we got to work.

It was in a secluded part of the building, far from the entrance's chaos, that they found a secured room, one further modified with a guard post on the outside and all entrances secured within. Inside, to their astonishment, was Generosity herself—Rarity, looking decidedly out of place with her poise intact despite the grim surroundings.\n\n"Non-thestrals for once?

The last word came out like a sigh, the momentary pause in her sentence giving Mint Fluff the anxious thought that she was putting more of a confident face than she let on. As they escorted her through the building, Rarity's presence seemed to casually soften the harshness of a crumbling Manehattan around them. "Such an awful way to treat a great city.

    fillydelphia_manesix.26.d: "Today, like every day, Fluttershy's ward in Fillydelphia was filled with the wounded and weary, each carrying stories of the conflict that had torn Equestria apart. Fluttershy moved among them, a soft presence of comfort and care in a world that had grown too accustomed to war.\n\nHer tasks were many, but Fluttershy approached each one with a grace and kindness that seemed to soothe even the deepest of wounds. Despite her lack of medical knowledge compared to the doctors she worked with, she still tried her best. She changed bandages with gentle hooves, whispered encouraging words to those who woke from nightmares, and shared smiles that, for a moment, made the harshness of the outside world fade away.\n\nIn one corner lay a young stallion, his leg wrapped in bandages, eyes tracing the patterns on the ceiling as if trying to read in them a story different from his own. Fluttershy approached, her voice barely above a whisper. "How are you feeling today?" she asked, her concern genuine, and her demeanor calm and reassuring.\n\n"Could've been better," he admitted, offering a weak smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "But your visits... they help."\n\nFluttershy returned the smile, sitting beside him. "I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to talk about it, or maybe I could get you something to read? Or, we could just sit in silence... if you want."\n\nThe stallion seemed to ponder for a moment, then nodded. "Maybe silence... with a bit of company," he said, his gaze shifting from the ceiling to meet Fluttershy's kind eyes.\n\nAnd so they sat, the room around them bustling with activity, yet within their small bubble, a tranquil silence prevailed. Fluttershy's presence brought a sense of peace, a reminder that amid the chaos of war, her kindness and compassion remained undiminished."
    fillydelphia_manesix.26.a: "A level of comfort found nowhere else."

    fillydelphia_manesix.27.t: "Rainbow's Day"
    fillydelphia_manesix.27.d: "Having the most awesome pony in the world to scout and patrol with was beyond anything Changed Gears could've imagined just years ago. Just to have the Element of Loyalty on her side, on Equestria's side screamed awesome. "...yeah, kid," Rainbow went on—flashing that self-assured smile of hers while her eyes soaked in every detail— "Officers stuff me in a chair for meetings, but kicking the baddies outta here is a million times better!" Her searching eyes widened. "Wait, where's Loopy? I haven't seen him and his—"\n\nThe air rippled. Dark spots rumbled in the horizon ahead in unnatural, "pegasi, enemy scouts and a fighter," she recited, then pushed Gears away, shielding her partner from the opposition's sight. "Hold on!"\n\nShe blasted off. Wind whiplashed against her face: her hooves whiplashed against theirs. Their wings went limp, falling adrift in her rainbow blur. That cursed plane remained in play, its engine roaring like a devil, obsessed with its sole target: one frightened and screaming Loopy Hoops, doing loops to dodge enemy fire—\n\nRainbow rushed into the bullet storm, forcing Loopy into her hooves,. Together, they crashed into the cockpit... at least the pilot ejected, his falling plane scarring the sky. A blue feather she then found on Loopy's mane, tainted with blood. "Rainbow!" her rescuee cried out. "You're...?"\n\nBrushing off the worry, Rainbow scanned the horizon, her mind already on the next move. "Heh, this? It's nothing. Now, where's your buddy? Give me a location, and we're on it," she urged, determination clear in her voice. Despite Loopy's shaken state, he managed to provide a last known position.\n\nWith a nod, Rainbow was back in the air, this time pulling a startled but resolute Gears along for the rescue. Their mission was clear: no one gets left behind. In that moment, Rainbow Dash embodied the very essence of loyalty, proving through action that heroes aren't just born—they're made in the moments that count."

    fillydelphia_manesix.28.t: "Beneath the Apple Tree"
    fillydelphia_manesix.28.d: "The burial of the three Apple brothers was supposed to bring closure, but as the last of the dirt settled, murmurs broke the silence. Honeycrisp, the Solarist; Russet, the Lunarist; and Wealthy, the Fillydelphian—brothers whose allegiances had torn them apart in life—now lay side by side in death. The only real blessing was that they had fallen in different battles and never crossed one another. The gathered Pears and Apples kept their muzzles shut out of respect for the parents until they departed, then whisperings turned to mumbles and then to words.\n\nApplejack heard all of them from the front row. "Ain't right, shouldn't bury them like that," or "Polluting the ground by putting filth next to good ponies." The discomfort stemmed from laying Honeycrisp and Russet beside their "hero" brother, Wealthy. Nopony stood to finish it, and clouds gathered over the Fillydelphian graveyard. Applejack was so lost in listening to how Equestria tore itself apart that the clump of dirt hitting a coffin lid sounded like a thunderclap. She looked up from the ground.\n\nGrand Pear had taken a shovel with knobby hooves and started, moving slowly with creaky joints. The Pears hushed immediately, but one of the Apples behind her whinnied. "What are you doing mixing us with the enemy!?"\n\n"In the end, we all share the same soil," Grand Pear replied, already short of breath. "We're all kin, or we were once. Laying them to rest together, maybe it'll remind us of that." Applejack stood and left her hat on the chair. Some of the Apples behind her nickered angrily, but others quieted them. She took another shovel and started beside her grandfather. She moved far faster than him. Grand Pear leaned on the shovel and met her eyes. He didn't quite smile. "Got your Pa's strength and your Ma's grace."\n\nApplejack nodded. After a moment, others came forward to fill the other graves."

    FLY_word_filter_desc: "§YBorn§!: July 17th, 974, Whinnyapolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Daughter of brewsters, Word Filter didn't grow up as a radical revolutionary. The earth pony earned her cutie mark writing an article to the school paper which led to her career as a local journalist. Her first (in)fame came from her scathing piece after the 997 Mill Disaster and on the financiers of the industries who'd esched regulations. This forced Word Filter to move into Fillydelphia where she worked for the newspaper Inquirer. She regularly targeted the incompetent elites in her writings while advocating for democratic reform across Equestria. In particular she was inspired by her work travels in Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, where she came into contact with local republicans. Few times she directly targeted the royal government in the articles, even daring to criticize Celestia for maintaining the status-quo at the expense of the common pony.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War began Word, like other ponies, was blindsided by the chaos and put her faith, ironically, in Celestia to restore peace. But when the princess became Daybreaker and remaining Equestria reformed into the Solar Empire, Word FIlter had enough. She joined the other ponies in raising the banner of rebellion to preserve harmony and putting her old travel skills to good use for the republican cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

    FLY_sharps: "Sharps"
    FLY_sharps_desc: "§YBorn§!: March 18th, 987, Ponydena\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to two earth ponies, Sharps spent his youth exploring the woodlands and canyons around his hometown of Ponydena, where he developed a love for his community and the Coltifornian way which expressed itself in his passion for architecture and history. He travelled the world, from Zebrica to Griffonia before returning home- right before all hell broke loose.\n\nThe return of Nightmare Moon and the rise Daybreaker shattered the hopes many still held onto for a return to normalcy, but it galvanized Sharps belief that the princesses should no longer determine the fate of Equestria. Rallying his neighbors to his side, he led a campaign of resistance to reestablish Coltifornia's self determination. And when Fillydelphia rose its standard of defiance of the mad sisters, he answered the call and flocked to its banner. Fillydelphia needs all the fighters it could get, and Sharps would answer the call, for the ponies of Equestria always stood tallest when standing together. And nopony, not even an Alicorn could stand in their way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

    FLY_mintfeather: "Mintfeather"
    FLY_mintfeather_desc: "§YBorn§!: 12th of February, 972, Fillydelphia\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Mintfeather was born in the Bells Air district of Fillydelphia to a pegasi family with a military tradition. After completing his basic education at the age of 16, he enrolled as a cadet at the Royal Guard Academy in Canterlot to become a commissioned officer. He graduated from the academy in 993 with the rank of captain.\n\nWhen the Winter Revolution broke out in the Severyana region of Equestria in 995, as an officer of the Royal Guard, he participated in the fighting and commanded his own company. During the short war, he was promoted to the rank of major, and after the war, he returned to the academy in Canterlot, where he later attained the rank of colonel.\n\nAt the time of Nightmare Moon's return and the outbreak of civil war in Equestria, Mintfeather was on leave at his home in Fillydelphia. As a known loyalist, he had to go into hiding to avoid reprisals from the Lunar authorities. During the civil war, he joined the Fillydelphian harmonist resistance, distributing anti-lunarist leaflets in mailboxes, writing harmonist slogans on walls, and occasionally carrying out minor acts of sabotage. Thanks to his involvement in the local resistance, he made contacts with groups that later proclaimed the Fillydelphian Republic after Princess Celestia lost her faith in harmony and turned into Daybreaker. As a (now former) colonel in the Equestrian Army and a staunch harmonist, Mintfeather became a general in the newly formed Republican Army.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Yuri"

    FLY_midnight_lancer_desc: "§YBorn§!: 25th of August, 970\n\n§YBiography§!§L:Midnight Lancer has come a long way. Originally growing up in Manehattan, the young colt grew a burning passion for aviation and pursued his dream to the furthest reaches of the world, eventually going to Macawia in 1001 and rising the ranks in their military thanks to his advanced tactics and voracious tenacity.\n\nThat all changed when Equestria descended into chaos. Days after the sisters fell and declared war on each other, Midnight begged the president to let him return home and help in any way he could. Manehattan, his home, was no longer safe as it had fallen into the clutches of the nightmare, so the stallion went south to Fillydelphia, one of the last bastions of harmony in the east.\n\nToday, Midnight serves the Republic as best he can, coordinating military matters of the air force as a member of their high command. The once bubbly and laid back pony his harpy comrades across the sea came to know is now gone, replaced by a determined stallion who works himself to the bone. The safety of harmony is all that matters to Midnight Lancer, and he won't stop until either it's saved or somepony puts a bullet in him."

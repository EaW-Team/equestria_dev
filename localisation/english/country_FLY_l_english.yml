 FLY_word_filter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: July 17th, 974, Whinnyapolis \n\n§YBiography§!: Daughter of brewsters, Word Filter didn't grow up as a radical revolutionary. The earth pony earned her cutie mark writing an article to the school paper which led to her career as a local journalist. Her first (in)fame came from her scathing piece after the 997 Mill Disaster and on the financiers of the industries who'd esched regulations. This forced Word Filter to move into Fillydelphia where she worked for the newspaper Inquirer. She regularly targeted the incompetent elites in her writings while advocating for democratic reform across Equestria. In particular she was inspired by her work travels in Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, where she came into contact with local republicans. Few times she directly targeted the royal government in the articles, even daring to criticize Celestia for maintaining the status-quo at the expense of the common pony.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War began Word, like other ponies, were blindsided by the chaos and put her faith, ironically, in Celestia to restore peace. But when the princess became Daybreaker and remaining Equestria reformed into the Solar Empire, Word FIlter had enough. She joined the other ponies in raising the banner of rebellion to preserve harmony and putting her old travel skills to good use for the republican cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

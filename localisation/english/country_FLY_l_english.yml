Instead it reminds everypony present of their duty, to Equestria and its people. Something that the Wonderbolts forshook when they remained loyal to Daybreaker, and no longer worthy of their pride. Soarin should definately be bitter here, since he and other defectors must fight against their former wing partners. He re-iterates that this is why the S.P.S carry their badge; in memory of the vaunted Wonderbolts legacy yet also in remembrance of their downfall — and the duty the S.P.S to Equestria to not fail them again. He bellows out the old Wonderbolts motto and the recruits salute."

  fillydelphia_manesix.1.d:0 "Starlight Glimmer, enveloped in the dim, flickering light of the hideout, stood motionless before the corkboard. The map of Equestria, a nation torn asunder, bore silent witness to her inner turmoil. She was a leader thrust into the throes of rebellion, a role that felt like an ill-fitting garment, chafing at her every move every passing day. Her heart raced with anxiety, her breathing increasingly frantic as she struggled to compose herself.\n\nThe ghosts of her past, once relatively dormant, now whispered incessantly, their words like thorns. 'Would you even be here if not for Twilight?' they taunted, a question that gnawed at her with the persistence of a lingering shadow. The burden of her newfound authority weighed heavily. Each decision, each action, felt like a step through a minefield, her mind a labyrinth of second-guesses and what-ifs.\n\nWith a trembling hoof, she pinned Rarity's photo to Manehattan, the city's name a stark reminder of the reality that faced them all. The other Elements, her friends, were scattered – disconnected in a time when unity was their greatest strength. She looked at their faces, her gaze lingering on each one. The thought of their separation, the uncertainty of their fates, was a jagged pill to swallow.\n\nTurning back to the map, Starlight's eyes traced the lines that divided Equestria, each one a scar upon the land she loved. The conflict between Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon had turned the country into a chessboard of power plays and suffering. Ponies, innocent and scared, caught in the crossfire of ambitions too great and too cruel.\n\nYet a resolve began to crystallize within Starlight. This was no longer about her insecurities or Twilight. This was about Equestria, about bringing together those who stood as its truest hope. The Elements of Harmony were more than just her friends; they were the key to healing a fractured land."

Warnings of danger fell on deaf ears; Fillydelphia's fate, and possibly hers, hung in worsening balance. Yet, Starlight, with her unparalleled magic, remained steadfast—until an aide, bearing a backpack radio, interrupted. "Miss Starlight, comms requested for you."\n\nConfusion gave way to recognition as she connected. "This is Site Patience. Q-R-Z?"\n\n"Q-R-Z? Starlight, it's me!" The voice crackled through, unmistakably vibrant and filled with an energy that could only belong to one pony. Before Starlight could even form a reply, her ears perked up, a smile curving her lips as warmth flooded her heart. "And Fluttershy's here too! We're about to land... now!" \n\nTrue to her word, Rainbow Dash arrived in an instant, crashing down on the ground with such force that Starlight's mane whipped wildly around her face. Fluttershy followed closely behind, her descent much more gentle by comparison. Rainbow, ever the dynamo, then greeted the troops with casual hoof-bumps as she eventually turned back to Starlight. "Looks like we've grown from a ragtag bunch to a force to reckon with!"\n\nStarlight's heart leapt. "I-I can't believe it! Rainbow? Fluttershy? It's incredible to see you!"\n\nFluttershy added softly, her voice carrying a mix of sorrow and hope, "The sooner we can end this, Starlight, the better."\n\nThe presence of the Elements among them sparked a wave of murmurs; here stood two embodiments of Equestria's ideals—loyalty and kindness. Rainbow shared tales of her escapades. Fluttershy, with empathy, connected with those burdened by loss.\n\nFor Starlight, this reunion was a beacon of hope, far from the dreary administrative tasks that had consumed her. Surrounded by friends, the outpost transformed from a mere military holdout to a symbol of resistance fueled by the very essence of hope."

This outpost, nestled among abandoned pear farms, had become an information hub since Fillydelphia's forces ousted enemy troops. Despite exhaustive searches, Applejack remained a rumor. That was, until a rustle in the bushes and the sudden focus of spotlights revealed a group of figures, armed and weary.\n\n"Woah there, it's just me!" The familiar country twang of Applejack's voice dispelled the tension as she stepped forward, her iconic hat looking much worse for wear and her hoof raised disarmingly. "Sent a letter, but it seems it got lost."\n\n"Intercepted, more likely. But you're here now," Clean Pick responded, his posture relaxing.\n\nBehind Applejack, the younger Pears, rugged from hardship, and Grand Pear, worn but unbroken, made their presence known. "We've been surviving, that's for darn sure. Any chance we can join y'all, help out where we can?" Applejack asked, her voice carrying a blend of relief and determination that reignited the hopes of Pick's squad.\n\nClean Pick, considering the multitude of tasks at hand and the prospect of rebuilding, saw an opportunity. "You picked the right time to come out of hiding. We've got plenty that needs doing, and your help could make a real difference."\n\nApplejack tipped her hat back, a determined spark lighting her eyes. "Well then, reckon it's time we got to work.

Keep moving," she ordered, leading her team further into the stronghold's heart. The corridors seemed to stretch on endlessly, but the resistance from the thestrals waned as they moved deeper, indicating that the main force had been stationed closer to the entrance, perhaps as a final line of defense. It was in a secluded part of the building, far from the entrance's chaos, that they found a secured room, one further modified with a guard post on the outside and all entrances secured within. Inside, to their astonishment, was Generosity herself—Rarity, looking decidedly out of place with her poise intact despite the grim surroundings.\n\n"Non-thestrals for once? To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"  Rarity remarked with a mix of surprise and composure as the cell door swung open.

The last word came out like a sigh, the momentary pause in her sentence giving Mint Fluff the anxious thought that she was putting more of a confident face than she let on. As they escorted her through the building, Rarity's presence seemed to casually soften the harshness of a crumbling Manehattan around them. "Such an awful way to treat a great city. I presume there's a plan?"\n\n"We could use your talents in our forces," admitted Mint Fluff, acknowledging her spirit.

  fillydelphia_manesix.26.d:0 "Today, like every day, Fluttershy's ward in Fillydelphia was filled with the wounded and weary, each carrying stories of the conflict that had torn Equestria apart. Fluttershy moved among them, a soft presence of comfort and care in a world that had grown too accustomed to war.\n\nHer tasks were many, but Fluttershy approached each one with a grace and kindness that seemed to soothe even the deepest of wounds. Despite her lack of medical knowledge compared to the doctors she worked with, she still tried her best. She changed bandages with gentle hooves, whispered encouraging words to those who woke from nightmares, and shared smiles that, for a moment, made the harshness of the outside world fade away.\n\nIn one corner lay a young stallion, his leg wrapped in bandages, eyes tracing the patterns on the ceiling as if trying to read in them a story different from his own. Fluttershy approached, her voice barely above a whisper. "How are you feeling today?" she asked, her concern genuine, and her demeanor calm and reassuring.\n\n"Could've been better," he admitted, offering a weak smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "But your visits... they help."\n\nFluttershy returned the smile, sitting beside him. "I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to talk about it, or maybe I could get you something to read? Or, we could just sit in silence... if you want."\n\nThe stallion seemed to ponder for a moment, then nodded. "Maybe silence... with a bit of company," he said, his gaze shifting from the ceiling to meet Fluttershy's kind eyes.\n\nAnd so they sat, the room around them bustling with activity, yet within their small bubble, a tranquil silence prevailed. Fluttershy's presence brought a sense of peace, a reminder that amid the chaos of war, her kindness and compassion remained undiminished."

Just to have the Element of Loyalty on her side, on Equestria's side screamed awesome. "...yeah, kid," Rainbow went on—flashing that self-assured smile of hers while her eyes soaked in every detail— "Officers stuff me in a chair for meetings, but kicking the baddies outta here is a million times better!" Her searching eyes widened. "Wait, where's Loopy? I haven't seen him and his—"\n\nThe air rippled. Dark spots rumbled in the horizon ahead in unnatural, "pegasi, enemy scouts and a fighter," she recited, then pushed Gears away, shielding her partner from the opposition's sight. "Hold on!"\n\nShe blasted off. Wind whiplashed against her face: her hooves whiplashed against theirs. Their wings went limp, falling adrift in her rainbow blur. That cursed plane remained in play, its engine roaring like a devil, obsessed with its sole target: one frightened and screaming Loopy Hoops, doing loops to dodge enemy fire—\n\nRainbow rushed into the bullet storm, forcing Loopy into her hooves,. Together, they crashed into the cockpit... at least the pilot ejected, his falling plane scarring the sky. A blue feather she then found on Loopy's mane, tainted with blood. "Rainbow!" her rescuee cried out. "You're...?"\n\nBrushing off the worry, Rainbow scanned the horizon, her mind already on the next move. "Heh, this? It's nothing. Now, where's your buddy? Give me a location, and we're on it," she urged, determination clear in her voice. Despite Loopy's shaken state, he managed to provide a last known position.\n\nWith a nod, Rainbow was back in the air, this time pulling a startled but resolute Gears along for the rescue. Their mission was clear: no one gets left behind. In that moment, Rainbow Dash embodied the very essence of loyalty, proving through action that heroes aren't just born—they're made in the moments that count."

The earth pony earned her cutie mark writing an article to the school paper which led to her career as a local journalist. Her first (in)fame came from her scathing piece after the 997 Mill Disaster and on the financiers of the industries who'd esched regulations. This forced Word Filter to move into Fillydelphia where she worked for the newspaper Inquirer. She regularly targeted the incompetent elites in her writings while advocating for democratic reform across Equestria. In particular she was inspired by her work travels in Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, where she came into contact with local republicans. Few times she directly targeted the royal government in the articles, even daring to criticize Celestia for maintaining the status-quo at the expense of the common pony.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War began Word, like other ponies, were blindsided by the chaos and put her faith, ironically, in Celestia to restore peace. But when the princess became Daybreaker and remaining Equestria reformed into the Solar Empire, Word FIlter had enough. She joined the other ponies in raising the banner of rebellion to preserve harmony and putting her old travel skills to good use for the republican cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

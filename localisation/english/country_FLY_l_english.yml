Cirrus, meanwhile, should have role of someone who still has hope and manages to convince Lyra that the fight is necessary to preserve harmony. This event is meant to, in a way, represent the Legitimacy system, and how the revolt has its work cut out to convince the ponies about the need to rise up."

A tricolour design inspired by the republicans in Griffonia has won most support but some alternative designs have been also been.\n\nFirst choice is the tricolour but with a symbol representing the Three Tribes at its center.\n\nSecond is one born reaction to the first but also including the thestrals, insisting the thestrals deserve recognition as the fourth tribe.\n\nThird is to have just a tricolour with no symbol on it to avoid the tribalism debate."

 ### M6 + Starlight Glimmer

  fillydelphia_manesix.1.t:0 "TODO"
  fillydelphia_manesix.1.d:0 "TODO starting event for the civil war storyline. At this point Starlight Glimmer has already assumed role within the revolt leadership. I feel she shouldn't have planned for this and has been overwhelmed for past few days. Maybe she could still be in part haunted by her past? She knows ponies trust in her because she is Twilight's student. After one final paper work, she turns to to a corkboard by the wall, showing map of Equestria. She takes out photos and nails them down on the board: it's photos of the Elements. Twilight —with Spike by ehr side— to Canterlot, Rarity to Manehattan, Applejack and Fluttershy to Ponyville (would make sense Starlight met with her briefly while closing the school). As for the rest, she can only guess, Rainbow and Pinkie were at the frontline. After she is done, Starlight stares at the map and thinks what can she even do. The Elements are scattered, Daybreaker and NMM fight and ponies suffer. Yet, somehow, she knows this is what she needs to do: to bring together the Elements in order to save Equestria."

She meets her in a tent away from the frontline. Fluttershy tells how about a week ago RD flew to Ponyville and grabbed her to run away. Maybe could mention or int towards RD having wanted to bring along Applejack but she refused to leave? Their goal was to fly to Fillydelphia together but along the way they were intercepted by [dynamic loc to randomize whenever it is Solar or Lunar troops] and RD diverted their attentio so Fluttershy could get away. She hid for few days after that, slowly flying towards Filly. Starlights asks where they got separated and Fluttershy tells it was by [dynamic loc for randomized location]. Ending is creative freedom but maybe Starlight offers Fluttershy time to rest but she wants to do something to help."

The earth pony earned her cutie mark writing an article to the school paper which led to her career as a local journalist. Her first (in)fame came from her scathing piece after the 997 Mill Disaster and on the financiers of the industries who'd esched regulations. This forced Word Filter to move into Fillydelphia where she worked for the newspaper Inquirer. She regularly targeted the incompetent elites in her writings while advocating for democratic reform across Equestria. In particular she was inspired by her work travels in Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, where she came into contact with local republicans. Few times she directly targeted the royal government in the articles, even daring to criticize Celestia for maintaining the status-quo at the expense of the common pony.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War began Word, like other ponies, were blindsided by the chaos and put her faith, ironically, in Celestia to restore peace. But when the princess became Daybreaker and remaining Equestria reformed into the Solar Empire, Word FIlter had enough. She joined the other ponies in raising the banner of rebellion to preserve harmony and putting her old travel skills to good use for the republican cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 zarantia.1.t:0 "The Aguellid"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. As all things were born, so all things must die, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months.  Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "I am not dead yet, you insolent whelp!"
 
 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Menes Amasdag - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return."" 
 zarantia.2.a:0 "Pea Shooter is a rat, and he shall be aware of where he stands."
 zarantia.2.b:0 "It is humiliating, but we can ill afford pride."
 
 zarantia.3.t:0 "From the Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Agzhat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the Zonician cities of the coast - built for defense as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Agzhat, they have been good."

 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the zonicians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Emerald Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being zonicians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""

 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honored, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""

"We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Agzhat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""

Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?"\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them.""

Wiwurgh Tasawent was a slight Zebra, though just how was hard to see thanks to the Tasawent's customary blue robe and veil that covered all but his bespectacled eyes. Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza and accepted the tea.\n\n "My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." He bowed his head before drinking. Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizeable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realized there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed as he gave the cup back. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far to ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him as she raised the cup to him and drank.

Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving tribes as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by her. Food, drink, even the singuler gift of a cup of Igennet tea awaited them, with no expenses spared.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptious feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well. Every household and every family of the Ataghan have opened their homes and tents, and from the highest to the lowest, all in Agzhat hosts their kin tonight."

Years have passed, friends were lost and gained, enough scars were cast on her body to make her look like a battleground map, and those naive, fresh eyes were replaced with a steely, temperate gaze.\n\nAlongside her as she looked backwards is the Ironbreaker Warriors, her battle brothers and sisters from home and abroad. Many of those she left with would never return home, their belongings and sometimes ashes being carried in a simple wagon to the families that even after all this years, waited either their return or a closure. Alongside these fallen brothers however, were many faces fresh from her home, folk that she extended a hoof in friendship and family, when the world had all but cast them down.\n\nThe Ironbreaker Warriors are not the same group that left this village that day. Bonds carved in battle, Ponies and even Gryphons stand alongside her ranks, each one carrying their particular wisdom and experience on each of their motions.\n\nZawgha is not the same.

For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.

Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested.

We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains. We love the sacred Igennet flowers that the mighty Ijirmed leaves in its wake, and we tend every little patch we find like it was our children.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it.

Mekiouzza has seen first hoof the broken families, the destroyed cities and abandoned tents, the scorched lands of her people, and their despair gripped her heart. The horrors he inflicted on her people were an unforgivable crime, and if she were any lesser, she would have fallen in a deep despair, or a maddened sense of revenge.\n\nNot to say she didn't desire revenge, but this revenge wouldn't come from blood and fire, but by picking up the pieces left from her home, and reforge into something greater, a whole larger than the Storm King ever saw before it blighted them with their presence.\n\n"As you can see, my Queen the rebuilding of Shizra is going apace." An assistant shows her ledger after ledger, as well as reports. "...at the pace of everything, reconstruction should be done within the month."\n\n"Not only reconstruction. Improvement." She said, to the light confusion of the assistant. "Shizra didn't have schools to teach it's youth. It didn't have a pier so it's people could take from the bounty of the rivers effectively." She continued, pushing herself to stand from her chair, gazing upon the window with a thoughtful, stern expression. "It didn't have plowshares and shoves, to work it's riverbed soil into the nature's bounty. I trust those means were all given to them now?"\n\n"Yes, my Queen."\n\n"Good. You're dismissed."

None would dare accuse her after all, and yet, as they argued, it was clear amongst them the different interpretations of the oath; veterans and newly-picked representatives of the tribes argued amongst themselves on what they meant, and soon a dawning realization came to them, prompted by a single question.\n\nMekiouzza raised a single hoof, silencing the commotion, before she spoke again.\n\n"I do not doubt the commitment of the tribes to the promise, but how long has it been since those oaths were carved in words and paper? How many were here, so long ago, when they were made? I do not ask for a test of faith, but a renewal of those promises. An oath made, for a new age."\n\nShe gesticulates a hoof over all the leaders, a careful laid smile on her expression.\n\n"Look at our land, our people. How they've suffered, yet how they've grown.

Her heart fluttered with  pride as once again her people had reclaimed her birth home to the world.\n\nAnd the world laid out there, ready to know her name. Ripe for Zarantia to one day stand as high as their peers of Colthage and Maregypt. And, if she allowed herself a moment of arrogance, to know the name of Queen Umalez.\n\nTobuck was returned to Zarantia and even with all the problems and challenges to come, Umalez let herself dream of possibilities that were yet to come, which didn't help her see the lightpost in front of her, her daydreams interrupted by the reality that she was not intangible."

Virtue was nothing: tyrants and murderers could reach as far and even further than those who spoke kindly and sought to give aid. Honor was nothing: convenience overruled it again and again, and the bonds forged through it withered under the sun.\n\nAll that mattered in the end was power, and power came from unity. Bickering would break that unity apart, and destruction would follow. It was a simple and yet cruel equation, proven beyond any reasonable doubt by the events of the last years. What once had swept aside Warzena's armies and liberated Tobuck could now be driven off by thugs and bandits, all due to their lack of unity.

She made her engineers carve the arena from stone, imported radios and recording equipment, and sent and scattered them across Zarantia, together with her challenge!\n\nThe people of Zarantia would be witness to the question that they didn't dare voice in front of her: Is her people, her government, truly a better path than what they had stubbornly clung to, all this time?\n\nThe battle took the good part of an hour, witnesses clinging to their seats, and she was sure families and entire clans sat around their radios, captivated by one of her aide's surprising ability at narrating the bout! Wasif fought like a Zebra possessed, but he only knew how to fight Zarantians. Zawgha was a warrior forged by coin, and battles abroad, and little by little, she wore him down until a brutal pommel strike to his cheek sent him crashing into the sand as the crowd roared and clopped.\n\nThe next day, with the city of Agzhat as witnessed on that same arena, they saw the most vicious warrior of the country bend his head and kissing her hooves, submitting himself and his tribe to her service, until the end of times."

And in a way, he still was, just not in the way his ancestors would have neither liked nor approved of.\n\nSimply put, he was a banker of the National Bank of Zarantia in Agzhat; which wouldn't be so "bad", if he wasn't also working closely with the Aguellid as she smothered the other tribes. Her plan was simple: outlast the tribes that refused a place in the council but and to submit to their taxation or any measure of control of their work.\n\nThat was what he was here for, after all. His time as a caravan gave him the mindset of one, and he knew how to starve them: simply fund the tribes and caravans that were more willing to play nice with them. A merchant, after all, was loyal to coin more than their tribesmen if they desired to make a profit, and by stealing the best caravaneers it would not only be the most stubborn merchants that would bend over, but also their business.\n\nThey would either submit to the government, and receive aid and investment, or break, sell out, and he would be there to buy them and put it to better use. And as the clock rang lunchtime, he stopped writing the missive of acquisition from his own tribe's rivals cotton farms and left his office towards the quaint, novel restaurant across the street.

And at the centre of it all stood the Aguellid and her daughter, mediating and subtly inserting their desired topics to the discussions, which tended to be accepted nonetheless.\n\nWithout any fanfare, over days and weeks, the concept of Zarantia as a true, federalized nation, became more and more of a reality. It would have almost filled her with pride if it wasn't for the fact that the time-honored tradition of throwing their horseshoes at each other when discussions became particularly heated had gone nowhere..."

She responded, fairly dryly, and casually leaning her head back as she dodged a half-hearted attempt from her mother to clobber her in the head.\n\n"Your sarcasm notwithstanding, what you're seeing right now is an uncut diamond. A potential to be something greater than even Tobuck, if one would only polish it, and make it shine brighter."\n\n"Greater than Tobuck? You surely don't mean that?"\n\n"I don't make claims I can't back up, Umalez. One of my biggest mistakes was thinking that Tobuck could have held our weight to the world by itself, that prosperity was to be found at those lush lands...no. The desert holds a treasure that the Imzeeb have neglected for far....far too long."\n\nShe tapped her cane on the ground and looked at her daughter once again...instead of the stern, harsh expression that she had seemed to permanently wear for the good part of a year, there was only a kind, soft expression as she spoke candidly, from mother to daughter.\n\n"I want you to look at this, and I'll promise you, the next time you cross this street""

Their knowledge of metallurgy and its industrial tycoons could easily be the push her country needed.\n\nOn the other hoof, Maregypt's trading history is downright millenary, and its development in recent years has been by leaps, thanks to their investment towards the new technologies; a future that she desires to lead her nation herself.\n\nHowever, she can't play both sides, a mixed capital is mixed trouble.

Even if nobody would know who they were, the road would outlast them.

In a few moments, a radio would broadcast her speech across all radios on her country, and what better way to make the first, of hopefully many broadcasts, than severing one of her country's oldest crutches.\n\n"People of Zarantia. Tribes, Imazeebs, Ponies and all. When Tobuck was stolen from us, I've thought deeply of our future, our country's future! What kind of proud nation, proud queen, would have built a strong legacy to simply collapse by itself when we lost but a city! But a territory!"\n\n"I've decided that before my body returns to the desert and my soul wanders the endless winds, I would set upon the stone to which a nation, not a group of collected tribes, but one, an individual home we share under the sky, would stood and grow! Growing pains have certainly been felt, and many detractors endeavored to stay against these changes, but still we are undeterred. Still we are stronger!"\n\n"Yet, one topic, many wish I wouldn't topic. One that, no matter how neutral the tribe stood, still dabbled on it. To put the chains on the defeated, the prisoners, the spoils of conflict. You might be glaring, you might be shutting off these radios, but I speak of a plain truth...it has no future in the Zantara of tomorrow. To hold one in chains is to consign them to a fate not of their control, neither to their freedom, and isn't freedom one of our main values?!"\n\nAnd, on the memory of every clansperson, on every slave owner who hurriedly shut down that lasted device, and carved in the heart of every soul clad in metaphorical and literal chains, were the next words..."

Murder to her wrists? Doubly so!\n\nHer maid, Adowa, raised alongside her took the quill, staring at it for a long moment, her expression conflicted.\n\n"...Are you expelling me, Ummy? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"W-what, no! You're a free mare! Your family has been our slaves since the times my mother had my age, don't you want to be free?"\n\n"...W-where would I even go?"\n\nShe stared at her lady, her friend, her wide, nervous eyes glancing at the zebra she grew alongside with. Of course, many of these slaves were from generations, where else would they go? She remembered something Mother did for those...what was it?\n\nAs if a lightbulb lit over her head, she quickly pulled a blank small quill, writing the terms of a quick contract, before hooving it to her, and motioning her to read. She seemed confused for a moment, her expression melting into peace as she read more and more.\n\n"I hereby declare Adowa Nefertiti to be the Princess Umalez of Zarantia's personal bedmaid, until she no longer deems herself worthy of service, upon the word of the Aguellid.""

It was a mood that could so easily explode into violence, and though they were both hard-bitten tribes more than willing to shed blood for honor's sake, that same honor forbade them from making the first move. Also...\n\n"Thank you all for your presence today. I'm overjoyed to see that you take your children's first day so seriously." The teacher of this new "school" said with a smile from where he stood at the other end of the classroom, and both chiefs turned to glare at this Agzhat interloper as their children had found their places in the rows of benches. "My name is Naravaz Tifirrelest. You can address me as Mister Tifirrelest, or for you children, you can simply say teacher. And today I especially wish to welcome Chief Munatas Aqyun and Chief Zararni Amcic: it is an honor to meet you both."\n\n"As chief of the Aqyun/Amcic, I-" the two chiefs both began before stopping and giving each other withering glares as the mood in the room dropped even further. Neither of them continued saying what they were going to say. Their followers all rose up a bit taller, glaring down their respective counterparts, and the children cowered a bit in their seats. Mister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, continued to smile even if it was an ever so slightly forced smile. Gods and ancestors both help him, if these were the tribes his students came from..."

"Why did this start? Nonononono!" he said, raising his hoof as they seemed about to start yelling at the same time. "Zadla will go first, and then Takama will speak."\n\n"Takama pushed my cousin!" Zadla said, Takama bristling.\n\n"I pushed him because he wouldn't leave my sister alone!" she yelled out angrily.\n\n"You lie, just like Amcic always..." Zadla began and Mister Tifirrelest slammed his hoof into the table.\n\n"QUIET!" Mister Tifirrelest roared, cowing them both before leaning down to begin untangling this entire mess. So Zadla's cousin had been pushed, but that was only because he had harassed Takama's sister after she had tricked him out of his lunch and she had done that because another kid had stolen hers and gods help them all... "So what started all this?" he asked the two. "Go back to the very start of this whole thing. Where did this conflict begin between your two groups?" He looked from Zadla to Takama, neither of them answering. Narawaz sighed.\n\n"This started centuries ago. At some point, Amcic and Aqyun started fighting, and you've been fighting ever since. Nobody knows where it started, because it is a braid made from spite and anger that goes back since before anyone was born." he placed a hoof on each of their shoulders. "I understand why you did what you did, both of you, but I am here because the Aguellid needs more from you. On her behalf, I ask that there be peace between your two tribes.""

Neither of them had said anything to the other for the entire day. In fact, they hadn't even looked at each other, and instead focused on their work. And yet still the air was almost quivering between them, and as Zadla reached out to grab her pen she accidentally bumped into Takama, who gave her a sour glare. Zadla glared back only for both of the girls to jump in their seats when Mister Tifirrelest slapped their bench with his cane.\n\n"Did you intentionally push her, Zadla?" he asked and Zadla looked down at her bench.\n\n"No, it was an accident," she muttered, and Mister Tifirrelest looked to Takama, who also looked down. Turning around, he returned to the blackboard. Zadla, meanwhile, glanced at Takama and stuck out her tongue before quickly turning back to look at the blackboard when Takama glared at her. After a few seconds she realized Takama was doing something and looked, only to see Takama turn back towards the teacher as well. Realizing what she was doing, Zadla extended her tongue once more and turned back before she was spotted, unable to stop a small smile from creeping onto her face as their silly game continued.\n\nMister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, heard the small giggles coming from behind him after a while and smiled to himself before schooling his face. Though he approved, he still had a class to hold."

 zarantia.35.d:0 "Zadla didn't like tests. It wasn't the test itself that was the issue though, it was that both tribes turned up to hear the results. Her father and a large contingent of the Aqyun tribe had gathered outside the school building, once again staring down the Amcic across the schoolyard. It felt weird, like two different parts of her life that wasn't meant to come together, and she gave Takama an apologetic look. She'd never tell her father, but she didn't mind Takama. After today though... she had felt confident on the test, and she knew she had a chance to get the top score. But if she was the best in her class, her father would lord it over the Amcic, and by that Takama. As they stood there, waiting, Zadla realized she was begging that she didn't get the top score. She didn't really care about that, not if it cost her her... friend?\n\nAs Mister Tifirrelest came outside, over a hundred eyes turned to him as he cleared his throat to call for the students, who lined up to receive their tests from him. Zadla realized her heart was beating, and she could only bow mutely as she was given her results. Walking over to her parents, she looked down at the score... 98/100.\n\n"98! Well done, my daughter!" Her father said loudly, patting her shoulder. "I knew you could do it! You've made me and the tribe both proud today!" Zadla wanted to sink down into the ground as she saw her father preen in the diretion of Takama's, who only blinked.\n\n"Wait a minute... my daughter also got 98! Has your brat been copying her?!" Takama's dad yelled. The two girls, meanwhile, looked at each other in surprise, and as their fathers began to yell at each other about who had copied from who, the girls snuck away to exchange tests. Realizing that they really had gotten the same results, they high-fived in joy."

Her sun had set a long time ago, and she could do was to make sure the desert, its treasure, her people, and her daughter, endured the time the winds called to her yet again.\n\n"Mother, are you alright?"\n\nUmalez came running, a bit breathless.

She didn't care much for the politics that happen between the tribe, her tribe casting her out in the desert for the crime of falling in love taught her a sharp lesson in trust not the whimsical, frail link between Imzabeeb, but between individuals, and bonds of kinhood.\n\nThat being said, that was one of the few decisions of the Aguellid she fully endorsed, and she all but insisted to see it to fruition. And as she stepped upon the fields of the tribe, and she saw the malnourished, weakly "spoils of war", she simply unsheathed her sword and trotted to each one with an unreadable expression.\n\nIt is depressing to think that as she approached, a tinge of fear came over them as if they were guilty of anything. She rose her saber high, and struck each and every one of their chains, their faces brightening as they were cast free.\n\n"You are a free zebra of your own accord. My brothers will take you towards the nearest town, and aid you in finding a true path to yourself."\n\nOf course, she knows it's not all in the goodness of her Aguellid's heart. The furnaces and factories need hooves to train, and the "economy" she so hears about needs people to buy, and be paid. But, in that particular instance, to the tearful smiles, hugs, and even oaths of following her Warband, she can't help but remark on how far that naive zebra cast to the desert went."

After all, I would not have accepted her if I hadn’t absolute confidence in your abilities as a blacksmith."\n\nZudad paused for a moment, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Then, he shook his head with a scoff. "Perhaps I could make an exception this time, even if she’s an Aqyun."

As an assistant, Zadla had quite the number of tasks to take care of, like preparing the furnace’s lumps of coal for work, sweeping the floor, and cleaning up the working surfaces once the day ended. Still, there was at least a silver lining. She liked to observe Master Zudad while he was at work. Furthermore, the older zebra loved to talk as he busied himself near the furnace; mostly to complain about Maregyptians keeping all the good metal for themselves, or to go into deep detail on various metallurgic techniques Zadla had never heard of.\n\nNot today. Zudad had remained silent, his eyes focused on the ingot of steel before him. Sparks flew with each strike of the hammer, stopping only momentarily as to gauge at his work, only to then begin again, in silence. He finally stopped after several hours, as the sun had already slipped beneath the horizon, and only after Zadla had pointed out the fact to him.\n\n"Do you know what this is, kid?" Zudad said as he removed his working googles. Zadla shot a puzzled glance at the object laying of the working surface. "Well, that’s a piece of metal, right?"\n\n"A piece of metal?!" Zudad scowled. "Kid, if I didn’t think you had some potential, I would have caned you already. A good blacksmith never sees the raw material, but always has the finished work before his eyes." Zadla gave a sceptical glance at the bar of steel in question but nodded anyway. "Oh. I see."\n\n"No, you don’t. And I guess that’s the real problem here.

Pockets of resistance and reports of Guerrilla ambushes are still fairly common, she still has a nation to build before her daughter takes the Crown, and the threat of their neighbors is an ever subtle, insidious whisper in her ears; the path will be long, arduous, and she will certainly not live to see the end of it, whatever destiny it may take.\n\nBut, if those quick bright flashes are any indication, Zarantia may be starting to appear on the newspapers abroad it seems.

He allowed them to surrender and to a faint shame of his part they've surrendered to the sieging forces almost immediately. He wondered if any of them bothered to understand why he held so tightly to Tobuck, to the ideal of this fake, artificial state. The population despised them, their armies were as loyal as the coin was plentiful, and in truth, no single politician of the republic thought of their nation as anything more than a squeeze and dump investment.\n\nTruth is, he didn't know either. Perhaps he was a fool, perhaps he was a griffin tired of running from his past, and desired a fresh start somewhere far from a place that knew his name, his true name.\n\nHe picked a bottle of Gryphonnian Whiskey and poured himself a cup.

 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks_desc:0 "Agzhat was never more than a gathering place for the tribes, yet with Mekiouzza's ascension it became so much more. It has become a city in its own right, and foreign traders and interests are coming there now that Tobuck is not accessible. Though it is lesser than our lost capitol, it serves us dutifully."

 ZAR_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 ZAR_the_old_ways_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have to many always wandered the Zebhara as an unchanging and proud people, staying true to their way of life no matter how the winds blow. This stereotype hides a more complicated truth. Even if many are proud of what they are and hold their traditions close, as many are fluid in their ways and readily change to adapt."

 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale:0 "The Sword or the Scale"
 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are a warlike people, the desert breeds a hardy people, but they are also traders and caravaneers who have earned a living crossing the Zebhara and carrying goods for whoever needs their services."

 ZAR_a_settling_people:0 "A Settling People"
 ZAR_a_settling_people_desc:0 "Nomadism is not some inherent trait of the Imazeeb, it is a way to eke out a living in these harsh lands. Many tribes, especially in the north, have been settled for centuries. They have built their towns and cities much like the zonicians or Maregyptians, and they are no less Imazeeb than their wandering kin."

 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi:0 "Reaffirming the Amsisi"
 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi_desc:0 "The Amsisi is the thread that binds the disparate tribes of the Imazeeb together. Whether warlike or mercantile, settled or nomadic, progressive or traditionalist, all Imazeeb acknowledge it."

 ZAR_the_blue_sage:0 "The Blue Sage"
 ZAR_the_blue_sage_desc:0 "Tasawent Wiwurgh is a zebra of singular wisdom and mercantile skill. Having travelled across northern zebrica for decades, he is a stallion of a thousand stories and a million insights. His return from his latest travels is eagerly awaited by not just Mekiouzza, but all imazeeb."

 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes:0 "The Council of Tribes"
 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "Unlike the Colthaginian senate or the Maregyptian pharaoh, no imazeeb leader rules without the consent of the tribal leaders. Mekiouzza has not forgotten this, and she has invited them all for a grand meeting to hear them and to reaffirm their oaths to her."

 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker:0 "Chief Ironbreaker"
 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker_desc:0 "No tribe is as martially inclined as the Amsarmud, and no Amsarmud as able as Zawgha. On orders from Mekiouzza, she went to Colthage to gather all those imazeeb who served there as mercenaries and to curry favour among our old clients. Much imazeeb blood has been spilled for the zonicians. Hopefully they will honor this."

 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebharan Trade"
 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade_desc:0 "The Storm King's rampage left the Trans-Zebharan trade devastated, and it is a shadow of what it once was. It will take years for it to grow back if it is not helped along. By royal decree, the caravans shall be restored greater than ever before."

 ZAR_messages_to_azir:0 "Assuaging the Azir Tribes"
 ZAR_messages_to_azir_desc:0 "The Azir tribes are a breed of their own, and the Imazeeb know well that if you wish to traverse their lands, you will respect them. Gifts of peace will help them overlook our trespasses, and extra precautions among the caravans will lower the risk of incidents."

 ZAR_muster_guards:0 "Muster Guards"
 ZAR_muster_guards_desc:0 "The Zebhara is a place of a thousand perils, from raiders to monsters, and the zebras who take on the duties of the caravans must be up to the task. Those who buy our services pay well for our protection, and we will not let them down."

 ZAR_a_grand_caravan:0 "A Grand Caravan"
 ZAR_a_grand_caravan_desc:0 "From Agzhat we will cut a path down to Camelkand, bypassing the Quaggatai lands and reaching the southeast in record time. This caravan is more than just a trading expedition, it is an affirmation that the imazeeb are still able and willing to master the Zebhara."

 ZAR_our_desert:0 "Our Desert"
 ZAR_our_desert_desc:0 "For centuries, the Imazeeb have not only survived but even thrived in lands that others find too harsh. Part of the key has been to never simply accept the desert for what it is. It can become more, and whether it will take years or decades, the imazeeb are patient."

 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes:0 "A Hundred Tribes"
 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's greatest achievement is, and will always be, the fact that she created a measure of true unity among her people. Even after recent events this unity is weakened, but not broken, and it will be enough to ensure that when she is gone, her daughter is accepted by them."

 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering:0 "Rising up Once More"
 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering_desc:0 "The Storm King caused untold suffering among the imazeeb, yet they did what they always had and adapted. The greedy yeti chose to go after the wealthier cities instead of chasing them up and down the dunes. Though the dead never can come back, the material damage wrought can be repaired."

 ZAR_new_year_new_hope:0 "New Year, New Hope"
 ZAR_new_year_new_hope_desc:0 "The fall of Tobuck was Zarantia's darkest hour, but as always, we weathered the storm, dusted ourselves off and rose once more. We shall return to Tobuck once more, and we shall continue to build our future."

 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters:0 "Listen to the Old Masters"
 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters_desc:0 "When queens and generals march, it is all too easy to forget the vast troves of knowledge that can be found among the old warriors. Those who fought when Mekiouzza was still young still remain, and they have much to teach still."

 ZAR_tribal_armories:0 "Tribal Gunsmithing"
 ZAR_tribal_armories_desc:0 "The best weapon in the world does not avail a warrior if it sits across the country. Instead of attempting to centralise our arms production, we should make sure that every town and every travelling group can produce their own weapons as needed."

 ZAR_history_guides_us:0 "History Guides Us"
 ZAR_history_guides_us_desc:0 "Are not tanks simply the chariots of Maregypt come again? Is not artillery the logical conclusion to the siege engines of Colthage? There is little that is new under the sun, and history can teach us how to move forward."

 ZAR_tribal_levy:0 "Calling the Tribal Levy"
 ZAR_tribal_levy_desc:0 "It would be wrong to expect our warriors to sit around for months on end, waiting for something to do. They have their own lives and their own families to care for. They will come when we call them, so there is no reason to worry."

 ZAR_warrior_pride:0 "A Warrior's Pride"
 ZAR_warrior_pride_desc:0 "Beyond duty and beyond honor, beyond all the reasons to fight, lies a pure and simple desire to not lose. To be Imazeeb is to persevere against all that the desert throws at you. To be a warrior, is to persevere no matter what your foe attempts."

 ZAR_born_to_endure:0 "Born to Endure"
 ZAR_born_to_endure_desc:0 "Through the freezing nights and the sweltering days, through endless sandstorms and days of nothing, anywhere and everywhere, we will push on towards victory. The soft coastal zebras call it insanity, but we know it as something we were born to do."

 ZAR_the_desert_demons:0 "The Desert Demons"
 ZAR_the_desert_demons_desc:0 "These raiders and assassins are unequalled, and they are willing to share their knowledge with us. The price is steep, but having them serve as our scouts will be a boon unlike any we could have hoped for."

 ZAR_learning_from_the_west:0 "Learning from the West"
 ZAR_learning_from_the_west_desc:0 "Our present mode of warfare is unsuited to contemporary combat. We must develop a modern army, under the tutelage of our western neighbours. Such a force would be much better able to hold ground."

 ZAR_to_fight_for_all:0 "To Fight for All"
 ZAR_to_fight_for_all_desc:0 "The defense of Zarantia takes precedence over all other concerns, be they mercenary work abroad, inter-tribal squabbles or any other thing. When the full might of the Imazeeb is levied thusly, it will be a force to be reckoned with."

 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians:0 "Courting the Colthaginians"
 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "Our ties to Colthage are strong, and turning to them for greater insight into modern warfare is a natural. They've made use of our mercenaries for centuries, and we have many contacts among their generals. It is just a matter of asking."

 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry:0 "A Fledgling Arms Industry"
 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry_desc:0 "The modern wars will be fought with countless different tools, and we are lagging far behind. The arms industry of Tobuck is not available to us, so if we are to defend ourselves, we must build an industry of our own."

 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare:0 "The Unified Principles of Warfare"
 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare_desc:0 "Certain things are forever true when it comes to war, but the ways in which these things are expressed changes as time marches on. We must make sure to follow these changes, and be up to date with all the new methods of warfare."

 ZAR_cross_tribal_service:0 "Cross-Tribal Service"
 ZAR_cross_tribal_service_desc:0 "The Imazeeb must learn to fight for more than tribe or town. By spreading them out so that soldiers serve in other tribes, we reinforce the bonds between them, and lay the foundation for greater faith in Amsisi."

 ZAR_desert_tunnels:0 "Desert Tunnels"
 ZAR_desert_tunnels_desc:0 "It is a mad notion, but there is a precedent for it in the countless smuggler and escape tunnels dug not only around Tobuck but across Zarantia. If our enemy can strike from above, then we simply strike from below. A corps of assault engineers, specialising in tunnel assaults, can become our ace."

 ZAR_royal_chargers:0 "The Royal Chargers"
 ZAR_royal_chargers_desc:0 "Mekiouzza gathers the best around her, and the warriors are no exception. Those warriors hoof-picked by her will become a cadre of chargers unlike any that Zarantia has seen. They are the best of the best, the fiercest and bravest, they are the Royal Zarantian Chargers, and the ground quakes under their hooves."

 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense:0 "The Arsenal of Defense"
 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense_desc:0 "If Zarantia is to remain be safe, we must never stop continuing in our efforts to procure new weapons, nor can we ever presume that we are "done" with improving our military production capacity."


###Political Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_unity:0 "The Issue of Unity"
 ZAR_issue_of_unity_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good? We must come together, or we will fall."
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza:0 "I am Mekiouzza"
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza_desc:0 "I brought the tribes together. I led the war to free Tobuck from Warzena's clutches. I forged Zarantia as a concept, and I maintained it. It is mine by right, as none of the other tribal leaders could even come close to accomplish what I accomplished. Zarantia is mine, and I will drown it in blood before I allow it to fall."
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together:0 "Bringing the Tribes Together"
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together_desc:0 "Zarantia is - must be - one united force. The tribes can no longer claim independence from it, and they must be given their place in the order that now arises. Their place will be given willingly and generously, but they will take it, or else..."
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi:0 "Enforce the Amsisi"
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi_desc:0 "There are those who would not view those outside their tribe as kin, but as outsiders. They would show hospitality, but only as much as is needed, and they would make excuses when called to defend those who would come to their aid. There is a word for this: betrayal, and it is time to remind them of this."
 ZAR_remember_your_friends:0 "Remember Your Friends"
 ZAR_remember_your_friends_desc:0 "Some of our people have stood by the Aguellid's side since the beginning. They have shown more than just recognition of her ability and given her loyalty. Through thick and thin, they have stood by her side, and Mekiouzza has not forgotten this."
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths:0 "Demanding their Oaths"
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths_desc:0 "The time has come for the Aguellid's power to be based on more than honor and custom. Those who stand by her will swear oaths to serve her, no matter what order she gives. If they do not give it, they have no place under her."
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to her."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered. The price if we fail is too high."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult deals." 
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals and Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure the Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud leader Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best and Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths of Mutual Defense"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many tribal leader are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, Mekiouzza has suggested that instead they will choose representatives to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

 ZAR_issue_of_land_desc:0 "It is from the land that our riches are gathered and grown, and from where the people stem. It is such a shame that the land is either held by absentee lords or lies fallow with no owner. To begin the path to modernity, this must be fixed."
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck:0 "Our Own Tobuck"

 ZAR_settling_land_disputes:0 "Settling Land Disputes"
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes_desc:0 "One problem with land are the ancient disputes over who owns which land, or if it is owned in the first place. The traditional ways of handling these issues have proven futile. Modern methods are needed to work these problems out."

 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors_desc:0 "Even if we do not have the know-how that we need to continue our march towards a modern society, other nations and their people have. Gold is a powerful motivator, and some can be swayed to apply the white heat of technology to Zarantia."
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless:0 "Land for the Landless"
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless_desc:0 "The final step of the land reform is to grant what land that is available to tenant farmers and those who do not stand to inherit land. A new land of smallholders and independent farmers, where it is not just a small class of lords that take all the profit."

 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth_desc:0 "Where some see desolate wastes, we see opportunity. Riches beyond our dreams lie beneath the sands, and they are waiting for those worthy to use them as they see fit. We will find them, and we will use it for the betterment of Zarantia."

 ZAR_schooling_for_all_desc:0 "Everything is founded on thoughts and brains.

 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains:0 "Hammers to Break their Chains"
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains_desc:0 "Slavery is not only a weight to our economical potential, but a historical debt towards out people, for it has no place for a Zarantia that desires to grow. What only remains is to discuss how we will abolish this rot to our society."
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road:0 "The Trans-Zarantian Road"
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road_desc:0 "Everything needs a place to be. The hammer needs the nail, the fuel the engine. And roads are how it gets there. It is no good having the parts if they cannot come together. A road is sorely needed."
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck:0 "The Second Tobuck"
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck_desc:0 "Foreign investments, labor and trade flows through Agzhat's markets and factories like water, the rough diamond not only turned into a oasis, but as as one of the finest jewels of Mekiouzza's Crown.

 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have lived in these lands for centuries through countless toils and hardships. Why should this time be any different?

 ZAR_tribe_support_laws:0 "Tribal Support Laws"
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws_desc:0 "The building block of Imazeeb society is the tribe. Before Zarantia and all else is the tribe. As such, laws must be enacted to ensure that the tribes can take care of themselves and take care of their own, even if it comes at the expense of the state as a whole."
 ZAR_division_of_labour:0 "The Division of Labour"
 ZAR_division_of_labour_desc:0 "While such a term like “division of labour” may seem out of place among the Imazeeb, it is not. All must do their part to ensure their community runs smoothly and all are provided for. By codifying existing traditions regarding labour, we can ensure small communities continue to operate smoothly."
 ZAR_everyzebras_right:0 "Everyzebra's Right"
 ZAR_everyzebras_right_desc:0 "All creatures yearn to be free, and zebras are no different. By putting zebras in chains, we violate that natural urge. On top of this, slave labour is proving inadequate for producing the complex machinery and tools used in modern methods. As such, slavery in its current form will be incrementally abolished and all slaves allowed to live (and more importantly work) as they please."
 ZAR_internal_trade:0 "Internal Trade"
 ZAR_internal_trade_desc:0 "While all the people may need is within our borders, it does not mean everyzebra can easily access them. By encouraging trade and caravans between villages and tribes, all will be able to benefit from our wealth and focus on the development of their own communities."
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops:0 "The Thousand Workshops"
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops_desc:0 "We do not need the massive, towering and dirty factories of the citydwellers. Cottage industry can be just as effective and every household is its own factory producing whatever the tribes, and therefore we, need be it swords, rifles, horseshoes, or silverware."
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships:0 "National Apprenticeships"
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships_desc:0 "Apprenticeships and masters teaching new tradezebras is a fairly common method of expanding skilled labor here and elsewhere in the world.

 ZAR_duty_to_aid:0 "A Duty to Aid"
 ZAR_duty_to_aid_desc:0 "While we may not have the extensive handouts and welfare of our urban neighbours, we are not heartless. Everyzebra falls on hard times once in a while, and it is the duty of everyzebra in the community to help lift them up. Likewise, we should show hospitality and generosity to strangers of our tribes.

 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own_desc:0 "While this may seem like a loose union, it is still a strong one within.

 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed:0 "Tobuck Reclaimed"
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed_desc:0 "In the end, the gun runners threats and boasts were nothing more than bluffs and empty banter. Once again, our armies claim Tobuck and reunite us with long lost brothers and sisters.

 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges:0 "Tobuckian Pledges"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges_desc:0 "While the population and the armies celebrate in the streets, our scribes wage another battle, not by weapons, but in pen and paper.

 ZAR_restoring_old_routes:0 "Restoring the Old Routes"
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes_desc:0 "It seems the Gun Runners' last spiteful bark at us was to blow up the roads and bridges that connected our cities. No matter, routes can be rebuilt and retraced, and those who destroyed them are gone."
 ZAR_emerald_fields:0 "The Emerald Fields"
 ZAR_emerald_fields_desc:0 "The Tobuckian Sea is known by its verdant, emerald gleam, but it's countryside where the emerald fields lie are its true treasure. Now that Tobuck is finally reunited with us, it is a simple matter of fixing those factories, and re-establishing the emerald trade. While we can't get back the profit those thieves profitted from our bounty, we can however return from where we left off."
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge:0 "Tobuckian Knowledge"
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge_desc:0 "The swindlers and thieves left behind a vast wealth of knowledge after we drove them from our city. It would be folly to allow it to go to waste.

 ZAR_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"

 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city_desc:0 "The retaking of Tobuck was costly to both our warriors and the city itself.

Who knows, maybe they will stumble on something missed before?"
 ZAR_learning_from_change:0 "Learning from Change"
 ZAR_learning_from_change_desc:0 "With Tobuck finally back under our control, we can allow ourselves to look to the future.

 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck suffered for a long time under the yoke of foreign adventurers who cared nothing for its people. Under Mekiouzza's leadership Tobuck shall be reforged into a mighty city, and a true capital of an united Zarantia." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution:0 "The Hour of Retribution"
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution_desc:0 "Mercy has its place, but not when dealing with liars and backstabbers. Their words were worth nothing, and they have caused both us and our Tobuckian kin countless woes. For that, they will die, and their deaths will serve as a warning."
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords:0 "Hunting them Down to the Last"
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords_desc:0 "There is no escape for the scum who thought they could steal Tobuck from us. We will chase them to the edge of the world if we have to, and our vengeance will be terrible."
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world:0 "A Warning to the World"
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world_desc:0 "Years ago, we lost Tobuck to a band of bandits, thieves, mercenaries and cut-throats. As a flock of carrion birds they followed the Storm King there, believing they could prey on our lands undisturbed, that the Imazeeb tribes were too weak to oppose them. But now, the time has come; all shall learn the price for facing a united Zarantia!" #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong:0 "Zarantia Stands Strong"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong_desc:0 "Tobuck's defences were damaged in the fighting, but also by a general lack of maintenance. Always the fools, the Gun Runners clearly were not interested in investing on their own safety. Now that we have returned, we shall rebuild the city's bastions and turn them into impregnable forts, ready to repel any invader." #AAAAAAH


 ##### Harmonic Tribal Confederation Tree #####

 ZAR_the_eternal_federation:0 "An Eternal Federation"
 ZAR_the_eternal_federation_desc:0 "We weep for the Great Aguellid as we put her to rest, but in her wake is left a great void that cannot be filled by any one zebra. She was great, but now other zebras must stand together and each be a co-equal part of carrying what she carried alone."
 ZAR_first_among_equals:0 "First Among Equals"
 ZAR_first_among_equals_desc:0 "We honor Umalez Ataghan not as the daughter of the Great Aguellid, but also for her own efforts for our people. Yet like her, we have learned from her mother. She has a place of honor in the federation we build, but it is one among us, not above us."
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council:0 "An Ascendant Council"
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council_desc:0 "The seeds that were planted by the Great Aguellid are blooming, and the council she created has reached its true potential. It is now more than just an advisory body; it is the beating heart of the nation, where all the voices of all the tribes sing not always in harmony, but always together."
 ZAR_a_decentralised_system:0 "A System Without Core."
 ZAR_a_decentralised_system_desc:0 "No single thread in the carpet holds the entirety together, and so shall our homeland be built to endure no matter what single thread is cut."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state:0 "A Many-Headed State."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state_desc:0 "The Great Aguellid's shortcoming was that she was but one zebra, and that as power flowed from her, it lessened all those around her. Zarantia is not one tribe, but many, and thus every tribal chief must be part of the leadership."
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us:0 "The Desert Belongs to Us"
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us_desc:0 "Though the desert causes our people many woes, it is also the source of our strength. The desert is a harsh mother, but so was the Great Aguellid, and she elevated us all. We must remember that the desert does the same, and as we face her and learn from her, we will be stronger for it."
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty:0 "Sharing in Modernity's Bounty"
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty_desc:0 "Though we have reaffirmed the tribes, we realise that there is no going back. Though the sword has its place, the gun is ascendant, and though the caravan fed us for centuries, the train runs faster and more tirelessly. We will continue trading for these new tools and machines, and we will build our tribes with them."
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth:0 "The Hidden Wealth"
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "New tools means new discoveries out in the wild hinterlands, and every tribe knows that it will earn a good living from the metals and minerals that are found. They scour the barren lands eagerly, seeking for their future in what was once considered a great emptiness."
 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms:0 "The Desert Storms"
 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms_desc:0 "We may not have the raw industrial power of other nations, but we have the grit and the spirit that has allowed us to thrive in even the most inhospitable of lands. Let the enemy come with their armored cars and tanks and cannons, we will lead them through a merry dance across the dunes, and their sun-bleached bones will serve as a warning to the others who would threaten our home."
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands:0 "A Sanctuary in the Sands"
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands_desc:0 "The world is a bloody place, and countless are fleeing the ravages of war and death. We who sit in a prosperous homeland must consider that most sacred of virtues, hospitality. When you see a lost wanderer you aid them, period. The same holds true today, and just because they arrive by boats or refugee caravans, they are no less lost."
 ZAR_friends_abroad:0 "Friends Abroad"
 ZAR_friends_abroad_desc:0 "We may be watchful, but we are not hostile. Those who show honor and act honestly are worthy of respect, whether Imazeeb or not, and as the night draws close, one cannot have enough friends."
 ZAR_facing_the_future:0 "Facing the Future"
 ZAR_facing_the_future_desc:0 "Though the Imazeeb change, we have changed on our terms. We learned from the highest of us, and rose to stand as tall as her. We don't know what the future will hold, but we know that we had a good teacher, who would not accept us failing."
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes:0 "Among the Dunes, Deliverance"
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb's greatest moment was when it swept forth from the desert to deliver the oppressed people of Tobuck. They cried out for deliverance, and we gave it. As the world grows darker, we remember this creed, and we listen. Should the oppressed and enslaved cry out, we will hear them, and we will come."

 ####Desert Kingdom Tree #####
 ZAR_masters_of_the_desert:0 "Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_masters_of_the_desert_desc:0 "After so many years, the flower of Zarantia is in full bloom. The dream that Mekiouzza Ataghan dreamed all those years ago finally is more than just a dream. Zarantia, the Desert Kingdom, stands strong and vital."
 ZAR_finding_allies:0 "Finding Allies"
 ZAR_finding_allies_desc:0 "Between our strategic position and the wealth that rests beneath the desert, we are not only strong, but we are also wealthy. Zarantia is a friend that many nations would be happy to have, and we're more than happy to formalise this."
 ZAR_the_march_of_progress:0 "The March of Progress"
 ZAR_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Time and tide waits for no mare. We have only started to build a strong and prosperous Zarantia, and instead of resting on our laurels, we need to launch ourselves forwards, and use the wealth we've gained to speed up our efforts."
 ZAR_settling_the_coast:0 "Settling the Coast"
 ZAR_settling_the_coast_desc:0 "With the recent chaos, the Tobuckian countryside is not nearly as populated as it should be, and we have an opportunity here. Those deep desert tribes that still have maintained a distance to us will find it much harder to do so when we dangle fertile land to settle on in front of them."
 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads:0 "The Zarantian Railroads"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads_desc:0 "Trains are loud, noisy, complicated and utterly wonderful. Hundreds of tonnes of cargo, easily enough for a great caravan, all carried at speeds we couldn't even dream of. This is more than a vehicle, it is the key to Zarantia's trading future!"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century:0 "New Century, New Laws"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century_desc:0 "A changing society demands changing laws. What exact taxes are we supposed to apply to electronic devices? How low can the airplanes that now cross our skies fly? How shall we treat patents? There's much to decide on here."
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen:0 "Honoring the greatest Aguellid"
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza Ataghan was more than an Aguellid. She was the founding mother of Zarantia, the liberator of Tobuck and the one who elevated the imazeeb. As our capitol grows it might not change name, but it will be shaped in her memory."
 ZAR_amsisi_laws:0 "Amsisi Laws"
 ZAR_amsisi_laws_desc:0 "The guiding principle of our nation is and will always remain that of Amsisi, but as Zarantia grows and changes, it risks drifting away from these principles. We therefore will write these principles into the foundational law of the nation, so that even as we change, we won't forget where we came from."
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol:0 "The Desert Patrol"
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol_desc:0 "Traditionally, the tribes have kept watch over their lands of the desert, but as these old duties are laid to rest, we need something else. The solution will be the Desert Patrol, an elite force of militarised police that will be equipped to watch over and keep order across the entirety of the Zebhara."
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court:0 "The Zarantian Court"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court_desc:0 "Around the queen of Zarantia, a vast organisation of civil servants and bureaucrats is emerging, one that will need to be tied closely to the rest of the nation if the queen is to be able to continue her duties to the people."
 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants:0 "The Buckharan Supplicants"
 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants_desc:0 "The Buckharans are a strange people, and for the longest time, we've been content to mind our affairs while they mind theirs. Still, they are distant kin of the imazeeb all the same, and they've come before Umalez with their heads bowed."
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad:0 "The Trans-Zebharan Railroad"
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad_desc:0 "The Zebhara has been an eternal barrier, a line across the map that divides north and south Zebrica, and the edges of it thrive off the trade that can flow past it. Yet now, the technological progress of recent years makes the impossible possible; a great road of iron cutting straight through it."
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara:0 "Liberating Buckhara"
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara_desc:0 "The Buckharans call, and we answer. If their overlords maintain their right to rule over them, we will show them that though the imazeeb have changed, their ferocity has not."
 ZAR_the_crossroad_kingdom:0 "The Crossroad Kingdom"
 ZAR_the_crossroad_kingdom_desc:0 "For a long time, the lands of the imazeeb were seen as distant frontiers far from civilisation. yet now, in the marriage between the Imazeeb and Tobuck and between sea and desert, we stand tall and proud as one people in a nation we built together."


 ##### Desert Empire Tree #####

 ZAR_crowned_by_death:0 "Crowned by Death"
 ZAR_crowned_by_death_desc:0 "My enemies lie dead around me, and those who would have denied me my rightful seat are broken. My mother's final lesson was harsh, but it was one I needed to learn. Through war, death and destruction do I sit here; anointed by blood and crowned by death."
 ZAR_violence_is_authority:0 "Authority through Violence"
 ZAR_violence_is_authority_desc:0 "Violence is how authority is kept. If you cannot defend what is yours, thieves and invaders will take it from you. You survive only because you've taught the world that if they try anything, you will end them. And if they have not learned yet, you must teach them."
 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance:0 "Reaching for Dominance"
 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance_desc:0 "Zarantia's fate is forged by one zebra, and the nation must be an extension of her will. My mother realized, almost too late, that the bartering and dealing that all Aguellids had engaged in prior to this left them weak. I will not make the same mistake."
 ZAR_tightening_the_grip:0 "Tightening the Grip"
 ZAR_tightening_the_grip_desc:0 "The more those who would refuse my authority struggle, the harder my hoof will press down on them. They have already seen the price of defiance, and if they choose to continue struggling they prove that they will never have a place in Zarantia."
 ZAR_our_rightful_place:0 "Our Rightful Place"
 ZAR_our_rightful_place_desc:0 "The victories of these last years has proven the worth of the Zarantian zebras. They are finally in a position where the world will not tread on them so easily, and now we rise to claim our place among the nations of Zebrica."
 ZAR_all_power_comes_from_the_queen:0 "All Power Comes From the Queen"
 ZAR_all_power_comes_from_the_queen_desc:0 "This new age demands a new Aguellid, one who does not barter for her power, but who holds it by default; a Queen. She shall be the sun under which all other zebras live, and her word shall be the light without which there is nothing."
 ZAR_servants_of_the_throne:0 "Servants of the Throne"
 ZAR_servants_of_the_throne_desc:0 "There shall be one way to true success and status in Zarantia, and that shall be to serve the queen. The finest minds shall be dedicated to the nation, not to personal wealth or advancement. In servitude, power. In devotion, greatness."
 ZAR_the_weak_will_bow:0 "The Weak Shall Bow"
 ZAR_the_weak_will_bow_desc:0 "The world has taught Zarantia the price of being weak, and now, as she has clawed itself to a position of strength, the pendulum swings the other way. By my strength - the only justification needed - Zarantia shall conquer."
 ZAR_imperial_zarantian_chargers:0 "The Imperial Zarantian Chargers"
 ZAR_imperial_zarantian_chargers_desc:0 "The throne held by force can be taken by force, and in order to more firmly hold onto it, the finest warriors from across Zarantia shall be gathered to her personal service, so that whenever a threat arises, the finest warriors know who they serve."
 ZAR_dragging_them_into_the_future:0 "Dragging them into the Future"
 ZAR_dragging_them_into_the_future_desc:0 "The tribes are an antiquated concept from a bygone age. The Zarantian people need only their queen and their state to find kinship. They will settle and create the factories and fields needed to feed a modern nation-state."
 ZAR_ending_the_era_of_tribes:0 "Ending the Era of the Tribes"
 ZAR_ending_the_era_of_tribes_desc:0 "The tribal chiefs are done away with, and the tribes are being reduced to little more than formalities. In due time, it will be little more than a quaint legacy."

 ZAR_give_with_one_hoof_take_with_other_desc:0 "When my enemies lie broken before me, they will find that they are given their due in submission, and that their new queen is a generous one. Their customs and their laws will be respected, and they will be allowed to keep their way of life as long as they pay their due."
 ZAR_empress_of_the_desert:0 "Empress of the Desert"
 ZAR_empress_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The dawn rises over a Zarantia greater than ever before. It has finally, after decades of suffering, cast off its weakness and disunity. Now it is a true empire, one that will write its name into the history books now, and for centuries ahead!"
 ZAR_controlling_the_trans_zebrican_trade:0 "Controlling the Tran-Zebrican trade."
 ZAR_controlling_the_trans_zebrican_trade_desc:0 "Zarantia's first breath was taken through the trade that flowed across the continent. It is in its destiny to control this trade, and anyone who presumes to cross the desert will pay their dues."

 #####Oil Industry Tree#####

 ZAR_the_black_gold:0 "The Black Gold"
 ZAR_the_black_gold_desc:0 "Deep beneath our sands lies something more precious than gold, gems or even crystals. Oil; the life-blood of the new century. For Zarantia to prosper, we must tap the great deposits within our lands, so that they might fuel the machine of progress."
 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did. It would be foolish for us not to learn from their methods, and their experts have surely much to teach us for the right price. Still, many wonder if depending to foreign expertise is truly a wise choice."
 ZAR_the_oil_fund:0 "The Oil Fund"
 ZAR_the_oil_fund_desc:0 "Oil brings wealth; wealth, however, is always accompanied by greed. The creation of specific institutions will help us prevent the concentration of wealth in the hooves of the few. Resources will be allocated to projects beneficial to all."
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells:0 "The Zamfara Wells"
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells_desc:0 "Our prospecting teams have discovered extensive oil deposits around Zamfara, deep beneath the ground. We'll be quickly dispatching construction crews and newly-bought equipment in the designated sites so that they may prepare the wells."
 ZAR_advanced_resource_extraction:0 "Advanced Resource Extraction"

 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells:0 "The Zajhari Wells"
 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells_desc:0 "Our expedition from Zajhari has returned with excellent news; new deposits have been discovered in the area. Now, they may not be as extensive as others are, but they also are not too deep underground. This will undoubtedly make extraction easier for our crews."
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture:0 "New Methods of Agriculture"
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture_desc:0 "For a long time, our food production was held back by harsh environment and rudimentary techniques. This will no longer be the case; in exchange for our oil, foreign nations are ready to share with us not only their expertise, but tractors and industrial fertilizers as well. Our people will never go hungry again."
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure:0 "The New Century's Infrastructure"
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure_desc:0 "Long pipelines of steel now snake across our lands, delivering the precious black gold to newly-built plants in a constant flow. From there, barrel-loaded trucks travel across highways toward distant markets. Oil is the resource of the future, and therefore requires equally novel infrastructure."
 ZAR_the_tobuck_stock_exchange:0 "The Tobuck Stock Exchange"
 ZAR_the_tobuck_stock_exchange_desc:0 "Tobuck is no stranger to commerce and trade, but the great influx of wealth from the oil industry has brought it to all new heights. It's fame now spread all over the world, from Manehattan to De Vleugels, and the stocks rise accordingly."
 ZAR_the_desert_blossoms:0 "The Desert Blossoms"
 ZAR_the_desert_blossoms_desc:0 "It is done. Centuries of back-breaking work and sacrifices had led us to this, the moment our people dreamed and hoped for since time immemorial. Let us celebrate and feast now, for our titanic struggle against Nature itself is over. And Zarantia has won."
 ZAR_boomtimes:0 "Boomtimes"
 ZAR_boomtimes_desc:0 "Oil has brought great wealth to us, and we wisely spread it amongst the many rather than the few. Hospitals, schools, and infrastructures have been built, and our people can now enjoy exotic products from distant lands. Zarantia has changed and, thankfully, for the better."
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting:0 "Wide-Scale Prospecting"
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting_desc:0 "We can now expand our extraction operations to a degree never seen before. Thanks to the constant efforts of our tireless prospector teams, new deposits are been discovered each month. Not a stone will be left unturned."
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society:0 "Modern Science and Society"
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society_desc:0 "As more and more complex machinery are introduced, we can no longer depend on the experience of foreign experts. Curriculums must be revised and new specialised schools opened for eager young minds. There, Zarantia's future will truly take form."

 ZAR_ascent_igennet:0 "The Ascent of the Mortuary Cult"
 ZAR_ascent_igennet_desc:0 "They presided over Mekiouzza's funeral, and they were the first to call out as Zarantia was twisted. They heard the call of the goddess and they came to her side. For the first time, the Mortuary Cults rule truly supreme among our people."
 ZAR_cut_out_cancer:0 "Cut Out the Cancer"
 ZAR_cut_out_cancer_desc:0 "They used us to free themselves, they proved their faithlessness when a foreign schemer could turn them against us so easily, and they aided him in murdering the great Aguellid. Tobuck was never our kin, they were the cancer that killed our hopes and dreams."
 ZAR_song_of_ijirmed:0 "The Song of the Ijirmed"
 ZAR_song_of_ijirmed_desc:0 "As the goddess calls, the great worms come to her. They delve through rock and sand, striking from nowhere and bring down even the mightiest walls. We now walk alongside the destroyer, and dance the song of death."

 ZAR_no_remorse_no_retreat_desc:0 "This is not a mere conflict over lands or wealth or honor, and we have to discard any notions that we should back down if the challenge is too great. We WILL die in this conflict, the question is simply how, and how many we take with us."
 ZAR_people_at_war:0 "A People at War"
 ZAR_people_at_war_desc:0 "All will die one day, and the goddess calls us all to our sacred purpose. The imazeeb that does not join this cause is no kin of ours, but traitors as bad as the Tobuckians."
 ZAR_tools_of_war:0 "All the Tools of War"
 ZAR_tools_of_war_desc:0 "Though we are tasked with throwing back the sickness that infested our lands, that does not mean we must reject all the tools it has provided. We are already tainted by it, so making use of their weapons to undo them is no sacrifice."
 ZAR_return_old_gods:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 ZAR_return_old_gods_desc:0 "In this struggle, we walk alongside the great gods of old, hearing names we had long forgotten. If we are to die, we can at least have done our part to ensure that the worms remain behind."

 ZAR_like_ijirmed_leave_nothing_desc:0 "When our armies sweep forth, we must ensure that every last weapon and every last that can aid our sacred efforts is seized. It is more than merely looting, it is a sacred act during which we disassemble the very foundations of this broken world."
 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia:0 "No Tobuck, no Zarantia, only Igennet"
 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia_desc:0 "Tobuck is tainted and needed to go, but the people within were slaves to the falsehoods it represented just like we were. We shall scatter them among the tribes, and they will come to hear the song of the gods as well. In the end, we shall become one after all."
 ZAR_tobuck_burning:0 "Tobuck Burning"
 ZAR_tobuck_burning_desc:0 "With this act, we settle the old scores utterly, and teach the old, tainted world the final lesson our people's honor demanded that we teach it. This city that caused so much strife and so much contention is no more, and nobody remains to recreate it."

 ZAR_feeding_the_creation:0 "Feeding the Creation"
 ZAR_feeding_the_creation_desc:0 "The flame that burns the brightest is snuffed out all the faster for it, and though our duty is to bring about the end of the world, harsh words rocks will not avail us.

 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction:0 "Feeding the Destruction"
 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction_desc:0 "The destruction of this tainted world is a sacred duty, one that will brook no half measures. Not a single stone must be left atop another, and not a single road must be left unspoilt.

 ZAR_reverbrating_across_the_world:0 "Reverbrating Across the World"
 ZAR_reverbrating_across_the_world_desc:0 "What good will the destruction of one tainted city do? The curse of this world order has seeped into every corner of it. A cancer not fully cut out will return and kill you all the same. Thus, we must continue to cut."
 ZAR_all_shall_fight:0 "All Shall Fight"
 ZAR_all_shall_fight_desc:0 "We are one in this purpose, and no other cause can trump it. Parent, child, sibling, spouse, it matters not, and if our loved ones have died, we gladly throw ourselves into this fight to die and be reunited with them."
 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins:0 "Quelling the Ruins"
 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins_desc:0 "Those that wander the devastation we've left behind are more than willing to continue to fight. It is honorable, but pointless. All will bow before Ijirmed, and as the goddess moves through these lands, they will see in the end."

 ZAR_out_of_the_ashes_desc:0 "The broken rise out of the ruins of all they knew, they come before the goddess, and she will give them one final purpose. Our kin in the ashes stand side by side with us, and as one we sweep across the world to end it all."

 ZAR_the_eldest_come_desc:0 "The greatest of the Ijirmed have slept for centuries, deep below the desert, yet even they are roused from their slumber, and the very earth is rent asunder as they, the greatest of the divine heralds, surge forth to break the old world apart."

 ZAR_the_city_regained: "The City Regained"
 ZAR_the_city_regained_desc: "It has been too long, but finally the great city of Tobuck has been returned to us. The scheming smugglers turned out to possess some modicum of honor, and honred their promises. We now return home, to rebuild and to greet our old friends."
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites: "Summoning the Elites"
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites_desc: "As the city is restored to Zarantian control, we must summon the old power brokers and figureheads before the Aguellid. They are still welcome under her rule, and a grand ceremony will let their return to her service be a great and honored moment."
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service: "Vasile cel Tradat at your Service"
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service_desc: "One of Pea Shooter's accomplices - a griffon from distant Brodfeld - have remained behind when his colleague ran off. It appears that he has realised there are few places for his kind to run, and he has offered his services to the Aguellid in exchange for safety."
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends: "Our Faithful Friends"
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends_desc: "There are those in the city who never forgot Tobuck's debt to the Zarantians, and who were ready and willing to aid us should it have come to war. These brave souls deserve to be recognized for their honor. Friendship is a valuable commodity, and we know its price."
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets: "Dancing In the Streets"
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets_desc: "Above all else, the union between Tobuck and the Imazeeb is one of mutual respect and honor, and we view the city folk not simply as subjects, but as honored friends and an integral part of Zarantia. Recent events have shaken them, however, and we need to remind them of the esteem we hold them in."
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law: "Reminding Them Of the Law"
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law_desc: "The Tobuckians are traders at heart, and they have always strived towards new and better deals. Sometimes this is at the expense of the law, and though we accept it, we do not let it get out of hoof. Fair warning will be given, but they have always known we treat the law seriously, and they can't have expected that to change."
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance: "Reestablishing Dominance"
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance_desc: "The city is under control, but the outlying areas which have been neglected for over a year, still go about life in their own way. They need to be made aware of the change in leadership, and that we may well come to ask them to do their part soon."
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck: "Lessons From Tobuck"
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck_desc: "It is a bitter pill to swallow, but there are things we can learn from Pea Shooter and his efforts here. Not all he did came out of brute force, and he managed to balance several factions quite well. Learning from him might feel distasteful, but there is value in it all the same."
 ZAR_the_migration: "The Migration"
 ZAR_the_migration_desc: "The coastlines were ravaged by the Storm King more than most areas of Zarantia. Many regions lie abandoned, not the least since their inhabitants fled into the desert. Now that the lands are reclaimed, they can finally return home again."
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck: "Mayor Of Tobuck"
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck_desc: "He is a snake, but nocreature can deny that Vasile cel Tradat has been an indispensible asset as we restore our hold over Tobuck. His talents are great, and can think of no more able candidate for the position of Mayor of Tobuck. We'll just have to make sure to keep an eye on him."
 ZAR_the_rightful_capitol: "The Rightful Capitol"
 ZAR_the_rightful_capitol_desc: "Agzhat served the Aguellid well in the time after Tobuck's fall, but it is time to restore the heart of Zarantian power to its rightful home."
 ZAR_international_assurances: "International Assurances"
 ZAR_international_assurances_desc: "There's been no limit of the concern expressed internationally after the fall of Tobuck. An important trade city was left to anarchy and crime, after all. It's time to reassure the world that the time of chaos is over, and that we're more than happy to see their traders again."
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities: "City Of Opportunities"
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities_desc: "Tobuck is a free city, one of opportunity and propsperity, over which the watchful Aguellid holds her hoof. Those who seek to earn their fortune may do so here honestly and without concern, for all of Zarantia watches vigilantly over their jewel of a city."
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck: "The Aguellid-Queen of Zarantia and Tobuck"
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck_desc: "A Queen is born, an Aguellid is chosen, and they are not the same. Yet, Tobuck is the gate between the Imazeeb and the world, and as we step into into the world, we must understand their ways. For this reason, Mekiouzza shall become both."

 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords: "Dealing With Warlords"
 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords_desc: "Pea Shooter is gone, but his thugs and enforcers are still covering the countryside like so much mold. They resent the loss of their meal ticket, and will not depart silently. We must decide how to deal with them."
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits: "A Sword For Bandits"
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits_desc: "The warlords are murderers and thieves, and we suffer neither. They were a threat when united under their old master, but now they are disorganised and scrambling. Do not let them regain their footing, kill them all."
 ZAR_one_by_one: "One By One"
 ZAR_one_by_one_desc: "Instead of letting them gather, we move swiftly to cut them off from each other and proceed to destroy them one after another. We are not dealing with warriors, but with murderous thugs, and this is not war, but a justice found in blood."
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood: "Washed Clean In Blood"
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood_desc: "The warlords are no more, and their bands of roaming highwaycreatures have been given the end they deserve. If there are anyone out there who believed that the Imazeeb were weak or hesitant to measure out justice, they now know how wrong they were."
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals: "Gently With Cornered Animals"
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals_desc: "Pea Shooter honored his deal and departed peacefully, and many lives were spared for it. Do we think the warlords are determined to fight to the bitter end for honor's sake? Of course not, so we can likely coax them to just leave as well, and spare ourselves the losses that crushing them would entail."
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons: "Lay Down Weapons"
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons_desc: "It is a frustrating and drawn out dance to get them to leave, much like handling a scared, angry animal, but opening up corridors to the borders or the ports to them is having its effects. As long as we do not do anything surprising, they will depart."
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy: "Yesterdays Enemy"
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy_desc: "A curious situation has emerged. It seems like one of the warlords - an exile from her distant homeland in the north - is tired of running. She has planted her forces firmly in the southwest and sent a message to the Aguellid. Her offer: fealty in return for a home."
 ZAR_law_and_order: "Law And Order"
 ZAR_law_and_order_desc: "The first duty of any leader is to provide security, and the warlords are not the only armed criminals found in Tobuck. Many of them have been acting brazenly against the tribes and villages, believing themselves beyond the reach of the law. This must be rectified, now."
 ZAR_the_pacification: "The Pacification"
 ZAR_the_pacification_desc: "Zarantia's oath to Tobuck included providing safety for the people. After the Storm King and thanks to Pea Shooter, we failed in this promise for a while. Now however, order is restored, and the lands of Tobuck are once again safe."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy: "A Zarantian Navy"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy_desc: "Before the fall of Tobuck, one of the projects that the Aguellid had decided on was the creation of a Zarantian navy, warriors wholly dedicated to warfare at sea. The sea is a different place though, and it has its own rules."
 ZAR_steel_behemoths: "Steel Behemoths"
 ZAR_steel_behemoths_desc: "Warships are immense things, larger than even many buildings, and the firepower they carry is equally immense. It goes without saying that building these things demands immense expertise and resources both. Thankfully, we have contacts that can help us on the way."
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding: "Tobuck Shipbuilding"
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding_desc: "A gun can be put together by a skilled gunsmith in his home, but the notion of said gunsmith hammering away at a thousand tonne steel colossus is more like the setup for a joke. As with all things, the new age demands new kinds of workshops, and the Tobuckians have contacts."
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral: "A Curious Admiral"
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral_desc: "We are not sure where exactly he came from, nor if he actually is an admiral or just a lunatic, but he seems to know what he is doing, and he brings a cadre of capable sailors with him. From what we hear of his history, it might be prudent to keep a close eye on him."
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald: "Controling The Emerald"
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald_desc: "The Emerald Sea has featured in our people's stories since ancient times, and it has been a vein of commerce for just as long. It is our connection to the outside world, and we should be doing our absolute best to keep it open."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce: "A Zarantian Airforce"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce_desc: "The Hippogriffs brought down the Storm King through use of modern warplanes, wheras we were left having to run away. If we had possessed the kind of planes that Aris did, things would have been very different."
 ZAR_eyes_in_sky: "Eyes In Sky"
 ZAR_eyes_in_sky_desc: "A leader must know what is going on during battle, and when one soars through the clouds at dizzying speeds, it is an entirely new world that is opened. The warriors who fly across these battlefields are something different, and we'll need to accept learning from wherever we can find it."
 ZAR_sky_warriors: "Sky Warriors"
 ZAR_sky_warriors_desc: "The foundations of aerial might is the fighter plane; a raider able to move swiftly and strike against all that would threaten our warriors below. They are a warrior's shield and first into the fight, and they will demand much of those we choose for this role."
 ZAR_flying_artillery: "Flying Artillery"
 ZAR_flying_artillery_desc: "An artillery shell weighs maybe 50 kilos, and we've seen what such a weapon can do to an entire warband. What then can a shell ten times as heavy, not fired from many kilometers away but dropped straight from above on them, do?"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers: "The Skywalkers"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers_desc: "Those who fight in the skies are a nigh tribe unto themselves, with customs and beliefs that will by necessity come to differ from their land-fighting kin. We shuldn't shy away from this, but rather embrace it. Let the Igenwan fly high, and let their stories reverberate through our history!"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare: "New Ways Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare_desc: "The menagerie of bandits, thugs and mercenaries that infested Tobuck might have been a plague, but it was a capable one. They would not have held out against the attempts to dislodge them if they hadn't been. It is just as well that we accept this fact, and study what they did to see what we can learn from it."
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare: "New Tools Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare_desc: "The age where a rifle and a sword could carry a warrior to victory is long gone; the Storm King and his eventual defeat proved that. War is like a diamond, possessing many facets, and each one must be polished to an absolute shine."
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior: "A Hybrid Warrior"
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior_desc: "It is the Imazeeb way to adapt to her surroundings, and with the plethora of painful lessons we have gotten in recent years, the time has come to adapt more than ever before. The traditional warrior must die, and in its place something new - the unity of two worlds - must be born."
 ZAR_the_martial_elite: "The Martial Elite"
 ZAR_the_martial_elite_desc: "War is a craft, one that can take a lifetime to truly master, and like with many other crafts it has changed. With a thousand tools at the crafter's disposal, it takes immense training to master them all. War is no different, and this new era will be one where the masters will shine."
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds: "Dominating The Wilds"
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds_desc: "Moving forward does not mean to discard what you are, but it does mean you must question some things. The Imazeeb have always been masters of desert warfare, but did she rely on that too much? Tobuck is more than just desert, and we have new lessons to learn here."
 ZAR_the_big_guns: "The Big Guns"
 ZAR_the_big_guns_desc: "Whatever skills a warrior possesses, they will not avail him if he is blown to bits before even reaching the battlefield. These heavy guns will be crucial to warfare going ahead."
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge: "Importing the Knowledge of Warfare"
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge_desc: "There are many places across the world that has seen war on a scale we can scarcely imagine, and whose peoples have learned many hard lessons about war. We should make sure to listen to them, and gain the lessons they learned without paying the price they had to."
 ZAR_holding_the_line: "Holding The Line"
 ZAR_holding_the_line_desc: "Imazeeb warfare has long been built on mobility, but if we are to protect Tobuck in the future, we must reconsider this attitude. While mobility will avail our forces, there will also be times where we must dig our hooves in and let the enemy break against us."
 ZAR_the_bulwark: "The Bulwark"
 ZAR_the_bulwark_desc: "It doesn't matter how fast a warrior runs, or how quickly he adapts, if everywhere he attacks he will find deep tunnels and fortified bunkers waiting for him. We know what we fight to protect, and every drop of sweat spilled in building will pay dividends in blood."

 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold: "City Of Wonders And Gold"
 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold_desc: "Tobuck is as she always has been, and she has always been a wondrous city. Outsiders will preen and say 'well OUR city is greater' but they can eat sand. To us, Tobuck is a shining jewel, and the wealth and industrial might she offers us is the greatest prize."
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess: "Cleaning Up The Mess"
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess_desc: "Pea Shooter left the city in a right state. Having been more interested in plundering the Storm King's arsenal than keeping the city in order, we are now left with an entire year of economic development wiped from the books. We are, in essence, starting from scratch."
 ZAR_taking_stock: "Taking Stock"
 ZAR_taking_stock_desc: ""If it has not been measured, weighed and registered, it does not exist, and the Aguellid will claim it as hers when she finds it." These words have lit a fire under the Tobuckians, and they are more than eager to register their property, their companies and their businesses with us."
 ZAR_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 ZAR_modern_agriculture_desc: "Not even the farmer's field is safe from the march of progress, with strange new machines, fertilisers and countless new innovations making the fields more fertile than ever. Famine will truly be a thing of history going ahead."

 ZAR_reopening_the_factories_desc: "It has taken time, and in a couple of cases chasing down the thieves that had seized the tools and machinery, but finally the factories of Tobuck are starting to work again."
 ZAR_sprawling_roads: "Sprawling Roads"
 ZAR_sprawling_roads_desc: ""All roads lead to Tobuck" a merchant once told Mekiouzza. Admittedly he was looking to sell her something at the time, but the expression has stuck with the Aguellid ever since. If it is not true, then why not make it true?"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics: "Schools and Clinics"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics_desc: "All this change and development is pointless if it does not benefit the entirety of our people, especially the children. Those are for whom we build this new world after all, and they need new teachers to find their place in this world as well as doctors to save them from disease or injury."
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors: "Age Of Prospectors"
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors_desc: "There is wealth out in the desert, but many times we do not know what we look for. Finding iron is one thing, but what are you supposed to look for when looking for tungsten or chromium? We'll invite any prospectors willing to come to look, and to know that we pay well for any deposits they find."
 ZAR_cash_crops: "Cash Crops"
 ZAR_cash_crops_desc: "With Tobuck's fields once again under our control, and with the food supply ensured, we can start making good use of the fields for more than just sustenance farming. There is a deep thirst in the world for things like coffee or tobacco, and we grow it well here."
 ZAR_the_trading_port: "The Trading Port"
 ZAR_the_trading_port_desc: "Tobuck's port is more than just a port, it is the gateway into all of Zarantia, and it should be one of the finest in all of northern Zebrica. The time of tripping over each other and fighting for space is over, now Tobuck shall welcome everycreature who wishes to come."
 ZAR_finally_industrialising: "Finally Industrialising"
 ZAR_finally_industrialising_desc: "With Tobuck back in prime shape, we can finally embark on that glorious old plan from years ago to let the new industry and commerce flow from Tobuck out into the rest of Zarantia. After all, when the answer to "how are we meant to industrialise" is simply to point at Tobuck and say "do that", it is much easier."
 ZAR_trade_is_king: "Trade is King"
 ZAR_trade_is_king_desc: "War and Trade have been the foundations of imazeeb life for a long time, but this too is changing. Raiding, mercenary work or tribal conflicts are becoming a thing of the past, as we all are united around the pursuit and facilitation of trade."
 ZAR_the_great_dam: "The Great Dam"
 ZAR_the_great_dam_desc: "We have worked the desert and irrigated it for centuries, and if there is any area where the modern developments thrill us, it is here. Going ahead, the desert is going to become ours to mold as we wish on a scale never before seen."

 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel_desc: "When you cross the oceans and pass by Maregypt into the Emerald Sea, you come upon Tobuck, a trading city of prosperity and progress. This city stands between worlds, be it Maregyptians or Imazeeb, Zebrica or Equus/Griffonia, or any other, but all are home here. Welcome to Tobuck, home and opportunity for anycreature."

 ZAR_revolt_against_the_modern_world:0 "Revolt Against the Modern World"
 ZAR_revolt_against_the_modern_world_desc:0 "The madness must come to an end! We have been marched to the very brink by power hungry tyrants, and in all their hollow talk of "progress" and "modernity" they forgot to ask whether this was something any of us wanted. We now give our answer: no!"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people:0 "Return the Land to the Tribes"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people_desc:0 "Land was the first thing they sought to take from us, and we take it back. We till the land and thus it is ours, and no amount of long-winded bleating by city creatures who never worked a day in their lives can convince us otherwise."
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders:0 "Restore Tribal Elders to Power"
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders_desc:0 "Give a creature an inch and they take a mile, that is the truth of all autocrats, and restoring our own leaders is long overdue. The Aguellid has one duty only, and we will not allow whoever holds that position to forget that in the future."
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians:0 "Peasants, Not Proletarians"
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians_desc:0 "Though we have gotten some aid from the so called Marksists in other nations, we aren't so deluded to think that they are kin. Farming and trade is our lifeblood, not industry. Besides, someone who calls your way of life "the idiocy of rural life" shows they're no kin of yours." 
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert:0 "True Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert_desc:0 "We defend what is ours, and we do so by tooth and hoof to the bitter end. Nocreature has truly conquered the imazeeb, and nocreature ever will, not as long as we never forget the price of submitting."
 ZAR_trade_not_factories:0 "Trade, not Factories"
 ZAR_trade_not_factories_desc:0 "For centuries, our lifeblood has been trade, and that will remain the case. We still provide something no other creature can - safe passage across the zebhara - and that will not change."
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand:0 "Farms in the Sand"
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand_desc:0 "We coax the desert to give what little it can, and over time, we have come to provide for ourselves. This is more than a grim necessity, this is our greatest achievment, and we should be proud of it!"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity:0 "Antiquity with Modern Elements"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity_desc:0 "We reject the outsiders' ways because they would destroy ours, but that does not mean we should reject it all out of hand. There are still valuable lessons to learn, as long as they don't challenge our way of life."
 ZAR_no_exceptions:0 "No Exceptions"
 ZAR_no_exceptions_desc:0 "The outsiders' ways are a disease, and it does not matter how useful they might seem. Let one rat into the home, and you will soon have a thousand. We have no use for that which we cannot create ourselves."
 ZAR_desert_ambushes:0 "Desert Ambushes"
 ZAR_desert_ambushes_desc:0 "If an enemy comes for you, you run. You run deep into the desert, taking water where you can and lead him on a merry chase only to turn around and kill him when he's exhausted and delirious from the heat."
 ZAR_continue_flowering:0 "Continue the Flowering"
 ZAR_continue_flowering_desc:0 "Our great works in the desert are living proof that we do not need the outsiders. Are the Maregyptians making desert into farmland like we do? The Colthaginians? No, the imazeeb alone know how to make these lands fertile."
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling:0 "Encourage Desert Settling"
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert may be harsh and unforgiving, but at least it does not try to break your people and make you something you're not. Our people have claimed swathes of the desert and made it livable before, and can do so again."
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck:0 "Deindustrialize Tobuck"
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck_desc:0 "That damned city has caused us no end of woes at this point, but the cause is too obvious. The Tobuckians have been steeped in industry and wealth, and like strong drink it has gone to their heads. We'll tear the bottle out of their hooves, and after that, maybe we can finally find accord."
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling:0 "Enforce Desert Settling"
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert is tamed through tireless work, but our people is loathe to accept others telling them what to do. Yet, if there is any place where we should push to encourage, it is in the irrigation efforts."
 ZAR_hidden_supplies:0 "Hidden Supplies"
 ZAR_hidden_supplies_desc:0 "They say that we live off sand and sunlight, and they can continue to think that. In truth, we just know how to hide supplies across the desert, and the task of creating these stockpiles is a revered position. The desert kills the unprepared, and we are always prepared."
 ZAR_community_and_tradition:0 "Community and Tradition"
 ZAR_community_and_tradition_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have endured since time immemorial through two great pillars: an eternal respect for tradition, and an ironclad community. That is all that we have ever truly needed, and we will sttle for this. We are imazeeb, no matter what the world tries to make us."

 #### Leader Descriptions ####

 ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of February 941 in northern Zarantia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of the leader of the Ataghan tribe. Ever the precocious child, her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the imazeeb tribes in throwing off the Warzenan yoke. Though not even a chief, she was the first to pledge herself to aid them and managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs as well.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"

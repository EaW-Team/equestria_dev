 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. As all things were born, so all things must die, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months.  Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."

Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return.""

 zarantia.3.t:0 "From the Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Agzhat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the Zonician cities of the coast - built for defense as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Agzhat, they have been good."

 zarantia.4.t:0 "A Changing World" 
 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the zonicians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Emerald Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being zonicians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""

 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honored, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""

 zarantia.6.d:0 ""The zonicians are an amusing sort." Mekiouzza said out of the blue. "We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Agzhat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""

"She is a dangerous mare, maybe even the most dangerous mare you will meet."\n\n"I've heard the stories of her, but all they say is that she fights her enemies, not her allies. Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?"\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them.""

Wiwurgh Tasawent was a slight Zebra, though just how was hard to see thanks to the Tasawent's customary blue robe and veil that covered all but his bespectacled eyes. Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza and accepted the tea.\n\n"My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." He bowed his head before drinking. Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizeable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realized there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed as he gave the cup back. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far to ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him as she raised the cup to him and drank.

Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving tribes as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by her. Food, drink, even the singular gift of a cup of Igennet tea awaited them, with no expenses spared.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptuous feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well. Every household and every family of the Ataghan have opened their homes and tents, and from the highest to the lowest, all in Agzhat hosts their kin tonight."

Years have passed, friends were lost and gained, enough scars were cast on her body to make her look like a battleground map, and those naive, fresh eyes were replaced with a steely, temperate gaze.\n\nAlongside her as she looked backwards is the Ironbreaker Warriors, her battle brothers and sisters from home and abroad. Many of those she left with would never return home, their belongings and sometimes ashes being carried in a simple wagon to the families that even after all this years, waited either their return or a closure. Alongside these fallen brothers however, were many faces fresh from her home, folk that she extended a hoof in friendship and family, when the world had all but cast them down.\n\nThe Ironbreaker Warriors are not the same group that left this village that day. Bonds carved in battle, Ponies and even Gryphons stand alongside her ranks, each one carrying their particular wisdom and experience on each of their motions.\n\nZawgha is not the same. But, as she gazed upon the village of Ausert, and how unchanged it was from her own memories, she allowed herself a nostalgic sigh."

 zarantia.11.d:0 "Much of the tribes' wealth was built not on warfare, but on trade. For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.

Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested.

 zarantia.13.d:0 "The Zonicians believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains. We love the sacred Igennet flowers that the mighty Ijirmed leaves in its wake, and we tend every little patch we find like it was our children.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it.

Mekiouzza has seen first hoof the broken families, the destroyed cities and abandoned tents, the scorched lands of her people, and their despair gripped her heart. The horrors he inflicted on her people were an unforgivable crime, and if she were any lesser, she would have fallen in a deep despair, or a maddened sense of revenge.\n\nNot to say she didn't desire revenge, but this revenge wouldn't come from blood and fire, but by picking up the pieces left from her home, and reforge into something greater, a whole larger than the Storm King ever saw before it blighted them with their presence.\n\n"As you can see, my Queen the rebuilding of Shizra is going apace." An assistant shows her ledger after ledger, as well as reports. "...at the pace of everything, reconstruction should be done within the month."\n\n"Not only reconstruction. Improvement." She said, to the light confusion of the assistant. "Shizra didn't have schools to teach it's youth. It didn't have a pier so it's people could take from the bounty of the rivers effectively." She continued, pushing herself to stand from her chair, gazing upon the window with a thoughtful, stern expression. "It didn't have plowshares and shoves, to work it's riverbed soil into the nature's bounty. I trust those means were all given to them now?"\n\n"Yes, my Queen."\n\n"Good. You're dismissed."

None would dare accuse her after all, and yet, as they argued, it was clear amongst them the different interpretations of the oath; veterans and newly-picked representatives of the tribes argued amongst themselves on what they meant, and soon a dawning realization came to them, prompted by a single question.\n\nMekiouzza raised a single hoof, silencing the commotion, before she spoke again.\n\n"I do not doubt the commitment of the tribes to the promise, but how long has it been since those oaths were carved in words and paper? How many were here, so long ago, when they were made? I do not ask for a test of faith, but a renewal of those promises. An oath made, for a new age."\n\nShe gesticulates a hoof over all the leaders, a careful laid smile on her expression.\n\n"Look at our land, our people. How they've suffered, yet how they've grown. Even with the loss of Tobuck, the people of Zarantia rebuilt themselves, into something new. And a new Zarantia requires a renewed Confederation, a renewed vow.

Her heart fluttered with  pride as once again her people had reclaimed her birth home to the world.\n\nAnd the world laid out there, ready to know her name. Ripe for Zarantia to one day stand as high as their peers of Colthage and Maregypt. And, if she allowed herself a moment of arrogance, to know the name of Queen Umalez.\n\nTobuck was returned to Zarantia and even with all the problems and challenges to come, Umalez let herself dream of possibilities that were yet to come, which didn't help her see the lightpost in front of her, her daydreams interrupted by the reality that she was not intangible."

Virtue was nothing: tyrants and murderers could reach as far and even further than those who spoke kindly and sought to give aid. Honor was nothing: convenience overruled it again and again, and the bonds forged through it withered under the sun.\n\nAll that mattered in the end was power, and power came from unity. Bickering would break that unity apart, and destruction would follow. It was a simple and yet cruel equation, proven beyond any reasonable doubt by the events of the last years.

But, as Umalez herself brought to her attention during one of her endless studying sessions, it offered something new: Unity and Presence.\n\nAgzhat was far from many territories, and the more venerable tribes would hesitate to send their elders here for brief affairs. Yet if they came here, and the sessions were plentiful enough, they would likely have to take residence within the city and need to communicate things back to their respective tribes.\n\nOn paper, it would seem she's giving up parts of her power, but the streamlining of the process of communicating with her people, and the convenience just meant that she simply could push more, quicker. With a giddiness she hadn't felt in ages she, her daughter, and a few trusted aides put pen to quill, and sign up the structure of the Tribal Council, as well as the invitations for every tribe her census could measure.\n\nThey would be more welcome to join, after all. And those that didn't, wouldn't complain if she just turned to them a blind eye. They would believe they were giving them more leeway when in truth, it all just meant giving her the power they stubbornly clung to."
 zarantia.23.a:0 "Maybe there's more to this democracy thing than she thought of!"

 zarantia.24.t:0 "Only One Real Choice" 
 zarantia.24.d:0 "One of the most stubborn tribes to bend to her hooves was the Talat. No amount of wrangling, negotiation nor threats would make them bow. Warriors to the very last one; birthed from exiles from other tribes to the harsh central deserts of Zarantia, the Talat had for centuries thrived on conflict, slavery, and conquest, and no symbol of that was mightier than their chief, Wasif.\n\nAnd as her representatives weren't even given the time of day, she simply laid to him a challenge. A duel, against her own finest general. If they won they could have what they desired from her. She'd turn a blind eye to them and never bother them again, but if Wasif fell they would submit, wholly and fully, to her cause.\n\nShe didn't spare a single zhekelt o broadcast that. She made her engineers carve the arena from stone, imported radios and recording equipment, and sent and scattered them across Zarantia, together with her challenge!\n\nThe people of Zarantia would be witness to the question that they didn't dare voice in front of her: Is her people, her government, truly a better path than what they had stubbornly clung to, all this time?\n\nThe battle took the good part of an hour, witnesses clinging to their seats, and she was sure families and entire tribes sat around their radios, captivated by one of her aide's surprising ability at narrating the bout! Wasif fought like a Zebra possessed, but he only knew how to fight Zarantians. Zawgha was a warrior forged by coin, and battles abroad, and little by little, she wore him down until a brutal pommel strike to his cheek sent him crashing into the sand as the crowd roared and clopped.\n\nThe next day, with the city of Agzhat as witnessed on that same arena, they saw the most vicious warrior of the country bend his head and kissing her hooves, submitting himself and his tribe to her service, until the end of times."

 zarantia.25.d:0 "Malikii thought all his life he would have lived, breathed, and died a caravan worker just like his mother, and her mother before her. And in a way, he still was, just not in the way his ancestors would have neither liked nor approved of.\n\nSimply put, he was a banker of the National Bank of Zarantia in Agzhat; which wouldn't be so "bad", if he wasn't also working closely with the Aguellid as she smothered the other tribes. Her plan was simple: outlast the tribes that refused a place in the council but and to submit to their taxation or any measure of control of their work.\n\nThat was what he was here for, after all. His time as a caravan gave him the mindset of one, and he knew how to starve them: simply fund the tribes and caravans that were more willing to play nice with them. A merchant, after all, was loyal to coin more than their tribesmen if they desired to make a profit, and by stealing the best caravaneers it would not only be the most stubborn merchants that would bend over, but also their business.\n\nThey would either submit to the government, and receive aid and investment, or break, sell out, and he would be there to buy them and put it to better use. And as the clock rang lunchtime, he stopped writing the missive of acquisition from his own tribe's rivals cotton farms and left his office towards the quaint, novel restaurant across the street. Maybe he could meet Addae, he'd been dying to ask her out on a date."
 zarantia.25.a:0 ""Ah, I should send a letter to mother, too. Her home is ready to move into!""

 zarantia.26.t:0 "The Resplendent Confederation" 
 zarantia.26.d:0 "The Council was and would forever be a battlefield of bickering chieftains and representatives trying to throw their weight around until others were sufficiently intimidated. But, for the time she had worked here, she had noticed how much the nuances changed; the chieftains and representatives began to to pick nicer topics, the older chieftains steadily replaced by fresher, younger faces that could keep up with the chaotic screaming.\n\nIt wasn't just their looks too, but their words: "Our tribe" became "our tribes", rivalries went from loudly proclaimed to implied, and words went from shallow assurances to a genuine desire to improve matters, even if their particular "powerbase" would benefit the most. And at the centre of it all stood the Aguellid and her daughter, mediating and subtly inserting their desired topics to the discussions, which tended to be accepted nonetheless.\n\nWithout any fanfare, over days and weeks, the concept of Zarantia as a true, federalized nation, became more and more of a reality. It would have almost filled her with pride if it wasn't for the fact that the time-honored tradition of throwing their horseshoes at each other when discussions became particularly heated had gone nowhere..."
 zarantia.26.a:0 "The Aguellid's doctors have gotten much more work recently."

 zarantia.27.t:0 "The Desert Jewel" 
 zarantia.27.d:0 ""You see all this, daughter of mine?"\n\nUmalez raised her brow and looked out across the capital of Agzhat. The humble, mud-brick building, its dirt paths, its crops growing alongside the river bed; a humble, fair city that one wouldn't think was probably the most settled city of Zarantia, the head of their government ever since Pea Shooter and his ilk stole Tobuck from them.\n\n"Yes, mother, I see our capital every day." She responded, fairly dryly, and casually leaning her head back as she dodged a half-hearted attempt from her mother to clobber her in the head.\n\n"Your sarcasm notwithstanding, what you're seeing right now is an uncut diamond. A potential to be something greater than even Tobuck, if one would only polish it, and make it shine brighter."\n\n"Greater than Tobuck? You surely don't mean that?"\n\n"I don't make claims I can't back up, Umalez. One of my biggest mistakes was thinking that Tobuck could have held our weight to the world by itself, that prosperity was to be found at those lush lands...no. The desert holds a treasure that the Imzeeb have neglected for far....far too long."\n\nShe tapped her cane on the ground and looked at her daughter once again...instead of the stern, harsh expression that she had seemed to permanently wear for the good part of a year, there was only a kind, soft expression as she spoke candidly, from mother to daughter.\n\n"I want you to look at this, and I'll promise you, the next time you cross this street...""
 zarantia.27.a:0 ""...will be in a car.""

 zarantia.28.t:0 "Guidance to Prosperity" 
 zarantia.28.d:0 "Momentum is what drives nations, but every push has to come from somewhere. With external capital, we can push our development akin to an uncontrollable boulder, but for that, it needs to be pushed. The Aguellid has sent her delegates and personal aides to the countries bordering us, and from all proposals, two have truly caught her eye.\n\nColthage has been historically one of Zarantia's finest partners, having fought kin to kin in the long, bloodied history of North Zebrica. Their knowledge of metallurgy and its industrial tycoons could easily be the push her country needed.\n\nOn the other hoof, Maregypt's trading history is downright millenary, and its development in recent years has been by leaps, thanks to their investment towards the new technologies; a future that she desires to lead her nation herself.\n\nHowever, she can't play both sides, a mixed capital is mixed trouble. With a nod to herself, quickly wrote a missive to one of the proposals, and called to her aide for delivery..."

 zarantia.29.t:0 "Immortality on the Small Things" 
 zarantia.29.d:0 "The sun shone brightly, scorching the tireless, dedicated workers as they chart, dig, and pave the sprawling network of the Royal Road. It was a grand menagerie of workers indeed, from captured slaves from other nations, foreign advisors and experts and various tribal labourers all working side by side.\n\nThrough day and night, through careful guidance from experienced travelers and their generational knowledge as well as foreign expertise, they carved a path through the desert, one built the test of dunes and winds, all the way out to the seas at Menzaka.\n\nAnd when they reached the sea, a sight of boundless blue that seemed impossible for many of them, they could not help but feel pride in their work. Even if nobody would know who they were, the road would outlast them. And one day, when those same foreign machines on wheels, boats, traders, and tourists came within their lands, their legacy would forever be enshrined on the path they walked upon. Yet, work wasn't over yet and they returned to it with only scoops of water as their reward." 
 zarantia.29.a:0 "Their efforts build our nation, and will not be forgotten."

 zarantia.30.t:0 "Breaking the Fetters" 
 zarantia.30.d:0 "Admittedly, Mekiouzza didn't quite get these new technologies. She, in her youth, had run laps around her country, and she became Aguellid got used to sending other people on that particularly grueling task, but the innovations of this new Millenium still left her vaguely confused.\n\nShe taps the microphone twice, glancing at one of the foreign "radio experts", as he nodded, and screamed in an odd language towards the other hippogriffs accompanying him. In a few moments, a radio would broadcast her speech across all radios on her country, and what better way to make the first, of hopefully many broadcasts, than severing one of her country's oldest crutches.\n\n"People of Zarantia. Tribes, Imazeebs, Ponies and all. When Tobuck was stolen from us, I've thought deeply of our future, our country's future! What kind of proud nation, proud queen, would have built a strong legacy to simply collapse by itself when we lost but a city! But a territory!"\n\n"I've decided that before my body returns to the desert and my soul wanders the endless winds, I would set upon the stone to which a nation, not a group of collected tribes, but one, an individual home we share under the sky, would stood and grow! Growing pains have certainly been felt, and many detractors endeavored to stay against these changes, but still we are undeterred. Still we are stronger!"\n\n"Yet, one topic, many wish I wouldn't topic. One that, no matter how neutral the tribe stood, still dabbled on it. To put the chains on the defeated, the prisoners, the spoils of conflict. You might be glaring, you might be shutting off these radios, but I speak of a plain truth... it has no future in the Zarantia of tomorrow. To hold one in chains is to consign them to a fate not of their control, neither to their freedom, and isn't freedom one of our main values?!"\n\nAnd, on the memory of every tribeszebra, on every slave owner who hurriedly shut down that lasted device, and carved in the heart of every soul clad in metaphorical and literal chains, were the next words..."
 zarantia.30.a:0 ""From this point onward, there is not a single legal slave within Zarantia!""
 zarantia.30.b:0 ""Your freedom will come to you! Your days as slaves are counted!""

 zarantia.31.t:0 "The Steady Road to Freedom" 
 zarantia.31.d:0 ""There we go. From this point onward, you're not a slave anymore." Umalez said, signing the papers with practiced ease, her hoof already sore from the months upon months of signing releases of service, one after the other, something that her oldest servant noticed with a chuckle.\n\nIt would have been much easier if her mother simply made a declaration, and let the army take care but she feared the reprisal from the chieftains; only after weeks of endless negotiation, butting heads, and untold horseshoes are thrown they could finally make some progress, but all of them required either her and her mother's signature, which all but condemned them to their chambers, signing towering pillars after towering pillars of quills to be sent to houses and tribes.\n\nThe proper procedure, yes. Murder to her wrists? Doubly so!\n\nHer maid, Adowa, raised alongside her took the quill, staring at it for a long moment, her expression conflicted.\n\n"...Are you expelling me, Ummy? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"W-what, no! You're a free mare! Your family has been our slaves since the times my mother had my age, don't you want to be free?"\n\n"...W-where would I even go?"\n\nShe stared at her lady, her friend, her wide, nervous eyes glancing at the zebra she grew alongside with. Of course, many of these slaves were from generations, where else would they go? She remembered something Mother did for those...what was it?\n\nAs if a lightbulb lit over her head, she quickly pulled a blank small quill, writing the terms of a quick contract, before hooving it to her, and motioning her to read. She seemed confused for a moment, her expression melting into peace as she read more and more.\n\n"I hereby declare Adowa Nefertiti to be the Princess Umalez of Zarantia's personal bedmaid, until she no longer deems herself worthy of service, upon the word of the Aguellid.""

 zarantia.32.t:0 "A Tense First Day" 
 zarantia.32.d:0 "The air almost quivered around the two chiefs as they stared each other down, each having several equally grim tribeszebras lined up behind them. The silence was near deafening, but neither of them seemed willing to make the first move. It was a mood that could so easily explode into violence, and though they were both hard-bitten tribes more than willing to shed blood for honor's sake, that same honor forbade them from making the first move. Also...\n\n"Thank you all for your presence today. I'm overjoyed to see that you take your children's first day so seriously." The teacher of this new "school" said with a smile from where he stood at the other end of the classroom, and both chiefs turned to glare at this Agzhat interloper as their children had found their places in the rows of benches. "My name is Naravaz Tifirrelest. You can address me as Mister Tifirrelest, or for you children, you can simply say teacher. And today I especially wish to welcome Chief Munatas Aqyun and Chief Zararni Amcic: it is an honor to meet you both."\n\n"As chief of the Aqyun/Amcic, I-" the two chiefs both began before stopping and giving each other withering glares as the mood in the room dropped even further. Neither of them continued saying what they were going to say. Their followers all rose up a bit taller, glaring down their respective counterparts, and the children cowered a bit in their seats. Mister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, continued to smile even if it was an ever so slightly forced smile. Gods and ancestors both help him, if these were the tribes his students came from..."
 zarantia.32.a:0 "...he really had his work cut out for himself."

 zarantia.33.t:0 "A Braid of Enmity" 
 zarantia.33.d:0 ""So tell me, you two." Mister Tifirrelest said as he watched the two young zebras standing in front of him. Zadla Aqyun and Takama Amcic had been at each other's throats since the very first day, and now they had come to actual blows, with Zadla missing a tuft of mane and Takama having a bite mark on her leg. "Why did this start? Nonononono!" he said, raising his hoof as they seemed about to start yelling at the same time. "Zadla will go first, and then Takama will speak."\n\n"Takama pushed my cousin!" Zadla said, Takama bristling.\n\n"I pushed him because he wouldn't leave my sister alone!" she yelled out angrily.\n\n"You lie, just like Amcic always..." Zadla began and Mister Tifirrelest slammed his hoof into the table.\n\n"QUIET!" Mister Tifirrelest roared, cowing them both before leaning down to begin untangling this entire mess. So Zadla's cousin had been pushed, but that was only because he had harassed Takama's sister after she had tricked him out of his lunch and she had done that because another kid had stolen hers and gods help them all... "So what started all this?" he asked the two. "Go back to the very start of this whole thing. Where did this conflict begin between your two groups?" He looked from Zadla to Takama, neither of them answering. Narawaz sighed.\n\n"This started centuries ago. At some point, Amcic and Aqyun started fighting, and you've been fighting ever since. Nobody knows where it started, because it is a braid made from spite and anger that goes back since before anyone was born." he placed a hoof on each of their shoulders. "I understand why you did what you did, both of you, but I am here because the Aguellid needs more from you. On her behalf, I ask that there be peace between your two tribes.""
 zarantia.33.a:0 "Can the Aguellid count on you?"

 zarantia.34.t:0 "Silly Games" 
 zarantia.34.d:0 "The mood was really awkward in the school bench. Mister Tifirrelest had reshuffled their seats, and Takama and Zadla had gotten the dubious pleasure of sitting side by side. Neither of them had said anything to the other for the entire day. In fact, they hadn't even looked at each other, and instead focused on their work. And yet still the air was almost quivering between them, and as Zadla reached out to grab her pen she accidentally bumped into Takama, who gave her a sour glare. Zadla glared back only for both of the girls to jump in their seats when Mister Tifirrelest slapped their bench with his cane.\n\n"Did you intentionally push her, Zadla?" he asked and Zadla looked down at her bench.\n\n"No, it was an accident," she muttered, and Mister Tifirrelest looked to Takama, who also looked down. Turning around, he returned to the blackboard. Zadla, meanwhile, glanced at Takama and stuck out her tongue before quickly turning back to look at the blackboard when Takama glared at her. After a few seconds she realized Takama was doing something and looked, only to see Takama turn back towards the teacher as well. Realizing what she was doing, Zadla extended her tongue once more and turned back before she was spotted, unable to stop a small smile from creeping onto her face as their silly game continued.\n\nMister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, heard the small giggles coming from behind him after a while and smiled to himself before schooling his face. Though he approved, he still had a class to hold."
 zarantia.34.a:0 "Zadla, Takama. Out into the hallway with you."

 zarantia.35.t:0 "Sometimes, Victory isn't All" 
 zarantia.35.d:0 "Zadla didn't like tests. It wasn't the test itself that was the issue though, it was that both tribes turned up to hear the results. Her father and a large contingent of the Aqyun tribe had gathered outside the school building, once again staring down the Amcic across the schoolyard. It felt weird, like two different parts of her life that wasn't meant to come together, and she gave Takama an apologetic look. She'd never tell her father, but she didn't mind Takama. After today though... she had felt confident on the test, and she knew she had a chance to get the top score. But if she was the best in her class, her father would lord it over the Amcic, and by that Takama. As they stood there, waiting, Zadla realized she was begging that she didn't get the top score. She didn't really care about that, not if it cost her her... friend?\n\nAs Mister Tifirrelest came outside, over a hundred eyes turned to him as he cleared his throat to call for the students, who lined up to receive their tests from him. Zadla realized her heart was beating, and she could only bow mutely as she was given her results. Walking over to her parents, she looked down at the score... 98/100.\n\n"98! Well done, my daughter!" Her father said loudly, patting her shoulder. "I knew you could do it! You've made me and the tribe both proud today!" Zadla wanted to sink down into the ground as she saw her father preen in the diretion of Takama's, who only blinked.\n\n"Wait a minute... my daughter also got 98! Has your brat been copying her?!" Takama's dad yelled. The two girls, meanwhile, looked at each other in surprise, and as their fathers began to yell at each other about who had copied from who, the girls snuck away to exchange tests. Realizing that they really had gotten the same results, they high-fived in joy."

 zarantia.36.d:0 "To be an Aguellid is to gaze upon the endless dunes of Zarantia, and see something in what many others see simply as an endless sea of sand. The night rose to the Sky, and she felt contemplative. Taking a temporary leave, and alleviating the worries of her aids she left her tent to take a long walk amidst the dunes of her home.\n\nThe howling of the wind, the biting cold, the starry sky, and the milky way stretched across her vision, reminding her how little time she truly had left. Her sun had set a long time ago, and she could do was to make sure the desert, its treasure, her people, and her daughter, endured the time the winds called to her yet again.\n\n"Mother, are you alright?"\n\nUmalez came running, a bit breathless. Such a teasing brat, yet it's moments like these her heart shone true...would she be okay? Would she be okay without her, eventually? She doesn't know...she likely never will. But that's alright.\n\nAs long as the Zarantia she leaves her with will pick up when she falters."

She didn't care much for the politics that happen between the tribe, her tribe casting her out in the desert for the crime of falling in love taught her a sharp lesson in trust not the whimsical, frail link between Imzabeeb, but between individuals, and bonds of kinhood.\n\nThat being said, that was one of the few decisions of the Aguellid she fully endorsed, and she all but insisted to see it to fruition. And as she stepped upon the fields of the tribe, and she saw the malnourished, weakly "spoils of war", she simply unsheathed her sword and trotted to each one with an unreadable expression.\n\nIt is depressing to think that as she approached, a tinge of fear came over them as if they were guilty of anything. She rose her saber high, and struck each and every one of their chains, their faces brightening as they were cast free.\n\n"You are a free zebra of your own accord. My brothers will take you towards the nearest town, and aid you in finding a true path to yourself."\n\nOf course, she knows it's not all in the goodness of her Aguellid's heart. The furnaces and factories need hooves to train, and the "economy" she so hears about needs people to buy, and be paid. But, in that particular instance, to the tearful smiles, hugs, and even oaths of following her Warband, she can't help but remark on how far that naive zebra cast to the desert went."

"I’ve been giving shape to metal for nearly twenty years, and I’ve no intention, nor time, to teach a filly."\n\n"And what will happen once you pass away, Zudad? How will our tribe carry on without your knowledge or skill? This service will assure none of them are forgotten to time. After all, I would not have accepted her if I hadn’t absolute confidence in your abilities as a blacksmith."\n\nZudad paused for a moment, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Then, he shook his head with a scoff. "Perhaps I could make an exception this time, even if she’s an Aqyun." His hard eyes settled on the young mare, the wrinkles on his face deepening with a frown and causing her to flinch back. "You sleep in the room in the back.

 zarantia.39.d:0 "The first two months were hard work. As an assistant, Zadla had quite the number of tasks to take care of, like preparing the furnace’s lumps of coal for work, sweeping the floor, and cleaning up the working surfaces once the day ended. Still, there was at least a silver lining. She liked to observe Master Zudad while he was at work. Furthermore, the older zebra loved to talk as he busied himself near the furnace; mostly to complain about Maregyptians keeping all the good metal for themselves, or to go into deep detail on various metallurgic techniques Zadla had never heard of.\n\nNot today. Zudad had remained silent, his eyes focused on the ingot of steel before him. Sparks flew with each strike of the hammer, stopping only momentarily as to gauge at his work, only to then begin again, in silence. He finally stopped after several hours, as the sun had already slipped beneath the horizon, and only after Zadla had pointed out the fact to him.\n\n"Do you know what this is, kid?" Zudad said as he removed his working googles. Zadla shot a puzzled glance at the object laying of the working surface. "Well, that’s a piece of metal, right?"\n\n"A piece of metal?!" Zudad scowled. "Kid, if I didn’t think you had some potential, I would have caned you already. A good blacksmith never sees the raw material, but always has the finished work before his eyes." Zadla gave a sceptical glance at the bar of steel in question but nodded anyway. "Oh. I see."\n\n"No, you don’t. And I guess that’s the real problem here. It’s a waste of breath describing it with words alone." Zudad shook his head. "No matter. You’ll see it tomorrow with your own eyes. Clean up now while I prepare dinner."\n\nZadla nodded and set out to work, before stopping midway as something finally clicked in her mind. "Wait. Master Zudad, did you say that I have potential?"

"One can’t just say no to his own chief, after all. And besides, it might be a good thing that I’m accompanying him. Munatas has this fascination with any kind of foreign machinery.

You’ve watched over my workshop before, right?"\n\nZadla hesitated, then shook her head. "For two weeks at most, not months. Master Zudad, I don’t think I’m ready for this. What if I mess something up while you’re ..."\n\n"Oh, give me a break, kid!" Zudad suddenly snapped. "Don’t come here telling me you’re afraid of working alone.

"I am happy to see you too, mum. Is dad here?"\n\n"You missed him by a few minutes, but don’t worry. He’ll be back soon. Now, why don’t you-" She stopped, her eyes falling on something else. "What is that?"\n\nZadla realized what had slipped out of her saddlebags, and she chuckled as she picked the scabbard back up. "Well, it was meant to be a surprise. It’s a gift to you, mother." Zadla removed the finely-crafted blade from its scabbard, her heart nearly burst with pride in seeing her mother’s eyes go wide. The single-edged, straight-backed sword glinted softly under the sunlight, the engravings near the hilt standing out.\n\nSlowly, Zlatig took it from her hooves, eyes shining bright as she examined the weapon. "It’s beautiful, dear. Where ... Where did you find it?" Zadla simply smiled." #AAAAAAH

 zarantia.120.t:0 "Farewell to a Legend"
 zarantia.120.d:0 "The procession through Tobuck had been truly grandiose, and the priests of the Mortuary Cult had presided over an equally grandiose ceremony. It all had been a fitting sendoff to the greatest Aguellid Zarantia had known since time immemorial, and it had only left Umalez deeper in grief. Having retreated to her chambers afterwards, she had spent the entire evening not crying, but rather just reeling. How did one process something like this? Her mother, her unconquerable, ferocious mother who had held back death itself, was gone. This mountain of a mare, to whom the world itself bent, had vanished from it, and what was even left in its wake?\n\nShe had always felt the gap between her and her mother keenly. Mekiouzza was born in the desert, and went to war young, and Umalez had been born in the Tobuck that Mekiouzza liberated and spent her childhood studying history and the arts. This gap had never been as obvious as it was now, as was the answer to who would step in to fill it. But how could she ever be her mother's equal? She couldn't, that was the simple fact of the matter, yet her mother's words came back to her.\n\n'You will be what Zarantia needs'.\n\nIf she belived in nothing else, she would believe in her mother. Though they had bickered, she had never doubted that her mother knew what she was doing. And her mother, the harshest critic there could be, had believed in her.\n\nAt that point, the floodgates burst, and the tears came uncontrollably."

 zarantia.121.d:0 "As representative of the Amsarmud, I approve." As Zawgha spoke, it struck Umalez how odd the sight of the assembled chieftains around her would have been just in her mother's youth. Back then, the tribes gathered out of necessity more than anything else, and yet these days, they were together near constantly and if not the chieftains, then at least a trusted representative. It was another testament to what her mother had achieved, whatever one thought of the methods.\n\n"As representative of Tobuck, I approve," Menes' words followed, and Umalez silently wondered how many would object. There would be some, but her mother's old servants had all stood by her. Some would speak out in protest, there was one way forward as a chieftain in Zarantia these days, and that was to play the game that Mekiouzza had established.\n\n"As representative of the Tasawent, I approve." She let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding. For all her respect towards Wiwurgh, she knew he was a zebra of ironclad principles. His vote was sincere, and it meant that what little risk there had been was gone. In the end, when the votes were tallied, she could rise up and accept the position of Aguellid-Queen, chosen by the tribes and cities, and invested with absolute authority over Zarantia."

 zarantia.122.d:0 "Umalez had been a young child visiting Colthage when she first had seen a train. She had seen them from far away at first, and thought they were some kind of giant snake. The fact was that it had scared her, and the noise it gave off as it approached had scared her enough that she had hidden behind her mother. Yet after she got over her fears, the sight of these iron beasts had spurred her imagination. She had filled her notebooks with drawings of them, even imagined trains that could go over the sands without the need for rails. Some things you had to leave aside when you grew up, but not her adoration of trains, and she smiled widely as she walked through the half-finished rail station.\n\n"In here will be the waiting hall." The architect said as he showed her around the area. "It'll be one big open area, and whenever the weather allows, the doors in each end will be open and allow for a nice cross-breeze. As you asked for, there will also be drinking fountains in every corner, as well as out on each platform." It was like her dreams coming true, and Umalez felt giddy at the sight of the building. Sure it wasn't a great palace, but a building like this, that creatures would flood in and out of daily, was just the kind of thing she liked; beautiful and practical things for the regular creature. And what more, it would be where trains arrived. Stepping out on the platform, she looked out across the railways and imagined the trains that would run past here soon. For all the benefits this brought to her homeland, she couldn't help but enjoy it on a much more selfish level."

 zarantia.123.t:0 "The Court of Zarantia"
 zarantia.123.d:0 "Presiding over a state where the tribal chieftains used to rule supreme, the Aguellid-Queen of Zarantia, Umalez Ataghan, deals not only council debates and diplomatic meetings, but also with loudly shouting tribal chieftains and flying horseshoes. It is a highly unorthodox kind of government, but most things about this most recent of monarchies are.\n\nRaised to the throne by the efforts of her mother and predecessor, Mekiouzza Ataghan, Aguellid-Queen Umalez rules over two halves of a whole; the imazeeb tribes of inland Zarantia, and the Maregyptian-descended ponies of Tobuck that came together in 961 after the Tobuckians rebelled against Warzena. Umalez, like her predecessor, has contended with two entirely different forms of politics. While the Tobuckian political game might seem quite familiar to the average Equestrian, the Imazeeb have for centuries worked not through laws and contracts, but verbal agreements enforced by honor and tradition and where vengeance was justice.\n\nTo the average outside observer, it may seem like the tribeszebras are a loud and disruptive presence in the Aguellid-Queen's court, but to the more keen-eyed observer there's a careful balance being struck in every debate. The Aguellid's word is final, but to the tribes, the art of objecting is as central as anything else. It is how they escape the need for more violent forms of protesting. They will rail and yell in protest to the Aguellid-queen's decrees so that they can prove to their tribespeople - effectively their constituents - that they still have a voice, and the Aguellid-Queen respects their rights to debate, protest and even at times, insolence. To the average Equestrian, the attitude that Aguellid-Queen Umalez is met with might seem beyond disrespectful. To the Zarantians, it is proof of the mutual respect that permeates her court."

She could tell the zebras around her were surprised by her actions. Though he was a chieftain of high honor and status, he was still a Buckharan, and the Imazeeb's relation to their very distant cousins in the east had always been a wary one.\n\n"Your hospitality is peerless, noble Aguellid, and I'm honored to sit in your house - a house equal in honor and dignity to your nation." He gave the bowl back to her with his head bowed. The Buckharans had not weathered the last years much better than the imazeeb had, but unlike the imazeeb, the Buckharans had not managed to reassert themselves and instead were trapped under the iron hoof of the Quaggatai and their Khan. Mekiouzza had made overtures to them many years ago, but they had politely rebuffed her back then. Of course, desperate times had a way of making old familial ties bubble to the surface.\n\n"It is a long overdue meeting, cousin, but I am happy to welcome you." Umalez smiled as she accepted the bowl from him and drank as well. It was a careful dance, one that likely would take days if customs would be observed. It would be, that was why the Buckharans were here. The Quaggatai overlordship chafed, and they had decided to take their chances with the Zarantians in the hopes that the Amsisi would give them their honor and independence back.\n\n"As am I, and if the gods will it, I hope we may see many future meetings like these. Of course, I would not expect a gift like this every time." He smiled slightly at her and Umalez returned it. As for her... the Buckharans were their distant relations, and controlling it would further strengthen their hold on the trans-zebrican trade. It would shield their eastern flank, and diminish the Khan's power. As her mother had taught her, sometimes the good and the profitable aligned quite well."   #Buckhara wants to be saved from Quaggatai.

Yet, for Umalez was the question of what would happen now. She had one chance to finish it, and let Buckhara be her answer to her mother's Tobuck, another jewel in the Zarantian crown. Yet, it would not be an uncomplicated matter. The Buckharans were thirsty for independence, and though she could exert some influence, the question was whether it was the right thing to do, whether she would change Zarantia irrevocably and take the final step away from the idea of the Imazeeb state. She had the luxury of choice, but that did not make it an easy one."

 zarantia.150.t:0 "The Hard Lessons of Leadership"
 zarantia.150.d:0 "The willful Imazeeb tribes had demanded the respect and independence they believed themselves due, and they had been ravaged until their spirit was broken. The criminals that had infested Tobuck had believed themselves secure from the wrath of its rightful owner, and they had been hunted down and killed to the last. Time and time again, as the world had crashed down on Zarantia, there had been one answer: force.\n\nIn the end, the world was a place where peoples and rulers scratched and clawed at each other, all to seize a place for themselves, and the instance you stopped fighting, you condemned yourself to death. Mercy and kindness were luxuries to be doled out in service of an end goal, and that goal was fear. Fear that you'd lose favour with your ruler, fear that the outsiders would come and take away what you had, fear that the world would hurt you if you did not hurt it first.\n\nStanding in front of Mekiouzza's mausoleum, Umalez wept. She wept for the passing of her beloved mother and for the cruelties that had come to pass under her watch. What more, she cried because she knew what would come next. No other chieftain remained to challenge the Ataghan tribe's dominance - her dominance - and the title of Aguellid-Queen was now hers by right... as would be the cruelty that holding this position would demand.\n\nThe lesson was taught, and Umalez had always been a good student. Liking or disliking the truth would not change. It was blood and death that had raised her to this position, and if she did not maintain the course, she would throw away all her mother had achieved. She wasn't that selfish, and she bowed her head to touch it against the cold stone door."

The hundreds of gathered warriors finished their oath, and Umalez rose up from the throne she had been sitting in. Stepping forth to stand side by side with Zawgha, who had administrered the oath, she addressed them for the first time.\n\n"Soldiers, you now stand as the true defenders of the throne and the nation. You have risen above the petty bickering of old, and you serve a higher purpose: to shield this nation from enemies both internal and external. By your labours, Zarantia will prevail, now and forever!"\n\n"Now and forever!" Their cry was almost deafening, and Umalez smiled as they saluted her. The tribes would never again have any say in how the wars of Zarantia were conducted, nor would they ever have the equipment and resources needed to challnge her position. Military might was now tied to her utterly, and with it would come stability."

You've insisted on making it difficult for you though." Zawgha took a sip of the tea she had been offered and leaned forward a little. "I know the game you're playing right now, but it won't work. Step down and bow your head because if you don't, the price is way higher than you can pay."\n\n"I didn't think the Ironbreaker would be the one who broke so easily," the chieftain across the table from her said with a raised eyebrow. "The Ataghan girl is not her mother, and she must be reminded of this."\n\n"She knows that she's not," Zawgha locked eyes with the old stallion. "When her mother made an example of the Talat some of us learned to not cross her, but Umalez learned that only violence can keep her where she is. She's learned that lesson with all her heart, and believes in it with fanatical fervor. There is no line she won't cross, no cruelty she will will not stoop to. I know you are looking for concessions to remain loyal, but she will kill you, she'll kill your family, she'll hunt down those who would seek vengeance for them, and end your entire tribe down to the foal born yesterday. Not because she is arrogant enough to think herself untouchable, but because to her, her mother's actions proved that is the only way to ensure order. This is not politics to her, it's faith, and she will gladly sacrifice anything on that altar."\n\n"If she is mad dog, then she..." the old chieftain began and Zawgha sighed, slamming her cup down to cut him off.\n\n"I have given my warning. It is more than she will do. Do with it what you wish, but once you make her your enemy, you will never be anything else to her. That is the age in which we live now, and for your children's sake, learn the new rules." With that, she got up and left the room.

A series of official edits to the Zarantian laws removed the majority of all references to the tribes that since the dawn of time had been the core of Imazeeb society. By word of the Aguellid-Queen, the tribes were no longer recognised legal entities in any form. Their privileges were revoked, their standing nullified and their customs no longer any more than quaint familial traditions.\n\nYet, the laws and its interpreters were controlled by the Aguellid-Queen, and silence reigned on the matter. The tribes that were in a position to challenge her or cause issues were long since cowed or bought off, leaving only the long since marginalised to cry out - fruitlessly - in protest. With the Aguellid-Queen's hooves around their throat, the tribes of Zarantia were at last starting to be consigned to history."

Out there were a horde of predators, each hungry for power and success, and they tirelessly circled around her in the hopes of currying favour. They would look for any signs of weakness, and they would pounce on it instantly. Thus, from the moment that door opened, she would be nothing but an indomitable autocrat who controlled Zarantia and every living creature within it. Yet for now, she would enjoy the little freedom she could still enjoy.\n\nShe did not bemoan her fate, it was all for Zarantia. Her mother had founded it, she had completed it, and one day her daughter would be the one to carry it on. Fate, the gods, the natural progression of society, whatever the forces that had brought them here had demanded that the Imazeeb be cowed if they were to become one nation. Like so many rulers throughout history, she had led her people down the path to civilisation by forcing them down it. That was the role she had been given, and she would not shirk from it, even if it exhausted her.\n\nA knock on the door left her sitting up almost instinctively, and she turned impassively to watch the servant that entered, holding a tray with her breakfast.

A procession walked slowly down the pathway open in the crowd, six zebras carrying the mummified body of Mekiouzza Ataghan towards the crypt, and in their wake, Zarantia wept.\n\nThe chieftains of Aqyun and Amcic, sworn enemies once, stood side by side with their heads bowed deeply to the mare who had buried their ancient enmity and dared them to dig it up. Wasif Talat, he who had so reluctantly come to serve her, showed his grief without any reservation for the only zebra who could have conquered the mighty Talat. Wiwurgh hid his face, for among the Tasawent grief was not shown openly beyond the family, yet his shaking body spoke its clear language, as did Zawgha's stony, expressionless face down which tears were carving their paths all the same.\n\nBy the mausoleum stood Umalez, alone in her grief, and as her mother was carried past her, he procession stopped and she leaned in, giving Mekiouzza a final kiss farewell. Whispering how much she loved her mother to her, she sobbed uncontrollably as she was gently pulled away and Mekiouzza was carried into the tomb to her final rest. As she was interred, the sound of the doors slamming shut was the sound of everyzebra's mother being lost to them.\n\nWeep, oh sun and mountains, weep oh stars, weep oh sea\nThe tale is now ending, in all things' destiny\nLet the victor rest now, her work is finally done"

zarantia_federation.2.t:0 "A Return to the Old Ways"
zarantia_federation.2.d:0 "The mood in the council room was tense, indeed awkward, and Umalez silently waited for the vote that was taking place to finish. It was a formality, most of it had been decided already in backroom deals and agreements. Strangely though, she did not mind that. The council was forged together tightly enough that it moved on its own, and unlike her mother, she did not see it as a means to an end. It was its own entity, and it moved by its own will. Wasn't that a good thing? The tribes that Mekiouzza had reluctantly empowered had seized that power, and now worked together to achieve their goals.\n\nYet, as the voting drew to a close, it became obvious that despite the efforts of several figures on the council, she was still elected Aguellid. Rising from her seat to accept the role, she thought back to her mother's last words; 'you will be what Zarantia needs'. And Umalez knew her path, so she would walk it.\n\n"I thank you all for your faith in me, and I swear upon my mother's name that I will treat this position with the care it deserves. I also wish to state, clearly and for all future records, that I assume the position of Aguellid only. I will be the protector of Zarantia, not its ruler. I speak for the tribes, but do not demand their blind allegiance. I, like the rest of you, will be a servant of our homeland. My mother created this council to give all tribes a voice, and my purpose is protecting those voices. And so... I, Umalez Ataghan, greet you, rulers of Zarantia." She bowed her head deeply to them, being met with deafening silence from a flummoxed council."

zarantia_federation.3.t:0 "The Hydra of Zarantia"
zarantia_federation.3.d:0 "In the end, a government is nothing but a group of creatures meeting to decide upon important matters, and fixed places to meet were a matter of convenience, not necessity. What more, fixing the seat of government in one place was to invite favouritism. Having the seat of government in your region would mean that you were the tribe who stood the closest to power. Tobuck had been one solution, but were they not a tribe in and of themselves, those city ponies? A large and unusually chaotic tribe, but a tribe all the same. No, Tobuck was not a solution.\n\nIn the end, it was the representative of Talat who suggested the best way out of this conundrum. Whenever a decision that concerned a region was to be taken, the decision would be taken in that region to be considered legitimate. A government absent from the region affected by the choices would not be legitimate, and though there has been protests by some of the settled tribes, as well as from the Tobuckians, no other solution has been found. The votes of the underserved and marginalised tribes still count, and along with the Aguellid's pleading for accord, the decision ended up approved.\n\nThe question of how exactly these regional seats will look will vary, with Agzhat and Tobuck having their council chambers prepared, but the nomadic tribes having simply begun to acquire grand tents and radios to host the council whenever it travels through their region. This will certainly make the council meetings a bit more interesting going ahead."

The oil deposits we've found out in the deserts are immense. I-I am not exaggerating when I'm saying that this may well be the very foundation of Zarantia's economy in the future! The trade, the agriculture, the... everything, nothing of it can come close to this kind of resources. Oil is the future, and we were just catapulted into the very forefront of it!

It had been during the darkest moments of her life, and yet she had come back from it, stronger than before. Though Tobuck had slipped out of her grasp, she had regained it, and though the world had kept challenging her, she had triumphed. Zarantia was stronger than ever, and she finally dared to believe that it would survive without her. Was that due to her reforms or actions? Oh certainly, to some extent, but there was one thing that gave her hope above all other things; her dear daughter.\n\nThough she had worried that her sweet daughter would not be up to the challenges that came with leadership, the events of the last years had proven Umalez' mettle beyond what Mekiouzza could have dreamed of. Indeed, maybe she had been the one to hold Umalez back she wondered as the door slammed open and Umalez came hurrying inside.\n\n"Mother, are you well?!" Umalez asked as she came up to Mekiouzza's side. "They said you were ill."\n\n"I've been ill for a long time. I just did not allow it to bother me," Mekiouzza's voice was cracking, the iron determination that had driven her for the last years finally having begun to run out. "I once cursed the fates for giving me a daughter that was so soft... but I was wrong, I see that now. You will be what Zarantia needs, and I was a fool for not seeing that." She gave up a slow, hoarse sigh, feeling how the tiredness only grew. "Good luck, my little flower.""

There were still buildings that had not been repaired, and the streets had piles of garbage in the corners. Yet, the ponies of the city were out said streets, and as Mekiouzza strode along Tobuck's streets with her daughter by her side, they cheered and stomped their hooves in celebration.\n\nMekiouzza wished she could join their glee, yet her smile was strained, and she found this moment of relief poisoned by the sting of wounded pride. The mighty Aguellid of Zarantia, returning to her city not as a liberator, but first when a common smuggler and criminal allowed her to do so. She felt weak, impotent, and the unwelcome sensation laid itself like a mourning veil over everything.\n\n"We should clean up the city, and when it is put back in good condition, we should celebrate again," Umalez' murmur made Mekiouzza glance at her. Her daughter's smile was wide, and her eyes sparkled with joy, even as she murmured almost imperceptibly to her. "Let's drown the memory of this whole awful episode in celebration and joy, things are finally back to what they should be, and isn't that what matters?"\n\nMekiouzza lowered her head slightly, feeling how her smile turned less forced."

zarantia.201.d:0 "Tobuck under Zarantia was not and had never been a city with one ruler, but rather the various power brokers and influential community figures in it were given a place on the city's council. The city, much like the tribes of the desert, had largely been allowed to mind its own affairs, at least until now.\n\n"Don't give me that look, Rose Rain," Mekiouzza told the mare across the table from her before looking at the rest of the gathered Tobuckians. "Speak plainly. In fact, all of you speak plainly. I'm too old to have you do the Tobuckian half-step of implications and hints around me."\n\n"Then please, noble Aguellid..." It was Menes Amasdag who spoke up. "You return from exile, and your first move is to clamp down on the freedoms the city has enjoyed, it's..."\n\n"Basically, where were you last year?" Rose Rain butted in. "We were left occupied by criminals, and those meant to protect us were off in the desert. I understand why, we do," she waved at the gathered ponies. "But how do you explain that to the rest of the city?"\n\n"That a tribe divided against each other will not stand," Mekiouzza told her. "You're right, last year was disgraceful, and I failed. Zarantia failed. The very purpose of this nation snapped like a dry twig. What we've been doing thus far didn't work, and that's why we're going to have to clamp down. The Storm King is gone, but Colthage's... whatever you call that entire mess over there, the Chiropterrans are up to something as well, and the entire region is scrambling to adapt after the last years. We can't go back to what was, because we saw what that led to. Things need to change if we are to survive, and that's why you are here.

"I can only hope that you can overlook my failure in this regard. I am very old, and my back is not what it was." A small smile crept over his face. "I am also very fat, and most likely would fall over if I tried."\n\n"I am not so unreasonable to throw you out for that," Umalez hid a small smile at the griffon’s self-deprecating humour. Between that and his ashamed appearance - face lowered and hat in claw - he cut an awkward, almost pitiable, figure. "Yet. You did work with Pea Shooter, and my mother has little patience for his cronies."\n\n"I most certainly understand that, and in my position I would be treating myself with the utmost care. Yet, I am but a humble merchant, and I value my life above any notions of honour; that is for better creatures than me. I also - humbly, would say that that is why you might be interested in my services. I won’t deny that my former colleague left the city in a bit of a mess. Yet he has somewhere to go, and I do not. I would serve you simply because if I don’t, I am a dead griff no matter what I do."\n\nUmalez didn’t trust him, not really, but he did have a point. If there was a snake in the house, it was better to know where it was. What more, unlike her mother she didn’t feel like killing someone just in case. Who knew, maybe he would prove useful?"

"How have you not caught yourself a husband yet with tea like this?"\n\n"Oh you know. My candidate has not been able to come here during the last year, but I'm working on it." Her coy answer made the zebras all 'oooh' and 'aaah' in understanding, and Hibiscus decided that now if anytime she had to ask the question that had been gnawing in the back of her mind. "Also... has something happened with the Aguellid? All these new laws and taxes... a lot of ponies worry. This isn't the Mekiouzza we remember." The mood around the table dropped like a rock, and the zebras looked down at their tea. Well then, at least that proved that they weren't alone in seeing the issues.\n\n"Those are matters of Aguellid and chieftains," one of the Zebras sighed after a second, and Hibiscus felt a sting of irritation. Why did they have to be so deferential, couldn't they see that this wasn't right?! She gave up a frustrated little noise but pushed the anger down. It wouldn't do any good to snap at them. "I know!"

"Walk with me, and tell me what your angle is."\n\n"As I mentioned to your daughter, madam, I am a griffon with few ways out," Vasile responded deferentially, falling in line with her as she stepped out into the hallway. "And besides, I've grown fond of Tobuck." His smile was not reciprocated. "Ahem, but yes. I merely wish to make the best of my situation, and the Zarantian state building project is an impressive one. Might I ask where we're going?"\n\n"Where you won't bleed on the rugs," Mekiouzza told him before raising the cane, one made out of iron, and bringing it down on his neck in one heavy strike. Vasile crumpled to the floor, only a choked gasp escaping from his lungs as Mekiouzza pulled back the cane. "I know your schemes, rat. My daughter vouched for you, spared your life, and you repaid her gift by trying to turn Tobuck against me." Vasile could only make weak sounds as he tried to crawl away, only for Mekiouzza to raise the cane and bring it down on him again. This time he screamed. \n\n"You could have become the mayor of Tobuck, spent your twilight years surrounded by luxuries and comforts and had statues of you when you died!" Mekiouzza spat, eyes glowing with rage. "Remember this as I beat your body into a corpse and feed you to the vultures, rat!" With that, she raised her cane and let it fall again, and again, and again.

Her mother was enraged, and she would see every last criminal in Tobuck dead no matter what it would cost... even if it meant that she would abandon the careful dance of deals and agreements that she had wielded thus far. Her mother was out for blood, and if you weren't with her, you would be against her.\n\nUmalez realised she was trying to calculate their chances. So used was she to believe in her mother, that though she was horrified by her mother's actions, Umalez' instincts still wanted to go along with it and believe in her. Yet even here?

Before the Storm King's reign, his tribe had held land along the coast, and prospered from it. They had suffered grievously when the Storm King came though, and were a shadow of what they had been. Due to this they had not rallied to Mekiouzza's side to retake the city, claiming they could not risk their few remaining sons and daughters.\n\n"I thank you for your kind words, and your faith in me honours me." She said it so easily, but she knew what kind of challenge would lay before her. The tribe's absence in the war to reclaim Tobuck had meant Mekiouzza had instead chosen to give the lands to her favoured general Zawgha instead. Those who served the Aguellid well were rewarded, those who didn't were cast aside. This was no mere coincidence, but rather the end goal of her mother's policies.

It had gone against centuries of dearly held tradition, and Mekiouzza should have been killed by the tribes as they rose up. Yet, after decades of playing the game, Mekiouzza had known how to outplay and isolate all those who did not bow to her, and though thousands lay dead by her hoof, Zarantia was stronger for it.\n\nBut what was it all for, Umalez wondered. Her mother was unquestioned, and wielded power beyond what any Imazeeb ever had. Was this merely the natural culmination of her efforts? Was it the inevitable end result for someone who sought to change the world around them?\n\nShe would once have been disgusted by it, and claim that the Aguellid's role was to serve as the defender of the tribes, not to tower above them like some Maregyptians Pharaoh or Griffonian Emperor. Agreement and negotiation was their people's way, and though she knew that things would have to change, wasn't the goal to only reach as far as was needed to in order to ensure their people could still thrive?

Umalez pondered the question for a good while before answering." 
zarantia_umalez_flavor.3.a:0 ""No. I admire mother's efforts, and hope I can be as patient one day.""
zarantia_umalez_flavor.3.b:0 ""I suppose it does, and I hope that one day it will not be necessary.""

zarantia_umalez_flavor.5.d:0 ""You have another question in mind, master Wiwurgh, I can tell." Umalez said as she took a break from her work of documenting the legends of their people. With the events of the last years, Umalez had decided to aid her people in a more oblique way. The Imazeeb had always been storytellers, and yet if they were meant to be one nation, wouldn't it behoove them to have those stories gathered as well? In this, Wiwurgh had been invaluable, even if he tended to continue needling her with his questions.\n\n"What's the purpose of Zarantia? Is it a vehicle for the Aguellid's ambitions, or does it mean more than that?" Umalez didn't reply at first, only blinked at him. That was audacious, even for him. What was he getting at? "I hold no intent of going against your mother in any way," Wiwurgh preempted her follow-up question, "but it is an important question. I cannot think of many zebras that are truly enthusiastic about the idea of trading away their independence to be ruled over by someone not of their tribe, not even one as revered as your mother. With that in mind, how does Zarantia justify its existence?""
zarantia_umalez_flavor.5.a:0 ""It exists to empower them all in the end.""
zarantia_umalez_flavor.5.b:0 ""If we don't change, we will be undone. Zarantia is our survival.""

zarantia_umalez_flavor.7.d:0 "The hour of fate was close at hoof, Umalez could tell. The tribes were coming together again, and her mother's position was more secure than it ever had been before. It would not be long before they marched on Tobuck now, and Umalez wondered what would happen then.\n\nFor all the changes that had come over their people in recent years, a few principles stood as strong as they ever had before. Though tempered by the Aguellid's law and the Amsisi, revenge was still a core tenet among the Imazeeb. When your security and dignity rested on being able to fight back against those who'd cross you, vengeance became not a vice, but a virtue. What more, by the Aguellid's words and creed Tobuck was equal to any Imazeeb tribe.\n\nAnd so, with their cousins on the coast conquered and degraded by honorless criminals who had sought to strip it bare to enrich themselves, the insult was as complete as it could be, and the demand for justice was absolute. Tobuck suffered, and so should not the Imazeeb pour out of the desert like a storm, and slay every last of these fiends for what they had done to the Imazeeb's distant family? And yet... was that what Tobuck wanted? Were the Imazeeb overlords coming to extract venceance for a slight against them more than they sought to liberate Tobuck?" 
zarantia_umalez_flavor.7.a:0 "They suffer already, the important thing is to end it."
zarantia_umalez_flavor.7.b:0 "They are not mutually exclusive, and we can't forgive this."

zarantia_umalez_flavor.9.t:0 "The Old Stories" #harmony/nonaligned choice events
zarantia_umalez_flavor.9.d:0 ""Was I naïve to think that our people's stories would be any less difficult to wrangle than the tribes themselves?" Umalez sighed, flopping back in her seat and staring up at the ceiling. Wiwurgh put down his pen and looked at her with an eyebrow raised. "That is now seventeen variants of the legend of the floating cities. Twelve of them just among the Azir tribes. When I try to find the common themes, I'm left with one thing, a floating city."\n\n"And sadly, each of those tribes would say that their tales are truthful." The Blue Sage was placid about the entire affair, though he gave her a sympathetic nod. "It has rarely been an issue before. After all, no Imazeeb would be so brazen as to question another tribe's legends."\n\n"And you will now ask me what my purpose with this endevour is," Umalez added dryly as she scooted up to a sitting position and Wiwurgh clucked happily in response. Looking down at the texts in front of her, she thought about all the high-minded ideals she had had when starting her work. One unified canon of stories to serve as a tentpole for Zarantia and bring them together, yet there were so many variations that she didn't know where to even start. In the end..."
zarantia_umalez_flavor.9.a:0 "This is what our people are, and I will document it all."
zarantia_umalez_flavor.9.b:0 "I'm focusing on what unifies them, to find common ground."

zarantia_umalez_flavor.11.d:0 "The Aguellid's role was clearly defined and always had been: elected by the tribes for the purpose of negotiating disputes and ensuring the safety of the tribes. To this end, they could call the tribes to war. That was the entirety of it, and Mekiouzza had run roughshod over it for a long time. Her influence was not strange per se, but the way she had tied it to her title was. She was no mere Aguellid, hadn't been for years, and yet what would happen when she was gone?\n\nUmalez sat quietly in her study, watching the bustling city outside the window. The last years had been crazy, and there was already so much that never would be the same again. Would the office go back to what it was, or would it too be forever changed? It should be such a simple thing to consider, a glorious triumph of her mother, but for some reason it made her pensive. How much could a people change and still remain themselves? She had worked tirelessly to preserve the rituals, the stories and the mythology of her people, but if all else had changed, was there a point to preserving those things?"
zarantia_umalez_flavor.11.a:0 "You are without equal, mother. But I hope our people will never need a zebra like you again."
zarantia_umalez_flavor.11.b:0 "You've built our future, mother, and I'll preserve our past."

zarantia_worm.1.t:0 "The Sudden Departure"
zarantia_worm.1.d:0 "After the Aguellid ran off into the desert and got herself eaten by a Tatzlwurm, we were half expecting things to go south, and fast, but the expected explosions of violence did not come. It seemed as though our efforts to divide the tribes had paid off, and with the hoofful of tribes that we could buy off on our side, we were safe, at least until last night.\n\nOut of nowhere, nearly every last of the tribals packed their stuff and left. The entire coast is being emptied of zebras, and in the cases where our border patrols tried to stop them, the tribals shot their way out. If we wanted to ensure that we didn't have to deal with the tribes again, that has certainly happened, but the circumstances are beyond suspicious."   
zarantia_worm.1.a:0 "Get some patrols to follow them, I want to know what's happening."

zarantia_worm.2.t:0 "The Secret is Out"
zarantia_worm.2.d:0 "We had thought that the departure of the zebras would at least give us some peace, but instead, there's rioting across the city! Someone has spread word of what happened to the Aguellid out to the people, and now they are out in the streets, calling for Vasile's head.\n\nVasile meanwhile is furious, and as the police is breaking up the protestors, an internal investigation into just who leaked this information out there. The troops involved in that fiasco were dealt with and wouldn't be able to tell anyone, and nobody outside the inner circle of advisors knew about it. Yet they are still out there, and when Vasile gets his claws on them, they'll wish they never were born."
zarantia_worm.2.a:0 "Get the police in the streets!"

zarantia_worm.3.t:0 "Slaughtered Patrols"
zarantia_worm.3.d:0 "The patrols we sent to try to track where the tribals were found on the border to the tribal lands... in pieces. We aren't sure what exactly happened, but they were evidently caught, and the tribes took their time with them.\n\nThe entire scene that met our border patrols was beyond gruesome, with the scouts having been ritually killed and their bodies arranged in some strange pattern. One of the guards identified it as a stylised Tatzlwurm, which only raises even more questions. Whoever this person who revealed what actually happened is, they're working with the tribals. What more, they're currently running circles around us!"  
zarantia_worm.3.a:0 "What is going on out there?!"

zarantia_worm.4.t:0 "Chaos across the Country"
zarantia_worm.4.d:0 "One thing is coming after another, and both are bringing their extended families! The streets of Tobuck are still filled with rioters, we've no idea what's going on in the deeper parts of the country, our troops are being sabotaged and bombs have started going off at airports and railroad hubs. The perpetrators we've managed to corner have cut their throats rather than to be captured alive.\n\nThey have been ponies, zebras, a couple griffons even, and the only thing that they have in common is that their bodies are covered in weird tattoos that have been identified as being that of the Zarantian mortuary cult. For some reason, these grave tenders have gone insane and are causing all the damage they can. The question is why, and there's a sense that we won't like the answer."
zarantia_worm.4.a:0 "Something big is coming..."

zarantia_worm.5.t:0 "The Song of the Goddess"
zarantia_worm.5.d:0 "Every foal among the Imazeeb knows to fear the passing of the Tatzlwurms, the creatures they know as Ijirmed. They are the heralds of the goddess of death, and all that steps in their path is undone. You do not fight the Ijirmed, you flee. Even if you could bring such a beast down, it would not earn you honor but rather exile, for their passage brings the sacred Igennet flowers to the desert, through which those blessed with its taste can glimpse the gods. They are eternal, their wrath endless and their gifts priceless, and when they sing, the imazeeb know the world will end.\n\nSlowly swaying as it towered above the zebras, the titanic worm filled the air with its rumbling lament together with the priests that encircled it. Other priests walked among the gathered crowds, holding baskets into which the tribeszebras threw their jewelry and their adornments, stripping themselves down to merely their robes in the way of mourners but for one exception; they were all armed. As the last zebra discarded his necklace and his rings, the mighty worm reared up high, its three jaws slowly opening as it looked out over the crowds. Gasps of horror and disbelief came from them, along with cries of denial or realization. Yet it all was drowned out as the worm, against all they knew, spoke.\n\n"Behold your past, the false roads you walked, and behold where they led you." The voice was not one but a thousand, all speaking in accord as its breath washed over them, overwhelming them with the acrid, sweet smell of Igennet. "The mirage has faded, and as you see, you understand. Aguellid broken, hopes crushed, trust betrayed, future murdered, rotting and left to the sand. So kill, Imazeeb, walk the bloody path, and bury the false world that would undo you. Die, and die as yourselves. End the broken world, and may the ashes bear the fruits of the a new one.""

It offers a gilded future of plenty and prosperity, only to let it all be torn away from you and leave you with nothing. It tears you up by the roots and makes you march to foreign drums, makes everything you are an inconvenience and a superstition, unworthy of anything but scorn.\n\nHow many of our people died when we liberated that misbegotten tumour in the west from the Warzenans? How much blood did we spend on protecting those fat gold-mongers, and what good did it do our people? Our greatest leader lies dead, our sacred rituals are reduced to pageantry to pacify us, and the one who should lead us became a puppet controlled by the debased foreigners. This is "modernity", this is what "progress" means to the outsiders. It is the taste they give their honeyed words to mask the poison inside.\n\nWhat have we bled for? What did we fight so hard for? What was the point of any of this?! That we would become twisted from within and reduced to slaves?! Modernity is a plague of the mind, one that destroys a people from within and leaves them beholden to only gold and greed. It is a mirage leading you astray and thirsting to death, all so that the carrion feeders can pick at your bones!\n\nIt is a false promise, one that has taken enough from us, all so that the tumour can keep feeding on us.

 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck:0 "The Rat of Tobuck"
 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was the crown jewel of Zarantia, and the Equestrian that now occupies it is a blight.

 ZAR_merchant_objections:0 "Merchant Objections"

 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks_desc:0 "Agzhat was never more than a gathering place for the tribes, yet with Mekiouzza's ascension it became so much more.

 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered. The price if we fail is too high."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult deals." 
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals and Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure the Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud leader Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best and Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths of Mutual Defense"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many tribal leader are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, Mekiouzza has suggested that instead they will choose representatives to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

 ZAR_issue_of_land:0 "The Issue of Land"  
 ZAR_issue_of_land_desc:0 "It is from the land that our riches are gathered and grown, and from where the people stem. It is such a shame that the land is either held by absentee lords or lies fallow with no owner. To begin the path to modernity, this must be fixed."
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck:0 "Our Own Tobuck"
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was a crutch to our nation's economy, and overreliance on it will not be a mistake we will repeat. Through investment, internal and external, we will carve a new jewel within our land."
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes:0 "Settling Land Disputes"
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes_desc:0 "One problem with land are the ancient disputes over who owns which land, or if it is owned in the first place. The traditional ways of handling these issues have proven futile. Modern methods are needed to work these problems out."

 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors_desc:0 "Even if we do not have the know-how that we need to continue our march towards a modern society, other nations and their people have. Gold is a powerful motivator, and some can be swayed to apply the white heat of technology to Zarantia."
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless:0 "Land for the Landless"
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless_desc:0 "The final step of the land reform is to grant what land that is available to tenant farmers and those who do not stand to inherit land. A new land of smallholders and independent farmers, where it is not just a small class of lords that take all the profit."

 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth_desc:0 "Where some see desolate wastes, we see opportunity. Riches beyond our dreams lie beneath the sands, and they are waiting for those worthy to use them as they see fit. We will find them, and we will use it for the betterment of Zarantia."
 ZAR_schooling_for_all:0 "Schooling for All"
 ZAR_schooling_for_all_desc:0 "Everything is founded on thoughts and brains. Though our generation may have been able to lift itselves up from our own disadvantages, we should not neglect the next generation. Everyone will need to receive an education. Tomorrow's battles will be faced by minds, not muscles."
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains:0 "Hammers to Break their Chains"
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains_desc:0 "Slavery is not only a weight to our economical potential, but a historical debt towards out people, for it has no place for a Zarantia that desires to grow. What only remains is to discuss how we will abolish this rot to our society."
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road:0 "The Trans-Zarantian Road"
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road_desc:0 "Everything needs a place to be. The hammer needs the nail, the fuel the engine. And roads are how it gets there. It is no good having the parts if they cannot come together. A road is sorely needed."
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck:0 "The Second Tobuck"
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck_desc:0 "Foreign investments, labor and trade flows through Agzhat's markets and factories like water, the rough diamond not only turned into a oasis, but as as one of the finest jewels of Mekiouzza's Crown. Our work to bring Zarantia to the modern age is far from over, but there's no shame in taking a moment to gaze upon our works."


 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert:0 "The Rules of the Desert"
 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have lived in these lands for centuries through countless toils and hardships. Why should this time be any different? These traditions and customs have not steered the tribes wrong before and they will not this time. It must be ensured that they are enshrined in law to preserve and refine them."
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws:0 "Tribal Support Laws"
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws_desc:0 "The building block of Imazeeb society is the tribe. Before Zarantia and all else is the tribe. As such, laws must be enacted to ensure that the tribes can take care of themselves and take care of their own, even if it comes at the expense of the state as a whole."
 ZAR_division_of_labour:0 "The Division of Labour"
 ZAR_division_of_labour_desc:0 "While such a term like “division of labour” may seem out of place among the Imazeeb, it is not. All must do their part to ensure their community runs smoothly and all are provided for. By codifying existing traditions regarding labour, we can ensure small communities continue to operate smoothly."
 ZAR_everyzebras_right:0 "Everyzebra's Right"
 ZAR_everyzebras_right_desc:0 "All creatures yearn to be free, and zebras are no different. By putting zebras in chains, we violate that natural urge. On top of this, slave labour is proving inadequate for producing the complex machinery and tools used in modern methods. As such, slavery in its current form will be incrementally abolished and all slaves allowed to live (and more importantly work) as they please."
 ZAR_internal_trade:0 "Internal Trade"
 ZAR_internal_trade_desc:0 "While all the people may need is within our borders, it does not mean everyzebra can easily access them. By encouraging trade and caravans between villages and tribes, all will be able to benefit from our wealth and focus on the development of their own communities."
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops:0 "The Thousand Workshops"
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops_desc:0 "We do not need the massive, towering and dirty factories of the citydwellers. Cottage industry can be just as effective and every household is its own factory producing whatever the tribes, and therefore we, need be it swords, rifles, horseshoes, or silverware."
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships:0 "National Apprenticeships"
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships_desc:0 "Apprenticeships and masters teaching new tradezebras is a fairly common method of expanding skilled labor here and elsewhere in the world.

 ZAR_duty_to_aid:0 "A Duty to Aid"
 ZAR_duty_to_aid_desc:0 "While we may not have the extensive handouts and welfare of our urban neighbours, we are not heartless. Everyzebra falls on hard times once in a while, and it is the duty of everyzebra in the community to help lift them up. Likewise, we should show hospitality and generosity to strangers of our tribes. Let us turn no pony, zebra, or otherwise away if they are in need."

 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own_desc:0 "While this may seem like a loose union, it is still a strong one within. In such a short time, the groundwork has been laid to ensure the Imazeeb tribes remain relevant and stronger than ever without abandoning our core values. With this alliance of tribes and families, we are sure to stand up to any challenge that may come to our homeland."

 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck:0 "Drive out the Thieves"
 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come to retake Tobuck. Pea Shooter might be gone, but his former allies still infest the city and they have made it clear they will not surrender it. So bet it then. Like we did fifty years ago, we will free Tobuck by force of arms and teach the thieves the price of crossing us."
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed:0 "Tobuck Reclaimed"
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed_desc:0 "In the end, the gun runners threats and boasts were nothing more than bluffs and empty banter. Once again, our armies claim Tobuck and reunite us with long lost brothers and sisters. Small pockets of resistance are still being found across the region, but for the time being, the Zarantia flag can pridefully fly against Tobuck's skies!"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges:0 "Tobuckian Pledges"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges_desc:0 "While the population and the armies celebrate in the streets, our scribes wage another battle, not by weapons, but in pen and paper. Many communities within Tobuck still need to renew their pledges and be brought back into the fold. With the mess we have been left, this will take time..."
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes:0 "Restoring the Old Routes"
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes_desc:0 "It seems the Gun Runners' last spiteful bark at us was to blow up the roads and bridges that connected our cities. No matter, routes can be rebuilt and retraced, and those who destroyed them are gone."
 ZAR_emerald_fields:0 "The Emerald Fields"
 ZAR_emerald_fields_desc:0 "The Tobuckian Sea is known by its verdant, emerald gleam, but it's countryside where the emerald fields lie are its true treasure. Now that Tobuck is finally reunited with us, it is a simple matter of fixing those factories, and re-establishing the emerald trade. While we can't get back the profit those thieves profitted from our bounty, we can however return from where we left off."
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge:0 "Tobuckian Knowledge"
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge_desc:0 "The swindlers and thieves left behind a vast wealth of knowledge after we drove them from our city. It would be folly to allow it to go to waste. As such, we must collect it up and replicate it so that we may instead bend the tools of the greedy for the good of all."
 ZAR_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"
 ZAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "As the last pockets of resistance are dealt with, and the last negotiations and pledges are made, the trading port of Tobuck is finally open for business once more! West, East or beyond, Zarantia welcomes all!"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city:0 "Taking Stock of the City"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city_desc:0 "The retaking of Tobuck was costly to both our warriors and the city itself.

Who knows, maybe they will stumble on something missed before?"
 ZAR_learning_from_change:0 "Learning from Change"
 ZAR_learning_from_change_desc:0 "With Tobuck finally back under our control, we can allow ourselves to look to the future.

For Zarantia, a new chapter now opens." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_offer_assurances:0 "Offer Assurances to the People"
 ZAR_offer_assurances_desc:0 "Though those that collaborated with our enemy deserve no pity nor mercy, we must not forget why we came here.

 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay:0 "The Pearl of the Green Bay"
 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck suffered for a long time under the yoke of foreign adventurers who cared nothing for its people. Under Mekiouzza's leadership Tobuck shall be reforged into a mighty city, and a true capital of an united Zarantia." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution:0 "The Hour of Retribution"
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution_desc:0 "Mercy has its place, but not when dealing with liars and backstabbers. Their words were worth nothing, and they have caused both us and our Tobuckian kin countless woes. For that, they will die, and their deaths will serve as a warning."
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords:0 "Hunting them Down to the Last"
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords_desc:0 "There is no escape for the scum who thought they could steal Tobuck from us. We will chase them to the edge of the world if we have to, and our vengeance will be terrible."
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world:0 "A Warning to the World"
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world_desc:0 "Years ago, we lost Tobuck to a band of bandits, thieves, mercenaries and cut-throats. As a flock of carrion birds they followed the Storm King there, believing they could prey on our lands undisturbed, that the Imazeeb tribes were too weak to oppose them. But now, the time has come; all shall learn the price for facing a united Zarantia!" #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong:0 "Zarantia Stands Strong"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong_desc:0 "Tobuck's defences were damaged in the fighting, but also by a general lack of maintenance. Always the fools, the Gun Runners clearly were not interested in investing on their own safety. Now that we have returned, we shall rebuild the city's bastions and turn them into impregnable forts, ready to repel any invader." #AAAAAAH

 ZAR_the_eternal_federation_desc:0 "We weep for the Great Aguellid as we put her to rest, but in her wake is left a great void that cannot be filled by any one zebra. She was great, but now other zebras must stand together and each be a co-equal part of carrying what she carried alone."
 ZAR_zarantia_is_amsisi:0 "Zarantia is Amsisi"
 ZAR_zarantia_is_amsisi_desc:0 "We came together as many different peoples: nomadic, settled, modernising, traditionalist, militant, mercantile, it all came together as one under the principle of Amsisi; unity not through conformity, but tolerance and mutual respect. That is Zarantia, that and nothing else, and those who claim otherwise should be viewed with suspicion."
 ZAR_first_among_equals:0 "First Among Equals"
 ZAR_first_among_equals_desc:0 "We honor Umalez Ataghan not as the daughter of the Great Aguellid, but also for her own efforts for our people. Yet like her, we have learned from her mother. She has a place of honor in the federation we build, but it is one among us, not above us."
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council:0 "An Ascendant Council"
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council_desc:0 "The seeds that were planted by the Great Aguellid are blooming, and the council she created has reached its true potential.

 ZAR_a_many_headed_state:0 "A Many-Headed State."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state_desc:0 "The Great Aguellid's shortcoming was that she was but one zebra, and that as power flowed from her, it lessened all those around her. Zarantia is not one tribe, but many, and thus every tribal chief must be part of the leadership."
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us:0 "The Desert Belongs to Us"
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us_desc:0 "Though the desert causes our people many woes, it is also the source of our strength.

 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty:0 "Sharing in Modernity's Bounty"
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty_desc:0 "Though we have reaffirmed the tribes, we realise that there is no going back. Though the sword has its place, the gun is ascendant, and though the caravan fed us for centuries, the train runs faster and more tirelessly. We will continue trading for these new tools and machines, and we will build our tribes with them."
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth:0 "The Hidden Wealth"
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "New tools means new discoveries out in the wild hinterlands, and every tribe knows that it will earn a good living from the metals and minerals that are found.

 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms_desc:0 "We may not have the raw industrial power of other nations, but we have the grit and the spirit that has allowed us to thrive in even the most inhospitable of lands. Let the enemy come with their armored cars and tanks and cannons, we will lead them through a merry dance across the dunes, and their sun-bleached bones will serve as a warning to the others who would threaten our home."
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands:0 "A Sanctuary in the Sands"
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands_desc:0 "The world is a bloody place, and countless are fleeing the ravages of war and death. We who sit in a prosperous homeland must consider that most sacred of virtues, hospitality. When you see a lost wanderer you aid them, period. The same holds true today, and just because they arrive by boats or refugee caravans, they are no less lost."
 ZAR_friends_abroad:0 "Friends Abroad"
 ZAR_friends_abroad_desc:0 "We may be watchful, but we are not hostile. Those who show honor and act honestly are worthy of respect, whether Imazeeb or not, and as the night draws close, one cannot have enough friends."
 ZAR_facing_the_future:0 "Facing the Future"
 ZAR_facing_the_future_desc:0 "Though the Imazeeb change, we have changed on our terms. We learned from the highest of us, and rose to stand as tall as her. We don't know what the future will hold, but we know that we had a good teacher, who would not accept us failing."

 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb's greatest moment was when it swept forth from the desert to deliver the oppressed people of Tobuck.

 ZAR_finding_allies:0 "Finding Allies"

 ZAR_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Time and tide waits for no mare. We have only started to build a strong and prosperous Zarantia, and instead of resting on our laurels, we need to launch ourselves forwards, and use the wealth we've gained to speed up our efforts."
 ZAR_settling_the_coast:0 "Settling the Coast"
 ZAR_settling_the_coast_desc:0 "With the recent chaos, the Tobuckian countryside is not nearly as populated as it should be, and we have an opportunity here.

 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads_desc:0 "Trains are loud, noisy, complicated and utterly wonderful. Hundreds of tonnes of cargo, easily enough for a great caravan, all carried at speeds we couldn't even dream of. This is more than a vehicle, it is the key to Zarantia's trading future!"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century:0 "New Century, New Laws"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century_desc:0 "A changing society demands changing laws. What exact taxes are we supposed to apply to electronic devices? How low can the airplanes that now cross our skies fly? How shall we treat patents? There's much to decide on here."
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen:0 "Honoring the greatest Aguellid"
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza Ataghan was more than an Aguellid. She was the founding mother of Zarantia, the liberator of Tobuck and the one who elevated the imazeeb. As our capitol grows it might not change name, but it will be shaped in her memory."
 ZAR_amsisi_laws:0 "Amsisi Laws"
 ZAR_amsisi_laws_desc:0 "The guiding principle of our nation is and will always remain that of Amsisi, but as Zarantia grows and changes, it risks drifting away from these principles.

 ZAR_the_desert_patrol:0 "The Desert Patrol"
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol_desc:0 "Traditionally, the tribes have kept watch over their lands of the desert, but as these old duties are laid to rest, we need something else.

 ZAR_the_zarantian_court:0 "The Zarantian Court"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court_desc:0 "Around the queen of Zarantia, a vast organisation of civil servants and bureaucrats is emerging, one that will need to be tied closely to the rest of the nation if the queen is to be able to continue her duties to the people."

 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants_desc:0 "The Buckharans are a strange people, and for the longest time, we've been content to mind our affairs while they mind theirs. Still, they are distant kin of the imazeeb all the same, and they've come before Umalez with their heads bowed."
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad:0 "The Trans-Zebharan Railroad"
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad_desc:0 "The Zebhara has been an eternal barrier, a line across the map that divides north and south Zebrica, and the edges of it thrive off the trade that can flow past it. Yet now, the technological progress of recent years makes the impossible possible; a great road of iron cutting straight through it."
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara:0 "Liberating Buckhara"

 ZAR_the_crossroad_kingdom_desc:0 "For a long time, the lands of the imazeeb were seen as distant frontiers far from civilisation. yet now, in the marriage between the Imazeeb and Tobuck and between sea and desert, we stand tall and proud as one people in a nation we built together."

 ZAR_violence_is_authority:0 "Authority through Violence"
 ZAR_violence_is_authority_desc:0 "Violence is how authority is kept. If you cannot defend what is yours, thieves and invaders will take it from you.

 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance:0 "Reaching for Dominance"
 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance_desc:0 "Zarantia's fate is forged by one zebra, and the nation must be an extension of her will. My mother realized, almost too late, that the bartering and dealing that all Aguellids had engaged in prior to this left them weak. I will not make the same mistake."

 ZAR_tightening_the_grip_desc:0 "The more those who would refuse my authority struggle, the harder my hoof will press down on them. They have already seen the price of defiance, and if they choose to continue struggling they prove that they will never have a place in Zarantia."

 ZAR_servants_of_the_throne_desc:0 "There shall be one way to true success and status in Zarantia, and that shall be to serve the queen. The finest minds shall be dedicated to the nation, not to personal wealth or advancement. In servitude, power. In devotion, greatness."

 ZAR_the_weak_will_bow_desc:0 "The world has taught Zarantia the price of being weak, and now, as she has clawed itself to a position of strength, the pendulum swings the other way. By my strength - the only justification needed - Zarantia shall conquer."
 ZAR_imperial_zarantian_chargers:0 "The Imperial Zarantian Chargers"
 ZAR_imperial_zarantian_chargers_desc:0 "The throne held by force can be taken by force, and in order to more firmly hold onto it, the finest warriors from across Zarantia shall be gathered to her personal service, so that whenever a threat arises, the finest warriors know who they serve."
 ZAR_dragging_them_into_the_future:0 "Dragging them into the Future"
 ZAR_dragging_them_into_the_future_desc:0 "The tribes are an antiquated concept from a bygone age. The Zarantian people need only their queen and their state to find kinship. They will settle and create the factories and fields needed to feed a modern nation-state."
 ZAR_ending_the_era_of_tribes:0 "Ending the Era of the Tribes"
 ZAR_ending_the_era_of_tribes_desc:0 "The tribal chiefs are done away with, and the tribes are being reduced to little more than formalities. In due time, it will be little more than a quaint legacy."

 ZAR_give_with_one_hoof_take_with_other_desc:0 "When my enemies lie broken before me, they will find that they are given their due in submission, and that their new queen is a generous one.

 ZAR_empress_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The dawn rises over a Zarantia greater than ever before. It has finally, after decades of suffering, cast off its weakness and disunity. Now it is a true empire, one that will write its name into the history books now, and for centuries ahead!"

 ZAR_controlling_the_trans_zebrican_trade_desc:0 "Zarantia's first breath was taken through the trade that flowed across the continent. It is in its destiny to control this trade, and anyone who presumes to cross the desert will pay their dues."

 #####Oil Industry Tree#####

 ZAR_the_black_gold:0 "The Black Gold"
 ZAR_the_black_gold_desc:0 "Deep beneath our sands lies something more precious than gold, gems or even crystals. Oil; the life-blood of the new century. For Zarantia to prosper, we must tap the great deposits within our lands, so that they might fuel the machine of progress."
 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did. It would be foolish for us not to learn from their methods, and their experts have surely much to teach us for the right price. Still, many wonder if depending to foreign expertise is truly a wise choice."
 ZAR_the_oil_fund:0 "The Oil Fund"
 ZAR_the_oil_fund_desc:0 "Oil brings wealth; wealth, however, is always accompanied by greed. The creation of specific institutions will help us prevent the concentration of wealth in the hooves of the few. Resources will be allocated to projects beneficial to all."
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells:0 "The Zamfara Wells"
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells_desc:0 "Our prospecting teams have discovered extensive oil deposits around Zamfara, deep beneath the ground. We'll be quickly dispatching construction crews and newly-bought equipment in the designated sites so that they may prepare the wells."
 ZAR_advanced_resource_extraction:0 "Advanced Resource Extraction"

 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells:0 "The Zajhari Wells"
 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells_desc:0 "Our expedition from Zajhari has returned with excellent news; new deposits have been discovered in the area. Now, they may not be as extensive as others are, but they also are not too deep underground. This will undoubtedly make extraction easier for our crews."
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture:0 "New Methods of Agriculture"
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture_desc:0 "For a long time, our food production was held back by harsh environment and rudimentary techniques. This will no longer be the case; in exchange for our oil, foreign nations are ready to share with us not only their expertise, but tractors and industrial fertilizers as well. Our people will never go hungry again."
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure:0 "The New Century's Infrastructure"
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure_desc:0 "Long pipelines of steel now snake across our lands, delivering the precious black gold to newly-built plants in a constant flow.

 ZAR_the_tobuck_stock_exchange_desc:0 "Tobuck is no stranger to commerce and trade, but the great influx of wealth from the oil industry has brought it to all new heights. It's fame now spread all over the world, from Manehattan to De Vleugels, and the stocks rise accordingly."

 ZAR_the_desert_blossoms_desc:0 "When, centuries ago, our ancestors dug the first irrigation canals across the dry Zebhara, could they have envisioned this outcome?

 ZAR_boomtimes:0 "Boomtimes"
 ZAR_boomtimes_desc:0 "Oil has brought great wealth to us, and we wisely spread it amongst the many rather than the few. Hospitals, schools, and infrastructures have been built, and our people can now enjoy exotic products from distant lands. Zarantia has changed and, thankfully, for the better."
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting:0 "Wide-Scale Prospecting"
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting_desc:0 "We can now expand our extraction operations to a degree never seen before. Thanks to the constant efforts of our tireless prospector teams, new deposits are been discovered each month. Not a stone will be left unturned."
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society:0 "Modern Science and Society"
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society_desc:0 "As more and more complex machinery are introduced, we can no longer depend on the experience of foreign experts. Curriculums must be revised and new specialised schools opened for eager young minds. There, Zarantia's future will truly take form."

 ZAR_ascent_igennet:0 "The Ascent of the Mortuary Cult"
 ZAR_ascent_igennet_desc:0 "They presided over Mekiouzza's funeral, and they were the first to call out as Zarantia was twisted. They heard the call of the goddess and they came to her side. For the first time, the Mortuary Cults rule truly supreme among our people."
 ZAR_cut_out_cancer:0 "Cut Out the Cancer"
 ZAR_cut_out_cancer_desc:0 "They used us to free themselves, they proved their faithlessness when a foreign schemer could turn them against us so easily, and they aided him in murdering the great Aguellid. Tobuck was never our kin, they were the cancer that killed our hopes and dreams."
 ZAR_song_of_ijirmed:0 "The Song of the Ijirmed"
 ZAR_song_of_ijirmed_desc:0 "As the goddess calls, the great worms come to her. They delve through rock and sand, striking from nowhere and bring down even the mightiest walls. We now walk alongside the destroyer, and dance to the song of death."

 ZAR_no_remorse_no_retreat_desc:0 "This is not a mere conflict over lands or wealth or honor, and we have to discard any notions that we should back down if the challenge is too great. We WILL die in this conflict, the question is simply how, and how many we take with us."
 ZAR_people_at_war:0 "A People at War"
 ZAR_people_at_war_desc:0 "All will die one day, and the goddess calls us all to our sacred purpose. The imazeeb that does not join this cause is no kin of ours, but traitors as bad as the Tobuckians."
 ZAR_tools_of_war:0 "All the Tools of War"
 ZAR_tools_of_war_desc:0 "Though we are tasked with throwing back the sickness that infested our lands, that does not mean we must reject all the tools it has provided. We are already tainted by it, so making use of their weapons to undo them is no sacrifice."
 ZAR_return_old_gods:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 ZAR_return_old_gods_desc:0 "In this struggle, we walk alongside the great gods of old, hearing names we had long forgotten. If we are to die, we can at least have done our part to ensure that the worms remain behind."

 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia:0 "No Tobuck, no Zarantia, only Igennet"
 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia_desc:0 "Tobuck is tainted and needed to go, but the people within were slaves to the falsehoods it represented just like we were. We shall scatter them among the tribes, and they will come to hear the song of the gods as well. In the end, we shall become one after all."
 ZAR_tobuck_burning:0 "Tobuck Burning"
 ZAR_tobuck_burning_desc:0 "With this act, we settle the old scores utterly, and teach the old, tainted world the final lesson our people's honor demanded that we teach it. This city that caused so much strife and so much contention is no more, and nobody remains to recreate it."

 ZAR_feeding_the_creation:0 "Feeding the Creation"
 ZAR_feeding_the_creation_desc:0 "The flame that burns the brightest is snuffed out all the faster for it, and though our duty is to bring about the end of the world, harsh words and rocks will not avail us in this struggle.

 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction:0 "Feeding the Destruction"
 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction_desc:0 "The destruction of this tainted world is a sacred duty, one that will brook no half measures. Not a single stone must be left atop another, and not a single road must be left unspoilt.

 ZAR_reverbrating_across_the_world:0 "Reverbrating Across the World"
 ZAR_reverbrating_across_the_world_desc:0 "What good will the destruction of one tainted city do? The curse of this world order has seeped into every corner of it. A cancer not fully cut out will return and kill you all the same. Thus, we must continue to cut."
 ZAR_all_shall_fight:0 "All Shall Fight"
 ZAR_all_shall_fight_desc:0 "We are one in this purpose, and no other cause can trump it. Parent, child, sibling, spouse, it matters not, and if our loved ones have died, we gladly throw ourselves into this fight to die and be reunited with them."
 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins:0 "Quelling the Ruins"
 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins_desc:0 "Those that wander the devastation we've left behind are more than willing to continue to fight. It is honorable, but pointless. All will bow before Ijirmed, and as the goddess moves through these lands, they will see in the end."

 ZAR_the_eldest_come_desc:0 "The greatest of the Ijirmed have slept for centuries, deep below the desert, yet even they are roused from their slumber, and the very earth is rent asunder as they, the greatest of the divine heralds, surge forth to break the old world apart."

 ZAR_the_city_regained_desc: "It has been too long, but finally the great city of Tobuck has been returned to us. The scheming smugglers turned out to possess some modicum of honor, and honred their promises. We now return home, to rebuild and to greet our old friends."
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites: "Summoning the Elites"
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites_desc: "As the city is restored to Zarantian control, we must summon the old power brokers and figureheads before the Aguellid. They are still welcome under her rule, and a grand ceremony will let their return to her service be a great and honored moment."
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service: "Vasile cel Tradat at your Service"
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service_desc: "One of Pea Shooter's accomplices - a griffon from distant Brodfeld - have remained behind when his colleague ran off. It appears that he has realised there are few places for his kind to run, and he has offered his services to the Aguellid in exchange for safety."
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends: "Our Faithful Friends"
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends_desc: "There are those in the city who never forgot Tobuck's debt to the Zarantians, and who were ready and willing to aid us should it have come to war. These brave souls deserve to be recognized for their honor. Friendship is a valuable commodity, and we know its price."
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets: "Dancing In the Streets"
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets_desc: "Above all else, the union between Tobuck and the Imazeeb is one of mutual respect and honor, and we view the city folk not simply as subjects, but as honored friends and an integral part of Zarantia. Recent events have shaken them, however, and we need to remind them of the esteem we hold them in."
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law: "Reminding Them Of the Law"
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law_desc: "The Tobuckians are traders at heart, and they have always strived towards new and better deals. Sometimes this is at the expense of the law, and though we accept it, we do not let it get out of hoof. Fair warning will be given, but they have always known we treat the law seriously, and they can't have expected that to change."
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance: "Reestablishing Dominance"
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance_desc: "The city is under control, but the outlying areas which have been neglected for over a year, still go about life in their own way. They need to be made aware of the change in leadership, and that we may well come to ask them to do their part soon."
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck: "Lessons From Tobuck"
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck_desc: "It is a bitter pill to swallow, but there are things we can learn from Pea Shooter and his efforts here. Not all he did came out of brute force, and he managed to balance several factions quite well. Learning from him might feel distasteful, but there is value in it all the same."
 ZAR_the_migration: "The Migration"
 ZAR_the_migration_desc: "The coastlines were ravaged by the Storm King more than most areas of Zarantia. Many regions lie abandoned, not the least since their inhabitants fled into the desert. Now that the lands are reclaimed, they can finally return home again."
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck: "Mayor Of Tobuck"
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck_desc: "He is a snake, but nocreature can deny that Vasile cel Tradat has been an indispensible asset as we restore our hold over Tobuck.

 ZAR_the_rightful_capitol: "The Rightful Capitol"

 ZAR_international_assurances: "International Assurances"
 ZAR_international_assurances_desc: "There's been no limit of the concern expressed internationally after the fall of Tobuck. An important trade city was left to anarchy and crime, after all.

 ZAR_city_of_opportunities: "City Of Opportunities"
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities_desc: "Tobuck is a free city, one of opportunity and propsperity, over which the watchful Aguellid holds her hoof. Those who seek to earn their fortune may do so here honestly and without concern, for all of Zarantia watches vigilantly over their jewel of a city."
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck: "The Aguellid-Queen of Zarantia and Tobuck"
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck_desc: "A Queen is born, an Aguellid is chosen, and they are not the same. Yet, Tobuck is the gate between the Imazeeb and the world, and as we step into into the world, we must understand their ways. For this reason, Mekiouzza shall become both."

 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords: "Dealing With Warlords"
 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords_desc: "Pea Shooter is gone, but his thugs and enforcers are still covering the countryside like so much mold. They resent the loss of their meal ticket, and will not depart silently. We must decide how to deal with them."
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits: "A Sword For Bandits"
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits_desc: "The warlords are murderers and thieves, and we suffer neither. They were a threat when united under their old master, but now they are disorganised and scrambling. Do not let them regain their footing, kill them all."
 ZAR_one_by_one: "One By One"
 ZAR_one_by_one_desc: "Instead of letting them gather, we move swiftly to cut them off from each other and proceed to destroy them one after another. We are not dealing with warriors, but with murderous thugs, and this is not war, but a justice found in blood."
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood: "Washed Clean In Blood"
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood_desc: "The warlords are no more, and their bands of roaming highwaycreatures have been given the end they deserve. If there are anyone out there who believed that the Imazeeb were weak or hesitant to measure out justice, they now know how wrong they were."
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals: "Gently With Cornered Animals"
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals_desc: "Pea Shooter honored his deal and departed peacefully, and many lives were spared for it. Do we think the warlords are determined to fight to the bitter end for honor's sake? Of course not, so we can likely coax them to just leave as well, and spare ourselves the losses that crushing them would entail."
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons: "Lay Down Weapons"
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons_desc: "It is a frustrating and drawn out dance to get them to leave, much like handling a scared, angry animal, but opening up corridors to the borders or the ports to them is having its effects. As long as we do not do anything surprising, they will depart."
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy: "Yesterdays Enemy"
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy_desc: "A curious situation has emerged. It seems like one of the warlords - an exile from her distant homeland in the north - is tired of running. She has planted her forces firmly in the southwest and sent a message to the Aguellid. Her offer: fealty in return for a home."
 ZAR_law_and_order: "Law And Order"
 ZAR_law_and_order_desc: "The first duty of any leader is to provide security, and the warlords are not the only armed criminals found in Tobuck. Many of them have been acting brazenly against the tribes and villages, believing themselves beyond the reach of the law. This must be rectified, now."
 ZAR_the_pacification: "The Pacification"
 ZAR_the_pacification_desc: "Zarantia's oath to Tobuck included providing safety for the people. After the Storm King and thanks to Pea Shooter, we failed in this promise for a while. Now however, order is restored, and the lands of Tobuck are once again safe."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy: "A Zarantian Navy"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy_desc: "Before the fall of Tobuck, one of the projects that the Aguellid had decided on was the creation of a Zarantian navy, warriors wholly dedicated to warfare at sea. The sea is a different place though, and it has its own rules."
 ZAR_steel_behemoths: "Steel Behemoths"
 ZAR_steel_behemoths_desc: "Warships are immense things, larger than even many buildings, and the firepower they carry is equally immense. It goes without saying that building these things demands immense expertise and resources both. Thankfully, we have contacts that can help us on the way."
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding: "Tobuck Shipbuilding"
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding_desc: "A gun can be put together by a skilled gunsmith in his home, but the notion of said gunsmith hammering away at a thousand tonne steel colossus is more like the setup for a joke. As with all things, the new age demands new kinds of workshops, and the Tobuckians have contacts."
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral: "A Curious Admiral"
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral_desc: "We are not sure where exactly he came from, nor if he actually is an admiral or just a lunatic, but he seems to know what he is doing, and he brings a cadre of capable sailors with him. From what we hear of his history, it might be prudent to keep a close eye on him."
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald: "Controling The Emerald"
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald_desc: "The Emerald Sea has featured in our people's stories since ancient times, and it has been a vein of commerce for just as long. It is our connection to the outside world, and we should be doing our absolute best to keep it open."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce: "A Zarantian Airforce"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce_desc: "The Hippogriffs brought down the Storm King through use of modern warplanes, wheras we were left having to run away. If we had possessed the kind of planes that Aris did, things would have been very different."
 ZAR_eyes_in_sky: "Nests of the Iron Birds"
 ZAR_eyes_in_sky_desc: "If we are to make use of these new machines, we will need to build specialised fields for them to take off from and land on. What more, they will need zebras specialised in caring for and repairing them to work there." 
 ZAR_sky_warriors: "Sky Warriors"
 ZAR_sky_warriors_desc: "The foundations of aerial might is the fighter plane; a raider able to move swiftly and strike against all that would threaten our warriors below. They are a warrior's shield and first into the fight, and they will demand much of those we choose for this role."
 ZAR_flying_artillery: "Flying Artillery"
 ZAR_flying_artillery_desc: "An artillery shell weighs maybe 50 kilos, and we've seen what such a weapon can do to an entire warband. What then can a shell ten times as heavy, not fired from many kilometers away but dropped straight from above on them, do?"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers: "The Skywalkers"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers_desc: "Those who fight in the skies are a nigh tribe unto themselves, with customs and beliefs that will by necessity come to differ from their land-fighting kin. We shuldn't shy away from this, but rather embrace it. Let the Igenwan fly high, and let their stories reverberate through our history!"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare: "New Ways Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare_desc: "The menagerie of bandits, thugs and mercenaries that infested Tobuck might have been a plague, but it was a capable one. They would not have held out against the attempts to dislodge them if they hadn't been. It is just as well that we accept this fact, and study what they did to see what we can learn from it."
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare: "New Tools Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare_desc: "The age where a rifle and a sword could carry a warrior to victory is long gone; the Storm King and his eventual defeat proved that. War is like a diamond, possessing many facets, and each one must be polished to an absolute shine."
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior: "A Hybrid Warrior"
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior_desc: "It is the Imazeeb way to adapt to her surroundings, and with the plethora of painful lessons we have gotten in recent years, the time has come to adapt more than ever before. The traditional warrior must die, and in its place something new - the unity of two worlds - must be born."
 ZAR_the_martial_elite: "The Martial Elite"
 ZAR_the_martial_elite_desc: "War is a craft, one that can take a lifetime to truly master, and like with many other crafts it has changed. With a thousand tools at the crafter's disposal, it takes immense training to master them all. War is no different, and this new era will be one where the masters will shine."
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds: "Dominating The Wilds"
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds_desc: "Moving forward does not mean to discard what you are, but it does mean you must question some things. The Imazeeb have always been masters of desert warfare, but did she rely on that too much? Tobuck is more than just desert, and we have new lessons to learn here."
 ZAR_the_big_guns: "The Big Guns"
 ZAR_the_big_guns_desc: "Whatever skills a warrior possesses, they will not avail him if he is blown to bits before even reaching the battlefield. These heavy guns will be crucial to warfare going ahead."
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge: "Importing the Knowledge of Warfare"
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge_desc: "There are many places across the world that has seen war on a scale we can scarcely imagine, and whose peoples have learned many hard lessons about war. We should make sure to listen to them, and gain the lessons they learned without paying the price they had to."
 ZAR_holding_the_line: "Holding The Line"
 ZAR_holding_the_line_desc: "Imazeeb warfare has long been built on mobility, but if we are to protect Tobuck in the future, we must reconsider this attitude. While mobility will avail our forces, there will also be times where we must dig our hooves in and let the enemy break against us."
 ZAR_the_bulwark: "The Bulwark"
 ZAR_the_bulwark_desc: "It doesn't matter how fast a warrior runs, or how quickly he adapts, if everywhere he attacks he will find deep tunnels and fortified bunkers waiting for him. We know what we fight to protect, and every drop of sweat spilled in building will pay dividends in blood."

 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold: "City Of Wonders And Gold"
 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold_desc: "Tobuck is as she always has been, and she has always been a wondrous city. Outsiders will preen and say 'well OUR city is greater' but they can eat sand. To us, Tobuck is a shining jewel, and the wealth and industrial might she offers us is the greatest prize."
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess: "Cleaning Up The Mess"
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess_desc: "Pea Shooter left the city in a right state. Having been more interested in plundering the Storm King's arsenal than keeping the city in order, we are now left with an entire year of economic development wiped from the books. We are, in essence, starting from scratch."
 ZAR_taking_stock: "Taking Stock"
 ZAR_taking_stock_desc: ""If it has not been measured, weighed and registered, it does not exist, and the Aguellid will claim it as hers when she finds it." These words have lit a fire under the Tobuckians, and they are more than eager to register their property, their companies and their businesses with us."
 ZAR_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 ZAR_modern_agriculture_desc: "Not even the farmer's field is safe from the march of progress, with strange new machines, fertilisers and countless new innovations making the fields more fertile than ever. Famine will truly be a thing of history going ahead."
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories: "Reopening the Factories"
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories_desc: "It has taken time, and in a couple of cases chasing down the thieves that had seized the tools and machinery, but finally the factories of Tobuck are starting to work again."
 ZAR_sprawling_roads: "Sprawling Roads"
 ZAR_sprawling_roads_desc: ""All roads lead to Tobuck" a merchant once told Mekiouzza. Admittedly he was looking to sell her something at the time, but the expression has stuck with the Aguellid ever since. If it is not true, then why not make it true?"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics: "Schools and Clinics"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics_desc: "All this change and development is pointless if it does not benefit the entirety of our people, especially the children. Those are for whom we build this new world after all, and they need new teachers to find their place in this world as well as doctors to save them from disease or injury."
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors: "Age Of Prospectors"
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors_desc: "There is wealth out in the desert, but many times we do not know what we look for. Finding iron is one thing, but what are you supposed to look for when looking for tungsten or chromium? We'll invite any prospectors willing to come to look, and to know that we pay well for any deposits they find."
 ZAR_cash_crops: "Cash Crops"
 ZAR_cash_crops_desc: "With Tobuck's fields once again under our control, and with the food supply ensured, we can start making good use of the fields for more than just sustenance farming. There is a deep thirst in the world for things like coffee or tobacco, and we grow it well here."
 ZAR_the_trading_port: "The Trading Port"
 ZAR_the_trading_port_desc: "Tobuck's port is more than just a port, it is the gateway into all of Zarantia, and it should be one of the finest in all of northern Zebrica. The time of tripping over each other and fighting for space is over, now Tobuck shall welcome everycreature who wishes to come."
 ZAR_finally_industrialising: "Finally Industrialising"
 ZAR_finally_industrialising_desc: "With Tobuck back in prime shape, we can finally embark on that glorious old plan from years ago to let the new industry and commerce flow from Tobuck out into the rest of Zarantia. After all, when the answer to "how are we meant to industrialise" is simply to point at Tobuck and say "do that", it is much easier."
 ZAR_trade_is_king: "Trade is King"
 ZAR_trade_is_king_desc: "War and Trade have been the foundations of imazeeb life for a long time, but this too is changing. Raiding, mercenary work or tribal conflicts are becoming a thing of the past, as we all are united around the pursuit and facilitation of trade."
 ZAR_the_great_dam: "The Great Dam"
 ZAR_the_great_dam_desc: "We have worked the desert and irrigated it for centuries, and if there is any area where the modern developments thrill us, it is here. Going ahead, the desert is going to become ours to mold as we wish on a scale never before seen."
 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel: "A Radiant Jewel"
 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel_desc: "When you cross the oceans and pass by Maregypt into the Emerald Sea, you come upon Tobuck, a trading city of prosperity and progress. This city stands between worlds, be it Maregyptians or Imazeeb, Zebrica or Equus/Griffonia, or any other, but all are home here. Welcome to Tobuck, home and opportunity for anycreature."

 ZAR_revolt_against_the_modern_world:0 "Revolt Against the Modern World"
 ZAR_revolt_against_the_modern_world_desc:0 "The madness must come to an end! We have been marched to the very brink by power hungry tyrants, and in all their hollow talk of "progress" and "modernity" they forgot to ask whether this was something any of us wanted. We now give our answer: no!"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people:0 "Return the Land to the Tribes"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people_desc:0 "Land was the first thing they sought to take from us, and we take it back. We till the land and thus it is ours, and no amount of long-winded bleating by city creatures who never worked a day in their lives can convince us otherwise."
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders:0 "Restore Tribal Elders to Power"
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders_desc:0 "Give a creature an inch and they take a mile, that is the truth of all autocrats, and restoring our own leaders is long overdue. The Aguellid has one duty only, and we will not allow whoever holds that position to forget that in the future."
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians:0 "Peasants, Not Proletarians"
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians_desc:0 "Though we have gotten some aid from the so called Marksists in other nations, we aren't so deluded to think that they are kin. Farming and trade is our lifeblood, not industry. Besides, someone who calls your way of life "the idiocy of rural life" shows they're no kin of yours." 
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert:0 "True Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert_desc:0 "We defend what is ours, and we do so by tooth and hoof to the bitter end. Nocreature has truly conquered the imazeeb, and nocreature ever will, not as long as we never forget the price of submitting."
 ZAR_trade_not_factories:0 "Trade, not Factories"
 ZAR_trade_not_factories_desc:0 "For centuries, our lifeblood has been trade, and that will remain the case. We still provide something no other creature can - safe passage across the Zebhara - and that will not change."
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand:0 "Farms in the Sand"
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand_desc:0 "We coax the desert to give what little it can, and over time, we have come to provide for ourselves. This is more than a grim necessity, this is our greatest achievement, and we should be proud of it!"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity:0 "Antiquity with Modern Elements"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity_desc:0 "We reject the outsiders' ways because they would destroy ours, but that does not mean we should reject it all out of hoof. There are still valuable lessons to learn, as long as they don't challenge our way of life."
 ZAR_no_exceptions:0 "No Exceptions"
 ZAR_no_exceptions_desc:0 "The outsiders' ways are a disease, and it does not matter how useful they might seem. Let one rat into the home, and you will soon have a thousand. We have no use for that which we cannot create ourselves."
 ZAR_desert_ambushes:0 "Desert Ambushes"
 ZAR_desert_ambushes_desc:0 "If an enemy comes for you, you run. You run deep into the desert, taking water where you can and lead him on a merry chase only to turn around and kill him when he's exhausted and delirious from the heat."
 ZAR_continue_flowering:0 "Continue the Flowering"
 ZAR_continue_flowering_desc:0 "Our great works in the desert are living proof that we do not need the outsiders. Are the Maregyptians making desert into farmland like we do? The Colthaginians? No, the imazeeb alone know how to make these lands fertile."
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling:0 "Encourage Desert Settling"
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert may be harsh and unforgiving, but at least it does not try to break your people and make you something you're not. Our people have claimed swathes of the desert and made it livable before, and can do so again."
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck:0 "Deindustrialize Tobuck"
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck_desc:0 "That damned city has caused us no end of woes at this point, but the cause is too obvious. The Tobuckians have been steeped in industry and wealth, and like strong drink it has gone to their heads. We'll tear the bottle out of their hooves, and after that, maybe we can finally find accord."
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling:0 "Enforce Desert Settling"
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert is tamed through tireless work, but our people is loathe to accept others telling them what to do. Yet, if there is any place where we should push to encourage, it is in the irrigation efforts."
 ZAR_hidden_supplies:0 "Hidden Supplies"
 ZAR_hidden_supplies_desc:0 "They say that we live off sand and sunlight, and they can continue to think that. In truth, we just know how to hide supplies across the desert, and the task of creating these stockpiles is a revered position. The desert kills the unprepared, and we are always prepared."
 ZAR_community_and_tradition:0 "Community and Tradition"
 ZAR_community_and_tradition_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have endured since time immemorial through two great pillars: an eternal respect for tradition, and an ironclad community. That is all that we have ever truly needed, and we will sttle for this. We are imazeeb, no matter what the world tries to make us."

 #### Leader Descriptions ####

 ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of February 941 in northern Zarantia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of the leader of the Ataghan tribe. Ever the precocious child, her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the imazeeb tribes in throwing off the Warzenan yoke. Though not even a chief, she was the first to pledge herself to aid them and managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs as well.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"

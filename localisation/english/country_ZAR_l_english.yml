For many decades have the balance of their myriad interests worked by Mekiouzza, her sheer presence and success more than enough to keep the tribes beating to the rhythm of her drum\n\nHowever, her time is running out, and the years ever since the death of the Storm King have led to a deep gap between the tribes, and her relationship with them.\n\nIf Zarantia is to have any future to be a power within North Zebrica, Mekiouzza must unite the disparate tribes' interests with her own, lest her power slips past her hooves like the sand of the ageless desert she calls home.\n\n£house_texticon Agzhat's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Agzhat_Compliance_Text]\n\n£mountain_texticon Zinder's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zinder_Compliance_Text]\n\n£glass_texticon Zawagh's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zawagh_Compliance_Text]\n\n£textiles_texticon Zajhari's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zajhari_Compliance_Text]\n\n£caravan_texticon Shizra's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Shizra_Compliance_Text]\n\n£alchemy_texticon Senmare's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Senmare_Compliance_Text]\n\n£sea_texticon Menzaka's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Menzaka_Compliance_Text]\n\n£gunandshield_texticon Zamfara's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zamfara_Compliance_Text]\n\n"

 zarantia.1.t:0 "The Aguellid"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. As all things were born, so all things must die, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capital in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months. Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "I am not dead yet, you insolent whelp!"

 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Menes Amasdag - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return.""
 zarantia.2.a:0 "Pea Shooter is a rat, and he shall be aware of where he stands."
 zarantia.2.b:0 "It is humiliating, but we can ill afford pride."

 zarantia.3.t:0 "From The Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Agzhat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the cities of the coast - built for defence as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Agzhat, they have been good."
 zarantia.3.a:0 "It's no Tobuck, but it's a good home."

 zarantia.4.t:0 "A Changing World"
 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the Colthaginians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Green Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being Colthaginians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""
 zarantia.4.a:0 ""We must make sure that they won't lose themselves.""
 zarantia.4.b:0 ""We serve so that the Imazeeb can change on their terms.""

 zarantia.5.t:0 "The Path To Unity"
 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honoured, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""
 zarantia.5.a:0 ""If things continue as they are, unity must be forced.""
 zarantia.5.b:0 ""But you are right. Our people must come together on their own terms.""

 zarantia.6.t:0 "A Settling People"
 zarantia.6.d:0 ""The Colthaginians are an amusing sort." Mekiouzza said out of the blue. "We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Agzhat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""
 zarantia.6.a:0 ""Those nomads helped us claim Tobuck, and I've not forgotten.""
 zarantia.6.b:0 ""I stand by the cities and towns, they are the way forward.""

 zarantia.7.t:0 "Everyzebra's Aguellid"
 zarantia.7.d:0 ""When you meet with Mekiouzza Ataghan, be careful." Wasif Talat warned the young colt by his side. "She is a dangerous mare, maybe even the most dangerous mare you will meet."\n\n"I've heard the stories of her, but all they say is that she fights her enemies, not her allies. Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?" The young colt was strong, and would become a great warrior one day, but he was still ignorant of the games of chieftains and aguellids.\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them whether we like it or not.""
 zarantia.7.a:0 "Slip up around her, and you too will be her ward."

 zarantia.8.t:0 "The Thousand-Mile Traveler"
 zarantia.8.d:0 "The sharp, spicy aroma of the sacred Igennet tea rose from the bowl between them, and Mekiouzza raised the bowl to offer to the wise sage that sat before her. Wiwurgh Tasawent was a Zebra slight of stature, though just how much was hard to see thanks to the Tasawent's customary blue robe and veil that covered all but his bespectacled eyes. Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza and accepted the tea.\n\n"My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." He bowed his head before drinking. Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realised there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed as he gave the cup back. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far too ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him as she raised the cup to him and drank. Wiwurgh bowed his head towards her."
 zarantia.8.a:0 ""I am your humble servant, Aguellid.""

 zarantia.9.t:0 "The Gathering Tribes"
 zarantia.9.d:0 "The lands around Agzhat are teeming with activity, as zebras from all over are arriving to join the great meeting of tribes. Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving tribes as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by her. Food, drink, even the singular gift of a cup of Igennet tea awaited them, with no expenses spared.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptuous feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well. Every household and every family of the Ataghan have opened their homes and tents, and from the highest to the lowest, all in Agzhat hosts their kin tonight."
 zarantia.9.a:0 "What a gathering!"

 zarantia.10.t:0 "Return Of The Ironbreaker"
 zarantia.10.d:0 "Zawgha remembered the day she left her home with a head full of thoughts, a rifle on her back and a motley group of friends and warriors she could trust, gazing upon the humble village she had called home before she headed towards unknown grounds. Years had passed, friends had been lost and gained, enough scars were cast on her body to make her look like a battleground map, her youthful rage had been tempered with cold, calculating insight.\n\nAlongside her as she looked backwards marched the Ironbreaker Warriors, her battle brothers and sisters from home and abroad. Many of those she left with would never return home, their belongings and sometimes ashes being carried in a simple wagon to the families that even after all these years, waited either for their return or for closure. Alongside these fallen brothers however, were countless faces new to these lands, people that she had extended a hoof in friendship to when the world had all but cast them down.\n\nThe Ironbreaker Warriors were not the same group that left this village that day. Ponies and even griffons walked in her ranks, bonds forged in the fires of war with each one carrying their particular wisdom and experience on each of their motions.\n\nAs she approached the city of Agzhat, the banners of the Aguellid flew high above it, and she could see the small group awaiting her. A small speck of red among those awaiting was unmistakable, even after all these years, and she smiled to herself. She was coming home, and she did so triumphantly."
 zarantia.10.a:0 "Welcome home, daughter of the desert."

 zarantia.11.t:0 "A Route Through The Great Desert"
 zarantia.11.d:0 "Much of the tribes' wealth was built not on warfare, but on trade. For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave this sweltering place. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide."
 zarantia.11.a:0 "Once more into the great emptiness."

 zarantia.12.t:0 "Returning From The Desert"
 zarantia.12.d:0 "Through the Zebhara, down past Quaggatai and into Camelkand and beyond the caravan has made its way. At several points, its appearance caused worry, even fear, as there were those who thought the approaching caravan was an invasion. Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested. And as long as there is a need for trade, the caravans will be travelling."
 zarantia.12.a:0 "We know these lands, and reap the benefits."

 zarantia.13.t:0 "The Desert Flowering"
 zarantia.13.d:0 "The peoples of the coast believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flow through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains. We love the sacred Igennet flowers that the mighty Ijirmed leaves in its wake, and we tend every little patch we find like it was our children.\n\nOther peoples have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can."
 zarantia.13.a:0 "We have not forgotten you, pony friends."

 zarantia.14.t:0 "Simple Glassworks"
 zarantia.14.d:0 "If one would look at Zarantia, one would almost think they hadn't suffered from the ravages of the Storm King. After all, with its boundless deserts and nomadic culture, what could they have suffered under that Tyrant's suffocating grip?\n\nIt was a disgustingly ignorant thought. Mekiouzza has seen first hoof the broken families, the destroyed towns and abandoned tents, the scorched lands of her people, and their despair gripped her heart. The horrors had he inflicted on her people were an unforgivable crime, and if she were any lesser, she would have fallen in a deep despair, or a maddened sense of revenge.\n\nNot to say she didn't desire revenge, but this revenge wouldn't come from blood and fire, but by picking up the pieces left from her home, and reforge into something greater, a whole larger than the Storm King ever saw before he blighted them with his presence.\n\n"As you can see, the rebuilding of Shizra is going apace." An assistant shows her ledger after ledger, as well as reports. "...at the pace of everything, reconstruction should be done within the month."\n\n"Not only reconstruction. Improvement." She said, to the light confusion of the assistant. "Shizra didn't have schools to teach its youth. Its reservoirs were pitiful and did not serve them as well as they could have." She continued, pushing herself to stand from her chair, gazing upon the window with a thoughtful, stern expression. "They did not have modern plowshares to work the soil. I trust those means were all given to them now?"\n\n"They have, and we are seeing about supplying the outlying villages."\n\n"Good. Thank you, you can leave now." And as the assistant bowed and departed, Mekiouzza allowed herself a honest smile, her true revenge against the Storm King realised, day by day."
 zarantia.14.a:0 "From the pieces of glass, a mosaic grander than what we were before."

 zarantia.15.t:0 "A New Millennium's Confederation"
 zarantia.15.d:0 ""Do you remember your oaths?"\n\nThe representatives of the tribes looked at Mekiouzza, puzzled for a moment. Of course they remembered the oath.\n\n"Of course we do, our Queen. Do you doubt our commitment to them?" Grumbling starts to come from the elder and the tribe representatives, one that the Queen simply lets it happen. None would dare accuse her after all, and yet, as they argued, it was clear amongst them the different interpretations of the oath; veterans and newly-picked representatives of the tribes argued amongst themselves on what they meant, and soon a dawning realization came to them, prompted by a single question.\n\nMekiouzza raised a single hoof, silencing the commotion, before she spoke again.\n\n"I do not doubt the commitment of the tribes to the promise, but how long has it been since those oaths were carved in words and paper? How many were here, so long ago, when they were made? I do not ask for a test of faith, but a renewal of those promises. An oath made, for a new age."\n\nShe gesticulates a hoof over all the leaders, a careful laid smile on her expression.\n\n"Look at our land, our people. How they've suffered, yet how they've grown. Even with the loss of Tobuck, the people of Zarantia rebuilt themselves, into something new. And a new Zarantia requires a renewed Confederation, a renewed vow. One that serves this new Zarantia we live upon."\n\nThe meeting would go without a hitch, the oaths and vows renewed, and if one or other trade deals happened between the like minded tribe leaders, well... That was just a plus after all, wasn't it?"
 zarantia.15.a:0 "Times change, bonds of kinship don't."

 zarantia.16.t:0 "The Water That Never Ends"
 zarantia.16.d:0 "How long had it been since she had seen the Sea? When one was surrounded by the harsh sands of the Desert, the sight of water was an invigorating experience, one that many a wayward traveller rushed towards when lost among the dunes. The rivers of Zarantia were always a beautiful sight, but as Umalez walked along the pier of Tobuck and gazed upon that boundless, verdant sea, it was hard to not feel emotional. Her heart fluttered with pride as once again her people had reclaimed her birth home to the world.\n\nAnd the world laid out there, ready to know her name. Ripe for Zarantia to one day stand as high as their peers of Colthage and Maregypt. And, if she allowed herself a moment of arrogance, to know the name of Queen Umalez.\n\nTobuck was returned to Zarantia and even with all the problems and challenges to come, Umalez let herself dream of possibilities that were yet to come, which didn't help her see the lightpost in front of her, her daydreams interrupted by the reality that she was not intangible."
 zarantia.16.a:0 "Dream high but remember what's right in front of you, heir of Zarantia."

Mekiouzza's chambers smelled heavily of incense, and its owner was standing over table further in where a map lay. The room was silent for a while before Mekiouzza turned to Zawgha.\n\n"Decades of prosperity and progress, and yet the tribes turned away from me in a moment of defeat." Her eyes were hard and her mouth a thin line as she continued. "Again and again they reaped the fruits of my labours, yet were content to lay there with their bellies up to the sky when the time came to work for it. Their talk of honour and their commitments ring hollow, and always have... If it meant anything, they should have rallied to my banner and fought to retake Tobuck to the last drop of blood!"\n\n"What do you need me to do?" Zawgha asked, a sinking feeling in her stomach as she knew where this was going. Mekiouzza walked up to her and placed a hoof on her shoulder.\n\n"I will not allow them to continue tearing us apart. They've proven they won't honour their words if they can get away with it, and I won't let them do that. Not any more. But I need you now, more than ever. Your ironbreakers are above their petty bickering, and I can only rely on you right now. I've spared the rod for too long, and the children are spoiled. Will you be my iron rod? Can I rely on you to teach them that when I speak, they will obey or pay the price?" Zawgha's hoof landed on Mekiouzza's, and she bowed her head."

High hopes and dreams fade in the face of martial might, and the only path to prosperity is to force yourself to a seat at the table. Legitimacy was nothing: the world shrugged and watched as a pack of looting thugs infested the capital of Zarantia.

Bickering would break that unity apart, and destruction would follow. It was a simple and yet cruel equation, proven beyond any reasonable doubt by the events of the last years. What once had swept aside Warzena's armies and liberated Tobuck could now be driven off by thugs and bandits, all due to their lack of unity. They were weak, and all around them the strong were circling. Tobuck was lost, and would Agzhat follow in a few years time to Colthage? Or maybe the bandits would keep pushing their luck and come for it?\n\nMercy was a privilege only the mighty could afford, and Zarantia was anything but. Thus, in the pursuit of survival, there could be no mercy, no hesitation and no doubt. Survival was all that mattered, and as the cornered animal would fight to the last drop of blood, so must Zarantia."

You're making slaves out of our pe-"\nA mighty slap echoed in the room, Mekiouzza silencing her daughter with her hoof as her eyes blazed with rage.\n"You speak of me enslaving my people, child?! There's not a single person in this city, in this desert, that loves her people more than I do! You think I take pleasure in spilling their blood, and not those occupying Tobuck?! We are here because they did not listen, and I will be damned before I let it all fall apart!" An oppressive silence followed between them, Umalez slowly nursing her cheek as Mekiouzza breathed deeply. "I am not my people's friend, and neither will you be. They may hate us, but they will live, and they'll become better for it. Once I die and you take the throne, each day you'll be thanking me for taking the heavy decisions so that you didn't need to."

The tribes simply sold to her the idea they were necessary, and now look where they are: Broken easily, scattered into worthless pockets of resistance and her people, pony and zebra alike, looked at her with adoration. They were not a scattered, aimless group of tribes led by sycophantic elders, but a nation, a people that gaze upon her for guidance towards something greater than ever before.\n\n"Please, Goddess Shams, lay your blessing to our beloved Aguellid! Our beloved Queen of Zarantia!" The priest echoed as Mekiouzza took the bowl of Igennet tea and raised it to her lips. The sharp taste filled her mouth, and the fumes rose into her mind as she let the priest anoint her with the sacred oils. She heard the chants and the proclamation of her people, and even her daughter who so doubted her smiling and bowing her head in acknowledgement, the last inklings of doubt were cast like sand to the wind."

Your naked faces say your tribe is as mature as my newborn daughter!"\n\nUnifying the tribes wouldn't ever be easy. While many tribes had histories as sordid and bloody, some had... the pettiest reasons; petty enough that Umalez' face was a study in absolute restraint and facial control and the Aguellid looking as if she bit a particularly zesty lemon.\n\nYet, if Zarantia was to move forward, these tribes had to be united. For good or bad reasons, they have to make them look eye to eye. But before Mekiouzza could say anything, Umalez cleared her throat and raised her voice, unable to hide her smile.\n\n"While certainly I can... respect the values both tribes were made of, we're not asking you to work together directly! The Amcic tribe is known for their skill in metalworking, while the Aqyun have been known for their talent in scouring the desert for the gems, yes?" She had a calm smile on her face, and her eyes twinkled with amusement. "We could set up caravans, to bring the products between both your lands, without having any of you seeing eye to eye? Does that sound acceptable?"\n\n"...it is distasteful to have our kin's hard work be put at the hooves of those-"\n\n"If nothing else, as a show of your tribe's hospitality and grace," Umalez placed a hoof on the young chieftain's, giving him her sweetest smile. "My mother has long spoken well of the Amcic..." Mekiouzza smiled wryly in the background. Umalez' pleading look had long since stopped working on her, but on a stallion in his youth?"

But, as Umalez herself brought to her attention during one of her endless studying sessions, it offered something new: Unity and Presence.\n\nAgzhat was far from many territories, and the more venerable tribes would hesitate to send their elders here for brief affairs. Yet if they came here, and the sessions were plentiful enough, they would likely have to take residence within the city and need to communicate things back to their respective tribes.\n\nOn paper, it would seem she's giving up parts of her power, but the streamlining of the process of communicating with her people, and the convenience just meant that she simply could push more, quicker. With a giddiness she hadn't felt in ages she, her daughter, and a few trusted aides put pen to quill, and sign up the structure of the Tribal Council, as well as the invitations for every tribe her census could measure.\n\nThey would be more welcome to join, after all. And those that didn't, wouldn't complain if she just turned to them a blind eye. They would believe they were giving them more leeway when in truth, it all just meant giving her the power they stubbornly clung to."

 zarantia.24.t:0 "Only One Real Choice"
 zarantia.24.d:0 "One of the most stubborn tribes to bend to her hooves was the Talat. No amount of wrangling, negotiation nor threats would make them bow. Warriors to the very last one; birthed from exiles from other tribes to the harsh central deserts of Zarantia, the Talat had for centuries thrived on conflict, slavery, and conquest, and no symbol of that was mightier than their chief, Wasif.\n\nAnd as her representatives weren't even given the time of day, she simply laid to him a challenge. A duel, against her own finest general. If they won they could have what they desired from her. She'd turn a blind eye to them and never bother them again, but if Wasif fell they would submit, wholly and fully, to her cause.\n\nShe didn't spare a single zhekel to broadcast that. She made her engineers carve the arena from stone, imported radios and recording equipment, and sent and scattered them across Zarantia, together with her challenge!\n\nThe people of Zarantia would be witness to the question that they didn't dare voice in front of her: Is her people, her government, truly a better path than what they had stubbornly clung to, all this time?\n\nThe battle took the good part of an hour, witnesses clinging to their seats, and she was sure families and entire tribes sat around their radios, captivated by one of her aide's surprising ability at narrating the bout! Wasif fought like a Zebra possessed, but he only knew how to fight Zarantians. Zawgha was a warrior forged by coin, and battles abroad, and little by little, she wore him down until a brutal pommel strike to his cheek sent him crashing into the sand as the crowd roared and clopped.\n\nThe next day, with the city of Agzhat as witnessed on that same arena, they saw the most vicious warrior of the country bend his head and kissing her hooves, submitting himself and his tribe to her service, until the end of times."

And in a way, he still was, just not in the way his ancestors would have neither liked nor probably approved of.\n\nYet here he sat, a banker of the National Bank of Zarantia in Agzhat; which wouldn't be so "bad", if he wasn't also working closely with the Aguellid as she smothered the other tribes. Her plan was simple: outlast the tribes that refused a place in the council and to submit to their taxation or any measure of control over their affairs.\n\nThat was what he was here for, after all. His time as a caravan gave him the mindset of one, and he knew how to starve them: simply fund the tribes and caravans that were more willing to play nice with them. A merchant, after all, was loyal to coin more than their tribesmen if they desired to make a profit, and by stealing the best caravaneers it would not only be the most stubborn merchants that would bend over, but also their business.\n\nThey would either submit to the government, and receive aid and investment, or break, sell out, and he would be there to buy them and put it to better use. And as the clock rang lunchtime, he stopped writing the missive of acquisition from his own tribe's rivals cotton farms and left his office towards the quaint, novel restaurant across the street.

And at the centre of it all stood the Aguellid and her daughter, mediating and subtly inserting their desired topics to the discussions, which tended to be accepted nonetheless.\n\nWithout any fanfare, over days and weeks, the concept of Zarantia as a true, federalized nation, became more and more of a reality. It would have almost filled her with pride if it wasn't for the fact that the time-honoured tradition of throwing their horseshoes at each other when discussions became particularly heated had gone nowhere..."

She responded, fairly dryly, and casually leaning her head back as she dodged a half-hearted attempt from her mother to clobber her in the head.\n\n"Your sarcasm notwithstanding, what you're seeing right now is an uncut diamond. A potential to be something greater than even Tobuck, if one would only polish it, and make it shine brighter."\n\n"Greater than Tobuck? You surely don't mean that?"\n\n"I don't make claims I can't back up, Umalez. One of my biggest mistakes was thinking that Tobuck could have held our weight to the world by itself, that prosperity was to be found at those lush lands...no. The desert holds a treasure that the Imzeeb have neglected for far....far too long."\n\nShe tapped her cane on the ground and looked at her daughter once again...instead of the stern, harsh expression that she had seemed to permanently wear for the good part of a year, there was only a kind, soft expression as she spoke candidly, from mother to daughter.\n\n"I want you to look at this, and I'll promise you, the next time you cross this street...""

Their knowledge of metallurgy and its industrial tycoons could easily be the push her country needed.\n\nOn the other hoof, Maregypt's trading history is downright millenary, and its development in recent years has been by leaps, thanks to their investment towards the new technologies; a future that she desires to lead her nation herself.\n\nHowever, she can't play both sides, a mixed capital is mixed trouble.

Even if nobody would know who they were, the road would outlast them.

In a few moments, a radio would broadcast her speech across all radios in her country, and what better way to make the first, of hopefully many broadcasts, than severing one of her country's oldest crutches.\n\n"People of Zarantia. Tribes, Imazeebs, Ponies and all. When Tobuck was stolen from us, I've thought deeply of our future, our country's future! What kind of proud nation would have built a strong legacy to simply collapse by itself when we lost but a city! But a territory!"\n\n"I've decided that before my body returns to the desert and my soul wanders the endless winds, I would set upon the stone to which a nation, not a group of collected tribes, but one, an individual home we share under the sky, would stood and grow! Growing pains have certainly been felt, and many detractors endeavored to stay against these changes, but still we are undeterred. Still we are stronger!"\n\n"Yet, one topic, many wish I wouldn't topic. One that, no matter how neutral the tribe stood, still dabbled on it. To put the chains on the defeated, the prisoners, the spoils of conflict. You might be glaring, you might be shutting off these radios, but I speak of a plain truth... it has no future in the Zarantia of tomorrow. To hold one in chains is to consign them to a fate not of their control, neither to their freedom, and isn't freedom one of our main values?!"\n\nAnd, on the memory of every tribeszebra, on every slave owner who hurriedly shut down that blasted device, and carved in the heart of every soul clad in metaphorical and literal chains, were the next words..."

Murder to her wrists? Doubly so!\n\nHer maid, Adowa, raised alongside her took the quill, staring at it for a long moment, her expression conflicted.\n\n"...Are you expelling me, Ummy? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"W-what, no! You're a free mare! Your family has been our slaves since the times my mother had my age, don't you want to be free?"\n\n"...W-where would I even go?"\n\nShe stared at her lady, her friend, her wide, nervous eyes glancing at the zebra she grew alongside with. Of course, many of these slaves were from generations, where else would they go? She remembered something Mother did for those...what was it?\n\nAs if a lightbulb lit over her head, she quickly pulled a blank small quill, writing the terms of a quick contract, before hooving it to her, and motioning her to read. She seemed confused for a moment, her expression melting into peace as she read more and more.\n\n"I hereby declare Adowa Nefertiti to be the Princess Umalez of Zarantia's personal bedmaid, until she no longer deems herself worthy of service, upon the word of the Aguellid.""

Also...\n\n"Thank you all for your presence today. I'm overjoyed to see that you take your children's first day so seriously." The teacher of this new "school" said with a smile from where he stood at the other end of the classroom, and both chiefs turned to glare at this Agzhat interloper as their children had found their places in the rows of benches. "My name is Naravaz Tifirrelest. You can address me as Mister Tifirrelest, or for you children, you can simply say teacher. And today I especially wish to welcome Chief Munatas Aqyun and Chief Zararni Amcic: it is an honour to meet you both."\n\n"As chief of the Aqyun/Amcic, I-" the two chiefs both began before stopping and giving each other withering glares as the mood in the room dropped even further. Neither of them continued saying what they were going to say. Their followers all rose up a bit taller, glaring down their respective counterparts, and the children cowered a bit in their seats.

"Why did this start? Nonononono!" he said, raising his hoof as they seemed about to start yelling at the same time. "Zadla will go first, and then Takama will speak."\n\n"Takama pushed my cousin!" Zadla said, Takama bristling.\n\n"I pushed him because he wouldn't leave my sister alone!" she yelled out angrily.\n\n"You lie, just like Amcic always..." Zadla began and Mister Tifirrelest slammed his hoof into the table.\n\n"QUIET!" Mister Tifirrelest roared, cowing them both before leaning down to begin untangling this entire mess. So Zadla's cousin had been pushed, but that was only because he had harassed Takama's sister after she had tricked him out of his lunch and she had done that because another kid had stolen hers and gods help them all... "So what started all this?" he asked the two. "Go back to the very start of this whole thing. Where did this conflict begin between your two groups?" He looked from Zadla to Takama, neither of them answering. Narawaz sighed.\n\n"This started centuries ago. At some point, Amcic and Aqyun started fighting, and you've been fighting ever since. Nobody knows where it started, because it is a braid made from spite and anger that goes back since before anyone was born." He placed a hoof on each of their shoulders.

And yet still the air was almost quivering between them, and as Zadla reached out to grab her pen she accidentally bumped into Takama, who gave her a sour glare. Zadla glared back only for both of the girls to jump in their seats when Mister Tifirrelest slapped their bench with his cane.\n\n"Did you intentionally push her, Zadla?" he asked and Zadla looked down at her bench.\n\n"No, it was an accident," she muttered, and Mister Tifirrelest looked to Takama, who also looked down. Turning around, he returned to the blackboard. Zadla, meanwhile, glanced at Takama and stuck out her tongue before quickly turning back to look at the blackboard when Takama glared at her. After a few seconds she realised Takama was doing something and looked, only to see Takama turn back towards the teacher as well. Realizing what she was doing, Zadla extended her tongue once more and turned back before she was spotted, unable to stop a small smile from creeping onto her face as their silly game continued.\n\nMister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, heard the small giggles coming from behind him after a while and smiled to himself before schooling his face.

Her father and a large contingent of the Aqyun tribe had gathered outside the school building, once again staring down the Amcic across the schoolyard. It felt weird, like two different parts of her life that wasn't meant to come together, and she gave Takama an apologetic look. She'd never tell her father, but she didn't mind Takama. After today though... she had felt confident on the test, and she knew she had a chance to get the top score. But if she was the best in her class, her father would lord it over the Amcic, and by that Takama. As they stood there, waiting, Zadla realised she was begging that she didn't get the top score. She didn't really care about that, not if it cost her her... friend?\n\nAs Mister Tifirrelest came outside, over a hundred eyes turned to him as he cleared his throat to call for the students, who lined up to receive their tests from him. Zadla realised her heart was beating, and she could only bow mutely as she was given her results. Walking over to her parents, she looked down at the score... 98/100.\n\n"98! Well done, my daughter!" Her father said loudly, patting her shoulder. "I knew you could do it! You've made me and the tribe both proud today!" Zadla wanted to sink down into the ground as she saw her father preen in the direction of Takama's, who only blinked.\n\n"Wait a minute... my daughter also got 98! Has your brat been copying her?!" Takama's dad yelled. The two girls, meanwhile, looked at each other in surprise, and as their fathers began to yell at each other about who had copied from who, the girls snuck away to exchange tests.

These debts are called in, and it would behove you to not contest it." She didn't care much for the politics that happened between the tribes, her tribe had never done so. For her, trust transcended politics, and it was not between imazeeb necessarily, but between creatures period.\n\nConsidering her tribe's brutal history of enslavement, there was a deep irony in what happened now though. As she stepped upon the fields of the tribe and saw the malnourished, weak "spoils of war", she simply unsheathed her sword and trotted to each one with an unreadable expression.\n\nThey flinched before her, and she scowled. Was there still a spark in them, or had they been truly broken? She raised her saber high and struck each and every one of their chains, their faces brightening as they were freed.\n\n"You are a free zebra of your own accord. My kin will take you to the nearest town, and aid you in finding a true path to yourself."\n\nOf course, she knows it's not all in the goodness of her Aguellid's heart. The furnaces and factories needed hooves to train, and the things made in these factories needed people to buy it.

I give you minutes to drop your bags there and come back. I don't have any time to waste, so from now on you follow my instructions. And don't you try touch my tools without permission!" Zadla let out a gulp before quickly nodding along." #AAAAAAH

 zarantia.39.d:0 "The first two months were hard work. As an assistant, Zadla had quite the number of tasks to take care of, like preparing the furnace's lumps of coal for work, sweeping the floor, and cleaning up the working surfaces once the day ended. Still, there was at least a silver lining. She liked to observe Master Zudad while he was at work. Furthermore, the older zebra loved to talk as he busied himself near the furnace; mostly to complain about Maregyptians keeping all the good metal for themselves, or to go into deep detail on various metallurgic techniques Zadla had never heard of.\n\nNot today. Zudad had remained silent, his eyes focused on the ingot of steel before him. Sparks flew with each strike of the hammer, stopping only momentarily as to gauge at his work, only to then begin again, in silence. He finally stopped after several hours, as the sun had already slipped beneath the horizon, and only after Zadla had pointed out the fact to him.\n\n"Do you know what this is, kid?" Zudad said as he removed his working goggles. Zadla shot a puzzled glance at the object laying of the working surface. "Well, that's a piece of metal, right?"\n\n"A piece of metal?!" Zudad scowled. "Kid, if I didn't think you had some potential, I would have caned you already. A good blacksmith never sees the raw material, but always has the finished work before his eyes." Zadla gave a sceptical glance at the bar of steel in question but nodded anyway. "Oh. I see."\n\n"No, you don't. And I guess that's the real problem here. It's a waste of breath describing it with words alone." Zudad shook his head. "No matter. You'll see it tomorrow with your own eyes. Clean up now while I prepare dinner."\n\nZadla nodded and set out to work, before stopping midway as something finally clicked in her mind. "Wait. Master Zudad, did you say that I have potential?" The zebra didn't answer. He had already disappeared back inside; quicker than usual, she would later note." #AAAAAAH

 zarantia.40.d:0 ""Master Zudad, are you ... are you absolutely sure about this?" The older zebra did not answer at first, busy as he was stuffing his saddlebags with personal belongings.\n\n"Not really, but there isn't much I can do about it," he muttered with a grin. "One can't just say no to his own chief, after all. And besides, it might be a good thing that I'm accompanying him. Munatas has this fascination with any kind of foreign machinery. Somepony has to make sure he doesn't empty the tribe's coffins for some pointless piece of junk." Then, he suddenly looked up. "What's the matter, kid? It's not like this is the first time. You've watched over my workshop before, right?"\n\nZadla hesitated, then shook her head. "For two weeks at most, not months. Master Zudad, I don't think I'm ready for this. What if I mess something up while you're..."\n\n"Oh, give me a break, kid!" Zudad suddenly snapped. "Don't come here telling me you're afraid of working alone. You think I haven't noticed your side-projects? I'm old, not blind."\n\nZadla blinked, caught by surprise. She quickly recovered though, shaking her head. "Those were just some experiments I've done." "Exactly!" Zudad exclaimed. "It doesn't take skill nor ability to follow somepony else instructions. Only when you take everything you've learned and put it aside, when you strike out on your own path, that's when you can start properly calling yourself a blacksmith."\n\nZadla tilted her head to the side at the older zebra. "I'll be honest with you, Master Zudad," she said slowly, a wide grin taking shape on her lips, "After all this time, I still can't understand when you're making a compliment."\n\nThe zebra shot her a perplexed look, before mirroring her with a grin of his own. "I guess that's true. Now, stop idling and help me find my toothbrush for the trip. I swear that damn thing was here just one moment ago."" #AAAAAAH

 zarantia.41.d:0 "The winding road to the village was familiar to her, having trod on it countless times since fillyhood. She now walked down the dirt road, saddlebags slung across her back, the leather straps biting in her shoulders. As she entered it, Zadla noticed how little her village had changed in the time she'd been away. Still, that was unimportant, for there was only one thing in her mind right now, that being ...\n\n"Mum?" Zadla called out as she came to a stop in front of her family's house and knocked on the door. "It's me, mum. Are you t-" The door burst open and, before Zadla realised what was happening, she found herself in the middle of a bone-crushing hug, gasping for air.\n\n"My little star is back!" she heard her mother Zlatig say. "Why didn't you write me you were coming back? Oh, you have grown up so much since I last saw you. Uhm, you look a bit thin though. Did those Amcic-"\n\n"Mum! A-Air!" Zadla managed. Her mother's fighting days as a warrior were over, but her strength was still there. Thankfully, she quickly relaxed her grip allowing her to breath. Still, despite everything, Zadla grinned. "I am happy to see you too, mum. Is dad here?"\n\n"You missed him by a few minutes, but don't worry. He'll be back soon. Now, why don't you-" She stopped, her eyes falling on something else. "What is that?"\n\nZadla realised what had slipped out of her saddlebags, and she chuckled as she picked the scabbard back up. "Well, it was meant to be a surprise. It's a gift to you, mother." Zadla removed the finely-crafted blade from its scabbard, her heart nearly burst with pride in seeing her mother's eyes go wide. The single-edged, straight-backed sword glinted softly under the sunlight, the engravings near the hilt standing out.\n\nSlowly, Zlatig took it from her hooves, eyes shining bright as she examined the weapon. "It's beautiful, dear. Where... Where did you find it?" Zadla simply smiled." #AAAAAAH

 zarantia.44.d:0 "When the Chiropterrans came roaring out of the west, determined to conquer, they had broken a compact they might well not even have realised existed. Centuries of secretive isolationism broken by only the occasional raid had meant the Imazeeb and the Tobuckians both had largely dismissed them as madcreatures and slavers in the west, and whom they were content to leave alone as long as the favour was repaid. The raids were a hazard like floods or storms, and you repaid it with counter-raids or just taking potshots at the retreating raiders as they left. With the attempted conquest however, the 'understanding' was off, and the favour was repaid in kind.\n\nYet Chiropterra, for all its wealth and resources, was a land of fanatics that would die before they surrendered, and the Imazeeb were not going to enter into the death spiral that long-term occupation would entail. They had their homeland, and they now had their victory, so instead they fell back on their old ways; pillaging.\n\nBy orders of the Aguellid, every burned farmstead and every devastated town would be paid for not in blood or conquest, but in goods. Grain stockpiles, industrial machinery, wealth whether national or personal, all would be seized and shipped back to the east, and whatever couldn't be brought along would be destroyed. Chiropterra was an immortal beast who had survived a thousand years, but though it couldn't be killed, it could be maimed."

 zarantia.442.d:0 ""General, the resistance is heavy throughout the city still, they seem ready to fight to the bitter end," the warrior bowed to Zawgha, who stood on a hill overlooking new Ayacachtli as messengers came running to keep her updated. She'd only ever heard whispers of this city and it was truly an impressive one, even with the smoke that rose to the sky. "The worst fighting is at the temple. The remnants of their Moon Legion have dug in there to defend it."\n\n"We don't need their artefacts." Zawgha could respect their grim determination. They knew that meant no mercy would be given, and they accepted it. Their dark goddess would probably spirit them to her side in the afterlife. "Bring up artillery and level the building. Shoot down those who try to run. Move to seize the factories. Make sure to bring engineers along to evaluate what we can seize and destroy or boobytrap what you can't. Is the railroad under control?"\n\n"They fortified that position, but one of our sharpshooters managed to kill the commander. They're still determined to fight on though."\n\n"The longer we have to dance with them the more of them we'll kill. Start fires in the eastern sections of the city. Try contacting them and say that either they give us the station or we'll continue to empty the city of life. Also, sabotage the water reservoirs." The Amsarmud had been feared across Zarantia before Mekiouzza ensnared them in her web. Though Zawgha believed in the Aguellid's dream and would fight for it, she knew they had in effect been tamed.

Two swords were held with the blades resting against his throat, and the warriors around him all held their weapons close.\n\n"Should she be so merciful, I... swear to ensure that the region is peacefully made part of the greater Zarantian state. All I ask is that we are given what the Tobuckians have been given, a say in our own affairs and the right to maintain our customs and faith. If she grants me this boon, I will work tirelessly to ensure that they become her loyal subjects."\n\n"I accept your offer, Lord Commander Lucent Eclipse," [ZAR.GetLeader] told him from her position towering above him. He was such a pitiable figure, and had just thrown away his people's ways to save them. For it, he would be branded the worst traitor, and yet she couldn't help but respect it. "Look at me." She ordered him and he obliged. His eyes were like a mirror back into her darkest moments after Tobuck's fall. Smiling, she leaned down and took his cheek in her hoof.\n\n"I see the sacrifice you make for your people, and I am not blind to it. When your work is finished, you will be spirited away from here, you will settle with a trusted tribe, and you will bear the name Afsax. As you gave your people life and security with this, so shall I give you the same. Now rise and tell me what you'll do to ensure your goals.""

The spoils of last month are being transported back to Tobuck, where they'll be divided up and put to good use. All industrial machinery falls to the Aguellid, all gold and jewellery falls to the warriors who seized it. The foodstuff is distributed evenly among the people, and all other goods are traded on to wherever it can earn the highest price.\n\nNot since the ancient times have the Imazeeb seen such a wealth in plunder, and the streets are filled with music and celebration at the end of the war. The southeast of Chiropterra has been seized under the Aguellid's banner, and though the locals were more than willing to fight back at first, the aid of the renegade Lord Commander has kept things under control.\n\nBy the ancient customs of war, the matter is now settled. They came for us, we crushed them, and we took our just compensation for the suffering they inflicted. If the Chiropterrans would come again, that is on them, but they cannot say they don't know the price."

Instead, we fall back and let them have their lands, keeping only a region of their homeland to use as a shield if they should get ideas in the future.

In her darkest moments, she had feared she might well never see its streets again.\n\nYet, her fears had not come true. As she rode in one of the cars Pea Shooter was so fond of, waving and being greeted and celebrated by the city's people as the flag of her grandest work and design flew proudly from the rooftops of Tobuck, she knew that this moment was the grand pay-off for all her struggles.\n\nIt had been tough, and the road had been long. Pockets of resistance and reports of ambushes were still coming in, she still had a nation to restore fully, and the threat of their neighbors were an ever subtle, insidious whisper in her ears. The path was still long, arduous, and she wondered if she would ever see the end of it.\n\nBut, if those quick bright flashes were any indication, Zarantia was reclaiming its name, and the world was taking notice.

Despite the accusations, he looked the one more prone to pack up their bags and try to seek asylum in Maregypt than the two of them, what if with their bloodshot, frantic eyes, constantly drawing and redrawing maps on a city on the cusp of being sieged.\n\n"Even if I was, you wouldn't be able to stop me, Allium.

He had allowed them to surrender and to a faint shame on his part they'd surrendered to the besieging forces almost immediately. He wondered if any of them bothered to understand why he held so tightly to Tobuck, to the ideal of this fake, artificial state. The population despised them, their armies were only as loyal as the coin was plentiful, and in truth, no single politician of the republic thought of their nation as anything more than a pump and dump investment.\n\nTruth was, he didn't know either. Perhaps he was a fool, perhaps he was a griffon tired of running from his past, and desired a fresh start somewhere far away from anygriff who knew his true name.\n\nHe picked a bottle of whiskey and downed a good gulp of it before putting it down next to the gun.

 zarantia.120.d:0 "The procession through Tobuck had been truly grandiose, and the priests of the Mortuary Cult had presided over an equally grandiose ceremony. It all had been a fitting sendoff to the greatest Aguellid Zarantia had known since time immemorial, and it had only left Umalez deeper in grief. Having retreated to her chambers afterwards, she had spent the entire evening not crying, but rather just reeling. How did one process something like this? Her mother, her unconquerable, ferocious mother who had held back death itself, was gone. This mountain of a mare, to whom the world itself bent, had vanished from it, and what was even left in its wake?\n\nShe had always felt the gap between her and her mother keenly. Mekiouzza was born in the desert, and went to war young, and Umalez had been born in the Tobuck that Mekiouzza liberated and spent her childhood studying history and the arts. This gap had never been as obvious as it was now, as was the answer to who would step in to fill it. But how could she ever be her mother's equal? She couldn't, that was the simple fact of the matter, yet her mother's words came back to her.\n\n'You will be what Zarantia needs'.\n\nIf she believed in nothing else, she would believe in her mother. Though they had bickered, she had never doubted that her mother knew what she was doing. And her mother, the harshest critic there could be, had believed in her.\n\nAt that point, the floodgates burst, and the tears came uncontrollably."

Back then, the tribes gathered out of necessity more than anything else, and yet these days, they were together near constantly and if not the chieftains, then at least a trusted representative. It was another testament to what her mother had achieved, whatever one thought of the methods.\n\n"As representative of Tobuck, I approve," Menes' words followed, and Umalez silently wondered how many would object. There would be some, but her mother's old servants had all stood by her. Some would speak out in protest, there was one way forward as a chieftain in Zarantia these days, and that was to play the game that Mekiouzza had established.\n\n"As representative of the Tasawent, I approve." She let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding. For all her respect towards Wiwurgh, she knew he was a zebra of ironclad principles. His vote was sincere, and it meant that what little risk there had been was gone. In the end, when the votes were tallied, she could rise up and accept the position of Aguellid-Queen, chosen by the tribes and cities, and invested with absolute authority over Zarantia."

The fact was that it had scared her, and the noise it gave off as it approached had scared her enough that she had hidden behind her mother. Yet after she got over her fears, the sight of these iron beasts had spurred her imagination. She had filled her notebooks with drawings of them, even imagined trains that could go over the sands without the need for rails. Some things you had to leave aside when you grew up, but not her adoration of trains, and she smiled widely as she walked through the half-finished rail station.\n\n"In here will be the waiting hall." The architect said as he showed her around the area. "It'll be one big open area, and whenever the weather allows, the doors in each end will be open and allow for a nice cross-breeze. As you asked for, there will also be drinking fountains in every corner, as well as out on each platform." It was like her dreams coming true, and Umalez felt giddy at the sight of the building. Sure it wasn't a great palace, but a building like this, that creatures would flood in and out of daily, was just the kind of thing she liked; beautiful and practical things for the regular creature. And what more, it would be where trains arrived. Stepping out on the platform, she looked out across the railways and imagined the trains that would run past here soon. For all the benefits this brought to her homeland, she couldn't help but enjoy it on a much more selfish level."

It is a highly unorthodox kind of government, but most things about this most recent of monarchies are.\n\nRaised to the throne by the efforts of her mother and predecessor, Mekiouzza Ataghan, Aguellid-Queen Umalez rules over two halves of a whole; the Imazeeb tribes of inland Zarantia, and the Maregyptian-descended ponies of Tobuck that came together in 961 after the Tobuckians rebelled against Warzena. Umalez, like her predecessor, has contended with two entirely different forms of politics. While the Tobuckian political game might seem quite familiar to the average Equestrian, the Imazeeb have for centuries worked not through laws and contracts, but verbal agreements enforced by honour and tradition and where vengeance was justice.\n\nTo the average outside observer, it may seem like the tribeszebras are a loud and disruptive presence in the Aguellid-Queen's court, but to the more keen-eyed observer there's a careful balance being struck in every debate. The Aguellid's word is final, but to the tribes, the art of objecting is as central as anything else. It is how they escape the need for more violent forms of protesting. They will rail and yell in protest to the Aguellid-Queen's decrees so that they can prove to their tribespeople - effectively their constituents - that they still have a voice, and the Aguellid-Queen respects their rights to debate, protest and even at times, insolence. To the average Equestrian, the attitude that Aguellid-Queen Umalez is met with might seem beyond disrespectful. To the Zarantians, it is proof of the mutual respect that permeates her court."

 zarantia.124.d:0 "Umalez held out the bowl of Igennet tea to the distant guest in front of her, smiling as he took it and drank carefully before handing it back to her. She could tell the zebras around her were surprised by her actions. Though he was a chieftain of high honour and status, he was still a Buckharan, and the Imazeeb's relation to their very distant cousins in the east had always been a wary one.\n\n"Your hospitality is peerless, noble Aguellid, and I'm honoured to sit in your house - a house equal in honour and dignity to your nation." He gave the bowl back to her with his head bowed. The Buckharans had not weathered the last years much better than the Imazeeb had, but unlike the Imazeeb, the Buckharans had not managed to reassert themselves and instead were trapped under the iron hoof of foreign overlords. Mekiouzza had made overtures to them many years ago, but they had politely rebuffed her back then. Of course, desperate times had a way of making old familial ties bubble to the surface.\n\n"It is a long overdue meeting, cousin, but I am happy to welcome you." Umalez smiled as she accepted the bowl from him and drank as well. It was a careful dance, one that likely would take days if customs would be observed. It would be, that was why the Buckharans were here. The fetters placed on them by their overlords chafed, and they had decided to take their chances with the Zarantians in the hopes that the Amsisi would give them their honour and independence back.\n\n"As am I, and if the gods will it, I hope we may see many future meetings like these. Of course, I would not expect a gift like this every time." He smiled slightly at her and Umalez returned it. As for her... the Buckharans were their distant relations, and controlling it would further strengthen their hold on the trans-zebrican trade. It would shield their eastern flank, and diminish the power of her eastern neighbor. As her mother had taught her, sometimes the good and the profitable aligned quite well."   #Buckhara wants to be saved from Quaggatai.

They've sent us an official message asking us to cede the Buckharan regions, citing something about self-determination and ancient kinship. It's a stunningly polite letter, but it's also making it very clear that they are more than prepared to seize it by force if we don't give them what they want."

 zarantia.126.d:0 "The Quaggatai hooves had been wrestled away from Buckhara, and the lands were finally free, all thanks to the Zarantian force of arms that made it all possible. Yet, for Umalez was the question of what would happen now. She had one chance to finish it, and let Buckhara be her answer to her mother's Tobuck, another jewel in the Zarantian crown. Yet, it would not be an uncomplicated matter. The Buckharans were thirsty for independence, and though she could exert some influence, the question was whether it was the right thing to do, whether she would change Zarantia irrevocably and take the final step away from the idea of the Imazeeb state. She had the luxury of choice, but that did not make it an easy one."
 zarantia.126.a:0 "They are not Imazeeb, and we shouldn't treat them as such."

 zarantia.127.d:0 "The response to her demands was all too predictable, and Umalez looked down at the document in silence. They refused to even entertain the notion of letting Buckhara go, and mocked her for giving them ample warning of her impending invasion. After all, they wrote, surprise was her only real advantage. A low sigh rose from her. Was she going to do this? Send thousands to their death?\n\nYes, she was. For the oaths given to those she had referred to as cousins, for the honour of her people, to not lose face in front of the entire world, and to strengthen Zarantia. A hundred reasons were all lined up, and she realised now more than ever the kind of forces that had driven her mother. So be it then."

 zarantia.128.d:0 "It was a cruel thing to be born of the great. When your lineage held the great, the demands placed on you became equally great. You could labour your entire life, and never measure up to these titans no matter what you accomplished. Yet, as Umalez had slowly come to realise, the person you compared yourself to was always above you in your own head, no matter what you did.\n\nStanding on the balcony overlooking Tobuck, she thought about her mother, and whether she ever had doubted herself. Logically she must have, but thinking back on the implacable Mekiouzza, it was hard to imagine it. Her mother could have been ruthless, even cruel, and she never seemed to hesitate when she finally acted. Meanwhile, Umalez never truly stopped doubting herself. Had she stood here a few years ago, she would have concluded that she was unworthy of carrying on her mother's legacy.\n\nYet, time brought clarity, and the actions she had taken herself had brought her understanding. Her mother had doubted herself, for she would have been foalish not to. With so much on the line, she would always have wondered if she had done the right thing, she just hadn't shown it as she was surrounded by those who would pounce on that weakness. Her mother was just as much a regular zebra as anyzebra else, but she had just risen to the task she had assumed, like Umalez now had.\n\nZarantia was prosperous and strong, and they were finishing their transformation into a truly modern nation without having truly lost who they were. Mekiouzza had started it, but Umalez had completed it. That was the key to not drown in your own self-doubt: not to try to accomplish what those who towered above you had done, it was to seek what they sought. With this realisation, she had found peace."

 zarantia.150.t:0 "The Hard Lessons Of Leadership"
 zarantia.150.d:0 "The willful Imazeeb tribes had demanded the respect and independence they believed themselves due, and they had been ravaged until their spirit was broken. The criminals that had infested Tobuck had believed themselves secure from the wrath of its rightful owner, and they had been hunted down and killed to the last. Time and time again, as the world had crashed down on Zarantia, there had been one answer: force.\n\nIn the end, the world was a place where peoples and rulers scratched and clawed at each other, all to seize a place for themselves, and the instance you stopped fighting, you condemned yourself to death. Mercy and kindness were luxuries to be doled out in service of an end goal, and that goal was fear. Fear that you'd lose favour with your ruler, fear that the outsiders would come and take away what you had, fear that the world would hurt you if you did not hurt it first.\n\nStanding in front of Mekiouzza's mausoleum, Umalez wept. She wept for the passing of her beloved mother and for the cruelties that had come to pass under her watch. What more, she cried because she knew what would come next. No other chieftain remained to challenge the Ataghan tribe's dominance - her dominance - and the title of Aguellid-Queen was now hers by right... as would be the cruelty that holding this position would demand.\n\nThe lesson was taught, and Umalez had always been a good student. Liking or disliking the truth would not change. It was blood and death that had raised her to this position, and if she did not maintain the course, she would throw away all her mother had achieved. She wasn't that selfish, and she bowed her head to touch it against the cold stone door."
 zarantia.150.a:0 "Thank you mother... I understand what you meant now."

 zarantia.1501.t:0 "Seizing What Is Hers By Right"
 zarantia.1501.d:0 "The gathered chieftains all fell into silence as Umalez came into the chambers, followed by Zawgha and several of her warriors. Without a word, she walked up towards the seat where her mother had sat. The seat was not really a throne, but it carried all the significance of one, and she turned around to look at each one of them.\n\n"My mother gathered you all because you valued loyalty beyond pride, and service to the nation above service to your own goals. Yet she is no longer with us. As her daughter, I claim the position of Aguellid and Queen as my inherited right. Whom among you wish to question me?"\n\nNot a word was said among the gathered chieftains, and Umalez nodded. Good, she didn't want people to die today. With that, she sat down on the seat of the Aguellid, and Zawgha called out loudly.\n\n"Hail to the Queen, rightful mistress of Zarantia!" she roared, her warriors and - eventually - the chieftains following suit. Umalez sat quietly and watched the chieftains with a smile on her face, yet at the same time she knew all too well that they were submitting as it was the easier thing to do. When they came home they would whisper other things between them, and scheme against her. Today she was victorious, but tomorrow would demand yet more of her. So be it then, that was what her mother had groomed her for."
 zarantia.1501.a:0 "My authority is absolute."

 zarantia.151.d:0 ""...as a soldier of Zarantia, I pledge my service and my life to the Aguellid cause. Her enemies are my enemies, and her wish is my command. Through me, she will protect the indivisible unity of Zarantia, and guard it from whoever would divide or diminish it. So I swear, and may my ancestors turn from me should I violate it." The hundreds of gathered warriors finished their oath, and Umalez rose up from the throne she had been sitting on. Stepping forth to stand side by side with Zawgha, who had administered the oath, she addressed them for the first time.\n\n"Soldiers, you now stand as the true defenders of the throne and the nation. You have risen above the petty bickering of old, and you serve a higher purpose: to shield this nation from enemies both internal and external. By your labours, Zarantia will prevail, now and forever!"\n\n"Now and forever!" Their cry was almost deafening, and Umalez smiled as they saluted her. The tribes would never again have any say in how the wars of Zarantia were conducted, nor would they ever have the equipment and resources needed to challenge her position. Military might was now tied to her utterly, and with it would come stability."
 zarantia.151.a:0 "Peace through superior firepower."

 zarantia.152.t:0 "A Tightening Noose"
 zarantia.152.d:0 ""We've known each other for a long time, and I hold you in high regard. With a hundred chieftains like you, Zarantia would have been a force unlike any other. You've insisted on making it difficult for you though." Zawgha took a sip of the tea she had been offered and leaned forward a little. "I know the game you're playing right now, but it won't work. Step down and bow your head because if you don't, the price is way higher than you can pay."\n\n"I didn't think the Ironbreaker would be the one who broke so easily," the chieftain across the table from her said with a raised eyebrow. "The Ataghan girl is not her mother, and she must be reminded of this."\n\n"She knows that she's not," Zawgha locked eyes with the old stallion. "When her mother made an example of the Talat some of us learned to not cross her, but Umalez learned that only violence can keep her where she is. She's learned that lesson with all her heart, and believes in it with fanatical fervor. There is no line she won't cross, no cruelty she will not stoop to. I know you are looking for concessions to remain loyal, but she will kill you, she'll kill your family, she'll hunt down those who would seek vengeance for them, and end your entire tribe down to the foal born yesterday. Not because she is arrogant enough to think herself untouchable, but because to her, her mother's actions proved that is the only way to ensure order. This is not politics to her, it's faith, and she will gladly sacrifice anything on that altar."\n\n"If she is mad dog, then she..." the old chieftain began and Zawgha sighed, slamming her cup down to cut him off.\n\n"I have given my warning. It is more than she will do. Do with it what you wish, but once you make her your enemy, you will never be anything else to her. That is the age in which we live now, and for your children's sake, learn the new rules." With that, she got up and left the room. Gods may that old fool learn, for she would not relish being his executioner."

 zarantia.153.t:0 "The Aguellid And Nozebra Else"
 zarantia.153.d:0 "The change was a largely bureaucratic one, but for those who knew, it was a shockwave through the Zarantian state. A series of official edits to the Zarantian laws removed the majority of all references to the tribes that since the dawn of time had been the core of Imazeeb society. By word of the Aguellid-Queen, the tribes were no longer recognised legal entities in any form. Their privileges were revoked, their standing nullified and their customs no longer any more than quaint familial traditions.\n\nYet, the laws and its interpreters were controlled by the Aguellid-Queen, and silence reigned on the matter. The tribes that were in a position to challenge her or cause issues were long since cowed or bought off, leaving only the long since marginalised to cry out - fruitlessly - in protest. With the Aguellid-Queen's hooves around their throat, the tribes of Zarantia were at last starting to be consigned to history."

 zarantia.154.t:0 "The Empress Of The Desert"
 zarantia.154.d:0 "Umalez Ataghan, the Aguellid-Queen and unquestioned ruler of Zarantia, lay quietly in her bed and stared up at the ceiling. These few minutes before they knocked at the door and the servants came in to serve her breakfast and help her get ready for the day was the only time when she felt relaxed. Out there were a horde of predators, each hungry for power and success, and they tirelessly circled around her in the hopes of currying favour. They would look for any signs of weakness, and they would pounce on it instantly. Thus, from the moment that door opened, she would be nothing but an indomitable autocrat who controlled Zarantia and every living creature within it. Yet for now, she would enjoy the little freedom she could still enjoy.\n\nShe did not bemoan her fate, it was all for Zarantia. Her mother had founded it, she had completed it, and one day her daughter would be the one to carry it on. Fate, the gods, the natural progression of society, whatever the forces that had brought them here had demanded that the Imazeeb be cowed if they were to become one nation. Like so many rulers throughout history, she had led her people down the path to civilisation by forcing them down it. That was the role she had been given, and she would not shirk from it, even if it exhausted her.\n\nA knock on the door left her sitting up almost instinctively, and she turned impassively to watch the servant that entered, holding a tray with her breakfast. Stepping out of the bed to be dressed, she realised that she longed for the next morning and the few minutes of freedom she would have then."

 zarantia.155.t:0 "A Message From Zarantia"
 zarantia.155.d:0 "The rise of the Imazeeb state Zarantia to our southwest has for the longest time been of little interest to most of Colthage. With few natural resources, a government friendly to Colthage and no conflicting ambitions, they have been mainly a source of mercenaries and trade. The rise of their new leader, however, has changed this equation. The Zarantians have grown militant, and their leader Umalez Ataghan has sent a message to [ROOT.GetLeader] in which she offers an alliance between "The powers of the Desert and the Sea". The entire message has left our government highly amused, though more than one have pointed out that the Imazeeb do make for good warriors, and it's not like we haven't made use of their services before."

 zarantia.156.t:0 "A Warning From Zarantia"
 zarantia.156.d:0 "After the death of its previous ruler, our southwestern neighbour Zarantia has come under the sway of a new leader. Her very start as a ruler was marked by her brutally forcing the Imazeeb tribes into submission, and she's now turned her eyes onto us.\n\nThe reasons given are as many as they are transparent, but she's demanded we pay tribute to Zarantia.

 zarantia.1561.a:0 "They should have taken our offer."

 zarantia.1562.t:0 "Tribute Given"
 zarantia.1562.d:0 "The Colthaginians were smart enough to see what they needed to do, and have bowed their heads. In addition to a large shipment of gold, they have also sent modern industrial machinery and technical information enough to ensure that we will not only be wealthy, but that our industry will continue to grow. What more, Colthage has proven that they understand the new order in the region, and this means we don't need to teach them."
 zarantia.1562.a:0 "We know where we have each other, and can coexist peacefully."

 zarantia.1581.a:0 "...then we'll take Colthage, and their soldiers' lives."

 zarantia.1582.t:0 "Colthage Has Been Surrendered"
 zarantia.1582.d:0 "Today is a great victory for diplomacy, as Colthage has been surrendered by its overlords to us. It seems they understood that this was not their land to hold sway over, and now Colthage will be like Tobuck, subjugated under the Zarantian crown."

A procession walked slowly down the pathway open in the crowd, six zebras carrying the mummified body of Mekiouzza Ataghan towards the crypt, and in their wake, Zarantia wept.\n\nThe chieftains of Aqyun and Amcic, sworn enemies once, stood side by side with their heads bowed deeply to the mare who had buried their ancient enmity and dared them to dig it up. Wasif Talat, he who had so reluctantly come to serve her, showed his grief without any reservation for the only zebra who could have conquered the mighty Talat. Wiwurgh hid his face, for among the Tasawent grief was not shown openly beyond the family, yet his shaking body spoke its clear language, as did Zawgha's stony, expressionless face down which tears were carving their paths all the same.\n\nBy the mausoleum stood Umalez, alone in her grief, and as her mother was carried past her, the procession stopped and she leaned in, giving Mekiouzza a final farewell kiss. Whispering how much she loved her mother, she sobbed uncontrollably as she was gently pulled away and Mekiouzza was carried into the tomb to her final rest.

It was a formality, most of it had been decided already in backroom deals and agreements. Strangely though, she did not mind that. The council was forged together tightly enough that it moved on its own, and unlike her mother, she did not see it as a means to an end. It was its own entity, and it moved by its own will. Wasn't that a good thing? The tribes that Mekiouzza had reluctantly empowered had seized that power, and now worked together to achieve their goals.\n\nYet, as the voting drew to a close, it became obvious that despite the efforts of several figures on the council, she was still elected Aguellid. Rising from her seat to accept the role, she thought back to her mother's last words; 'you will be what Zarantia needs'. And Umalez knew her path, so she would walk it.\n\n"I thank you all for your faith in me, and I swear upon my mother's name that I will treat this position with the care it deserves. I also wish to state, clearly and for all future records, that I assume the position of Aguellid only. I will be the protector of Zarantia, not its ruler. I speak for the tribes, but do not demand their blind allegiance. I, like the rest of you, will be a servant of our homeland.

"Won't that just lead to further divisions? A strong tribe could just defect and take the best land and industry with them?"\n\n"They could, but why would they?" her guide asked in response.\n\n"Self-determination? Being able to rule themselves without having to think about what a bunch of other zebras think about it?"\n\n"They still would though. Their cousins maybe, or their siblings-in-law. Rare is the zebra without rivals or enemies in their own tribe."\n\n"But that's still their people, isn't it? If push came to shove, they're with them against the others."\n\n"Now I see what you are on about." Her guide nodded, as if he had realised something. "I trust the Tjenwitt chieftain more than my cousin. My cousin is a haughty fool, Izemrasen Tjenwitt is a zebra of honour. If I argue with Izemrasen about farmland, maybe my cousin will be an ally there, but then we will bicker again. If I've been honourable with Izemrasen, she could be my ally against him in other matters. When somecreature asks 'are you with me or against me', we ask 'what is the issue at hoof?'. Sometimes you will stand as one family, sometimes you must find allies elsewhere. If you break away from Zarantia, you only have your family, and then you're weaker for it.

What more, fixing the seat of government in one place was to invite favouritism. Having the seat of government in your region would mean that you were the tribe who stood the closest to power. Tobuck had been one solution, but were they not a tribe in and of themselves, those city ponies? A large and unusually chaotic tribe, but a tribe all the same. No, Tobuck was not a solution.\n\nIn the end, it was the representative of Talat who suggested the best way out of this conundrum. Whenever a decision that concerned a region was to be taken, the decision would be taken in that region to be considered legitimate. A government absent from the region affected by the choices would not be legitimate, and though there has been protests by some of the settled tribes, as well as from the Tobuckians, no other solution has been found. The votes of the underserved and marginalised tribes still count, and along with the Aguellid's pleading for accord, the decision ended up approved.\n\nThe question of how exactly these regional seats will look will vary, with Agzhat and Tobuck having their council chambers prepared, but the nomadic tribes having simply begun to acquire grand tents and radios to host the council whenever it travels through their region. This will certainly make the council meetings a bit more interesting going ahead."

They watch carefully, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and it is said that the only time you truly are safe around them is when you are out of their reach. The Axuxi, meanwhile, are unparalleled survivors who have thrived in the depths of the desert for long enough that stories abound of how the blood of desert spirits flow in their veins.\n\nEach of them, like many others, have found different answers to the question of how to thrive in the harsh lands where the Imazeeb are the only ones to do so. Yet the tribes also guard their knowledge fiercely, and have rarely shared in this knowledge, at least until now.\n\nIt is still a careful process, but as our Aguellid has worked to chronicle the many legends of our people, so have the many arts of our people started to come together. The tribes are opening up more and more, their secretive teachings becoming knowledge shared among all. Inspired by their chieftain's Ironbreakers, the Amsarmud have begun to take students among other tribes. The Talat are more and more inviting to those who wish to challenge them. All over Zarantia, the tribes are intermingling, learning from each other and growing stronger for it. Faith in the new order is strong, and with it comes assurances that the secrets shared will be used for the good of all, and even if not all is shared, there is still enough to strengthen our people."

zarantia_federation.6.t:0 "Riding the Sandstorm"
zarantia_federation.6.d:0 "How many armies have marched into these lands, thinking that they could challenge us here? They march under the beating sun into a land where water is as precious as gold, thinking that controlling towns or roads will lead to victory, yet time and time again they've found out what it means to fight the Imazeeb. We do not surrender, not as long as there is life left in us, and when we die our kin will rally to avenge us. We move like the storm, and we await them wherever they least expect it, already dug in and waiting for them, and whether they come from one direction or several, we'll hold out before retreating, ready to strike again when needed. And as they choke on the dust and their exhaustion, we are there to finish what they started."
zarantia_federation.6.a:0 "This is what it means to fight the Imazeeb."

zarantia_federation.7.t:0 "No Longer Lost"
zarantia_federation.7.d:0 ""Come on Barhi, drink, there's still some water left." Medjoul put the water bottle to his powerless sister's mouth, trying to urge her to drink. Everything had gone wrong, and he didn't know what to do any more. All he knew was that he couldn't lose Barhi too, but the rocky desert that surrounded them was completely empty. He smiled at her, nodding as she drank. "We'll be fine. We'll find our good place. The trees will be filled with fruits, and birds will sing in them, and the water will run clear as glass..." he repeated the stories he'd told her over and over, feeling like he wanted to cry even as no tears would come. Not Barhi... please gods not her too!\n\nYelling in the distance made him look up, and he grabbed the stick he'd been using. The three figures that came around the rocky outcropping weren't those who had burned down the farm though. They were the desert zebras.\n\n"Put down the stick, child," one of them said as Medjoul leaped up to his hooves and raised the stick. "We're not your enemies. We're here to help you. Is that your sister? She needs water, we have water," he raised a full water skin to show him. Medjoul hesitated, blinking as he felt how he suddenly got dizzy right before everything went black.\n\nWhen he woke up again, he realised he was lying in a bed, and that he was staring up at a ceiling made of fabric. Slowly sitting up, he blinked as he looked around himself before realizing Barhi was sitting by his bedside, having fallen asleep against his leg. Stirred awake, she pushed herself up and, upon realizing he was awake, tackled him to hug him in relief. Medjoul could only return the embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the tent, the zebras who had found them were in quiet discussion. They had decided to give the siblings a moment before entering. The filly's story of what had happened had bothered them deeply. It was too common to hear of these tragedies these days, and many times the stories did not have happy endings. This one did though, and they entered the tent to speak with the two, to hear where they needed to go, and if they wanted to take shelter with their tribe."
zarantia_federation.7.a:0 "They are safe with us."

zarantia_federation.8.t:0 "For the Suffering"
zarantia_federation.8.d:0 ""The dead are becoming more and more commonplace along the borders." The chieftain was livid as he spoke. Only a few days ago, a large group of refugees had died in his lands. Despite the best efforts of his tribeszebras to save them, they had bled out before help arrived. "If we count the number of creatures trying to reach out lands for sanctuary and are gunned down, the numbers will be in the hundreds by now! Meanwhile, those fortunate who have escaped - among which I now count the pony married to my son - plead with us to intervene!"\n\nUmalez looked silently around the council chambers, having as usual chosen to let the tribes handle the matter. The idea of Amsisi had always been kinship beyond the tribes, and in the last years, the tribes had taken to the concept more strongly than she could have imagined. As they saw the suffering of the peoples beyond their borders they were enraged, and when they were begged to do something, they listened. Of course, the cynic would say that the tribal warriors were pushing for intervention as they feared losing their standing, and the political players knew that being a virtuous wielder of the principles that her mother had guided them to would make them look good. And of course, if they intervened against the tyrants, they would open up new markets for Zarantia. It was a careful balance to be walked here, and she raised her hoof, figuring it was time to push in the right direction.\n\n"If we shall intervene to save these peoples, we should do so not to engage in dynastic infighting, nor to enrich ourselves. Their sons and daughters should not be sent to die in foreign lands, and the wealth of their lands must not be taken from them. As your Aguellid I am ready to - should the council decree so - rally the tribes to tear down the tyrants whose victims we shelter, and return them home. Not for plunder, but for Amsisi and the sacred rights of all peoples to not be driven from their homes. Will we take on this burden, and march to war?""
zarantia_federation.8.a:0 "We will."

The council that presides over this state has extended an offer of alliance to us for the sake of mutual defence and prosperity. If the Imazeeb's intervention to help the Tobuckians some fifty years ago is any indication, they are quite serious about offering to fight alongside us."

The oil deposits we've found in the deserts are immense. I-I am not exaggerating when I'm saying that this may well be the very foundation of Zarantia's economy in the future! The trade, the agriculture, the... everything, nothing of it can come close to this kind of resources. Oil is the future, and we were just catapulted into the very forefront of it! The world will line up to be our customers, even gold wouldn't bring this kind of wealth!"

His old associates have rushed to entrench themselves and block any attempts by your people to ensure the city is returned to Zarantian control. They are lying in wait for you, and there is little chaos for you to exploit in attempting to attack. Lest you come with the full weight of your people, I fear they will thwart you as they have before.\n\nI asked you to show tolerance towards the Equestrian, and in doing so I have done my part in bringing about this state of affairs. I can only plead for your forgiveness for this, and will remain in Tobuck to send you what information I can.\n\nYour humble servant, Menes Amasdag."

 zarantia.990.t:0 "Only When She Allowed It"
 zarantia.990.d:0 "'No rest for the wicked' her daughter had said once, and Mekiouzza couldn't help but smile dryly to herself as she recalled it from her bed. It had been during the darkest moments of her life, and yet she had come back from it, stronger than before. Though Tobuck had slipped out of her grasp, she had regained it, and though the world had kept challenging her, she had triumphed. Zarantia was stronger than ever, and she finally dared to believe that it would survive without her. Was that due to her reforms or actions? Oh certainly, to some extent, but there was one thing that gave her hope above all other things; her dear daughter.\n\nThough she had worried that her sweet daughter would not be up to the challenges that came with leadership, the events of the last years had proven Umalez' mettle beyond what Mekiouzza could have dreamed of. Indeed, maybe she had been the one to hold Umalez back she wondered as the door slammed open and Umalez came hurrying inside.\n\n"Mother, are you well?!" Umalez asked as she came up to Mekiouzza's side. "They said you were ill."\n\n"I've been ill for a long time. I just did not allow it to bother me," Mekiouzza's voice was cracking, the iron determination that had driven her for the last years finally having begun to run out. It was inexorable, building. "I once cursed the fates for giving me a daughter that was so soft... but I was wrong, I see that now. You will be what Zarantia needs, and I was a fool for not seeing that." She gave up a slow, hoarse sigh, feeling how the tiredness only grew. "Good luck, my little flower.""

zarantia.200.t:0 "Returning Home"
zarantia.200.d:0 "Tobuck's streets were not like she remembered them, not quite. The Storm King's ravages and a year under the thieves had left it a shadow of its former self. There were still buildings that had not been repaired, and the streets had piles of garbage in the corners. Yet, the ponies of the city were out in said streets, and as Mekiouzza strode along Tobuck's streets with her daughter by her side, they cheered and stomped their hooves in celebration.\n\nMekiouzza wished she could join their glee, yet her smile was strained, and she found this moment of relief poisoned by the sting of wounded pride. The mighty Aguellid of Zarantia, returning to her city not as a liberator, but first when a common smuggler and criminal allowed her to do so. She felt weak, impotent, and the unwelcome sensation laid itself like a mourning veil over everything.\n\n"We should clean up the city, and when it is put back in good condition, we should celebrate again," Umalez' murmur made Mekiouzza glance at her. Her daughter's smile was wide, and her eyes sparkled with joy, even as she murmured almost imperceptibly to her. "Let's drown the memory of this whole awful episode in celebration and joy, things are finally back to what they should be, and isn't that what matters?"\n\nMekiouzza lowered her head slightly, feeling how her smile turned less forced."
zarantia.200.a:0 "Indeed we should, my dear daughter, indeed we should."

zarantia.201.t:0 "The Tobuckian 'Chieftains'"
zarantia.201.d:0 "Tobuck under Zarantia was not and had never been a city with one ruler, but rather the various power brokers and influential community figures in it were given a place on the city's council. The city, much like the tribes of the desert, had largely been allowed to mind its own affairs, at least until now.\n\n"Don't give me that look, Rose Rain," Mekiouzza told the mare across the table from her before looking at the rest of the gathered Tobuckians. "Speak plainly. In fact, all of you speak plainly. I'm too old to have you do the Tobuckian half-step of implications and hints around me."\n\n"Then please, noble Aguellid..." It was Menes Amasdag who spoke up. "You return from exile, and your first move is to clamp down on the freedoms the city has enjoyed, it's..."\n\n"Basically, where were you last year?" Rose Rain butted in. "We were left occupied by criminals, and those meant to protect us were off in the desert. I understand why, we do," She waved at the gathered ponies. "But how do you explain that to the rest of the city?"\n\n"That a tribe divided against each other will not stand," Mekiouzza told her. "You're right, last year was disgraceful, and I failed. Zarantia failed. The very purpose of this nation snapped like a dry twig. What we've been doing thus far didn't work, and that's why we're going to have to clamp down. The Storm King is gone, but Colthage's... whatever you call that entire mess over there, the Chiropterrans are up to something as well, and the entire region is scrambling to adapt after the last years. We can't go back to what was, because we saw what that led to. Things need to change if we are to survive, and that's why you are here. I call upon your services as I did before, to make sure that the Zarantia we dreamed of comes true.""

zarantia.202.t:0 "A Most Useful Griffon"
zarantia.202.d:0 ""I understand that it is customary to bow deeply before you, most honoured princess of Zarantia." The obese griffon wheezed a bit as he addressed Umalez. "I can only hope that you can overlook my failure in this regard. I am very old, and my back is not what it was." A small smile crept over his face. "I am also very fat, and most likely would fall over if I tried."\n\n"I am not so unreasonable to throw you out for that," Umalez hid a small smile at the griffon's self-deprecating humour. Between that and his ashamed appearance - face lowered and hat in claw - he cut an awkward, almost pitiable, figure. "Yet. You did work with Pea Shooter, and my mother has little patience for his cronies."\n\n"I most certainly understand that, and in my position I would be treating myself with the utmost care. Yet, I am but a humble merchant, and I value my life above any notions of honour; that is for better creatures than me. I also - humbly, would say that that is why you might be interested in my services. I won't deny that my former colleague left the city in a bit of a mess. Yet he has somewhere to go, and I do not. I would serve you simply because if I don't, I am a dead griff no matter what I do."\n\nUmalez didn't trust him, not really, but he did have a point. If there was a snake in the house, it was better to know where it was. What more, unlike her mother she didn't feel like killing someone just in case. Who knew, maybe he would prove useful?"
zarantia.202.a:0 "I am sure you will prove yourself, mister Tradat."

zarantia.203.t:0 "Not Quite Back to Normal"
zarantia.203.d:0 "Hibiscus was overjoyed that the Imazeeb were back in town. Not only did they keep things in order, but they were also way more well-mannered than those brutish mercenaries. If there was any people she really wanted to have piling into her little café to buy coffee or tea, it was them.\n\n"Your tea is as fine as always, madam Hibiscus!" one of the zebras commented as he and a dozen of his... she thought of it basically as 'extended family', sat around a table meant for eight. "How have you not caught yourself a husband yet with tea like this?"\n\n"Oh you know. My candidate has not been able to come here during the last year, but I'm working on it." Her coy answer made the zebras all 'oooh' and 'aaah' in understanding, and Hibiscus decided that now if anytime she had to ask the question that had been gnawing in the back of her mind. "Also... has something happened with the Aguellid? All these new laws and taxes... a lot of ponies worry. This isn't the Mekiouzza we remember." The mood around the table dropped like a rock, and the zebras looked down at their tea. Well then, at least that proved that they weren't alone in seeing the issues.\n\n"Those are matters of Aguellid and chieftains," one of the zebras sighed after a second, and Hibiscus felt a sting of irritation. Why did they have to be so deferential, couldn't they see that this wasn't right?! She gave up a frustrated little noise but pushed the anger down. It wouldn't do any good to snap at them. "I know!" The zebra suddenly perked up. "It's Yuften you're waiting for, isn't it?" he asked, leaning in to see Hibiscus' reaction. Hibiscus just rolled her eyes."

zarantia.204.t:0 "A Useful Griffon's Due"
zarantia.204.d:0 ""You've really been most useful, Vasile cel Tradat," Mekiouzza told the bowing griffon that had come into her office. "Indispensable, even, one might say," She pushed herself up to stand, supporting herself on a cane. "Walk with me, and tell me what your angle is."\n\n"As I mentioned to your daughter, madam, I am a griffon with few ways out," Vasile responded deferentially, falling in line with her as she stepped out into the hallway. "And besides, I've grown fond of Tobuck." His smile was not reciprocated. "Ahem, but yes. I merely wish to make the best of my situation, and the Zarantian state building project is an impressive one. Might I ask where we're going?"\n\n"Where you won't bleed on the rugs," Mekiouzza told him before raising the cane, one made out of iron, and bringing it down on his neck in one heavy strike. Vasile crumbled to the floor, only a choked gasp escaping from his lungs as Mekiouzza pulled back the cane. "I know your schemes, rat. My daughter vouched for you, spared your life and gave you an honoured post, and you repaid her gift by trying to turn Tobuck against me." Vasile could only make weak sounds as he tried to crawl away, only for Mekiouzza to raise the cane and bring it down on him again. This time he screamed. \n\n"You could have become the mayor of Tobuck, spent your twilight years surrounded by luxuries and comforts and had statues of you when you died!" Mekiouzza spat, eyes glowing with rage. "Remember this as I beat your body into a corpse and feed you to the vultures, rat!" With that, she raised her cane and let it fall again, and again, and again. Her age and exhaustion was long forgotten, rage giving her strength enough that when she was finally pulled away, Vasile cel Tradat was long since dead."
zarantia.204.a:0 "Dump him in the harbour, and clean up the blood."

zarantia.2041.t:0 "The Worst Possible News"
zarantia.2041.d:0 "The shots rang out through the palace, one right after the other, and Umalez startled as she heard it from just down the hallway. What was worse, it came from where her mother had been! Breaking into a sprint, she ran towards it only to find the door to her mother's study wide open and a body of a pony she didn't recognize on the floor right inside. Further inside stood Vasile, a gun in his trembling claw aimed at the figure.\n\n"P-princess," he stuttered, and while Umalez normally would have corrected him on the use of the title, but the sight of the second body inside the room, next to him, made her heart stop. Her mother lay in a pool of her own blood. The wall behind where she had stood covered by blood splatter. Guards came storming into the room, Vasile being disarmed others rushed to Mekiouzza's side.\n\nShe was dead, having died instantly when the assassin's bullet hit her, and Umalez could only sit limply by her side, staring down at her mother. She was in a daze, as if she didn't know what to do or say. Someone was screaming, howling like mad, and Umalez, still utterly detached, wished they'd stop."
zarantia.2041.a:0 "It took a good while to realize that it was she who screamed."

zarantia.205.t:0 "As All Things Are Born, So All Things Must Die"
zarantia.205.d:0 ""Excellent," Mekiouzza said weakly as Umalez sat down by her bedside and put a bowl of dates down on the small table. The disease had come out of nowhere, and it had struck relentlessly, leaving Mekiouzza bedridden. Despite the best efforts of several doctors, she did not get better, and eventually she sent them out and called for her daughter. She barely could pick one up, and chewed it slowly. "You told me once that I should retire and leave ruling to you, remember? I should spend the rest of my days eating dates."\n\n"Yes, I remember," Umalez smiled at the memory as she took one herself. "A joke, nothing else. I couldn't have replaced you then."\n\n"If I had, I would not lie here." Mekiouzza grunted as she looked up at the ceiling. Merely the effort of eating a couple of dates exhausted her. "I am not getting up from this bed," she concluded after a while. "No, don't protest. I've been weak for months, weak in a way that you don't come back from. Days or weeks, I cannot say, but there's no coming back from this. Until then, I will heed my daughter's advice and eat dates." Mekiouzza squeezed her daughter's hoof, "For these coming days, sit with me."\n\n"Of course," Umalez nodded, feeling the lump grow in her stomach but keeping a brave face. "I will speak with Menes and make sure the affairs of the state are managed, then I'll be back. While you're stuck here, I'll treat you to foreign delicacies I've learned of recently."\n\n"So I shall lie on my deathbed, being used as a test subject by my own daughter," Mekiouzza drawled and Umalez giggled as she leaned in to kiss her forehead.\n\n"That is the punishment for your villainy, mama.""

The question is how we should deal with them.\n\nZawgha has prepared a plan to isolate and crush the Warlords one by one. Between the Ironbreakers and the loyal tribes, we'll crush them and let their deaths be a lesson to whoever else would attempt to challenge our grasp on the city again. After all that has been, the time for the Imazeeb to show their ability as warriors has come, and they will not be found wanting. This is especially important as the warlords possess modern weapons and tactics, and defeating them will let us learn how to deal with these types of enemies when they aren't disorganised mercenaries.\n\nWiwurgh, meanwhile, has proposed to simply buy them out. Provide them a way out and provisions to smooth things over, and we'll see them leave without more death. After all, Pea Shooter made good on his promises, and it is the nature of the mercenary to avoid conflicts since you can't spend your gold if you're dead. We are rising from recent embarrassments without having lost hundreds or thousands of our brave warriors. Let us keep that, and focus our efforts on rebuilding Tobuck. War will come sooner or later, and let us not seek it when it is not needed."
zarantia.206.a:0 "Whatever we do, we must handle them quickly."

Pretending that there's any reasoning to be had with these kinds of creatures is to debase ourselves, and we shall gladly pay the price needed to settle this matter in a way that does not further disgrace ourselves. In a world where the strong take what they please, weakness is a betrayal of those who rely on you for protection. We've already been made foals of enough for ten lifetimes in recent years, and if we let these vermin go, we may as well hang up giant banners at the borders with the words 'the Imazeeb are weak, come and take what you wish from them' written on it.\n\nNo, we settle this, and we settle it as they settled things with the warriors whom they fought when they first came here: in death and blood."

zarantia.208.d:0 ""I ain't gonna complain, don't get me wrong," General Wallnut Drive said as he looked at the crates of food that had been put down between him and the very angry zebra that stared him down. "But... just so we don't talk past each other, could you repeat all that from top to bottom?"\n\n"By the order of the Aguellid, you have a month's grace to make yourself scarce," Zawgha growled at him, and Wallnut idly wondered if this was what it was like to stare down a dragon. "Buzz off to whatever hole you crawled out of, and never again touch Zarantia's lands."\n\n"Pretty sure that's about the best deal we could get. Though from one soldier to another, professional courtesy if that's your thing, let's just take a moment here. My soldiers and I ain't much for talk or for diplomacy, but we can make somethin' work if you give it a chance." He fired off his most endearing smile, only to have the zebra's eyes drill a hole in him.\n\n"Do not test me, you rat-born Chiropterran pile of puke. Turn your pack of vermin around and march! If one single farm burns, or one single pony is harmed during your retreat, the deal is off and we'll hunt you down and gut you like fish! Do I make myself clear, or do I need to carve it into your face?!"\n\n"Alright, I hear you! No problem, we're good to go as is! Thanks for puttin' up with us!" Not even he was going to push his luck any more. Boy, was he glad he didn't have to deal with her on the battlefield."
zarantia.208.a:0 "Start marching, and do not stop."

zarantia.209.t:0 "Severyana's Proud Daughter"
zarantia.209.d:0 "The ponies stood in immaculately straight lines, all of them at attention, and before them stood General Alesia Snezhnaya with one hoof resting on the sword that was planted before her. The standoff had been going on for a week, but she kept her forces in line. Neither hide nor hair of any of the locals had been touched, and that was what had made Mekiouzza agree to meet with her. Before the lines of soldiers, she seemed small, but she only smirked as she studied their commander.\n\n"Many of my people say that I am meek for letting you slip instead of burying you all," she said as she walked towards Alesia, studying the mare's face. "Am I, girl? And if I'm not, what makes you think you're in a position to make demands of me."\n\n"I have seen enough of the Imazeeb to know that they don't follow a leader they don't respect, and everything I've heard about you tells me why they respect you." Alesia stood firm and met Mekiouzza's gaze without wavering. "That's why I know you'll listen." Mekiouzza raised an eyebrow, coming to a stop as she stood right in front of Alesia and leaning in to indicate that she should continue. "I'm here because my prowess on the field of battle is my only way to gain the resources required to reclaim my homeland, command is the only thing where I am truly capable. My previous employer deceived my soldiers and I, as you are no doubt aware. Returning home now would leave us with nothing, which is why I wish to offer my services to Zarantia. We are unaffiliated with any local or regional politics, and our loyalty will be to you so long as you continue to command with honour and retain our pay. As our actions in recent months have shown, we are disciplined; if you need to test us, put us into battle wherever you need. All I ask is that we are allowed to continue operating here to our own ends, and that when the time comes we are released from our contract. If you accept this, then we shall surrender to you."\n\n"And if I don't?" Mekiouzza asked, still smirking.\n\n"Then we shall stand our ground and die well," Alesia didn't hesitate, and Mekiouzza chuckled. Good... that was what she wanted to hear."

zarantia.210.d:0 ""They are always bigger than you can imagine," Wiwurgh commented as he walked down the pier, looking at the warship that lay at anchor. "And the mad thing is that this one is a whelp among warships. Some vessels would dwarf this like a stallion would dwarf a newborn foal. Thousands of tonnes of steel, enough to make guns and swords for an army, all cast into one ship. And to rule the seas, a leader will need an army of them. They thread the water for days if not weeks and months, more isolated than a tribe in the deepest desert, and they are lumbering. Every step they take must be taken with the utmost caution. They truly could not be more different from the affairs of warriors."\n\n"Are you trying to console me?" Zawgha asked him, scowling at the Blue Sage's lecture. Wiwurgh bowed his head towards her.\n\n"To an extent, but also to defend our noble Aguellid's decision to make a Tobuckian the head of our navy. I understand your anger, but the lion should hunt, and the shark should swim. It would humiliate the lion to ask it to leap into the water and chase fish. It can, and it is loyal and brave enough to do it without hesitation, but it is over the dunes and hills where it shows its strength."\n\n"Tell me, do all Tasawent speak in this manner? Speaking to you is like reading a book of fables." Wiwurgh's smile could be seen even through his veil."

zarantia.211.d:0 "Vasile sat half buried behind papers when Umalez entered, and as he looked up from the documents he was working on, somewhat wild-eyed, he blinked and quickly rose up. "Princ-" he began only to knock over a stack and send them crashing into the floor. "Oh dear..." he grimaced as they scattered all over the floor. "I'm terribly sorry, please forgive me, I've not slept too much recently..." he bent down and did his best to pick up the papers. Umalez chose to simply bend down to help him pick them up instead of making a fuss.\n\n"What keeps you from sleeping? Have you been sick?" She asked him as she put half the fallen papers back on his desk.\n\n"No, I am just making the most of the opportunity offered," Vasile said as he slid his own stack in under Umalez'. "I admittedly may have worked a bit later last night than I should have. Has there been any issues with my work?"\n\n"No, not at all," Umalez wondered just how late he had worked. "Rather, a cart was delivered to the palace this morning, containing gold that was stolen when the Storm King ransacked the city. You would not know any of it?"\n\n"Yes, and my apologies that I did not counsel you on the matter. I have had my ear to the ground recently. While your mother is putting the squeeze on the city's underworld, I am making sure to catch any bits of interest that spurt out so to speak." An awkward moment passed between them before he covered his eyes with a groan. "That was a terrible way to put it and I am SO sorry..." Umalez, meanwhile, had to hide the smile that came over her face.\n\n"I will overlook it. However, do make sure that you rest properly. You won't be able to convince my mother of your usefulness if you exhaust yourself."\n\n"Thank you very much, princess, I will make sure to rest properly and to not make a fool out of myself going ahead." He bowed and Umalez returned the gesture with a nod before leaving the room. As she did, she couldn't help but be impressed. He seemed more sincere than she had initially thought."
zarantia.211.a:0 "Maybe there's hope for him yet."

zarantia.212.t:0 "A Curious Holiday"
zarantia.212.d:0 ""Good Evi's Day to you," Vasile greeted Umalez as she came into the room. She gave him a confused look and he quickly moved to explain. "In Brodfeld, the river Evi has always been important, enough that we pray to the goddess of that river. Today is Evi's Day. Were I home I would celebrate with my family and a huge feast. I did manage to find some Pâine de Orez though. Would you care for some?" he asked, holding up the plate of small square pieces of what looked like cake.\n\n"Thank you," Umalez reached out and helped herself to it. It was more akin to a bread than cake, but it was smooth and fluffy, and she nodded approvingly.\n\n"That is very nice, thank you. Is it made from rice? I recall reading that Brodfeld grows rice."\n\n"Rice for days," Vasile chuckled. "It is in everything, and we say 'can't even boil rice' about someone who knows nothing. That and fish from the Evi is most of what we eat. Though, and I just know my dear grandmother would cane me for saying this, but I must say that I prefer the fish of the Green Bay. But sorry, I'm getting lost in nostalgia. What do you require of me?" he sat up a bit straighter and Umalez raised a hoof to stop him.\n\n"Actually, let's leave that for now. I will send for tea, and you can tell me more of Brodfeld. If we are to trust you, it would be good for us to know you better. Also, it seems such a shame that you'd have to celebrate Evi's Day alone."\n\n"I couldn't possibly ask that of you, princess. I am more than honoured, but-"\n\n"I have worked to maintain my people's traditions even in this new age. If you remain here, you will be one of my people. So please, teach me your people's traditions." She pushed him a little, having long since figured out he kept his guard up. If he were to open up, she'd have to push. Vasile, in the end, bowed his head and smiled, more genuinely than ever before."
zarantia.212.a:0 "It would be my honour."

zarantia.213.t:0 "The Exile's Hope"
zarantia.213.d:0 ""What do you reckon that your mother's state will look like in the end?" Vasile asked Umalez after he was finished giving his report. "I hope you will have patience with my question, but your mother's great work centers on elevating the Imazeeb people. She's doing great things, and she'll go down in history. But where does that leave Tobuck? This city is not Imazeeb. What is their place in this new world? A subject people?"\n\n"Amsisi," Umalez answered him. "Our people have never been one, not really. The fact that she accomplishes as much as she's able to is because she's bartered and dealed with them for years. To most of us, there's no greater difference between a Tobuckian and an Ataghan than between an Ataghan and an Uzzal. In fact most of my tribe would be more comfortable around Tobuckians than the Uzzal."\n\n"I understand, but I worry all the same. To the Tobuckians, you are united. You all are still one people. A varied such to be true, but Imazeeb is still Imazeeb. They don't like to say it though, but in their more vulnerable moments...?" he made a grimace. "It as been on my mind for a long time, take my advice as you see fit, but if one side says 'you're part of us' and the other says 'we are our own group', then you have a recipe for great tensions."\n\n"And what would you suggest?" Umalez had figured him out; how he started by laying out the facts in support of his idea before suggesting it.\n\n"I would establish a mayorship over Tobuck, one with wide-reaching authority to make them feel like they're truly part of Zarantia. When one of those at Mekiouzza's side is one of them, and always will be, then they see that they're more than just subjects."\n\n"And who would you suggest for this title?" Umalez asked, eyes twinkling mischievously. "Come now Vasile, you've got a suggestion lined up. Say it..." Vasile shook his head, refusing to say it, but Umalez could tell precisely who he was thinking of."
zarantia.213.a:0 "And yet... would he really be a bad candidate?"

zarantia.214.t:0 "The Price of Naiveté"
zarantia.214.d:0 ""Well, do you have nothing to say for yourself?" The cane that lay across Mekiouzza's table was covered in dried blood, and Umalez stared mutely down at it. Shame and anger pooled inside her as her mother sat behind the desk, staring her down. After Vasile's death, his hidden correspondence had revealed just what kind of web the griffon had woven, including inflaming tensions in the city, squirrelling away millions of zhekels for his own use and installing his own people across the entire government.\n\n"Nothing," she whispered in response. The last weeks had been a chaotic scramble to clean them out, and Umalez had time and time again been confronted with just how much she had aided him. She had all but served the government to him on a silver platter. "I have let you down, and I'm unworthy of following in your hoofsteps." What could she even say? She was worse than a failure, she was a traitor, unwitting but traitor all the same. Her mother walked around the table and placed a hoof under her cheek to push her face up.\n\n"Look at me," she ordered, and Umalez quietly obeyed. "I have covered up your involvement in this. Nozebra will know of it. But do you finally see the price of kindness? You wanted to help an outsider, and in doing so you poisoned your own nation. This scar of shame will never go away. Warriors learn from their scars, have you learned what you need to?\n\n"Yes mother..." Umalez didn't want to start crying, and she bit back her tears even though she could barely talk. That was when her mother leaned in to embrace her, making her breath hitch before she realised what was happening.\n\n"My daughter, you are too kind for this world," Mekiouzza whispered, making Umalez lose what composure she still had, returning the embrace as she shook uncontrollably against her mother's shoulder."

You will dig wells and provide food in times of famine?" Umalez nodded after every question Tin had. In the end, he locked eyes with her, studying her for a while before asking "Why?"\n\n"Amsisi," Umalez responded plainly. "My mother taught me that all Imazeeb are kin. You are Imazeeb." She would have gone further, but she had long since understood that to the Azir tribes, laconic answers were the best.\n\n"We're trophies to show your mother was correct?" Tin Zinan's eyes narrowed.\n\n"Distant family." Umalez insisted. "I want to gather that family."\n\n"Will we be the children?"\n\n"Cousins," Umalez smiled widely. "Ornery cousins." At this, Tin Zinan gave up a bark of laughter. It was the first time he had even smiled during her time here.\n\n"Very well, cousin," he told her. "I will spread the word. Azir is yours.""

Build them elsewhere."\n\nWith the message has come a map of the region, where the alternate routes have been drawn out. It will demand more resources to build in such a way, but nozebra is seriously indulging the idea that we would ignore the warnings. The Ijirmed are the heralds of the goddess of endings, and one single worm could wreck the railroad and kill scores of workers.\n\nThe messenger has remained behind to take our answer, but the question is if this is not as good a time as any to contact the Azir tribes and see what accord we can find with them."

Her mother had never been a zebra to back down once she had decided to act, and many times it had been a source of comfort for her. To know that when her strong, indomitable mother said something would be a certain way, come Tartarus or tornadoes, she would achieve it. And yet right now it only left a pit in her stomach.\n\nWith the news out of Tobuck, her mother had grown colder, grimmer, and it was all too clear to Umalez what was going on. Her mother was enraged, and she would see every last criminal in Tobuck dead no matter what it would cost... even if it meant that she would abandon the careful dance of deals and agreements that she had wielded thus far. Her mother was out for blood, and if you weren't with her, you would be against her.\n\nUmalez realised she was trying to calculate their chances. So used was she to believe in her mother, that though she was horrified by her mother's actions, Umalez' instincts still wanted to go along with it and believe in her. Yet even here? Down a path that would see her turn on her own people and demand their loyalty on pain of death?"

Umalez ran a hoof over the page in front of her, her face deep in thought.\n\n"And yet the tribe I spoke to maintains, on their honour and their ancestors, that this is the full truth." Wiwurgh told her from his position by the wall, where he was enjoying the tea provided for him. "The stories passed down the tribes have travelled far through the ages, and many of them carry the marks and scars of the long road they have travelled."\n\n"But these stories bind our people together. When they have become this different over time... do we even know what the truth is?" She felt a pit in her stomach. She had sought to find a refuge in the project of gathering the tales of her people, hoping to collect it into one unified work. Yet even here reality got in the way as there seemed to be a thousand versions of most stories, and even her best efforts to find the original story stumbled.\n\n"A good question, one that I cannot provide the answer for. It will be an important answer though." The Blue Sage leaned back a bit in his seat, looking pointedly at Umalez, who could only sigh and bury her face in her hooves."

Umalez was rare in this respect, a foal born and raised in the city that to many Imazeeb was a distant entity, and the loss of her home city had been hard on her. Like her mother, she had gritted her teeth and pushed on, determined to be a strength to her people instead of a liability. Yet, she still had nightmares of seeing the Storm King's fleet in the sky, and the fires raging behind her as she left Tobuck behind that fateful night still burned in her neck.\n\nFifty years of hard work all had come crumbling down, leaving them near back where they had started, and all the while foreign criminals had run roughshod over her home city. Was that what fifty years of work had meant, to be weak enough to have to suffer the presence of criminals in their seat of power? Umalez would lie if she said she did not understand her mother's rage. The question would be what happened when she retook Tobuck though."

I beg you to plead with her on my tribe's behalf, for I am helpless, and my tribe will starve if this continues." Umalez felt sick to her stomach as she watched the proud chieftain bow deeply before her, humiliating himself before her for the good of his tribe. Before the Storm King's reign, his tribe had held land along the coast, and prospered from it. They had suffered grievously when the Storm King came though, and were a shadow of what they had been. Due to this they had not rallied to Mekiouzza's side to retake the city, claiming they could not risk their few remaining sons and daughters.\n\n"I thank you for your kind words, and your faith in me honours me." She said it so easily, but she knew what kind of challenge would lay before her. The tribe's absence in the war to reclaim Tobuck had meant Mekiouzza had instead chosen to give the lands to her favoured general Zawgha instead. Those who served the Aguellid well were rewarded, those who didn't were cast aside. This was no mere coincidence, but rather the end goal of her mother's policies. The poor chieftain in front of her was the chieftain of a dead tribe, he just didn't know it yet. But she couldn't undermine her mother on this... could she?"

Like with most things, practice made perfect, and though Umalez still felt troubled by some of the things that were happening, she couldn't help but grow familiar with it. The tribes that had seemed so proud and headstrong turned out to be pliable if enough force was applied, and those who didn't bow were simply killed. It had gone against centuries of dearly held tradition, and Mekiouzza should have been killed by the tribes as they rose up. Yet, after decades of playing the game, Mekiouzza had known how to outplay and isolate all those who did not bow to her, and though thousands lay dead by her hoof, Zarantia was stronger for it.\n\nBut what was it all for, Umalez wondered. Her mother was unquestioned, and wielded power beyond what any Imazeeb ever had. Was this merely the natural culmination of her efforts? Was it the inevitable end result for someone who sought to change the world around them?\n\nShe would once have been disgusted by it, and claim that the Aguellid's role was to serve as the defender of the tribes, not to tower above them like some Maregyptians Pharaoh or Griffonian Emperor. Agreement and negotiation was their people's way, and though she knew that things would have to change, wasn't the goal to only reach as far as was needed to in order to ensure their people could still thrive?

Though she was making light of it, the question he had asked was one she had thought a lot about herself. Even now, after everything had crumbled, her mother had patiently begun to gather the tribes around her with as soft a hoof as she had shown decades ago.

With the events of the last years, Umalez had decided to aid her people in a more oblique way. The Imazeeb had always been storytellers, and yet if they were meant to be one nation, wouldn't it behove them to have those stories gathered as well? In this, Wiwurgh had been invaluable, even if he tended to continue needling her with his questions.\n\n"What's the purpose of Zarantia? Is it a vehicle for the Aguellid's ambitions, or does it mean more than that?" Umalez didn't reply at first, only blinked at him. That was audacious, even for him. What was he getting at? "I hold no intent of going against your mother in any way," Wiwurgh preempted her follow-up question, "but it is an important question. I cannot think of many zebras that are truly enthusiastic about the idea of trading away their independence to be ruled over by someone not of their tribe, not even one as revered as your mother. With that in mind, how does Zarantia justify its existence?"\n\nUmalez sighed as she leaned back and looked up at the ceiling.

Though tempered by the Aguellid's law and the Amsisi, revenge was still a core tenet among the Imazeeb. When your security and dignity rested on being able to fight back against those who'd cross you, vengeance became not a vice, but a virtue. What more, by the Aguellid's words and creed Tobuck was equal to any Imazeeb tribe.\n\nAnd so, with their cousins on the coast conquered and degraded by honourless criminals who had sought to strip it bare to enrich themselves, the insult was as complete as it could be, and the demand for justice was absolute. Tobuck suffered, and so should not the Imazeeb pour out of the desert like a storm, and slay every last of these fiends for what they had done to the Imazeeb's distant family? And yet... was that what Tobuck wanted? Were the Imazeeb overlords coming to extract vengeance for a slight against them more than they sought to liberate Tobuck?"

"That is now seventeen variants of the legend of the floating cities. Twelve of them just among the Azir tribes. When I try to find the common themes, I'm left with one thing, a floating city."\n\n"And sadly, each of those tribes would say that their tales are truthful." The Blue Sage was placid about the entire affair, though he gave her a sympathetic nod. "It has rarely been an issue before. After all, no Imazeeb would be so brazen as to question another tribe's legends."\n\n"And you will now ask me what my purpose with this endeavour is," Umalez added dryly as she scooted up to a sitting position and Wiwurgh clucked happily in response. Looking down at the texts in front of her, she thought about all the high-minded ideals she had had when starting her work.

It should be such a simple thing to consider, a glorious triumph of her mother, but for some reason it made her pensive. How much could a people change and still remain themselves? She had worked tirelessly to preserve the rituals, the stories and the mythology of her people, but if all else had changed, was there a point to preserving those things?"

"Send out your ironbreakers into the streets. Tell them to drive back the rioters with force. Your tribes respect strength, so be their strength, claim the Aguellidship, or your mother's dream will die here as well!"\n\n"You... you're right. I have to..." She rose up, taking a deep breath. "Send Zawgha to me and I'll order her out." Vasile pushed himself up as well and touched her shoulder.\n\n"You're doing the right thing. Have faith, and we'll solve this yet." He gave her a fatherly smile before bowing and retreating, opening the door to send after the general. As he did though, he couldn't help but grin a little to himself.\n\nWhen he had realised just how watchful Mekiouzza was, he had been ready to grab whatever he could and run, but when had that ever earned anygriff a profit? Looking back on the plotting of recent months, he had been outright reckless, but it had worked! Mekiouzza was out of the way, and that sobbing girl in the room back there would bend like a reed."

zarantia_vasile_coup.2.d:0 ""You ordered me out to slaughter our people, and now you claim the position of Aguellid without their approval!" Zawgha snarled as she stared Umalez down. "Has your brain rotted?!"\n\n"I know you tribes put pride in being frank, but you are still speaking to the Aguellid, so mind your manners!" Vasile cut in before Umalez could reply, making Zawgha turn to him with eyes blazing.\n\n"Hold your tongue before I cut it out, you swollen crow! This is an Imazeeb matter, and you should be dangling from the gallows already!" \n\n"Enough!" Umalez screamed, slamming her hoof into the table. What little composure she had regained in recent days was gone. "I restored order after they ran out and started killing innocents, and yes I took the position! I wasn't going to call those chieftains to a meeting while their warriors burned Tobuck down! You served my mother, you serve me! Or are you going to turn around too when it's no longer convenient!?" Zawgha froze at this, the anger running off her as she stared mutely at Umalez before responding.\n\n"Don't you dare call my honour into question one more time, whelp. We Amsarmud fought for your mother since before you were born, and you of all zebras do not get to question that." Her voice was deathly still, yet Umalez didn't waver.\n\n"Then leave, and don't question me again," she hissed, her entire body trembling. Zawgha spun around and silently walked out, leaving behind an Umalez that slowly sank down to the floor with her body trembling. Vasile came to her side and place his claw on her shoulder.\n\n"You did the right thing, princess," he whispered. "That zebra was just unreasonable. You had to put your hoof down." Umalez could only stare down into the floor as she nodded mutely along with Vasile's words."

zarantia_vasile_coup.3.d:0 ""Umalez, I know you can hear me!" When the order had been sent out to Zawgha, she had stormed towards the palace to demand answers from Umalez only to have guards block her path. "Umalez!" She paced back and forth, one hoof on her sword. "If you have even a shred of integrity left in you then face me! Or did your mother birth a coward?! Come out!"\n\n"Princess, wait!" Inside the palace, Vasile stopped Umalez from leaving the room they were in. "Don't indulge her! She's actively defying you, and if you let yourself be cowed now, she'll show everycreature that you can get your way by bullying the Aguellid."\n\n"Zawgha served my mother for decades, she deserves better," Umalez said, making another move for the door as Vasile stopped her again.\n\n"And she will get it. She just has to go on her mission. She'll cool down, things will settle, and when she comes back you can embrace her like a sister! But right now you must be the firm one. What would your mother have done?!" Umalez flinched, almost as if she was struck, and in the end she slowly lowered her hoof from the door handle.\n\nZawgha, meanwhile, remained outside for nearly an hour, screaming for Umalez to show herself. In the end though, after no response, she turned around and left. That very same evening, she led her ironbreakers out of Tobuck. Her mission: scour the far wastes for any tribes that were in open defiance of the Aguellid's rule and not return until they were dealt with."

zarantia_vasile_coup.4.t:0 "The Defiant Sage"
zarantia_vasile_coup.4.d:0 ""So this is what you offer in response to the truth?" Wiwurgh Tasawent asked calmly. The courtroom was tense as a piano wire, with all eyes on him. The Blue Sage had been seized by guards after he was caught publicly denouncing the 'dismissal' of the Ironbreaker. The charges; 'disturbing the peace' and 'inciting a riot'. Judging from the mood out in the streets, there was plenty of chance for a riot yet.\n\n"The defendant will be silent during proceedings," the Judge addressed him and Wiwurgh looked around himself as the charges kept being read out. In disgust, he shook his head at it all.\n\n"Are you proud of yourself, judge?" he asked, ignoring the banging of the gavel. "You are old enough to remember when we Imazeeb flooded over the hills to liberate you. Have you forgotten the old debts so easily that you participate in this farce?!" his voice rose as the judge yelled for him to be quiet. "Have you forgotten what the Imazeeb are capable of if you betray them?! Do you not see what you are abetting!? You are meant to keep the laws, yet are those laws letting you march your city and your people towards oblivion?! Think, you fool, think before you become the instrument of your own undoing!" He had no time to say anything more before the bailiffs seized him and gagged him.\n\nUmalez, meanwhile, sat in her study and tried to focus her mind elsewhere. Everything was in chaos, and the city needed stability. She had to recuse herself from Wiwurgh's trial! Otherwise nocreature would have any reason to believe in the law! But how could she? Wiwurgh was revered among her people, throwing him out would make things even worse! She was just about to rise up and storm away towards the court when Vasile placed a claw on her shoulder. He hadn't left the room during the proceedings either, and Umalez wanted to curse him out but bit her tongue. Who else did she even have to trust these days?"
zarantia_vasile_coup.4.a:0 "The news of the verdict soon came; expulsion to the desert."

zarantia_vasile_coup.5.t:0 "The Old Ceremonies"
zarantia_vasile_coup.5.d:0 "Umalez swung the censer back and forth, letting the smoke of the sacred igennet fill the room. She knew all the steps of the rituals, and sang the sacred hymns of the sun goddess, but she as she led the procession down the temple, she felt like a fraud. To her people, the religious rituals were absolute facts of life, moments that stood above political bickering, and yet here she was, using them to try to create peace in a Tobuck that was near ripping itself apart. She wouldn't have done it, had not Vasile given her a push.\n\nBowing her head before the altar, she struggled to not cough at the harsh, sweet smell of the igennet incense. It was overwhelming, and she had barely even tasted the tea from it before. Her body was tingling already - almost painfully so - and her vision was turning spotty. She focused as hard as she could on the ceremony, away from the recent events, away from her doubts and away from everything that crushed down on her.\n\nAnother wave of smoke came over her, and the rest of the ritual turned into an unclear blur. She recalled loose bits and pieces of it as he came to, but overall it was a confusing mess. All she knew was that she came to sitting on a footstool in the back of the temple, blinking as she saw Vasile talk to somezebra only to look towards her when she gave up a confused noise. His face quickly split in a grin and he hurried to her side, taking her hoof.\n\n"That was splendid, princess. You did great! Good work!" He shook her hoof, and Umalez smiled hesitantly. She wasn't even quite sure what she had done, but she had done a good job... that was a good thing, wasn't it? Her head was still swimming, and she felt lethargic, but she had done a good job."

zarantia_vasile_coup.6.d:0 "These silly little ceremonies were doing wonders, and Vasile could have giggled with glee at the goldmine he had discovered. Not an actual one of course, but for how it kept the tribes in line. And not only that, after she had done that whole song and dance for them, the princess was high as a kite and became completely docile. And it stayed too! It took her days to regain herself after the ceremonies, after which she did begin to become difficult again, but the answer was all too obvious.\n\nWith the Imazeeb having a massive array of different gods, all with unique rituals and traditions, the princess' schedule was swiftly becoming packed with rituals. The Imazeeb were going to have a cultural renaissance, with their old traditions coming back greater than ever under the watchful eye of the Aguellid-Priestess.\n\nThe only problem was that blasted Igennet flower. For some reason the Imazeeb were really particular about what particular drugs they used to 'come in contact with their gods', and Igennet was rare enough that it was probably the most precious commodity the tribes had. Trading for it was a near impossibility, so if he wanted to get hold of it, he'd have to get hold of it on his own.\n\nIt would be expensive, but it cost to invest in gold mines."

zarantia_vasile_coup.7.t:0 "Religious Frenzy"
zarantia_vasile_coup.7.d:0 "Hibiscus was terrified these days. She had once welcomed the Imazeeb back, but nowadays everything was just chaos. It had seemed like the tribes were planning to burn Tobuck to the ground after the death of Mekiouzza, and in the wake of it they had become frightening. Those who hadn't departed from Tobuck were angry and looked at you with suspicion, as if you might try to murder one of them as well. Why did they have to judge them all after what one desperate merchant had done!?\n\nEven worse though was the constant rituals. She didn't understand half of it, but the Imazeeb were in the throes of religious madness these days. Nary a week was passing without new rituals, and it felt like they were steadily becoming more and more violent. What at first had been prayers and songs were these days a cacophony of wild dancing and chanting, strange rituals and even sacrifices! Her old customers were largely absent these days, and the few who showed up were different."

zarantia_vasile_coup.8.t:0 "Lost In The Mists"
zarantia_vasile_coup.8.d:0 "Umalez danced around the bonfire in a haze. The Igennet had flooded her mind, and the dancing and the singing were all she could focus on. In her lucid moments, which were rarer and rarer these days, she tried to act, tried to find ways to address the divisions among her people. She went to sleep as the fumes faded from her mind, thinking that in the morning she would rise and act at once, but every time issues rose, again and again, and she felt like she was stuck in quicksand.\n\nBut not when she breathed Igennet. Igennet gave peace, and she smiled widely, feeling how her mouth did not allow her to smile wide enough. She was happy, free and safe, and she danced with her ancestors. They were all around her, shapes dancing in and out of the smoke to where it didn't matter anymore who were the ghosts and who were the other celebrants. She laughed with child-like glee as the sun goddess danced alongside her, inviting her to even wilder steps, and all the while Ijirmed coiled around her and whispered of the world's undoing.\n\nWhat was would be and what would be was, all was one and nothing, she didn't understand it, but lived in it. Coherent thoughts were long gone from her and yet she couldn't care, for she was happy."

zarantia_vasile_coup.9.d:0 "Despite recent efforts to stabilise the situation, the death of the assassin's family at the hooves of an enraged Imazeeb mob created a rift in between Tobuckians and Imazeeb, one which has steadily grown. The Imazeeb have begun refusing to walk the streets without weapons, no longer trusting that they are safe in the city, and the Tobuckians are starting to see fewer and fewer differences between the Imazeeb and the mercenaries that occupied the city after the Storm King's rampage. The accord built up during the old reign is fading fast, and things may well escalate further."

Nocreature knows who fired first, but in the end twenty-seven zebras and ponies were left dead in the streets.\n\nWhile things did not spill over into more widespread chaos, the rift this tore up between the Tobuckians and Imazeeb is immense.

To make it even worse, the forces we sent after them to be out of the way have defected, and we're now facing down not just errant tribes, but a full scale rebellion! The tribes we've bought off are still loyal, for now, but our Aguellid's authority is turning out to be not nearly what we hoped it'd be.\n\nThanks to our mercenary hiring efforts we've got at least some forces out in the field, but this isn't the post Storm King anarchy. The tribes are not in chaos like they were back then, and they're determined to see us hang."

zarantia_vasile_coup.15.d:0 "The hot air burned in her lungs, just like how the sand in her eyes and the Igennet fumes in her brain. She retched, stumbled, and the pushed herself up again as she kept running, deeper and deeper into the desert. Where and why didn't matter, she only knew that she needed to run, flee the abomination that the future of her people had turned into. How had she not seen?! How had she not understood?! And now it was all gone, choked by the slug that had nested in the heart of her mother's dream! She ran, throwing off her jewellery its weight seemed to drag her down, discarding the robes that felt like fetters around her body.\n\n"I'm sorry mother, I'm sorry!" She couldn't think straight, everything was like a dream. Around her the ancestors danced, screaming at her, asking her why she hadn't stopped it, cursing her failure. Even her mother... her mother stared her down, and Umalez couldn't meet her eyes. "Forgive me, please mama... forgive me!" she cried, even as the tears would not come. What was wrong with her!? Retching again, she felt like she needed to expel everything inside her, and her hooves beat against the desert sand, again and again, as she screamed and retched and cried.\n\nThe sound of vehicles behind her left her looking back in panic, and she broke into a sprint when she realised they were coming. She wouldn't go back, she couldn't! Her sobs and retching did not abate, and in the end her legs gave away under her again, as she pounded the sand in rage and shame. Ijirmed take them all! Ijrmed take her! Let the worm take this entire cursed world, let the thing she wove out of her mother's legacy burn!\n\n"Ijirmed take you all!" Her screams became guttural, primal, bereft of thought and reason. The soldiers leaped off their vehicles and grabbed her, yelling at each other to get ropes to tie her up and drag her back. She kicked and bit, feeling blood in her mouth and not even knowing whose it was as the world spun around her. Angry shouts turned panicked, a couple of them let her go, yet Umalez only kept fighting. Ijirmed take them all!\n\nIt was there that she heard the rumble, realised her hooves were sinking into the sands, and then the world exploded."

Why had he even shoved all these resources to keep that useless mare high and compliant if she couldn't even get those tribals to sit still and behave?!\n\nThe countryside was on fire, the tribals were coming for his head, and he was officially tired of this stupid city. It was time to do it the old fashioned way; strip everything of value and flee while he still had the chance. If they wanted their city back, they could have it, but he would have his due first. For now though, he needed time, all the time he could get.\n\nSome frantic phone calls and orders had been sent out and the armouries were being opened. They'd plaster the city with propaganda about how 'the murderous savages were coming to kill them all' and start conscripting ponies to 'protect the city'. Between them, the bought off tribes and his mercenaries, he'd have time enough to clear the city out... hopefully."

zarantia_vasile_coup.17.d:0 "The fighting could be heard in the distance as Vasile hurried towards the harbour and the fast ship that was waiting for him there. The last weeks had been the most stressful in his life, and he was pretty certain he had taken a year or two off his life as it stood. Yet it all had worked out nicely enough. The ship was packed with artefacts and gold, ostensibly placed there to keep them out of the hooves of the tribals, and its fuel tanks were filled to the brim.\n\nHe couldn't say that this was what he had hoped for, but then again you won some and you lost some. He'd at least come out of this with a good retirement fund, or possibly money enough for new investments, and that was not too shabby considering the circumstances. Not that it had been easy, between the fighting, unrest and - after a while - that drugged out mare's whining for more 'rituals', he had had more than one moment where it seemed like it all would collapse. That was the problem with controlling creatures with drugs, after a while they became loyal to it and not you. Oh well, she wasn't his problem anymore!\n\nStepping on board the ship, he nodded to the sailor that greeted him and offered to take his bags and relinquished them. As the gangway was pulled in and the ship began its departure from the city, he leaned against the railing and took out a cigar. He had planned to smoke it when his control over the city had become total, but that wasn't going to happen. Still, the millions he had squirrelled away in the hold right now did call for at least some kind of celebration he thought, lighting it."

It seemed as though our efforts to divide the tribes had paid off, and with the hoofful of tribes that we could buy off on our side, we were safe, at least until last night.\n\nOut of nowhere, nearly every last of the tribals packed their stuff and left. The entire coast is being emptied of zebras, and in the cases where our border patrols tried to stop them, the tribals shot their way out. If we wanted to ensure that we didn't have to deal with the tribes again, that has certainly happened, but the circumstances are beyond suspicious."

The perpetrators we've managed to corner have cut their throats rather than to be captured alive.\n\nThey have been ponies, zebras, a couple of griffons even, and the only thing that they have in common is that their bodies are covered in weird tattoos that have been identified as being that of the Zarantian mortuary cult. For some reason, these grave tenders have gone insane and are causing all the damage they can. The question is why, and there's a sense that we won't like the answer."

Even if you could bring such a beast down, it would not earn you honour but rather exile, for their passage brings the sacred Igennet flowers to the desert, through which those blessed with its taste can glimpse the gods. They are eternal, their wrath endless and their gifts priceless, and when they sing, the Imazeeb know the world will end.\n\nSlowly swaying as it towered above the zebras, the titanic worm filled the air with its rumbling lament together with the priests that encircled it. Other priests walked among the gathered crowds, holding baskets into which the tribeszebras threw their jewellery and their adornments, stripping themselves down to merely their robes in the way of mourners but for one exception; they were all armed. As the last zebra discarded his necklace and his rings, the mighty worm reared up high, its three jaws slowly opening as it looked out over the crowds. Gasps of horror and disbelief came from them, along with cries of denial or realization. Yet it all was drowned out as the worm, against all they knew, spoke.\n\n"Behold your past, the false roads you walked, and behold where they led you." The voice was not one but a thousand, all speaking in accord as its breath washed over them, overwhelming them with the acrid, sweet smell of Igennet. "The mirage has faded, and as you see, you understand. Aguellid broken, hopes crushed, trust betrayed, future murdered, rotting and left to the sand. So kill, Imazeeb, walk the bloody path, and bury the false world that would undo you. Die, and die as yourselves. End the broken world, and may the ashes bear the fruits of a new one.""

zarantia_worm.10.d:0 "The earth rent asunder beneath the entrenched soldiers, sending earth and bodies both flying in all directions. Shocked and terrified screams were drowned out by the deafening roar of the elder worm that rose from below. The vines of its mouth lashed out and captured several soldiers mid-air to tear them into its massive jaws where rows upon rows of teeth awaited. Landing with a deafening crash that kicked up even more dust from the buildings crushed beneath its humongous body, the worm thrashed and roared to send creatures, artillery and buildings all flying. Further away, another explosion came, then another and yet another as the titans rose from below to rip and tear at everything in the area.\n\nPanic set in within moments, the soldiers staring up in horror at the giants before them before turning and running away. The few who stood by their guns watched the shells explode impotently against several feet of ancient chitin, and only provoking their target to turn straight onto them. Leaping with seemingly impossible agility, the worm came crashing down on the artillery pieces and devoured them and their crews in moments.\n\nThe elder ones kept up their savage dance, and in death and destruction and chaos, they remade the world. As their dance ended, weeks later, nothing was left but a wasteland of churned up earth and the shattered pieces of whatever had thought it could stand in their way."

zarantia_worm.11.t:0 "Procession of the Worm Queen"
zarantia_worm.11.d:0 "The most sacred act of the faithful is to break apart the old world, tear down the false idols of technology and modernity, and leave its victims purified. By worm and by zebra, by hoof and by bomb, by pickaxe and by rope we pull and tear, ripping down every piece of this cursed age and scatter it to the wind. All that which we can use to further the great cause is spirited away to be put to use, all that isn't will be ground to ashes, and the worm queen's song will echo across the cleansed lands to quell those who would fight us in desperation. Our procession is inexorable, absolute, and the fires that spread in its wake will be the soil from which new life shall emerge."
zarantia_worm.11.a:0 "They will not understand, but they will be made free."

zarantia_worm.12.t:0 "The Final Withering"
zarantia_worm.12.d:0 "The fires were dying, the chaos of war coming to an end, and over the world a stillness settled.\n\nRearing high above her faithful, the goddess watched them in silence, seeing the thousands upon thousands of warriors who surrounded her. Her blessings had long since overwhelmed them, leaving them as pure extensions of her will, and she wept for them. Imazeeb, Tobuckians, Chiropterrans, Warzenans, Colthaginians or any of myriad other peoples did not matter. They had all done their part, and now their song was at an end. It was time to let them sleep.\n\nHer mouth opened to let the final song spill forth. All around her, the faithful slowly laid down to listen to her, their eyes glazing over as the goddess ended it. The call reverberated through the earth, wurm after wurm beginning to sing, and as they did they left the faithful to at last be released from their service. They had done all they had been asked to, and could now enter the cycle of rebirth as well.\n\nOnly in the lands where the worm queen had first awakened did the faithful stay, turning their tools onto the tainted machinery that had driven their efforts, disassembling them and destroying the last remnants of the broken world's darkness before joining their kin.\n\nWith the end of her song, the worm queen wept still, and her mouth slowly closed as she along with the worms burrowed themselves down deep, deep into the earth to sleep. Maybe one day the world would need them again, but until then, they would sleep."
zarantia_worm.12.a:0 "And in the ruins, the survivors slowly emerged to a purified world."

zarantia_worm.13.t:0 "The Liar's Due"
zarantia_worm.13.d:0 "The beaten and battered Vasile cel Tradat was pulled through the crowd by four zebras, each carrying one limb. His wings and beak were both broken, and he struggled weakly against them before being dumped on the ground. Moaning in pain, he tried to push himself up as a shadow fell over him. Looking up in confusion, he froze when he saw it.\n\nTowering high above him, a gigantic Tatzlwurm stared down at him. Its three jaws opened wide, revealing rows of fangs, its vine-like, prehensile tongues and most of all, a sight that left in paralysed with fear and shock and horror.\n\n"Liar-spawn, corruptor and carrion feeder, behold your work." The giant worm's voice, a thousand voices speaking in a dissonant chorus, spoke to him before one of its tongues lashed out and captured him by the throat. Hoisting him into the air as he struggled against the vine, the wurm pulled him in closer. Its breath washed over him, and he coughed, trying to get air. "Your greed and ambition birthed the cleansing, corruption to purging, lies to enlightenment, greed to freedom. You played your part, now be rewarded." With that, the still choking Vasile was pulled into the massive creature's mouth, meeting row after row of gnashing teeth. In his final moments, before the crunching was the last thing he heard, he would have given anything to undo what he had done."
zarantia_worm.13.a:0 "The liar has been dealt with."

zarantia_worm.14.t:0 "The Marvel"
zarantia_worm.14.d:0 "Towering high above the army that surrounded it, the Worm Queen swayed back and forth as it gazed out across the sea, to where other lands were. She-who-was-Umalez remembered stories and tales, books read sitting by mama's side of the great things that lay there, the magical and wonderful - now revealed to be debased and twisted like all other things.\n\n"Stand and watch, wait and tend to," she spoke, her disciples all looking up at her. "The Garden of Igennet, pure and free, grows as is tended. Tainted waves beat fruitlessly against the shores. We watch and wait, we return home, we rest." In silence, the crowds around her realised what she meant, and soon cheers erupted. The wars were over, the Worm Queen had called for it all to end. They would finally rest, after months and years of fighting it was over!\n\nAs the thousands cheered, the Worm Queen, she-who-was-Umalez, wept. The last flickers of old dreams and hopes were dying inside her, and soon there would be only the Worm Queen. She barely even remembered why she didn't want to continue this great work to cleanse the land, but that last sliver held her back. She looked back at the garden behind her, the garden where the disease that had taken everything would never again be allowed to come. It was clean, it was pure, and maybe it would be enough to quell the ancient rage that drove her. She could sweep the world, end the taint wherever she found it, but the last vestiges of what she was in her were tired. The goddess prayed that the world would take her mercy, begged that this was it, for if it was not, there would be no second chance for any of what she knew of."

zarantia_worm.15.t:0 "The Azir Tribes"
zarantia_worm.15.d:0 "From their distant homes far away in the Zebhara, the tribes of Azir have finally rallied to the side of the Worm Queen. Scattered across the desert, they've observed their own rituals and gathered in their own ways. They never suffered the betrayal of Tobuck and have not suffered under its foreign puppet master, yet they too now come to our side."

 zarantia_socialist.1.t:0 "The Red Banners Rise!"
 zarantia_socialist.1.d:0 "In the depths of Zarantia, the Imazeeb have watched the events of the last years in disgust. Mekiouzza's reforms, already overreaching and impopular, have mutated into something truly vile. Even those who once showed loyalty to the Aguellid's cause cannot deny what is plainly before them: Mekiouzza's dream lies dead, strangled to death by the foreigner who holds the leash of her daughter and who has clasped an iron grip on the city of Tobuck.\n\nYet in the city of Shizra, far from the eyes of the foreigners, the reaction is growing, as the chieftess Izemrasen Tjenwitt has gathered the tribes in revolt against the Aguellid and against the foreign bastards that have degraded and insulted them all. No more Ageullids, no more talk of 'progress' and 'development' and no more putting their fates in the hooves of that blasted city!\n\nUniting under the Red Banners, the tribes call out in anger to defend what is theirs and to tear back control of their fates. In a callback to the olden days before the Aguellid, Izemrasen has claimed the title of Amhaddi - protector - and sworn to step down the instant that her services to her people are no longer needed. Like countless people across the world - the Severyanians, the Coltvans, the Brodfeldians - the Imazeeb rise against those distant tyrants who would oppress them, secure in their knowledge that they stand as one united people, and that they will be the ones who decide their fates."
 zarantia_socialist.1.a:0 "Rise Imazeeb, and retake your homes!"

 zarantia_socialist.2.t:0 "Land Of The Free Zebras"
 zarantia_socialist.2.d:0 "The winds swept across the desert, whipping up the sand to dance across the dunes in swirling patterns. In the light of the setting sun, it was beautiful, but more than that it was the way things were meant to be. Izemrasen knew that as far as the eye could see and beyond, the Imazeeb were free and dignified. They were in charge of their fates, and no foreigner or tyrant would ever tell them what to do. Their teachings stayed at the borders, and the Imazeeb chose what they wanted to let in. More than anything, the industrialisation and the attempts to destroy their ways of life was driven off and never would be allowed to set one hoof in these lands.\n\nTurning around, she walked down towards the camp further down the dune, hidden from the winds. Families sat at the camp fires, singing and playing music as they prepared their evening meals just as they had for centuries and would do for centuries still. A group of foals ran past her in one of their wild games, foals who never would have to doubt who they were or how they were meant to live. She smiled as she reached her tent, where her daughter was sitting by the fire preparing dinner, and she kissed her daughter - at last safe from the ravages of the foreign ideas - on the forehead. As they portioned out the food to eat - her once slaves eating with her as family - she looked to the depths of the tent where a pitiful figure lay curled up.\n\n"Go fetch her," she told her son, who obliged and patiently coaxed the ragged, starved mare out to sit with them. The mare's gaze was empty, and she walked like a sleepwalker. "Come, eat now," Izemrasen urged the pitiful Umalez. "That foreign rat will never touch you again. Eat..." she filled her spoon and raised it to the mare's lips. Though it took some more coaxing, Umalez did eat some in the end, and Izemrasen smiled. "You are safe. Nozebra will threaten you again, things are as they should be. All will be well." She stroked the hair of the broken mare to comfort her. Things were as they should be, and all would be well."

 zarantia_socialist.3.t:0 "Justice At Last"
 zarantia_socialist.3.d:0 "The bastard who pulled the strings of the broken Aguellid has been captured. True to his nature, he was in the process of stripping Tobuck bare of wealth, even as his soldiers were fighting and dying to protect him. He planned to flee, and leave his dupes and his cronies to take the fall for his actions. The realisation of just how low this wretch could sink stands all too clear to us, not the least since we've found Umalez Ataghan, or rather what is left of her.\n\nThe mare whom we once knew as a scholar of our traditions and history is now little more than a mindless drug addict, and she didn't even understand what was going on as we entered her chambers. All she could do was beg for us to let her perform the rituals. She drank too deep of the sacred Igennet, and it extracted a terrifying price from her. Several chieftains have insisted that she should be put down, that it would be a kindness to end her wretched state and to remember the scholar, and not the wailing madzebra that was left behind. Izemrasen however has proclaimed that she will protect Umalez, and that she will ensure that she can come back from the injuries inflicted on her mind.\n\nThe thieving animal who caused all this - meanwhile - will be dealt with in the old way, and is being taken deep into the desert where he will be buried up to his neck and left for Ijirmed to find. We could inflict a thousand more horrors on him, but even a century of torture would not be due payment for what he has done. Instead, let the gods judge him."
 zarantia_socialist.3.a:0 "Their judgement will be severe."

 zarantia_socialist.4.t:0 "The Pitiable"
 zarantia_socialist.4.d:0 "As we stormed Tobuck, true vengeance was denied us. The bastard who caused all this has slipped out of our reach, fleeing with the city's gold and artefacts and leaving his cronies to take the fall. It seems he managed to spite us all one last time, and though many of our warriors have sworn to pursue him even across the sea, we are for now left picking up the pieces of the ruins he left behind.\n\nThe worst thing of all that he left behind was what is left of Umalez Ataghan. We knew her as a scholar of our people's history and lore, but what we found was a drug-addled madzebra, deep in the grips of addiction to the sacred Igennet. She is so far gone that she did not even understand what was going on as her quarters were stormed, and all she could do was wail that she needed to perform the rituals and beg us to fetch Vasile. Her desperate screams were enough to send shivers down the spines of even the most hardened warriors. Had it not been for the intervention of Izemrasen herself, who claimed Umalez as her ward and said she would watch over the crazed mare's recovery, she would likely have been killed as an act of mercy. Few of us can see how a broken life like that can be worth living, and death seems a kindness, yet she has stood firm. With that, the war is over, and we are free of the foreign puppetmaster and his puppet Aguellid."

 ZAR_the_desert_queen_desc:0 "The story of Zarantia is the story of Mekiouzza Ataghan. No zebra before her has managed to bring the Imazeeb tribes together like she did, and during her long life she has become a legend. Yet, the Storm King's rampage and the loss of Tobuck shattered the hope of her twilight years being peaceful."

 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck:0 "The Rat Of Tobuck"
 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was the crown jewel of Zarantia, and the Equestrian that now occupies it is a blight. Yet, he has the backing of powerful warlords, as evident by the fate of those warriors who first rushed to dislodge them. The already weakened Imazeeb are in no position to fight a war, and the pen must rule."

 ZAR_choosing_to_hope:0 "Choosing To Hope"
 ZAR_choosing_to_hope_desc:0 "The Equestrian has given his promise, and unless rivers of blood are spilled, the city remains in his grip either way. Trusting his word and remaining on as good terms as possible with him may well be the best hope the weakened Imazeeb have."

 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud:0 "Appeasing The Amsarmud"
 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud_desc:0 "The Amsarmud are Mekiouzza's most fierce servants, but their loyalty is tied to their honour. The choice to tolerate the Tobuckian intruders robs them of vengeance for our fallen kin, and they are making their voices heard."

 ZAR_reminding_the_rats_desc:0 "Tobuck is Zarantian by right, and Pea Shooter is a thief and a rat. He shall know his place, and though we are not charging in right now, our warriors wait just beyond the border. A step, a word, a single breath in the wrong direction, and he shall face our fury."

 ZAR_merchant_objections:0 "Merchant Objections"
 ZAR_merchant_objections_desc:0 "Many of our people still have ties to the ponies of Tobuck, and trade is still flowing to some extent. Mekiouzza's threats have ruptured this, as any Imazeeb approaching Tobuck now faces not just scrutiny, but hostility."

 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks:0 "The City Of Brooks"
 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks_desc:0 "Agzhat was never more than a gathering place for the tribes, yet with Mekiouzza's ascension it became so much more. It has become a city in its own right, and foreign traders and interests are coming there now that Tobuck is not accessible. Though it is lesser than our lost capital, it serves us dutifully."

 ZAR_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 ZAR_the_old_ways_desc:0 "To an outside observer, the Imazeeb are an eternal and unchanging fixture of the Zebhara, one that stays true to their ways no matter how the wind blows.

 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale:0 "The Sword Or The Scale"
 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are a warlike people, the desert breeds a hardy people, but they are also traders and caravaneers who have earned a living crossing the Zebhara and carrying goods for whoever needs their services."

 ZAR_a_settling_people:0 "A Settling People"
 ZAR_a_settling_people_desc:0 "Nomadism is not some inherent trait of the Imazeeb, it is a way to eke out a living in these harsh lands. Many tribes, especially in the north, have been settled for centuries.

 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "Unlike the Colthaginian senate or the Maregyptian pharaoh, no Imazeeb leader rules without the consent of the tribal leaders. Mekiouzza has not forgotten this, and she has invited them all for a grand meeting to hear them and to reaffirm their oaths to her."

 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker:0 "Chief Ironbreaker"
 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker_desc:0 "No tribe is as martially inclined as the Amsarmud, and no Amsarmud as able as Zawgha. On orders from Mekiouzza, she went to Colthage to gather all those Imazeeb who served there as mercenaries and to curry favour among our old clients. Much Imazeeb blood has been spilled for the Colthaginians. Hopefully they will honour this."

 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebharan Trade"
 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade_desc:0 "The Storm King's rampage left the Trans-Zebharan trade devastated, and it is a shadow of what it once was. It will take years for it to grow back if it is not helped along. By Mekiouzza's word and efforts, the caravans shall be restored greater than ever before."

 ZAR_messages_to_azir:0 "Assuaging The Azir Tribes"
 ZAR_messages_to_azir_desc:0 "The Azir tribes are a breed of their own, and the Imazeeb know well that if you wish to traverse their lands, you will respect them. Gifts of peace will help them overlook our trespasses, and extra precautions among the caravans will lower the risk of incidents."

 ZAR_muster_guards:0 "Muster Guards"
 ZAR_muster_guards_desc:0 "The Zebhara is a place of a thousand perils, from raiders to monsters, and the zebras who take on the duties of the caravans must be up to the task. Those who buy our services pay well for our protection, and we will not let them down."

 ZAR_our_desert:0 "Our Desert"
 ZAR_our_desert_desc:0 "For centuries, the Imazeeb have not only survived but even thrived in lands that others find too harsh. Part of the key has been to never simply accept the desert for what it is. It can become more, and whether it will take years or decades, the Imazeeb are patient."

 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes:0 "A Hundred Tribes"
 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's greatest achievement is, and will always be, the fact that she created a measure of true unity among her people. Even after recent events this unity is weakened, but not broken, and it will be enough to ensure that when she is gone, her daughter is accepted by them."

 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering:0 "Rising Up Once More"
 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering_desc:0 "The Storm King caused untold suffering among the Imazeeb, yet they did what they always had and adapted.

 ZAR_new_year_new_hope:0 "New Year, New Hope"
 ZAR_new_year_new_hope_desc:0 "The fall of Tobuck was Zarantia's darkest hour, but as always, we weathered the storm, dusted ourselves off and rose once more. We shall return to Tobuck once more, and we shall continue to build our future."

 ZAR_warrior_pride:0 "A Warrior's Pride"
 ZAR_warrior_pride_desc:0 "Beyond duty and beyond honour, beyond all the reasons to fight, lies a pure and simple desire to not lose. To be Imazeeb is to persevere against all that the desert throws at you. To be a warrior, is to persevere no matter what your foe attempts."

 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to her."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite Or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered. The price if we fail is too high."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For My People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush Those Who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe Of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult deals."
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals And Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure The Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud leader Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best And Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths Of Mutual Defence"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many tribal leader are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, Mekiouzza has suggested that instead they will choose representatives to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

 ZAR_issue_of_land:0 "The Issue Of Land"
 ZAR_issue_of_land_desc:0 "It is from the land that our riches are gathered and grown, and from where the people stem. It is such a shame that the land is either held by absentee lords or lies fallow with no owner. To begin the path to modernity, this must be fixed."
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck:0 "Our Own Tobuck"
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was a crutch to our nation's economy, and overreliance on it will not be a mistake we will repeat. Through investment, internal and external, we will carve a new jewel within our land."
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes:0 "Settling Land Disputes"
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes_desc:0 "One problem with land are the ancient disputes over who owns which land, or if it is owned in the first place. The traditional ways of handling these issues have proven futile. Modern methods are needed to work these problems out."

 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors_desc:0 "Even if we do not have the know-how that we need to continue our march towards a modern society, other nations and their people have. Gold is a powerful motivator, and some can be swayed to apply the white heat of technology to Zarantia."
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless:0 "Land For The Landless"
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless_desc:0 "The final step of the land reform is to grant what land that is available to tenant farmers and those who do not stand to inherit land. A new land of smallholders and independent farmers, where it is not just a small class of lords that take all the profit."

 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth_desc:0 "Where some see desolate wastes, we see opportunity. Riches beyond our dreams lie beneath the sands, and they are waiting for those worthy to use them as they see fit. We will find them, and we will use it for the betterment of Zarantia."

 ZAR_schooling_for_all_desc:0 "Everything is founded on thoughts and brains.

Tomorrow's battles will be faced by minds, not muscles."
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains:0 "Hammers To Break Their Chains"
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains_desc:0 "Slavery is not only a weight to our economical potential, but a historical debt towards out people, for it has no place for a Zarantia that desires to grow. What only remains is to discuss how we will abolish this rot to our society."
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road:0 "The Trans-Zarantian Road"
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road_desc:0 "Everything needs a place to be. The hammer needs the nail, the fuel the engine. And roads are how it gets there. It is no good having the parts if they cannot come together. A road is sorely needed."
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck:0 "The Second Tobuck"
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck_desc:0 "Foreign investments, labour and trade flows through Agzhat's markets and factories like water, the rough diamond not only turned into an oasis, but as one of the finest jewels of our homeland. Our work to bring Zarantia to the modern age is far from over, but there's no shame in taking a moment to gaze upon our works."


 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert:0 "The Rules Of The Desert"
 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have lived in these lands for centuries through countless toils and hardships. Why should this time be any different? These traditions and customs have not steered the tribes wrong before and they will not this time. It must be ensured that they are enshrined in law to preserve and refine them."
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws:0 "Tribal Support Laws"
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws_desc:0 "The building block of Imazeeb society is the tribe. Before Zarantia and all else is the tribe. As such, laws must be enacted to ensure that the tribes can take care of themselves and take care of their own, even if it comes at the expense of the state as a whole."
 ZAR_division_of_labour:0 "The Division Of Labour"
 ZAR_division_of_labour_desc:0 "While such a term like "division of labour" may seem out of place among the Imazeeb, it is not. All must do their part to ensure their community runs smoothly and all are provided for. By codifying existing traditions regarding labour, we can ensure small communities continue to operate smoothly."
 ZAR_everyzebras_right:0 "Everyzebra's Right"
 ZAR_everyzebras_right_desc:0 "All creatures yearn to be free, and zebras are no different. By putting zebras in chains, we violate that natural urge. On top of this, slave labour is proving inadequate for producing the complex machinery and tools used in modern methods. As such, slavery in its current form will be incrementally abolished and all slaves allowed to live (and more importantly work) as they please."
 ZAR_internal_trade:0 "Internal Trade"
 ZAR_internal_trade_desc:0 "While all the people may need is within our borders, it does not mean everyzebra can easily access them. By encouraging trade and caravans between villages and tribes, all will be able to benefit from our wealth and focus on the development of their own communities."
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops:0 "The Thousand Workshops"
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops_desc:0 "We do not need the massive, towering and dirty factories of the citydwellers.

 ZAR_national_apprenticeships:0 "National Apprenticeships"
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships_desc:0 "Apprenticeships and masters teaching new tradezebras is a fairly common method of expanding skilled labour here and elsewhere in the world.

 ZAR_duty_to_aid:0 "A Duty To Aid"
 ZAR_duty_to_aid_desc:0 "While we may not have the extensive handouts and welfare of our urban neighbours, we are not heartless. Everyzebra falls on hard times once in a while, and it is the duty of everyzebra in the community to help lift them up. Likewise, we should show hospitality and generosity to strangers of our tribes. Let us turn no pony, zebra, or otherwise away if they are in need."

 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own_desc:0 "While this may seem like a loose union, it is still a strong one within.

 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come to retake Tobuck. Pea Shooter might be gone, but his former allies still infest the city and they have made it clear they will not surrender it. So bet it then. Like we did fifty years ago, we will free Tobuck by force of arms and teach the thieves the price of crossing us."
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed:0 "Tobuck Reclaimed"
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed_desc:0 "In the end, the gun runners' threats and boasts were nothing more than bluffs and empty banter. Once again, our armies claim Tobuck and reunite us with long lost brothers and sisters. Small pockets of resistance are still being found across the region, but for the time being, the Zarantia flag can pridefully fly against Tobuck's skies!"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges:0 "Tobuckian Pledges"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges_desc:0 "While the population and the armies celebrate in the streets, our scribes wage another battle, not by weapons, but in pen and paper.

 ZAR_restoring_old_routes:0 "Restoring The Old Routes"
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes_desc:0 "It seems the Gun Runners' last spiteful bark at us was to blow up the roads and bridges that connected our cities. No matter, routes can be rebuilt and retraced, and those who destroyed them are gone."
 ZAR_emerald_fields:0 "The Emerald Fields"
 ZAR_emerald_fields_desc:0 "Tobuck is a great city, but it's countryside hold an equal treasure in its verdant fields. Now that Tobuck is finally back under our control, we can at last reestablish the plantations that provided so much prosperity for us."
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge:0 "Tobuckian Knowledge"
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge_desc:0 "The swindlers and thieves left behind a vast wealth of knowledge after we drove them from our city. It would be folly to allow it to go to waste. As such, we must collect it up and replicate it so that we may instead bend the tools of the greedy for the good of all."
 ZAR_open_for_business:0 "Open For Business"
 ZAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "As the last pockets of resistance are dealt with, and the last negotiations and pledges are made, the trading port of Tobuck is finally open for business once more! West, East or beyond, Zarantia welcomes all!"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city:0 "Taking Stock Of The City"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city_desc:0 "The retaking of Tobuck was costly to both our warriors and the city itself.

Who knows, maybe they will stumble on something we missed before?"
 ZAR_learning_from_change:0 "Learning From Change"
 ZAR_learning_from_change_desc:0 "The world is changing fast, and the events of the last years proved that we haven't caught up. We must redouble our efforts to learn and adapt to the changing times, for the next time we may not have the opportunity to."
 ZAR_offer_assurances:0 "Offer Assurances To The People"
 ZAR_offer_assurances_desc:0 "Though those that collaborated with our enemy deserve neither pity nor mercy, we must not forget why we came here.

 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay:0 "The Pearl Of The Green Bay"
 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck suffered for a long time under the yoke of foreign adventurers who cared nothing for its people. Under Mekiouzza's leadership Tobuck shall be reforged into a mighty city, and a true capital of a united Zarantia." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution:0 "The Hour Of Retribution"
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution_desc:0 "Mercy has its place, but not when dealing with liars and backstabbers. Their words were worth nothing, and they have caused both us and our Tobuckian kin countless woes. For that, they will die, and their deaths will serve as a warning."

 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords_desc:0 "There is no escape for the scum who thought they could steal Tobuck from us. We will chase them to the edge of the world if we have to, and our vengeance will be terrible."
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world:0 "A Warning To The World"
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world_desc:0 "Years ago, we lost Tobuck to a band of bandits, thieves, mercenaries and cut-throats. As a flock of carrion birds they followed the Storm King there, believing they could prey on our lands undisturbed, that the Imazeeb tribes were too weak to oppose them. But now, the time has come; all shall learn the price for facing a united Zarantia!" #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong:0 "Zarantia Stands Strong"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong_desc:0 "Tobuck's defences were damaged in the fighting, but also by a general lack of maintenance. Always the fools, the Gun Runners clearly were not interested in investing in their own safety. Now that we have returned, we shall rebuild the city's bastions and turn them into impregnable forts, ready to repel any invader." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_her_lifework_restored:0 "Her Life's Work, Restored"
 ZAR_her_lifework_restored_desc:0 "A few years ago, it seemed as though Mekiouzza Ataghan's life's work would be left in ruins, but she persevered, and she triumphed. Zarantia stands stronger than ever, and Mekiouzza's authority is absolute. At last, the great Aguellid can rest."

 ZAR_the_eternal_federation_desc:0 "We weep for the Great Aguellid as we put her to rest, but in her wake is left a great void that cannot be filled by any one zebra. She was great, but now other zebras must stand together and each be a co-equal part of carrying what she carried alone."
 ZAR_zarantia_is_amsisi:0 "Zarantia Is Amsisi"
 ZAR_zarantia_is_amsisi_desc:0 "We came together as many different peoples: nomadic, settled, modernising, traditionalist, militant, mercantile, it all came together as one under the principle of Amsisi; unity not through conformity, but tolerance and mutual respect. That is Zarantia, that and nothing else, and those who claim otherwise should be viewed with suspicion."
 ZAR_first_among_equals:0 "First Among Equals"
 ZAR_first_among_equals_desc:0 "We honour Umalez Ataghan not as the daughter of the Great Aguellid, but also for her own efforts for our people. Yet like her, we have learned from her mother. She has a place of honour in the federation we build, but it is one among us, not above us."
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council:0 "An Ascendant Council"
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council_desc:0 "The seeds that were planted by the Great Aguellid are blooming, and the council she created has reached its true potential.

 ZAR_a_decentralised_system:0 "A System Without Core"
 ZAR_a_decentralised_system_desc:0 "No single thread in the carpet holds the entirety together, and so shall our homeland be built to endure no matter what single thread is cut. Should one leader fall, there is always someone else ready to rise."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state:0 "A Many-Headed State"
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state_desc:0 "The Great Aguellid's shortcoming was that she was but one zebra, and that as power flowed from her, it lessened all those around her. Zarantia is not one tribe, but many, and thus every tribal chief must be part of the leadership."
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us:0 "The Desert Belongs To Us"
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us_desc:0 "Though the desert causes our people many woes, it is also the source of our strength. The desert is a harsh mother, but so was the Great Aguellid, and she elevated us all. We must remember that the desert does the same, and as we face her and learn from her, we will be stronger for it."
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty:0 "Sharing In Modernity's Bounty"
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty_desc:0 "Though we have reaffirmed the tribes, we realise that there is no going back. Though the sword has its place, the gun is ascendant, and though the caravan fed us for centuries, the train runs faster and more tirelessly. We will continue trading for these new tools and machines, and we will build our tribes with them."
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth:0 "The Hidden Wealth"
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "New tools means new discoveries out in the wild hinterlands, and every tribe knows that it will earn a good living from the metals and minerals that are found.

 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms:0 "The Desert Storms"
 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms_desc:0 "We may not have the raw industrial power of other nations, but we have the grit and the spirit that has allowed us to thrive in even the most inhospitable of lands. Let the enemy come with their armoured cars and tanks and cannons, we will lead them through a merry dance across the dunes, and their sun-bleached bones will serve as a warning to the others who would threaten our home."
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands:0 "A Sanctuary In The Sands"
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands_desc:0 "The world is a bloody place, and countless are fleeing the ravages of war and death. We who sit in a prosperous homeland must consider that most sacred of virtues, hospitality. When you see a lost wanderer you aid them, period. The same holds true today, and just because they arrive by boats or refugee caravans, they are no less lost."
 ZAR_friends_abroad:0 "Friends Abroad"
 ZAR_friends_abroad_desc:0 "We may be watchful, but we are not hostile. Those who show honour and act honestly are worthy of respect, whether Imazeeb or not, and as the night draws close, one cannot have enough friends."
 ZAR_facing_the_future_focus:0 "Facing The Future"
 ZAR_facing_the_future_focus_desc:0 "Though the Imazeeb have changed, we have changed on our terms. We learned from the highest of us, and rose to stand as tall as her. We don't know what the future will hold, but we know that we had a good teacher, who would not accept us failing."
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes:0 "Among The Dunes, Deliverance"
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb's greatest moment was when it swept forth from the desert to deliver the oppressed people of Tobuck. They cried out for deliverance, and we gave it. As the world grows darker, we remember this creed, and we listen. Should the oppressed and enslaved cry out, we will hear them, and we will come."

 ZAR_finding_allies:0 "Finding Allies"
 ZAR_finding_allies_desc:0 "Between our strategic position and the wealth that rests beneath the desert, we are not only strong, but we are also wealthy. Zarantia is a friend that many nations would be happy to have, and we're more than happy to formalise this."
 ZAR_the_march_of_progress:0 "The March Of Progress"
 ZAR_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Time and tide waits for no mare. We have only started to build a strong and prosperous Zarantia, and instead of resting on our laurels, we need to launch ourselves forwards, and use the wealth we've gained to speed up our efforts."
 ZAR_settling_the_coast:0 "Settling The Coast"
 ZAR_settling_the_coast_desc:0 "With the recent chaos, the Tobuckian countryside is not nearly as populated as it should be, and we have an opportunity here.

 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads:0 "The Zarantian Railroads"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads_desc:0 "Trains are loud, noisy, complicated and utterly wonderful. Hundreds of tonnes of cargo, easily enough for a great caravan, all carried at speeds we couldn't even dream of. This is more than a vehicle, it is the key to Zarantia's trading future!"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century:0 "New Century, New Laws"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century_desc:0 "A changing society demands changing laws. What exact taxes are we supposed to apply to electronic devices? How low can the airplanes that now cross our skies fly? How shall we treat patents? There's much to decide on here."
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen:0 "Honouring The Greatest Aguellid"
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza Ataghan was more than an Aguellid. She was the founding mother of Zarantia, the liberator of Tobuck and the one who elevated the Imazeeb. As our capital grows it might not change name, but it will be shaped in her memory."
 ZAR_amsisi_laws:0 "Deeply Rooted Amsisi"
 ZAR_amsisi_laws_desc:0 "The guiding principle of our nation is and will always remain that of Amsisi, and it has become an obvious concept. The tribe is not the end-all, be-all, and friends or foes are as easily found beyond it."
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol:0 "The Desert Patrol"
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol_desc:0 "Traditionally, the tribes have kept watch over their lands of the desert, but as these old duties are laid to rest, we need something else. The solution will be the Desert Patrol, an elite force of militarised police that will be equipped to watch over and keep order across the entirety of the Zebhara."
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court:0 "The Zarantian Court"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court_desc:0 "Around the queen of Zarantia, a vast organisation of civil servants and bureaucrats is emerging, one that will need to be tied closely to the rest of the nation if the queen is to be able to continue her duties to the people."
 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants:0 "The Buckharan Supplicants"
 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants_desc:0 "The Buckharans are a strange people, and for the longest time, we've been content to mind our affairs while they mind theirs. Still, they are distant kin of the Imazeeb all the same, and they've come before Umalez with their heads bowed."
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad:0 "The Trans-Zebharan Railroad"
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad_desc:0 "The Zebhara has been an eternal barrier, a line across the map that divides north and south Zebrica, and the edges of it thrive off the trade that can flow past it. Yet now, the technological progress of recent years makes the impossible possible; a great road of iron cutting straight through it."
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara:0 "Liberating Buckhara"
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara_desc:0 "The Buckharans call, and we answer. If their overlords maintain their right to rule over them, we will show them that though the Imazeeb have changed, their ferocity has not."
 ZAR_the_crossroad_kingdom:0 "The Crossroad Kingdom"
 ZAR_the_crossroad_kingdom_desc:0 "For a long time, the lands of the Imazeeb were seen as distant frontiers far from civilisation. Yet now, in the marriage between the Imazeeb and Tobuck and between sea and desert, we stand tall and proud as one people in a nation we built together."

 ZAR_crowned_by_death_desc:0 "My enemies lie dead around me, and those who would have denied me my rightful seat are broken. My mother's final lesson was harsh, but it was one I needed to learn. Through war, death and destruction do I sit here; anointed by blood and crowned by death."
 ZAR_violence_is_authority:0 "Authority Through Violence"
 ZAR_violence_is_authority_desc:0 "Violence is how authority is kept. If you cannot defend what is yours, thieves and invaders will take it from you.

 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance:0 "Reaching For Dominance"
 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance_desc:0 "Zarantia's fate is forged by one zebra, and the nation must be an extension of her will. My mother realised, almost too late, that the bartering and dealing that all Aguellids had engaged in prior to this left them weak. I will not make the same mistake."
 ZAR_tightening_the_grip:0 "Tightening The Grip"
 ZAR_tightening_the_grip_desc:0 "The more those who would refuse my authority struggle, the harder my hoof will press down on them. They have already seen the price of defiance, and if they choose to continue struggling they prove that they will never have a place in Zarantia."

 ZAR_the_black_gold_desc:0 "Deep beneath our sands lies something more precious than gold, gems or even crystals. Oil; the life-blood of the new century. For Zarantia to prosper, we must tap the great deposits within our lands, so that they might fuel the machine of progress."
 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did.

Still, many wonder if depending to foreign expertise is truly a wise choice."
 ZAR_the_oil_fund:0 "The Oil Fund"
 ZAR_the_oil_fund_desc:0 "Oil brings wealth; wealth, however, is always accompanied by greed. The creation of specific institutions will help us prevent the concentration of wealth in the hooves of the few. Resources will be allocated to projects beneficial to all."

 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture:0 "New Methods Of Agriculture"
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture_desc:0 "For a long time, our food production was held back by harsh environment and rudimentary techniques. This will no longer be the case; in exchange for our oil, foreign nations are ready to share with us not only their expertise, but tractors and industrial fertilisers as well. Our people will never go hungry again."

 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure_desc:0 "Long pipelines of steel now snake across our lands, delivering the precious black gold to newly-built plants in a constant flow.

 ZAR_boomtimes:0 "Boomtimes"
 ZAR_boomtimes_desc:0 "Oil has brought great wealth to us, and we wisely spread it amongst the many rather than the few. Hospitals, schools, and infrastructures have been built, and our people can now enjoy exotic products from distant lands. Zarantia has changed and, thankfully, for the better."

 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting_desc:0 "We can now expand our extraction operations to a degree never seen before. Thanks to the constant efforts of our tireless prospector teams, new deposits are been discovered each month. Not a stone will be left unturned."
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society:0 "Modern Science And Society"
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society_desc:0 "As more and more complex machines are introduced, we can no longer depend on the experience of foreign experts. Curriculums must be revised and new specialised schools opened for eager young minds. There, Zarantia's future will truly take form."

 ZAR_no_remorse_no_retreat_desc:0 "This is not a mere conflict over lands or wealth or honour, and we have to discard any notions that we should back down if the challenge is too great. We WILL die in this conflict, the question is simply how, and how many we take with us."
 ZAR_people_at_war:0 "A People At War"

 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia_desc:0 "Tobuck is tainted and needed to go, but the people within were slaves to the falsehoods it represented just like we were. We shall scatter them among the tribes, and they will come to hear the song of the gods as well. In the end, we shall become one after all."

 ZAR_tobuck_burning_desc:0 "With this act, we settle the old scores utterly, and teach the old, tainted world the final lesson our people's honour demanded that we teach it. This city that caused so much strife and so much contention is no more, and nobody remains to recreate it."

 ZAR_tending_the_garden_desc:0 "The lands around us will be purified, and we shall restore them to what they should have been. The twisted machinery and gold hunger that's driven the people of these lands have made them insane, but resting in the great garden will give them sanity back."

 ZAR_feeding_the_creation_desc:0 "The flame that burns the brightest is snuffed out all the faster for it, and though our duty is to break down the taint of these lands and remake it, harsh words and rocks will not avail us in this struggle.

 tatzelwurm_equipment_0_desc:0 "Solitary and violently protective of its roaming grounds, the Tatzlwurm can move with immense speed for its size and even leap high out of the earth to snatch prey out of the sky. Though it often goes after smaller creatures, it will not hesitate to attack even bigger monsters if its territory has been disturbed"

 tatzelwurm_equipment_1:0 "Elder Tatzlwurm"
 tatzelwurm_equipment_1_desc:0 "Usually hibernating deep in the earth, ancient Tatzlwurms have no theoretical upper limit on size and will grow as long as they can find nourishment. This usually presents few issues, as they are given to conserve their energy, but if roused to anger they are a threat like few others"

 ZAR_the_world_is_sick:0 "The World Is Sick, Slowly Rotting Away..."
 ZAR_the_world_is_sick_desc:0 "Across the world this disease has spread, dispossessing millions and cowing them not under tribe or family, but under gold and greed. Like a cancer, it leaves nothing behind and will infect everything if not checked."
 ZAR_we_are_the_cure:0 "...It Is A Disease Without Name..."
 ZAR_we_are_the_cure_desc:0 "We call it "modernity", but it is a flawed name to try to capture all that it is. It leaves behind nothing but the hunger, making treason, falsehood and corruption just part of the business."
 ZAR_disease_without_name:0 "...And Without A Cure, Bar For One Thing..."
 ZAR_disease_without_name_desc:0 "There's no debating with a tumour, nor is there bartering with a poison. If we do not see this fact we are blind, and will achieve nothing. The champions of this disease can expect nothing more from us than the tumour."
 ZAR_disease_cut_out:0 "...It Must Be Cut Out, Without Hesitation..."
 ZAR_disease_cut_out_desc:0 "You cut the tumour out, carefully but decisively, and if you must cut into the still healthy flesh to do so, then that is the price you must pay to ensure that it does not return."
 ZAR_from_the_ashes:0 "...And The Diseased Flesh Thrown On The Fire..."
 ZAR_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "And when the diseased flesh is cut out it is not something to make use of, it is something to burn. Tossing it onto the fire, destroying it, becomes part of the act of healing, for that which is tainted must be destroyed."
 ZAR_something_new:0 "...It Must Be Reduced To Ashes..."
 ZAR_something_new_desc:0 "Those who would cry for or defend the tumour are delusional at best, dangerous at worst, and they too must be contested. Their misguided fear of destruction makes them the agents of corruption, and thus part of it."
 ZAR_grow_free_of_sickness:0 "...And From The Ashes Scattered In The Field..."
 ZAR_grow_free_of_sickness_desc:0 "This truth is what guides us, and we will neither hesitate nor relent. We shall sweep the land like a storm of fire, leaving nothing of this cursed taint in our wake."
 ZAR_scatter_ashes:0 "...The Garden Of Igennet Will Grow..."
 ZAR_scatter_ashes_desc:0 "And as we've swept the land clean, we shall restore it to what it was. For centuries, only small droplets of the divine has been allowed to grow, but under us it will become what it was meant to be."

 ZAR_let_this_sick_world_die_desc:0 "The lands of north Zebrica are purified, and the Garden of Igennet is growing. The disease may fester beyond the borders, and if it comes to us we will await with steel and fire. Yet here, we have created an island of purity in a sea of filth."

 ZAR_the_city_regained:0 "The City Regained"
 ZAR_the_city_regained_desc:0 "It has been too long, but finally the great city of Tobuck has been returned to us. The scheming smugglers turned out to possess some modicum of integrity, and honoured their promises. We now return home, to rebuild and to greet our old friends."
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites:0 "Summoning The Elites"
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites_desc:0 "As the city is restored to Zarantian control, we must summon the old power brokers and figureheads before the Aguellid. They are still welcome under her rule, and Mekiouzza will meet with them to hear their counsel and request their aid."
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service:0 "Vasile cel Tradat At Your Service"
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service_desc:0 "One of Pea Shooter's accomplices - a griffon from distant Brodfeld - have remained behind when his colleague ran off. It appears that he has realised there are few places for his kind to run, and he has offered his services to the Aguellid in exchange for safety."
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends:0 "Our Faithful Friends"
 ZAR_our_faithful_friends_desc:0 "There are those in the city who never forgot Tobuck's debt to the Zarantians, and who were ready and willing to aid us should it have come to war. These brave souls deserve to be recognized for their honour. Friendship is a valuable commodity, and we know its price."
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets:0 "Dancing In The Streets"
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets_desc:0 "Above all else, the union between Tobuck and the Imazeeb is one of mutual respect and honour, and we view the city folk not simply as subjects, but as honoured friends and an integral part of Zarantia. Recent events have shaken them, however, and we need to remind them of the esteem we hold them in."
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law:0 "Reminding Them Of The Law"
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law_desc:0 "The Tobuckians are traders at heart, and they have always strived towards new and better deals. Sometimes this is at the expense of the law, and though we accept it, we do not let it get out of hoof. Fair warning will be given, but they have always known we treat the law seriously, and they can't have expected that to change."
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance:0 "Reestablishing Dominance"
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance_desc:0 "The city is under control, but the outlying areas which have been neglected for over a year, still go about life in their own way. They need to be made aware of the change in leadership, and that we may well come to ask them to do their part soon."
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck:0 "Lessons From Tobuck"
 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck_desc:0 "It is a bitter pill to swallow, but there are things we can learn from Pea Shooter and his efforts here. Not all he did came out of brute force, and he managed to balance several factions quite well. Learning from him might feel distasteful, but there is value in it all the same."
 ZAR_the_migration:0 "The Migration"
 ZAR_the_migration_desc:0 "The coastlines were ravaged by the Storm King more than most areas of Zarantia. Many regions lie abandoned, not the least since their inhabitants fled into the desert. Now that the lands are reclaimed, they can finally return home again."
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck:0 "Mayor Of Tobuck"
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck_desc:0 "He is a snake, but nocreature can deny that Vasile cel Tradat has been an indispensable asset as we restore our hold over Tobuck. His talents are great, and we can think of no more able candidate for the position of Mayor of Tobuck. We'll just have to make sure to keep an eye on him."
 ZAR_the_rightful_capitol:0 "The Rightful Capital"
 ZAR_the_rightful_capitol_desc:0 "Agzhat served the Aguellid well in the time after Tobuck's fall, but it is time to restore the heart of Zarantian power to its rightful home."
 ZAR_international_assurances:0 "International Assurances"
 ZAR_international_assurances_desc:0 "There's been no limit of the concern expressed internationally after the fall of Tobuck. An important trade city was left to anarchy and crime, after all. It's time to reassure the world that the time of chaos is over, and that we're more than happy to see their traders again."
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities:0 "City Of Opportunities"
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities_desc:0 "Tobuck is a free city, one of opportunity and prosperity, over which the watchful Aguellid holds her hoof. Those who seek to earn their fortune may do so here honestly and without concern, for all of Zarantia watches vigilantly over their jewel of a city."
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck:0 "The Aguellid-Queen of Zarantia And Tobuck"
 ZAR_queen_zarantia_tobuck_desc:0 "A Queen is born, an Aguellid is chosen, and they are not the same. Yet, Tobuck is the gate between the Imazeeb and the world, and as we step into into the world, we must understand their ways. For this reason, Mekiouzza shall become both."

 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords:0 "Dealing With Warlords"
 ZAR_dealing_with_warlords_desc:0 "Pea Shooter is gone, but his thugs and enforcers are still covering the countryside like so much mould. They resent the loss of their meal ticket, and will not depart silently. We must decide how to deal with them."
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits:0 "A Sword For Bandits"
 ZAR_a_sword_for_bandits_desc:0 "The warlords are murderers and thieves, and we suffer neither. They were a threat when united under their old master, but now they are disorganised and scrambling. Do not let them regain their footing, kill them all."
 ZAR_one_by_one:0 "One By One"
 ZAR_one_by_one_desc:0 "Instead of letting them gather, we move swiftly to cut them off from each other and proceed to destroy them one after another. We are not dealing with warriors, but with murderous thugs, and this is not war, but a justice found in blood."
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood:0 "Washed Clean In Blood"
 ZAR_washed_clean_in_blood_desc:0 "The warlords are no more, and their bands of roaming highwaycreatures have been given the end they deserve. If there are anyone out there who believed that the Imazeeb were weak or hesitant to measure out justice, they now know how wrong they were."
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals:0 "Gently With Cornered Animals"
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals_desc:0 "Pea Shooter honoured his deal and departed peacefully, and many lives were spared for it. Do we think the warlords are determined to fight to the bitter end for honour's sake? Of course not, so we can likely coax them to just leave as well, and spare ourselves the losses that crushing them would entail."
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons:0 "Lay Down Weapons"
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons_desc:0 "It is a frustrating and drawn out dance to get them to leave, much like handling a scared, angry animal, but opening up corridors to the borders or the ports to them is having its effects. As long as we do not do anything surprising, they will depart."
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy:0 "Yesterday's Enemy"
 ZAR_yesterdays_enemy_desc:0 "A curious situation has emerged. It seems like one of the warlords - an exile from her distant homeland in the north - is tired of running. She has planted her forces firmly in the southwest and sent a message to the Aguellid. Her offer: fealty in return for a home."
 ZAR_law_and_order:0 "Law And Order"
 ZAR_law_and_order_desc:0 "The first duty of any leader is to provide security, and the warlords are not the only armed criminals found in Tobuck. Many of them have been acting brazenly against the tribes and villages, believing themselves beyond the reach of the law. This must be rectified, now."
 ZAR_the_pacification:0 "The Pacification"
 ZAR_the_pacification_desc:0 "Zarantia's oath to Tobuck included providing safety for the people. After the Storm King and thanks to Pea Shooter, we failed in this promise for a while. Now however, order is restored, and the lands of Tobuck are once again safe."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy:0 "A Zarantian Navy"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_navy_desc:0 "Before the fall of Tobuck, one of the projects that the Aguellid had decided on was the creation of a Zarantian navy, warriors wholly dedicated to warfare at sea. The sea is a different place though, and it has its own rules."
 ZAR_steel_behemoths:0 "Steel Behemoths"
 ZAR_steel_behemoths_desc:0 "Warships are immense things, larger than even many buildings, and the firepower they carry is equally immense. It goes without saying that building these things demands immense expertise and resources both. Thankfully, we have contacts that can help us on the way."
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding:0 "Tobuck Shipbuilding"
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding_desc:0 "A gun can be put together by a skilled gunsmith in his home, but the notion of said gunsmith hammering away at a thousand tonne steel colossus is more like the setup for a joke. As with all things, the new age demands new kinds of workshops, and the Tobuckians have contacts."
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral:0 "A Curious Admiral"
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral_desc:0 "We are not sure where exactly he came from, nor if he actually is an admiral or just a lunatic, but he seems to know what he is doing, and he brings a cadre of capable sailors with him. From what we hear of his history, it might be prudent to keep a close eye on him."
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald:0 "Controlling The Green Bay"
 ZAR_controling_the_emerald_desc:0 "The Green Bay has featured in our people's stories since ancient times, and it has been a vein of commerce for just as long. It is our connection to the outside world, and we should be doing our absolute best to keep it open."
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce:0 "A Zarantian Airforce"
 ZAR_a_zarantian_airforce_desc:0 "The Hippogriffs brought down the Storm King through use of modern warplanes, whereas we were left having to run away. If we had possessed the kind of planes that Aris did, things would have been very different."
 ZAR_iron_birds_nests:0 "Nests Of The Iron Birds"
 ZAR_iron_birds_nests_desc:0 "If we are to make use of these new machines, we will need to build specialised fields for them to take off from and land on. What more, they will need zebras specialised in caring for and repairing them to work there."
 ZAR_sky_warriors:0 "Sky Warriors"
 ZAR_sky_warriors_desc:0 "The foundation of aerial might is the fighter plane; a raider able to move swiftly and strike against all that would threaten our warriors below. They are a warrior's shield and first into the fight, and they will demand much of those we choose for this role."
 ZAR_flying_artillery:0 "Flying Artillery"
 ZAR_flying_artillery_desc:0 "An artillery shell weighs maybe 50 kilos, and we've seen what such a weapon can do to an entire warband. What then can a shell ten times as heavy do if it is not fired from many kilometres away but dropped straight from above?"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers:0 "The Skywalkers"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers_desc:0 "Those who fight in the skies are like a tribe unto themselves, with customs and beliefs that will by necessity come to differ from their land-fighting kin. We shouldn't shy away from this, but rather embrace it. Let the Igenwan fly high, and let their stories reverberate through our history!"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare:0 "New Ways Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare_desc:0 "The menagerie of bandits, thugs and mercenaries that infested Tobuck might have been a plague, but it was a capable one. They would not have held out against the attempts to dislodge them if they hadn't been. It is just as well that we accept this fact, and study what they did to see what we can learn from it."
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare:0 "New Tools Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare_desc:0 "The age where a rifle and a sword could carry a warrior to victory is long gone; the Storm King and his eventual defeat proved that. War is like a diamond, possessing many facets, and each one must be polished to an absolute shine."
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior:0 "A Hybrid Warrior"
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior_desc:0 "It is the Imazeeb way to adapt to her surroundings, and with the plethora of painful lessons we have gotten in recent years, the time has come to adapt more than ever before. The traditional warrior must die, and in its place something new - the unity of two worlds - must be born."
 ZAR_the_martial_elite:0 "The Martial Elite"
 ZAR_the_martial_elite_desc:0 "War is a craft, one that can take a lifetime to truly master, and like with many other crafts it has changed. With a thousand tools at the crafter's disposal, it takes immense training to master them all. War is no different, and this new era will be one where the masters will shine."
 ZAR_shieldwall_discipline:0 "Iron Discipline"
 ZAR_shieldwall_discipline_desc:0 "The idea of the wild warriors sweeping out of the desert is romantic, but flawed. True fighting ability comes from organisation and discipline, and this needs to be instilled in our warriors."
 ZAR_the_big_guns:0 "The Big Guns"
 ZAR_the_big_guns_desc:0 "Whatever skills a warrior possesses, they will not avail him if he is blown to bits before even reaching the battlefield. These heavy guns will be crucial to warfare going ahead."
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge:0 "Importing The Knowledge Of Warfare"
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge_desc:0 "There are many places across the world that has seen war on a scale we can scarcely imagine, and whose peoples have learned many hard lessons about war. We should make sure to listen to them, and gain the lessons they learned without paying the price they had to."
 ZAR_holding_the_line:0 "Holding The Line"
 ZAR_holding_the_line_desc:0 "Imazeeb warfare has long been built on mobility, but if we are to protect Tobuck in the future, we must reconsider this attitude. While mobility will avail our forces, there will also be times where we must dig our hooves in and let the enemy break against us."
 ZAR_the_bulwark:0 "The Bulwark"
 ZAR_the_bulwark_desc:0 "It doesn't matter how fast a warrior runs, or how quickly he adapts, if everywhere he attacks he will find deep tunnels and fortified bunkers waiting for him. We know what we fight to protect, and every drop of sweat spilled in building will pay dividends in blood."

 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold:0 "City Of Wonders And Gold"
 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold_desc:0 "Tobuck is as she always has been, and she has always been a wondrous city. Outsiders will preen and say 'well OUR city is greater' but they can eat sand. To us, Tobuck is a shining jewel, and the wealth and industrial might she offers us is the greatest prize."
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess:0 "Cleaning Up The Mess"
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess_desc:0 "Pea Shooter left the city in a right state. Having been more interested in plundering the Storm King's arsenal than keeping the city in order, we are now left with an entire year of economic development wiped from the books. We are, in essence, starting from scratch."
 ZAR_taking_stock:0 "Taking Stock"
 ZAR_taking_stock_desc:0 ""If it has not been measured, weighed and registered, it does not exist, and the Aguellid will claim it as hers when she finds it." These words have lit a fire under the Tobuckians, and they are more than eager to register their property, their companies and their businesses with us."
 ZAR_modern_agriculture:0 "Modern Agriculture"
 ZAR_modern_agriculture_desc:0 "Not even the farmer's field is safe from the march of progress, with strange new machines, fertilisers and countless new innovations making the fields more fertile than ever. Famine will truly be a thing of history going ahead."
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories:0 "Reopening The Factories"
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories_desc:0 "It has taken time, and in a couple of cases chasing down the thieves that had seized the tools and machinery, but finally the factories of Tobuck are starting to work again."
 ZAR_sprawling_roads:0 "Sprawling Roads"
 ZAR_sprawling_roads_desc:0 "'All roads lead to Tobuck' a merchant once told Mekiouzza. Admittedly he was looking to sell her something at the time, but the expression has stuck with the Aguellid ever since. If it is not true, then why not make it true?"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics:0 "Schools and Clinics"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics_desc:0 "All this change and development is pointless if it does not benefit the entirety of our people, especially the children. Those are for whom we build this new world after all, and they need new teachers to find their place in this world as well as doctors to save them from disease or injury."
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors:0 "Age Of Prospectors"
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors_desc:0 "There is wealth out in the desert, but many times we do not know what we look for. Finding iron is one thing, but what are you supposed to look for when looking for tungsten or chromium? We'll invite any prospectors willing to come to look, and to know that we pay well for any deposits they find."
 ZAR_cash_crops:0 "Cash Crops"
 ZAR_cash_crops_desc:0 "With Tobuck's fields once again under our control, and with the food supply ensured, we can start making good use of the fields for more than just sustenance farming. There is a deep thirst in the world for things like coffee or tobacco, and we grow it well here."
 ZAR_zarantian_arms_industry:0 "The Zarantian Arms Industry"
 ZAR_zarantian_arms_industry_desc:0 "We cannot rely on foreign arms manufacturers if we hope to maintain our independence from now on. Whether it is rifles, guns, shells or any other tool of war, we have to be able to produce it on our own."
 ZAR_finally_industrialising:0 "Finally Industrialising"
 ZAR_finally_industrialising_desc:0 "With Tobuck back in prime shape, we can finally embark on that glorious old plan from years ago to let the new industry and commerce flow from Tobuck out into the rest of Zarantia. After all, when the answer to "how are we meant to industrialise" is simply to point at Tobuck and say "do that", it is much easier."
 ZAR_the_trading_port:0 "The Trading Port"
 ZAR_the_trading_port_desc:0 "Tobuck's port is more than just a port, it is the gateway into all of Zarantia, and it should be one of the finest in all of northern Zebrica. The time of tripping over each other and fighting for space is over, now Tobuck shall welcome everycreature who wishes to come."
 ZAR_the_great_dam:0 "The Great Dam"
 ZAR_the_great_dam_desc:0 "We have worked the desert and irrigated it for centuries, and if there is any area where the modern developments thrill us, it is here. Going ahead, the desert is going to become ours to mold as we wish on a scale never before seen."
 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel:0 "A Radiant Jewel"
 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel_desc:0 "When you cross the oceans and pass by Maregypt into the Green Bay, you come upon Tobuck, a trading city of prosperity and progress. This city stands between worlds, be it Maregyptians or Imazeeb, Zebrica, Equus or Griffonia or any other, but all are home here. Welcome to Tobuck, home and opportunity for anycreature."


 ZAR_appoint_new_aguelid:0 "Appointing A New Aguellid"
 ZAR_appoint_new_aguelid_desc:0 "With the most tragic death of the dear Aguellid, we face a breakdown in order, but thankfully her dear daughter is present and distraught enough that she will agree to our aid as we quickly make her the new Aguellid."

 ZAR_mercenary_returns:0 "The Mercenaries Return"
 ZAR_mercenary_returns_desc:0 "The ascension of dear Umalez did - predictably - make the tribes a bit antsy. We cannot rely on them to enforce good order, and will have to look back to our old associates for help. Sadly, the latest kerfuffle meant that many of them are not available, so we'll have to take what we can get."

 ZAR_alienating_tribes:0 "Alienating Some Tribes..."
 ZAR_alienating_tribes_desc:0 "As the more loudly shouting tribes have proven, loyalty isn't always a good thing. That Amsarmud hag Zawgha especially has been a real pain. It will be tricky to pull off, but we'll ram a wedge between her and Umalez yet."

 ZAR_into_the_far_desert:0 "Into the Far Desert"
 ZAR_into_the_far_desert_desc:0 "With some tribes openly defiant, we have good reason to send Zawgha and her Ironbreakers away from Tobuck and off into the deep desert to deal with them. She'll have her work cut out for herself, but she'll be quite able to handle it. And if she doesn't or she goes rogue, she's still out of the way."

 ZAR_buy_or_bully:0 "...Buying And Bullying The Others"
 ZAR_buy_or_bully_desc:0 "Those tribes who remain on the fence should not be so easily discarded. If you understand the zebras' ideas about honour, you can simply squeeze them to fall in line. For those of a more practical mindset, gold does the trick."

 ZAR_ensnared_in_gold:0 "Ensnared In Gold"
 ZAR_ensnared_in_gold_desc:0 "Gold is an amazing guarantor for loyalty. The less affluent tribes especially have been quite easy to ensnare as we bought up their traditional ways of earning a living and made sure that without us, they have nothing left. They'll be fine though, as long as they remain loyal."

 ZAR_enforcing_loyalty:0 "Enforcing Loyalty"
 ZAR_enforcing_loyalty_desc:0 "The Aguellid is the supreme leader of Zarantia, and defying her is treason. Maybe the Imazeeb have had some other notions on that topic, but that's neither here nor there. We are at last where we can enforce some proper order, and whoever does not bow shall be expelled."

 ZAR_pacification_of_tribes:0 "Pacifying The Tribes"
 ZAR_pacification_of_tribes_desc:0 "These tribals really are causing a ruckus, and sadly Umalez does not have the ability to crack down on them. Yet, it seems there's some other options to make use of. Even the desert zebras have religious beliefs, and if worldly power cannot control them, maybe spiritual power can?"

 ZAR_cultural_renaissance:0 "Cultural Renaissance"
 ZAR_cultural_renaissance_desc:0 "The ceremonies held in Tobuck turned out quite well, and we've seen the tensions abate somewhat. Digging deep into the Imazeeb traditions, there are countless old ceremonies that have faded in relevance over time. That won't do, let's give the zebras a grand cultural reawakening and maybe they'll start behaving."

 ZAR_grand_ceremonies:0 "Grand Ceremonies"
 ZAR_grand_ceremonies_desc:0 "The Igennet ceremonies are quite something! It does cost to dig up those flowers from across the desert, but with some stagecraft the ceremonies seem almost supernatural, and what more the consumption of the flowers keeps Umalez pliable when she isn't performing."

 ZAR_moving_into_open:0 "Moving Into The Open"
 ZAR_moving_into_open_desc:0 "Umalez has graciously restored Tobuck's independence after her mother decided to get her hooves all up in its business, and now we can see about scaling the more meddling reforms back. For this eventuality, Vasile has created an entire shadow bureaucracy that now can step out into the open and get to work."

 ZAR_efficiency_in_labour_market:0 "Efficiency In The Labour Market"
 ZAR_efficiency_in_labour_market_desc:0 "There's much to be done, and not enough workers for it. Much of this is due to various restrictions and limitations imposed on where and how you can work, and by scaling this back and opening up for labour as payment, we'll grow our workforce massively!"

 ZAR_cut_red_tape:0 "Cutting The Red Tape"
 ZAR_cut_red_tape_desc:0 "A slim government is an effective government, and so we do away with the more restrictive rules placed on the city. Tobuck was built by Maregyptian settlers who took the opportunities before them, and Zarantia was born of a zebra who did the same. It's not fair that we'd limit today's creatures any more."

 ZAR_opportunities_galore_desc:0 "Everycreature has agreed that Tobuck is a place of opportunities. Here, a pony, or griffon, or zebra, can remake themselves without annoying interference from others. Here, those who can may reach as far as they wish, and those who can't can stay out of the way."

 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders_desc:0 "Give a creature an inch and they take a mile, that is the truth of all autocrats, and restoring our own leaders is long overdue. The Aguellid has one duty only, and we will not allow whoever holds that position to forget that in the future."

 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert may be harsh and unforgiving, but at least it does not try to break your people and make you something you're not. Our people have claimed swathes of the desert and made it livable before, and can do so again."

 #### Leader Descriptions ####

ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of the leader of the Ataghan tribe. Ever the precocious child, her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the Imazeeb tribes in throwing off the Warzenan yoke. Though not even a chief, she was the first to pledge herself to aid them and managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs as well.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the Imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"
ZAR_umalez_harmony_desc:0 "Umalez was born as a mare caught between two worlds. Though she is the daughter of Mekiouzza, her childhood and upbringing was shaped by city life in Tobuck and the finest teachers available. Between her studies and her constant contacts with foreign delegates at her mother's court, Umalez grew to develop a mindset and attitude that was quite far removed from her kin, especially as Mekiouzza raised her to think of the role of Aguellid as something that would be hers by right. While she knows her people's traditions and observes them, she has always felt as though she is merely donning a costume, and she has always struggled with the idea that she could ever measure up to her mother.\n\nIn the end, she realised that she shouldn't try to be Mekiouzza, and instead surrendered the authority her mother had claimed back to the tribes. She does not need to be the sole authority of Zarantia, and instead the council that her mother built can maintain that role, elevating all Imazeeb as her mother once said she wished to do. It might not be what Mekiouzza planned, but she did not raise Umalez to blindly follow the lead of others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Egil"

In the end, she may not be her mother, but she sees what her mother saw. The duty entrusted to her is the greatest honour any zebra can ask for, and between the two of them, Umalez knows they will leave a Zarantia that can stand the test of time, and which can give their people a nation to help them prosper through the ages to come.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Egil"

Her people's traditions and customs, her own doubts, indeed the lives of her people, all needed to be gambled if Zarantia was to survive. This artificial state, the final expression of her mother's raw determination, was only kept together by force. If it would remain intact that same force needed to be exerted. She will never be her mother, but she can keep Zarantia together, and earn it its place in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Egil"

These days, Umalez has come to resign herself to being reliant on her Brodfeldian advisor. She has her worries, but there is never time, and she seems to jump from one crisis to another. All she can do is try to keep Zarantia together, but time will tell if she will accomplish anything but oversee its slow decay.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Egil"
ZAR_umalez_worm_desc:0 "The Worm Queen has been an eternal fixture in Imazeeb legends for centuries. As all things are born, so all things must die, and she is there to devour the dead and in doing so separate their spirits from their flesh. Rot, decay, the consumption of flesh in fire and by wind and water; everywhere that things wither is her domain. Her children are countless, from the smallest carrion feeder to the titanic Ijirmed that roam the deserts of the Zebhara, and in the end all things will come to her. She is no goddess of death though, as the realm of the dead is far beyond her reach. All she does is break apart that which was in order to make sure that something new can be born out of it.\n\nAs the girl Umalez cried out for Ijirmed to devour them all, a herald of the goddess did indeed hear her. Her body fell into the thrashing maws of the giant worm, yet the divine essence of the Igennet had permeated her and made her mind become one with the creature. Where it now ends and Umalez begins none can say, and neither can anyone say what is left of Umalez. One thing is clear though; the degradation that the promises of Tobuck offered would break the Imazeeb, as it has broken the world, and the Worm Goddess has decided to act. The world is sick, and her destruction is the cure."
ZAR_zawgha_desc:0 "Zawgha Amsarmud would have been the reaver of the Zebhara, a desert terror to strike fear across northern Zebrica. Born into the militant Amsarmud tribe, Zawgha grew up learning that there were those who took and those who were victims, as was the Amsarmud way. As a member of one of the few tribes who did not recognize the Aguellid, she cut her teeth at a young age as a raider, killed her first enemy at twelve years of age, and became chieftess at twenty. She earned the moniker 'Ironbreaker' when she broke her opponent's sword during a duel with her bare hoof, and during the early days of Mekiouzza's reign, this ferocious desert raider was one of its greatest threats. Yet where Zawgha hoped for battle, Mekiouzza slowly isolated and starved the Amsarmud, never giving them a proper fight.\n\nAfter a year's standoff, during which Zawgha refused to yield, the two met on neutral ground. Though nocreature knows what was said between them, Zawgha came out of the meeting swearing fealty to the Aguellid and to Mekiouzza personally, making the Amsarmud favoured and Zawgha the supreme commander of Zarantia's forces. The reversal was sudden, and Zawgha's first order of business became putting down a revolt inside her own tribe which she did without hesitation.\n\nEver since, Zawgha has been Mekiouzza's favoured general. The exact details of their relationship are shrouded in mystery, but whatever was said between the two made Zawgha believe in Mekiouzza with fanatical zeal. After the Storm King, she became well aware of the weaknesses of the Imazeeb way of war and has worked tirelessly to build up a new cadre of soldiers that will become the mould in which Zarantia's military will be recast.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kessel"

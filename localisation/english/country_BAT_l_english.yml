However, we can easily mitigate their resolve. All it will take is a discreet supply of narcotics to hinder their ability to organize themselves."
BAT_infiltrate_urban_centers:0 "Infiltrate The Cities"
BAT_infiltrate_urban_centers_desc:0 "Being a very large country, Equestria has a lot of industrial power to call upon should they realize their potential. We will place some agents in key locations across the country. Then all we'll need to do is give them the word and Equestria's military might will crumble under their lack of supplies."
BAT_academic_infiltration:0 "Sabotage The Academia"
BAT_academic_infiltration_desc:0 "It is no secret that Equestria holds some of the finest minds in the world. Fortunately for us, we know where they live. We'll just need to make sure that several "accidents" occur once the war begins."
BAT_military_excersises:0 "Drill The Legions"
BAT_military_excersises_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that our Legionaries aren't as disciplined as we'd like them to be. We will hold a grand military exercise to remind them of their purpose. This should also show our population that supporting Her Imperial Majesty is a cause worth enlisting for!"
BAT_auxiliary_expansion:0 "Auxiliary Recruitment Drive"
BAT_auxiliary_expansion_desc:0 "With our increased acquisition of labourers, one general has proposed the idea of an auxiliary branch of recruits composed entirely of these same individuals. Though some doubt their loyalty, we will give them an opportunity to prove their worth."
BAT_tactical_superiority:0 "Tactical Superiority"
BAT_tactical_superiority_desc:0 "A millennium of preparing for battle has given us an edge in tactical knowledge. We will establish a mandate that all our new recruits as well as our seasoned veterans be given extensive training in the latest strategies. They will know what it means to be a Chiropterran Legionary."
BAT_terror_bombing:0 "Terror Bombing Tactics"
BAT_terror_bombing_desc:0 "With all of our new recruits, Lunar Hail has proposed a radical idea to the Legionary Council: Bomb Equestria into oblivion. We will give these recruits flight training and access to every bomber we can find, then order them to destroy Equestria's morale. All will learn to fear and respect the Nightmare."
BAT_send_over_resources:0 "The Manehattan Pipeline"
BAT_send_over_resources_desc:0 "Through a significant amount of effort, we have established control over a small section of Manehattan's industry. When the Nightmare arrives, She will have an ample number of arms manufacturers to answer Her call."
BAT_send_over_officers:0 "Legionaries Lead The Way!"
BAT_send_over_officers_desc:0 "An in-depth analysis of the Nightmare's supporters in Equestria has concluded that they are woefully prepared for the reality of an armed conflict. Should the fighting break out now, they will surely perish. This cannot be allowed to happen. We will send our finest advisors to teach them how to properly wage a war."
BAT_final_preperations:0 "One Minute To Midnight"
BAT_final_preperations_desc:0 "Rejoice! We have done much in preparation for the Nightmare's return. Now all that's left is to wait for the living prison that is Princess Luna to crack under the pressure we've exerted, and then our glorious Nightmare Moon will rise once again!"

BAT_the_civil_war_has_come:0 "The Equestrian Civil War"
BAT_the_civil_war_has_come_desc:0 "The time has finally come. All doubt is washed away, and all hesitation undone. Once more Her Imperial Majesty has risen, and once more we will rally to her side! Operation Moonshine has begun, and this time, the Night will last for a thousand years!"
BAT_use_smuggler_networks:0 "Bolster the Smuggling Operations"
BAT_use_smuggler_networks_desc:0 "Wars are meat grinders that consume both bodies and guns, and the civil war tearing Equestria apart is a war unlike any we have faced before. To this end, we must acquire more weapons than ever before, and we must do it now."
BAT_fillydelphia_FOB:0 "FOB Summerfield"
BAT_fillydelphia_FOB_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon calls for us and we shall obey. To this end, a Forward Operating Base will be established in the areas she control, from which our finest soldiers can operate in the service of the night."
BAT_disappear_prisoners:0 "Take On the Burden"
BAT_disappear_prisoners_desc:0 "Many ponies in Her Imperial Majesty's territory have refused to see the truth, and the longer they rot, the more they consume resources our Queen needs in her war. We will offer to take on these prisoners: we know how to put them to good use."
BAT_send_over_instructors:0 "Send Instructors"
BAT_send_over_instructors_desc:0 "For a thousand years we have waited and prepared, and in that time we have learned much of war. Our numbers may pale in comparison to Her Imperial Majesty's Equestrian legions, but with our knowledge they can become even more deadly."
BAT_drive_up_recruitment:0 "Drive Up Recruitment"
BAT_drive_up_recruitment_desc:0 "There will be no discussion and no exceptions, not now when the fate of everything is on the line. The war demands blood, and we will provide as much as needed to secure victory."
BAT_propaganda_effort:0 "For the Empire!"
BAT_propaganda_effort_desc:0 "This is the day we've awaited for a thousand years, and we must steel ourselves for the task at hoof. All must be given for the cause, and war must be all that we can envision until the final body hits the ground."
BAT_procur_auxiliaries:0 "Offer Redemption"
BAT_procur_auxiliaries_desc:0 "Though some zealots would gladly give our prisoners a neck-shot and some shovels of dirt, that would be wasteful. Those who stood against us can still atone for their crimes in war, especially if they know what the alternative is."
BAT_massive_recruitment_campaign:0 "Expand the Imperial Rifles"
BAT_massive_recruitment_campaign_desc:0 "The Imperial Rifles have served well, and keeping their numbers down has helped us keep them as elite as they have been, but this war will demand more than the formations we currently have."
BAT_radar_preparation:0 "Forward Listening Posts"
BAT_radar_preparation_desc:0 "The world groans under the weight of the grand clash, and our enemies at home will gladly strike at us if we drop our guard. In order to counter this, we need to keep monitoring their every move, lest they catch us unaware."
BAT_boost_wartime_production:0 "The War At the Homefront"
BAT_boost_wartime_production_desc:0 "The luxuries of peace must become a distant memory for us, any waste or hesitation to commit would not only sabotage the war effort, but also be outright treasonous towards Her Imperial Majesty. We are not going to commit anything less than all we have to Her!"
BAT_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Manufacturing"
BAT_rifles_desc:0 "The age of smuggling and scavenging is going to have to end: we have acquired enough different weapons to know which technologies and designs work the best. Now, we will implement them so that we can arm our forces truly uniformly."
BAT_military_production:0 "Boost Wartime Production"
BAT_military_production_desc:0 ""Set up new production lines, double the shifts, raise quotas, employ corporeal punishment for workers who slack off, I don't care how you boost productivity, but do it, and do it now.\n\n-Lord Commander Autumn Breeze""
BAT_producing_support:0 "Support Gear Procurement"
BAT_producing_support_desc:0 "Our smuggling network is vast, and we can use it to procure more than just rifles. If we focus our efforts on acquiring more specialized tools, that will let our industry focus on the more easily-produced equipment."
BAT_producing_trucks:0 "Expand Vehicular Production"
BAT_producing_trucks_desc:0 "Unlike in Her Imperial Majesty's first war for dominance, this war will demand vehicles as well as bodies, and our engineers have thankfully produced designs that will serve both us and Her Imperial Majesty well, as long as we make sure to get the vehicle production up and running."
BAT_producing_artillery:0 "Artillery Procurements"
BAT_producing_artillery_desc:0 "Properly deployed, artillery can account for three-fourths of all the casualties inflicted upon the enemy. Our Imperial Rifles have always made good use of artillery since the advent of gunpowder, and in order to ensure that we can keep hammering our foes, we must make sure to acquire as many artillery pieces as possible."
BAT_send_advisors:0 "The Jungle Corps"
BAT_send_advisors_desc:0 "Southern Equestria is teeming with jungles, and our exile in Zebrica has given us plenty of experience fighting in them. Using this knowledge, we can ensure the Disciples of the Night can use the jungles to their greatest advantage. "
BAT_training_camps:0 "Insurgent Training Camps"
BAT_training_camps_desc:0 "Equestria's southern regions are contested by the Disciples of the Night, a zealous army indeed. Yet, their zeal outpaces their skill, and if they are to be the weapons that Her Imperial Majesty truly needs, we must spare no expenses in helping to mould them into true soldiers of the Night."
BAT_send_them_equipment:0 "Supply the Disciples"
BAT_send_them_equipment_desc:0 "The Disciples are fighting a war on several fronts, and all the zeal in the world can't compensate for lack of equipment. We must ensure that they are given proper armaments, no matter what we must do to reach them."
BAT_skim_a_bit_of_rubber:0 "Domestic Rubber Production"
BAT_skim_a_bit_of_rubber_desc:0 "Chiropterra has the perfect climate to produce rubber, and with the realization of how important this material is for modern wars, the recourse is clear; start producing all the rubber we can. It is not glamorous, but necessary, and victory will demand the mundane as much as the heroic."
BAT_prisoner_camps:0 "Transport the POWs"
BAT_prisoner_camps_desc:0 "As Her Imperial Majesty's loyalists seize more and more prisoners, we have humbly offered to keep them in our lands. Of course, that is not to say we were planning to just let them sit around. If they won't serve the Night willingly, they can serve unwillingly."
BAT_psychological_fighting:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_fighting_desc:0 "The soft ponies of Equestria might think they are ready to fight us, but they'll learn otherwise. Wars are won when your opponent is broken, whether physically or spiritually, and terror is as deadly a blade as any gun."

BAT_yet_another_failure:0 "Yet Another Failure"
BAT_yet_another_failure_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, Operation Moonshine has failed. It is the second rebellion our bloodlines have lost and it will take the powers of the Nightmare herself to convince our nation that we should prepare for a third attempt. We must look to our current state of affairs and determine what needs to be changed so that we can last another thousand years."
BAT_emergency_session:0 "Turn Back the Clock"
BAT_emergency_session_desc:0 "Although our efforts in Equus have failed, we are still a minute from midnight! While the heretical sun may have driven us back into the shadows, around us are a great many rich and fertile lands. It is time, for the future of Chiropterra, that we look to the world that is immediately around us; Zebrica."
BAT_limited_diplomacy:0 "Prepare the Second Great Conquest"
BAT_limited_diplomacy_desc:0 "As we pivot away from reclaiming Equestria for our goddess, we must lay the seeds of our success on Zebrica. We cannot forget why we are taking the steps in this great crusade, not for greed or gold; but for our goddess alone! The Nightmare needs us to secure these lands from the profligates and heretics, for only we can use its bounty for her righteous cause!"
BAT_pacification_brigades:0 "Form the Imperial Frontier Forces"
BAT_pacification_brigades_desc:0 "Our Legions dominate our enemies on the field of battle, but when a war ends; what then? When our first ancestors carved out modern day Chiropterra from the natives that sullied her soil, they formed dedicated units to keep the peace. We shall follow the lessons of this history and form our own Frontier Corps to serve, protect, and ensure the loyalty of our new territories."
BAT_strike_at_tobuck:0 "Strike Down the Savages"
BAT_strike_at_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come for our strength to be shown to these heretics! Tobuck and Zarantia are lands without order and without faith, ruled by petty despots and barely worthy to be considered nations. We shall not underestimate the conniving warlords and their armies however. We shall treat them as if they were our greatest enemies, we shall pour our hearts and souls into this war! For the Legion! For the Nightmare!"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords:0 "Woe To the Vanquished"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords_desc:0 "The rogue warlords of the desert have been captured by our forces, now all that matters is to decide what to do with them. While there have been talks of simply executing the lot of them, the Legionary Council has met to decide their fate. The debate is expected to take several sessions and require many interrogations, but the Nightmare is a just mistress; so we shall follow her example."
BAT_secure_tobuck:0 "Reorganise the Eastern Territories"
BAT_secure_tobuck_desc:0 "With the warlords dealt with, the resistance crushed, and the civilians pacified; we have done what none of the petty despots of the natives could...secured Tobuck. Now that our invasion is over we must no longer be conquerors; but rather protectors. Tobuck is our territory now, it is the territory of Nightmare Moon, and a valued part of her empire. We will not let it fall into disarray again."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage:0 "The Enemy Of My Enemy..."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage_desc:0 "Whoever rules over Colthage matters little to us at this time. Despite their status as heretics with a maddening polytheistic pantheon, they have use to us as potential allies. The Hippogriffs are an imposing force and a danger to our great expansion. Much like how our ancestors fought in the Legions of old, we need somepony alongside us against the enemy."
BAT_help_their_military:0 "Assist the Colthaginians"
BAT_help_their_military_desc:0 "The Colthaginians are fighting with equipment captured from the Yetis and antiques carried by their fathers, it is time we enlighten them to the true power of the modern age; machine guns, rifles, and whatever else we can spare will be given to our fair weather friends in the hopes of granting them a fighting chance in the struggle ahead."
BAT_the_gamble:0 "Cast the Die"
BAT_the_gamble_desc:0 "Warzena lies just to our east and barely stands on a single leg. The Zebra nation will be enlightened to our righteous cause and we shall join them in our pact, but this cannot be done with the Hippogriffs hanging over their shoulder; whispering false notions of 'harmony' to them. We shall make our demands known and if the Hippogriffs dare stand against us? So be it."
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push:0 "Operation Spit Roast"
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push_desc:0 "War! The Hippogriffs have made their intentions clear and justified our operations! While the battles rage across Zebrica, we must coordinate with our ally to the East! Coordinated offensives from both sides will disorient and weaken our foe. Peace will only come when Chiropterrans and Colthaginians stand shoulder to shoulder against the great, harmonic menace! Forward, to victory!"
BAT_strike_them_down:0 "Push the Hippogriffs Back Into the Sea"
BAT_strike_them_down_desc:0 "Stand firm! The Hippogriffs once thought that their strength would drive us into the sea? The Nightmare laughs at their insolence, for now we turn to face them with all our might! Greater enemies have died by our hooves and greater enemies shall fall in our future! These Hippogriffs shall be driven back into the sea!"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront:0 "Sway The Old Guard"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront_desc:0 "The conquest of new lands does not mend the failures of Operation Moonshine. The old families speak of the Legionary Council simply trying to mend their failure with smaller gains. Their impudence needs to change. Lord Commander Autumn Breeze will host a gala at his plantation, the Council hopes the patriarch of Clan Reed can sway his fellow aristocracy back in line."
BAT_reorganize_local_governance:0 "Embrace State Capitalism"
BAT_reorganize_local_governance_desc:0 "The competition that capitalism breeds weeds out the weak and unsustainable businesses, but sometimes a guiding hoof is needed to ensure that the country's economy charges forward without the meddling of businessponies. Our economy shall sustain itself, we shall not hide it any longer! While we may not offer the same stock options, we can certainly guarantee that the state's businesses are too big to fail."
BAT_reorganize_agriculture:0 "Reorganise the Agricultural Sector"
BAT_reorganize_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has been weakened by the strain of war. Each success and each failure consumes valuable ponypower and supplies, hemorrhaging our food supplies over time. By mechanizing our farms the same way we have some of our military divisions, we can not only free up more bodies for the industrial sector or front; but also increase our available food supply!"
BAT_limited_unionism:0 "The Chiropterran Development Fund"
BAT_limited_unionism_desc:0 "By expanding our allocations to the industrial sector with a larger development fund, we are investing in our future success! Although it may harm us financially now, by pouring money into greater industrial research and companies we can improve the compliance and effectiveness of industry at all levels."
BAT_army_development:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
BAT_army_development_desc:0 "The industry required to sustain our massive military build-up can only be met by greater government subsidies. To keep our military top of the line, we embrace this wedding of assets against the critics who warn of tying our commercial sector even more to the military. The contracts we grant though will diversify the research opportunities before us."
BAT_labourer_leasing:0 "Labourer Leasing"
BAT_labourer_leasing_desc:0 "Although Labourers belong to the state, sometimes there are simply too many for the state to use on all projects. Because we have an overflow of labourers, it only makes sense that we allow what few foreign companies on our soil and local businesses to lease this free labour from us...at a reasonable tax of course."
BAT_the_propaganda_machine:0 "Hearts and Minds"
BAT_the_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "Operation Moonshine failed, but Chiropterra hasn't! Recent battles have given our propaganda machine all the film, features, and pictures needed to drum up its messaging for the first time in centuries. We do not have to look to our ancestors alone for heroes any more, as there are living legends among us now! Crowds line up at recruiting offices after newsreels show our brave Legionnaires on the front."
BAT_expand_civilian_governance:0 "Expand Local Civilian Governments"
BAT_expand_civilian_governance_desc:0 "The Legionary Council might act as our supreme authority, but it would be foolish to have them weigh in on local district disputes and the laws of small towns. By expanding the power of our local government officials, we can encourage greater participation in government while expanding our power simultaneously!"
BAT_remember_your_duty:0 "The Thousand Year Struggle"
BAT_remember_your_duty_desc:0 "It has taken time and effort to remind our people of our duty. One cannot blame them for losing faith, for they struggled for a thousand years preparing for their triumph. As one generation passes onto the next though, we have rekindled the flames of patriotism within them all. The first great steps on another thousand year struggle have been made and they all take pride in being at its forefront."
BAT_new_settlement_initiative:0 "New Settlement Initiative"
BAT_new_settlement_initiative_desc:0 "As we expand our territory east, we also must consider the uncultivated land already within our territory. With increased automation and infrastructure, its feasible to settle even the most desolate parts of Chiropterra. This new initiative will encourage our people to settle in these new townships and enjoy the comforts of modernity there."
BAT_youth_service_corps:0 "Form the Youth Service Corps"
BAT_youth_service_corps_desc:0 "The Nightmare does not need to inspire the loyalty of the faithful, for they are already in her embrace. She must enkindle the love of the foals to ensure that the future is in her name. The establishment of the Youth Service Corps will lead to the betterment of our young ponies and inspire future generations of loyal, dependable, and honest Chiropterrans."
BAT_expand_operations:0 "Expand the Hoof's Operations"
BAT_expand_operations_desc:0 "The Hoof of the Nightmare must grow as we have. While our traditional intelligence agency has been with us since our first landings, there have been few innovations in their conduct of operations on domestic soil. While they remained on the bleeding edge of foreign espionage, by granting them greater power in Chiropterra itself we can expand their support of the state here."
BAT_the_war_at_sea:0 "The War At Sea"
BAT_the_war_at_sea_desc:0 "The largest border Chiropterra has is with the ocean, meaning that we must have a capable navy to defend ourselves with. By reviewing our current doctrine and comparing it with other developments from our own experiences and that of others, we can expand our naval knowledge far beyond our current capabilities. What took others years will only take us months, for the Nightmare guides us with her shadow!"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards:0 "Shipyard Expansion Scheme"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards_desc:0 "While we are guided by the Nightmare, we also must be aware of our capabilities. The shipyards of Chiropterra will be modernized to not only rival that of our enemies, but surpass them! Our ships shall be remembered for centuries and their legacy will rule the waves! In due time, the weight of our naval power shall crash against our true enemy! For now we will sharpen our fangs on the prey we find around us."
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet:0 "The Seawind MKII"
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet_desc:0 "Effective, hard to detect, and dangerous; it is easy to see why the Legionary Council has favored the development of the submarine. Our current hulls are out of date and if we wish to have our wolfpacks be the most dangerous in the sea, we will have to give them the tools to be successful!"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers:0 "The Moonfire MKII"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers_desc:0 "Cheap, maneuverable, and swift; it is also easy to see why the Council favors this surface ship. Although not as effective at raiding as our submarines, our destroyers are ancient in comparison to that of our enemies. New hulls and new guns mounted on them will make our surface fleet stronger. It is wiser to start at the ground up for retrofits with the support ships rather than starting with the battleships after all."
BAT_fuel_conservation:0 "Fuel Conservation Initiative"
BAT_fuel_conservation_desc:0 "As we improve our naval capabilities, we will also need to allocate a greater stockpile of fuel to the surface and submarine fleets. Although this is a daunting task, it has a simple solution; expand the reserves. By constructing additional fuel silos, we can increase our total storage capacity ensuring an availability of fuel during long term operations."
BAT_the_lunar_marines:0 "Form the Imperial Marine Corps"
BAT_the_lunar_marines_desc:0 "Our enemies shall be placed under siege! Under lockdown! The Nightmare's Imperial Marines will storm their ranches, homes, and liberate them from the heels of their masters! Our marines are merciless, dangerous, well-oiled machines that will land on their shores without warning."
BAT_convoy_raiding:0 "Supply Line Disruption Tactics"
BAT_convoy_raiding_desc:0 "We cannot match the operation range of our surface fleet with that of our enemies, therefore we shall dedicate most of our efforts to our reliable raiding groups. While the waters around Chiropterra shall be secured, we shall cause havoc upon the enemy wherever their ships sail in the ocean! Their will be no escape from our hunt!"
BAT_operation_range_expansion:0 "Long Distance Operations"
BAT_operation_range_expansion_desc:0 "Our surface fleet needs to go past our shores, to be able to meet the enemy anywhere they are found. While we cannot simply take over every island between here and Equestria to build up a series of naval bases, we can instead focus on improving our doctrine with the capabilities we have to greater expand the flexibility of our operations."

BAT_look_to_the_economy:0 "A Failure On the Homefront"
BAT_look_to_the_economy_desc:0 "We have failed in our efforts, but we cannot hold only the Legionnaire responsible. Our homefront was just as critical to Moonshine as our soldiers were. We must prepare for our next crusade and build an economy that is able to support it, even if it takes another thousand years to prepare."
BAT_strenghten_the_commission:0 "Tighten the Grip"
BAT_strenghten_the_commission_desc:0 "The treatment of our native Labourers has been too relaxed. The restraints on the Commission allowed for silent protest and 'protections' among the few dissidents there were. We must tighten our hold over this critical part of the economy and not allow even one soul to think of anything beyond service."
BAT_intensify_raids:0 "Calibrated Acquisition Operations"
BAT_intensify_raids_desc:0 "Our raiding parties will be equipped with our most modern equipment and soldiers. We cannot afford to limit ourselves in these missions anymore, by diverting more resources to each raid we should be able to enjoy greater returns on the labourers acquired."
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD:0 "LMRD Test Subject Procurement Standardisation"
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD_desc:0 "The LMRD is an invaluable asset to Chiropterra and we cannot throttle their need for test subjects anymore. We shall finally grant them free reign to take whichever labourers they require for experiments without the need for approval from the Native Affairs Commission."
BAT_control_collars:0 "Behavioral Correction Collars"
BAT_control_collars_desc:0 "Behavioral Correction collars have a simple, but deadly design. A small explosive charge is encased in five pounds of durable steel. A microphone and a radio wave receiver and transmitter allow for the location of labourers to be monitored along with their conversations. Need be, the collars can be detonated remotely."
BAT_work_for_your_bread:0 "Food Ration Standardisation"
BAT_work_for_your_bread_desc:0 "One of our founders a thousand years ago wrote a simple directive as we established ourselves; if one works, one eats. We shall apply this straightforward directive to our labourers who will only be given their rations after they have performed their allotted duties for the day. Those who do not work, do not eat."
BAT_dedicated_research_centers:0 "Special Access Zones"
BAT_dedicated_research_centers_desc:0 "The LMRD and Native Affairs Commission have presented a bold new research strategy, aimed at collecting large units of data at once from an enclosed population. By combining a labourer barracks and worksite into one 'Special Access Zone', we can completely restrict their movement and allow the LMRD to observe them as they work."
BAT_reforming_the_commission:0 "The Velvet Glove"
BAT_reforming_the_commission_desc:0 "To even deny one part of our population the benevolence of the Nightmare's sacred reign is sowing the seeds of our own destruction. We cannot allow the Native Affairs Commission to continue in its current state and we must examine our treatment of the labourers. We must follow our Empress' example, we must improve."
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence:0 "Mandatory Moonday Attendance"
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence_desc:0 "The Labourers had always been given the option to attend services at our temples, for faith is something that cannot be forced. By making temple attendance mandatory, we aim to provide them with a spiritual outlet and provide a dedicated day of rest in their week of labour. It is our hope that in time the exposure to the temple and holy word will passively convert many."
BAT_the_one_generation_rule:0 "The One Generation Rule"
BAT_the_one_generation_rule_desc:0 "A child shall not be punished for the sins of their father, is that not what the Moonspeakers say? We will adapt our laws and allow the children of Labourers who convert to the true word of the goddess to be equal citizens in one generation, instead of two. If their parents are truly faithful, so too will their children be!"
BAT_improve_working_conditions:0 "Labourer Lodgings Improvement"
BAT_improve_working_conditions_desc:0 "Home is where the heart is and if one's home is two sheets of tin without running water, one's heart is not going to be its work. It is only logical that we provide basic living conditions to our labourers, for they are not slaves; only wayward souls we are attempting to save."
BAT_accountable_overseers:0 "Limit Physical Punishment"
BAT_accountable_overseers_desc:0 "The whip is a tool of weaker ponies, we will be smarter and stronger than that. The overseers of our Labourers must be held to the same standard as any other citizen of Chiropterra. By limiting their legal ability to inflict physical punishment, we predict a sharp decline in cases of Labourers perishing in hostile working conditions."
BAT_decent_living_quarters:0 "Loyalty Shall Be Rewarded"
BAT_decent_living_quarters_desc:0 "For those that work without incident and are faithful to Nightmare Moon, why not allow them luxuries? There is no reason to deny a labourer access to books or a permit to reward hard labour? Why not even grant those that push past their quotas a chance to keep what they earn for profit? There are many reforms we will make and all will reward the loyal."
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition:0 "Additional Labourer Procurement"
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition_desc:0 "Raids are violent and prone to failure, but they are not the only way to procure labourers. Our agents will begin operations to direct refugee ships towards our waters or even find those desperate enough to volunteer for a new life in the mythical Chiropterra for the Nightmare."
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick:0 "No Place For Cruelty"
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "Cruelty is inefficient. It is an emotional and wasteful expression of weaker ponies and their false ideologies. We must embrace this fact. We shall enable those who enforce our law better means to control our population through more benevolent means under the philosophy of the carrot and the stick."
BAT_harsher_conditions:0 "Harsh Yet Fair"
BAT_harsher_conditions_desc:0 "We will look to reform our justice system, but in doing this our laws will be harsher. All the same, they will be much more fair. No pony is above the laws of the Nightmare, no one sentient creature will stand above others. Justice is blind, but the Nightmare is not!"
BAT_service_for_freedom:0 "Freedom Through Service"
BAT_service_for_freedom_desc:0 "Service guarantees citizenship! Labourers of Chiropterra rejoice! All who serve for their committed time in the Legions of Nightmare Moon will be granted their freedom at the end of their term. Those who are wounded or medically discharged with honors will be placed in auxiliary battalions, but are still eligible. Are you doing your part for a better future?"
BAT_use_our_connections:0 "The Underground Economy"
BAT_use_our_connections_desc:0 "Let us not pretend that there is an economy in the world that runs beneath the shadows of every state. As children of the darkness, we will thrive in it. Our agents shall expand our connections into these illegal markets and shell corporations to greatly increase our assets."
BAT_equipment_smuggling:0 "Gray Market Contacts"
BAT_equipment_smuggling_desc:0 "As we press into the underground economy, we shall enjoy the fruits of our labours. Several shipping companies from Haukland and Skyfall shall begin to loose shipments in international waters along the coast of Saddle Arabia, but their shared insurance conglomerate Lunar Protections will always reimburse them handsomely."
BAT_the_poppy_fields:0 "The Poppies Of Love"
BAT_the_poppy_fields_desc:0 "Praise be to Nightmare Moon and the bounties of her harvest. Chiropterra is a harsh environment, even by Zebrican standards. This however does not stop the cultivation of our crops, including that of the poppy plant. We can extract valuable medicine from the poppy plant such as morphine, but we also must acknowledge its volatile recreational purposes..."
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling:0 "Drown Their Markets"
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling_desc:0 "While our own ponies will benefit from the sale and cultivation of the poppy plant, we shall drown our enemies in cheap, dangerous opioids. Our goal is not profit, but proliferation. We shall sink the claws of addiction and strife deep into our enemy's most vulnerable and spread like a disease from them."
BAT_shell_companies:0 "Shell Company Procurements"
BAT_shell_companies_desc:0 "Our contacts in the grey markets have solidified different sectors of control. Sanctioning a few small squads of infiltrators, we shall secure the last few signatures' we need to gain full control of several different companies. Through these our reach will be greater and even more hidden."
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Academic Extraction"
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "Several Equestrian academics are researching different projects that interest us. By staging several honeypot operations and the occasional disappearance we can siphon off the best and brightest of our heretical enemies with them being none the wiser."
BAT_electronics_development:0 "The Colossus"
BAT_electronics_development_desc:0 "Through the use of vacuum tubes and other electronic marvels, we can develop an electronic machine that can compute certain equations and ciphers for us! Our leading electronics experts predict massive leaps and bounds in processing ability and power with newer models of the Colossus as well!"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry:0 "Bolster Military Production"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry_desc:0 "More factories means more guns. More guns means more soldiers. The math here is rather simple, but we will have to commit time to consolidate our national assets to refocus on military production. Once we pool our resources, we will be able to enjoy the benefit of more factories, which means more guns...et cetera, et cetera."
BAT_synthethic_oil:0 "Coal Liquefaction"
BAT_synthethic_oil_desc:0 "CTL or Coal to Liquid Fuels is a process in which coal is, rather obviously, converted into fuel. Although this method of synthesis has been around for several years, we have yet to fully invest in the ingenuity of the idea. By embracing this new method of accessing critical fuels, we can bolster our reserves."
BAT_mining_mechanisation:0 "Mining Mechanisation"
BAT_mining_mechanisation_desc:0 "A machine can two twice the work of an average pony, save for a few anomalous earth ponies among our miners. Be that as it may, by mechanizing our mines we can extract more, dig deeper, and enjoy a much larger return from them."
BAT_improve_logistics:0 "Improve Inter-District Infrastructure"
BAT_improve_logistics_desc:0 "It is time we examine the state of our roads between districts, meaning that we must take drastic steps to improve infrastructure throughout our country. By building onto existing railroads and roads, we can create a comprehensive Inter-District travel network that enables mobility of our citizens but also critical logistics."
BAT_developmental_effort:0 "Academic Modernisation"
BAT_developmental_effort_desc:0 "The universities of Yale or the School of Magic in Equestria will have nothing on our academies, once we finish modernizing them of course. It is no secret that our isolation forces us to be creative, but it also hobbles our ability to stay ahead of the curve academically. By granting more funding to our institutions of higher learning, we can benefit from their knowledge."
BAT_medical_research_development:0 "Inter-District Medical Network"
BAT_medical_research_development_desc:0 "By expanding state control of hospitals and other medical facilities, we can ensure they are staffed by properly trained doctors with the most modern equipment possible. Any citizen or labourer in need of medical attention will receive it in new, start of the art facilities. The health of our ponies is the health of our nation."
BAT_crop_diversification:0 "Diversify and Specialize"
BAT_crop_diversification_desc:0 "Diversification is the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk. Or while specialization is the allocation of capital into one particular asset for the greatest reward. We will find the balance between both with our new Industrial Fund, dedicated to allocating grants to different parts of our economy."
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching:0 "Coconut Crab Ranching"
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching_desc:0 "The Coconut Crab is the largest land animal with an exoskeleton that does not use magical means for its survival. These large creatures were common in Chiropterra and have been hunted for centuries for their meat, nearly to the point of extinction. By expanding our protection of the crabs and allocating many more to sanctioned ranches, we can cultivate them safely."
BAT_a_life_of_luxury:0 "Luxuries For the Masses"
BAT_a_life_of_luxury_desc:0 "As our economy becomes more and more efficient, our experts have found startling accounts of surplus and excess. We are out producing our projections for the next century, meaning that we can afford to shower our ponies with commercial goods and luxuries."

BAT_examine_military_procedures:0 "Examine What Went Wrong"
BAT_examine_military_procedures_desc:0 "We have failed to bring the Eternal Night and Nightmare Moon remains lost to us, but we cannot give up hope! We must think back to our ancestors when they first arrived on these shores, we must follow in their example and lay the groundwork for the next war. Even if it must be in another thousand years."
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria:0 "Welcome the New Exiles"
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria_desc:0 "With the failure of Operation Moonshine, we must arrange for a withdrawal of significant assets from Equestria. There is a silver lining in that the officers we embedded into the Equestrian military can now return to us with their experiences and sympathizers."
BAT_support_squads:0 "Auxiliary Combat Role Training"
BAT_support_squads_desc:0 "Our Auxiliaries cannot be wasted on menial tasks anymore! Some of our most loyal units comprise of Auxiliary forces, therefore we must integrate them wholly into the Legions. Separate support companies mixed in with regular troops will give our frontline units greater flexibility."
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles:0 "Adapt the Luna Nova"
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles_desc:0 "Magical rifles are a novelty. Unreliable perhaps, but their efficacy cannot be denied. Gone are the times when only unicorns could launch devastating spells against their enemies. Through a more widespread adoption of such weapons, our forces will be capable of punching well above their weight." #AAAAAAH
BAT_ranger_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Legionary Ranger Corps"
BAT_ranger_corps_desc:0 "We must develop a dedicated light infantry corps to better improve the lethality of our divisions. It is with this course of action that we open our first 'Ranger' school in the Howling Mountains region. We shall test candidates' mental, physical, and martial prowess in order to form a specialized ranger corps that can be integrated with our main infantry units."
BAT_equipment_modernisation:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
BAT_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "The world around us is rapidly evolving with major technological advancements made in a matter of months rather than years. We cannot afford to fall behind. It is too costly and time consuming to consistently rely on espionage to acquire new equipment for us to copy, so we must subsidize our own researchers to improve upon our own equipment."
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts:0 "Legacy of the Shadowbolts"
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts were a dedicated flying formation from the first coming of Nightmare Moon known for their ferocity in the skies! Their night flying is legendary and their accomplishments in the skies even greater! We shall look to their memory as we develop our flying corps capabilities, our new planes and doctrine will echo their legacy!"
BAT_troop_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
BAT_troop_support_desc:0 "The use of combined arms represents the future of warfare. Coordinated assaults of infantry, artillery, and armor to destroy the enemy in quick, decisive attacks will win us our next war. Gone are the days of wasteful tactics and mass infantry attacks without proper support, this new doctrine will pave the way to victory with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_new_bombercraft:0 "Strategic Destruction"
BAT_new_bombercraft_desc:0 "In war we are not just fighting military forces anymore, we are fighting nations. Every city is an asset, every civilian in it a labourer for their war effort. Some on the Council might not approve of this new approach to warfare, but we must strike at all assets of the enemy in order to end a war as quickly as possible by bombing the enemy into absolute submission."
BAT_the_fuel_issue:0 "The Imperial Strategic Petroleum Reserve"
BAT_the_fuel_issue_desc:0 "We are a small nation and our resources can easily be stretched thin in a prolonged conflict, why even our economy now is reliant upon fuel. Our limited contact with the world at large means that we cannot so easily acquire it either. By opening a series of synthetic plants and establishing a means to store vast quantities of oil for long periods of time, we can prepare a vast reserve for military use."
BAT_army_motorisation:0 "Legionary Mechanisation"
BAT_army_motorisation_desc:0 "There is a tribe of warriors on Zebrica that can march fifty miles a day and still fight, but they are only carrying spears and shields. A modern soldier carries much more and his support unit's wagons. We must fully motorize our military so that we can move a hundred and fifty miles a day and fight with the full force of our modern Legions!"
BAT_armoured_trains_focus:0 "Armoured Trains"
BAT_armoured_trains_focus_desc:0 "Railways are the backbone of our logistics no matter the amount of trucks we may have. It is important that we provide this critical asset of military infrastructure with the means to defend itself. By implementing the use of armored trains, we cannot only improve the defense of our logistics but also some units dedicated to protecting railways to be used elsewhere."
BAT_extensive_planning:0 "Strategy in Depth"
BAT_extensive_planning_desc:0 "Tactics are the plans at the smallest unit level and strategy is at the highest, but their overall goals must align for success. Our strategic mission in any military campaign or operation must be clear so that commanders on all levels understand its intent."
BAT_military_logistics_department:0 "Legionary Logistics Corp"
BAT_military_logistics_department_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the saying goes. With the adoption of vehicles, modern weapons, and other tools of warfare; an army marches on its stomach and fights with whatever the motor pool can provide. Our improved Logistics Corps shall ensure that our army has whatever it needs wherever it needs it."
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "Only a fool would have different branches of our military compete with one another for supplies or resources, but we are limited in who we can provide with what. By adopting a Joint Chiefs of Staff to inform the Legionary Council of the different branches' needs, we can better organize and coordinate their efforts with the goal of the state."
BAT_psychological_warfare:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_warfare_desc:0 "All soldiers are susceptible to manipulation, even our own. While our propaganda will remind the Legions what they are fighting for, we shall invest heavily into our own efforts to undermine our enemy's will to fight. It is useless to resist the will of Nightmare Moon and we are her chosen ponies. If the pamphlets do not convince them, the speaker systems will."
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps:0 "The LMRD Chemical Department"
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps_desc:0 "A detachment of LMRD scientists will oversee the training of the first and all future members of the Legion's Chemical Corps. These soldiers will be specialized in utilizing advances in 'tactical use' chemicals such as gas, white phosphorus, and herbicides across all branches of our military while also acting to counter any use of chemical weapons by our enemy."
BAT_blow_them_out:0 "Destruction From Afar"
BAT_blow_them_out_desc:0 "Every life of a Legionnaire is sacred in the eyes of our great goddess. We cannot afford to spend them in her honor with wasteful assaults or risky maneuver tactics taken from heretical bugs. We instead will embrace a doctrine over overwhelming and superior firepower. It is our hope that once our artillery is done with a position that the infantry will simply have to sweep the enemy out of the crater."
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity:0 "Operational Integrity"
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Gone are the days when generals commanded nearly every aspect of a battle. Instead, our commanders will now pass on their plans and intent to subordinates. Those subordinates will do the same down the chain of command. At each level the officers will be able to pursue their own means to completing their respective objectives with disciplined initiative."
BAT_artillery_reliability:0 "Concentrated Fire"
BAT_artillery_reliability_desc:0 "The harder the fighting and the longer the war, the more the Legions lean on its gunners. Our artillery is the King of battle fit for our Holy Empress. We must ensure that the tools of our gunners are reliable as they are on the field of battle. Our Moonspeakers shall bless their shells and our ordnance shall rain the Nightmare's righteous fury from them."
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception:0 "The Batton Plan" #Yes I too want to die for this pun
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception_desc:0 "General Batton's insistence on a flexible, mobile army has lead to his personal development of a new doctrine for the Legions. Hoofcrafted, the 'Batton Plan' copies much from the Changeling school of warfare, but makes modifications that focus on the sustainability of maneuver warfare. If we were to fully commit to this plan, Batton insists our force could be entirely motorized in a matter of years."
BAT_develop_tank_models:0 "Adapt Stalliongradian Blueprints"
BAT_develop_tank_models_desc:0 "The godless heathens in Stalliongrad do not make the best tanks, but they are easy to manufacture and replace. They are also receptive to bribes and are more then willing to lose a few...examples. By adopting the Stalliongrad designs and doctrine, we will gain from the benefit their tanks offer; ease of manufacturing, utility, and numerical superiority."
BAT_develop_anti_tank:0 "The Stanchion"
BAT_develop_anti_tank_desc:0 "The Stanchion is a modern anti-tank rifle that gives its user the power of an anti-tank gun in the power of their hooves. Early trials are promising with live fire demonstrations coming in a matter of months. The ammunition the tank weapon uses can be altered as well depending on the range, target, or environment; all around a promising and unique weapon for our Legions' arsenals."
BAT_replacable_parts:0 "Material Standardisation"
BAT_replacable_parts_desc:0 "We adopted Stalliongradian tanks because of their easily replaceable parts, why not extend this idea to all of our military? By ensuring that reliability and ease of repair is uniform for all our materials, it will become easier to maintain our Legion's lethality during protracted conflicts."
BAT_heavier_tanks:0 "Breakthrough Tactics"
BAT_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Our lighter tanks exceed our expectations with maneuverability, but they do not meet our needs to overcome deeply entrenched enemy positions. Sometimes one cannot simply drive around the enemy, therefore we must invest in developing a heavier model of tank that can drive through the enemy."
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults:0 "All the Little Ponies"
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults_desc:0 "The average machine gun fires hundreds of rounds per minute, but every enemy machine gun has a finite amount of ammo and a limited field of fire. With the blessings of the Nightmare, we cannot fail in overcoming this mortal obstacle. If it fires hundreds of rounds, we shall send thousands of ponies! We will crash upon our enemy like a wave in concentrated assaults!"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics:0 "Stormtrooper Tactics"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics_desc:0 "The Griffonian heretics and their meagre empire have developed an interesting infantry doctrine around 'Infiltration Tactics' and 'Stormtroopers'. By allowing small detachments of our soldiers to survey and attack weak points in the enemy line, we can breakthrough where the enemy least expects us; just like the Stormtroopers of the Griffon Empire."
BAT_redemptionary_brigades:0 "Redemptionary Brigades"
BAT_redemptionary_brigades_desc:0 "Deserters, traitors, labourers, and any other dissidents who are willing to repent their sins shall be given the chance to find redemption through service in these special brigades. It might be cruel, but it is far more efficient to use them as a moving, fighting shield for our other units rather than simply execute them for their crimes."
BAT_combat_enhancers:0 "The LMRD Alchemical Department"
BAT_combat_enhancers_desc:0 "Methamphetamine hydrochloride when mixed with shamanistic positions creates a potent combat enhancement that keeps soldiers alert without the risk of a crash after. We shall encourage our soldiers to consume these enhancements and monitor their effects. These enhancements will be distributed to units in laced gum, chocolates, and tablets for consumption."
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun:0 "The Bits Gun"
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun_desc:0 "Although the Bits gun might look strange and according to reports nearly impossible to carry comfortably, our wayward enemies in Equestria have created a reliable weapon suited for all types of environments. An internal compartment inside the receiver prevents the submachine gun from jamming even after dipped in mud or sand. Even its odd placement of the magazine holds a pragmatic purpose; we must have it for ourselves."
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Sappers"
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps_desc:0 "With the integration of Auxiliary units into combat roles, we can train our engineers to serve a greater purpose in combat. Taken from the Aquileian tradition, our sappers will act as our frontline combat engineers. No matter the danger, the obstacle, or the mission; our sappers will clear a path for our Empress' blessed Legions!"

BAT_the_commonwealth:0 "The Chiropterran Commonwealth"
BAT_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "To the victor, the spoils! We have achieved our goals! Our Second Great Conquest has crushed the armies of our enemies. No organized military, no singular nation that we opposed remains standing to fight us. We shall declare our Commonwealth of nations under the Chiropterran banner, for together we shall achieve the ultimate victory in the generations to come!"
BAT_leaf_lehay_airforce_reforms_2:0 "The LeHay Reforms"
BAT_leaf_lehay_airforce_reforms_2_desc:0 "General LeHay has plans to reform the Air Force into its own independent branch of the military that would be able to win wars on its own. His plans, among other ideas, call for the introduction of large bombers that can devastate cities and an expanded R & D department to ensure the Chiropterran Air Force is the most advanced in the world."
BAT_aerial_supply_drops_2:0 "Aerial Logistics Department"
BAT_aerial_supply_drops_2_desc:0 "As the military expands its capabilities certain challenges have arisen. Among them is the Army's inability to effectively supply their faster moving offensive units and troops stationed outside of the existing supply lines. A new department has been created within the Air Force, composed of purpose-built transport planes, that will supply our far-off troops from the air at a relatively fast pace."
BAT_intercontinental_destruction_2:0 "Intercontinental Operations"
BAT_intercontinental_destruction_2_desc:0 "Thanks to recently increased funds the first batch of our newly designed strategic bombers have been produced. These planes have the potential to win wars on their own if used efficiently and in large numbers. Now it is up to our pilots to develop new tactics for these war machines."
BAT_nuclear_capabilities_2:0 "Nuclear Capabilities"
BAT_nuclear_capabilities_2_desc:0 "The R & D department, together with some of our nation's top scientists and engineers, has made a momentous discovery. A bomb that is capable of vanquishing cities with a single use. With this device in our inventory the might of Chiropterra will be known to all. Some time and funds are required to finalise the plans to build our first atomic bomb."
BAT_exploit_subjects:0 "North Zebrican Resource Allocation Department"
BAT_exploit_subjects_desc:0 "As our borders have been greatly expanded in the wake of our victory, we must look to the just redistribution of North Zebrica's vast resources across the Commonwealth. The shambles of nation states that once held this territory were unable to use the bounty beneath them. It is our holy duty to the Nightmare, to allocate these new assets for the betterment of the Commonwealth as a whole."
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation:0 "Veteran Land Grants"
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation_desc:0 "The lands to the East can hardly be considered loyal territory yet. While we continue to debate what to do with its denizens, we can guarantee a perfectly loyal group by allocating significant portions of the territories to veteran plantations. Not only will this prove to be a boon to our economy, it will reward our former soldiers and plant true citizens of Chiropterra across the Commonwealth."
BAT_literally_boer_militias:0 "Legionary Settlement Defence Force"
BAT_literally_boer_militias_desc:0 "While our pacification brigades are an excellent tool in our arsenal for dealing with stubborn resistance, even our military cannot be everywhere at once. Among loyalists and veterans across the Commonwealth's new territories, we shall empower them to form defensive militias in their towns to combat insurgent forces. This will put much needed pressure onto rebel groups with little cost."
BAT_industrial_decommission:0 "Industrial Relocation Office"
BAT_industrial_decommission_desc:0 "The once...'prosperous' centers of industry in in Tobuck and Warzena were suited for their needs, not that of the Commonwealth. While many locals have protested the decision, it is only logical we relocate these assets where we see fit. These are no longer the factories of corrupt businessponies and warlords, but the means to a greater purpose under Nightmare Moon."
BAT_economic_cartelisation:0 "Economic Cartelisation"
BAT_economic_cartelisation_desc:0 "Our economy, while made to support our war efforts, must be adapted to allow us to accomplish our goals over a greater period of time. To do this, we will embrace the concept of 'Cartelisation' where state owned industries shall dominate their sector of specialization. This will let small businesses prosper while we bend the markets completely to us."
BAT_dealing_with_resistance:0 "Counter-Terrorism Operations"
BAT_dealing_with_resistance_desc:0 "Fighting a uniformed enemy is far easier than fighting a scattered insurgency, but there are many avenues open to us in this regard. The road ahead is dangerous though, failures in containing these threats do not only mean losses today; but losses for decades to come. An insurgency must be dealt with effectively and expediently."
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine:0 "The Flying Arrow Doctrine"
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine_desc:0 "Although far more costly than looking for a fight, the Flying Arrow Doctrine requires a great network of blockhouses and outposts to restrict movement in designated areas. By denying the enemy the freedom of movement from these fixed positions, a mobile quick reaction force will engage any insurgents within these areas once they are spotted."
BAT_drop_squads:0 "Search And Destroy"
BAT_drop_squads_desc:0 "The obscene cost of building a network of overlapping fortifications is maddening! Therefore, we shall engage the enemy where we find them. While the enemy will retain much of their freedom of movement, anytime they congregate in meaningful numbers they will be crushed with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_interbranch_cooperation:0 "Interservice Cooperation"
BAT_interbranch_cooperation_desc:0 "While fighting an insurgency is much more layered than a conventional war, it does share its similarities. Clear lines of communication and integrated chains of command in areas of operation will enable a singular, shared approach as opposed to multiple disconnected efforts from different agencies and branches."
BAT_ban_collective_punishment:0 "Civilian Outreach Programs"
BAT_ban_collective_punishment_desc:0 "An insurgency will continue indefinitely if the civilian population does not want you there. While we cannot change hearts and minds overnight, nor cause further harm by isolating civilians in camps...we can reach out to them. By building roads, schools, and integrating ourselves into their lives peacefully we can turn them against the insurgency."
BAT_WLA_profilieration:0 "The WLA Question"
BAT_WLA_profilieration_desc:0 "The Warzenan Liberation Army failed its purpose as a military unit and as a propaganda piece. The collaborators have proven time and time again to be a failure in the eyes of the Commonwealth. As we finalize our efforts in eliminating organized resistance, the WLA is our final decision; what do we do with them?"
BAT_internment_camps:0 "Internment Camps"
BAT_internment_camps_desc:0 "In an insurgency it is impossible to tell a civilian from an insurgent, so we will no longer attempt to. By rounding up the locals into patrolled and regulated camps, we can let them go about their lives under our watchful eye as we eliminate anyone outside these camps. For if they're outside the camps, clearly they are the enemy."
BAT_special_zones:0 "Local Legionary Commissariats"
BAT_special_zones_desc:0 "A series of joint civilian-military commissariats shall be established in these zones of occupation to deepen our connection to these new territories with our government in Chiropterra. Overtime these shall be dismantled in favor of more conventional governmental structures once the insurgency is pacified down to a local level."
BAT_fresh_blood:0 "Fresh Blood"
BAT_fresh_blood_desc:0 "Much of our high command trained for years to prepare for the great war that never came, they trained to storm Canterlot...to fight through the streets of Manehattan. A new generation has arisen in this conflict, one that trained and succeeded in their liberation of North Zebrica. It is time to recognize their achievements!"
BAT_integration_issue_debate:0 "Integration Woes"
BAT_integration_issue_debate_desc:0 "Our success has come at a less obvious cost. While we have won the war and are dealing with the insurgents, it is clear now that we face another issue entirely; what to do with the civilians in our new territory. Some voices demand immediate enslavement, others suggest that this new influx is an opportunity for change."
BAT_a_time_for_change:0 "A Time Of Change"
BAT_a_time_for_change_desc:0 "The Commonwealth is without equal, its ponies shall thrive under the Nightmare's guiding hoof. It is foolish to think that our past could guide us into the future however, for we must change in the face of our victory! Our new population, although misguided, can be brought into the fold as opposed to just being exploited."
BAT_limit_reprisals:0 "Trustbuilding Campaign"
BAT_limit_reprisals_desc:0 "Our more overzealous soldiers might take it upon themselves to personally limit local villages and towns in the name of the Nightmare following an insurgent attack, but this initiative often leads to numerous dead civilians. We must limit this foolish tendency and replace it with a more unified trust building effort."
BAT_allow_native_landholders:0 "The Native Homeland Act"
BAT_allow_native_landholders_desc:0 "We will make no friends nor enlighten anypony if we go around kicking the natives off their land. The Native Homeland Act will ensure that law-abiding ponies of the Commonwealth will be able to enjoy the lands their ancestors have lived on for centuries. It is their land, but it now rests under our law."
BAT_literal_jizya:0 "The Protected Ponies Initiative" #Literally Jizya/Dhimmi
BAT_literal_jizya_desc:0 "The state is obligated to protect the life of the individual, their property, and their choice of faith...provided of course their loyalty and the acceptance of a higher tax rate. It is an equal exchange that will quell most religious dissidents while also swaying those more susceptible to convert."
BAT_increase_quality_of_life:0 "Improve Quality Of Life"
BAT_increase_quality_of_life_desc:0 "The lands of Tobuck and Warzena were savage places without even the most basic of modern luxuries. We shall bring electricity, roads, and railways to the ponies of these territories and they shall praise the Nightmare for it! An increase in the quality of life improves anypony's feelings towards us."
BAT_nativist_brotherhoods:0 "Support Legionary Brotherhoods" #Essentially Veteran Associations
BAT_nativist_brotherhoods_desc:0 "Our veterans, especially those that settle in North Zebrica, deserve a connection to their brothers and sisters in arms. By encouraging the organization of Legionary Brotherhoods across the Commonwealth, we can help foster continue unity in our communities."
BAT_segregation:0 "The Separate And Harmonious Policy"
BAT_segregation_desc:0 "Those who do not worship the Nightmare cannot be forced to under the Protected Ponies Initiative...but that does not mean they can be in the same schools or buildings as the faithful. As long as each facility is equal to its faithful counterpart, there is no reason not to segregate; right?"
BAT_legal_opposition:0 "Permit Legal Opposition"
BAT_legal_opposition_desc:0 "It has taken many years and many crushed protests for us to finally understand that patriotism is also critique of the Nightmare, not just blind loyalty to her. Legalizing opposition will separate extremists who wish to destroy us and the patriotic who wish to voice complaints peacefully."
BAT_settler_colonies:0 "A Haven For the Faithful"
BAT_settler_colonies_desc:0 "The failures of Operation Moonshine and the subsequent withdrawal of our assets from Equestria and New Mareland meant that we also had to leave many of the faithful behind. However, with our newly acquired territories we now have more than enough room to welcome them to our shores and make a stronger effort to bring them here!"
BAT_they_will_know_their_place:0 "One Nation Under the Nightmare"
BAT_they_will_know_their_place_desc:0 "One nation under the Nightmare, one will, and one people! Our faith and our way are the only way forward into the future. If newly liberated ponies of North Zebrica cannot accept that? Then their children's children will!"
BAT_the_model_communities:0 "Model Lunarist Communities"
BAT_the_model_communities_desc:0 "Our people need living space, a place to call their own in the hostile lands of the East. While we have vanquished their armies and burned their fields, it is time to lay the roots of our future there. By funding expeditions of the faithful to establish settlements in our new lands, we can lay a model of expansion for the future."
BAT_freedom_is_a_luxury:0 "Freedom Is A Luxury"
BAT_freedom_is_a_luxury_desc:0 "The new population of heretics in our Commonwealth must learn that freedom is a luxury bought with faith, family, and service. If they work hard and diligently in our new factories, their grandchildren might have a chance to enjoy proper citizenship."
BAT_teach_the_children:0 "No Foal Left Behind"
BAT_teach_the_children_desc:0 "A child's mind is easy to mold to see the truth of the world. No matter their faith or background, no foal shall go uneducated. They must learn of the Commonwealth's history and the tyrant in Canterlot, they must learn of their supremacy in this world!"
BAT_the_worlds_finest_army:0 "A Society Of Warriors"
BAT_the_worlds_finest_army_desc:0 "The purpose of the Commonwealth is to not build a new nation for Nightmare Moon, its purpose is to wage war for her to reclaim her rightful throne! Our purpose in North Zebrica is but a stepping stone in a far greater effort. Our society is made for war, it will always be made of warriors!"
BAT_slave_states:0 "The Slave States"
BAT_slave_states_desc:0 "Some areas will never be fully pacified or enlightened, we must accept this. Therefore certain regions across the Commonwealth will be designated for their purpose as a source of Labourers and centralized areas to utilize their...unique circumstances."
BAT_reaffirm_council_authority:0 "Respect the Chain Of Command"
BAT_reaffirm_council_authority_desc:0 "It never hurts to remind even the loyal citizen of their place in the Commonwealth, there is only one Empress and the Council is her word in this world until she returns again. The Council's decisions cannot be questioned and must not be ignored; for Nightmare Moon!"

BAT_orders_from_up_top_desc:0 "Praise be to the nightmare! Thanks to our loyal service in facilitating the return of Nightmare Moon, we can finally carry out her will properly.

BAT_empower_the_civilian_government:0 "Civilian Government Empowerment"
BAT_empower_the_civilian_government_desc:0 "The Empress' directive to us specified building up civilian rule in Chiropterra, so we shall abide. Military governors will be removed and replaced with civilian officials, separating the responsibilities of the army and the state from one another."
BAT_loosen_nonbeliever_laws:0 "The One Generation Law"
BAT_loosen_nonbeliever_laws_desc:0 "At the behest of our Empress, we shall make efforts to expedite the integration of natives into our state.

BAT_support_legionary_brotherhoods:0 "Encourage Legionary Brotherhoods"
BAT_support_legionary_brotherhoods_desc:0 "For most of our history, small Brotherhoods of Legionnaires have existed, promoting military service and even charity in some cases. In the past, we often believed these to be breeding grounds for heresy and subversion.

BAT_the_church:0 "They Who Speeek For The Nightmare"
BAT_the_church_desc:0 "One of the Empress' more interesting directives was that the office of Chief Moonspeaker should become a civilian post.

BAT_develop_the_destroyers_desc:0 "Cheap, maneuverable, and swift; it is also easy to see why the Council favors this surface ship. Although not as effective at raiding as our submarines, our destroyers are ancient in comparison to that of our enemies. New hulls and new guns mounted on them will make our surface fleet stronger.

BAT_rapid_urban_modernisation_desc:0 "As the nation's industry grows, so does the urbanisation rate. To ensure that cities can provide work and housing to these new migrants, more land will be given to industries and residences close to them."
BAT_cybersin:0 "Cybersin"
BAT_cybersin_desc:0 "While the Meadow Plan is mostly focused on expanding the commercial and industrial capabilities of the Commonwealth, funds should also be allocated to the scientific areas of these fields. This will ensure that all businesses use the latest technologies and methods to get their profits."
BAT_private_military_contractors:0 "Private Military Design Contractors"
BAT_private_military_contractors_desc:0 "In the spirit of the free market private military designers will be allowed to compete in the economy. They will be free to design and produce weapons to their heart's content. Any innovations they make will, in the end, strengthen Chiropterra as well."

BAT_exploit_subjects_2:0 "North Zebrican Resource Allocation Department"
BAT_exploit_subjects_2_desc:0 "As our borders have been greatly expanded in the wake of our victory, we must look to the just redistribution of North Zebrica's vast resources across the Commonwealth. The shambles of nation states that once held this territory were unable to use the bounty beneath them. It is our holy duty to the Nightmare, to allocate these new assets for the betterment of the Commonwealth as a whole."
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation_2:0 "Veteran Land Grants"
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation_2_desc:0 "The lands to the East can hardly be considered loyal territory yet. While we continue to debate what to do with its denizens, we can guarantee a perfectly loyal group by allocating significant portions of the territories to veteran plantations. Not only will this prove to be a boon to our economy, it will reward our former soldiers and plant true citizens of Chiropterra across the Commonwealth."
BAT_literally_boer_militias_2:0 "Legionary Settlement Defence Force"
BAT_literally_boer_militias_2_desc:0 "While our pacification brigades are an excellent tool in our arsenal for dealing with stubborn resistance, even our military cannot be everywhere at once. Among loyalists and veterans across the Commonwealth's new territories, we shall empower them to form defensive militias in their towns to combat insurgent forces. This will put much needed pressure onto rebel groups with little cost."
BAT_industrial_decommission_2:0 "Industrial Relocation Office"
BAT_industrial_decommission_2_desc:0 "The once...'prosperous' centers of industry in in Tobuck and Warzena were suited for their needs, not that of the Commonwealth. While many locals have protested the decision, it is only logical we relocate these assets where we see fit. These are no longer the factories of corrupt businessponies and warlords, but the means to a greater purpose under Nightmare Moon."
BAT_private_military_contractors_2:0 "Private Military Design Contractors"
BAT_private_military_contractors_2_desc:0 "With our recent victory, it is time to relinquish our centralized approach to weapons production. We will allow instead private businessponies to compete in a free market environment, so that only the best products will have the honour of being employed by our forces. Ah, the beauty of the military-industrial complex!" #AAAAAAH

BAT_dealing_with_resistance_2:0 "Counter-Terrorism Operations"
BAT_dealing_with_resistance_2_desc:0 "Fighting a uniformed enemy is far easier than fighting a scattered insurgency, but there are many avenues open to us in this regard. The road ahead is dangerous though, failures in containing these threats do not only mean losses today; but losses for decades to come. An insurgency must be dealt with effectively and expediently."
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine_2:0 "The Flying Arrow Doctrine"
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine_2_desc:0 "Although far more costly than looking for a fight, the Flying Arrow Doctrine requires a great network of blockhouses and outposts to restrict movement in designated areas. By denying the enemy the freedom of movement from these fixed positions, a mobile quick reaction force will engage any insurgents within these areas once they are spotted."
BAT_drop_squads_2:0 "Search And Destroy"
BAT_drop_squads_2_desc:0 "The obscene cost of building a network of overlapping fortifications is maddening! Therefore, we shall engage the enemy where we find them. While the enemy will retain much of their freedom of movement, anytime they congregate in meaningful numbers they will be crushed with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_interbranch_cooperation_2:0 "Interservice Cooperation"
BAT_interbranch_cooperation_2_desc:0 "While fighting an insurgency is much more layered than a conventional war, it does share its similarities. Clear lines of communication and integrated chains of command in areas of operation will enable a singular, shared approach as opposed to multiple disconnected efforts from different agencies and branches."
BAT_ban_collective_punishment_2:0 "Civilian Outreach Programs"
BAT_ban_collective_punishment_2_desc:0 "An insurgency will continue indefinitely if the civilian population does not want you there. While we cannot change hearts and minds overnight, nor cause further harm by isolating civilians in camps... we can reach out to them. By building roads, schools, and integrating ourselves into their lives peacefully we can turn them against the insurgency."
BAT_WLA_profilieration_2:0 "The WLA Question"
BAT_WLA_profilieration_2_desc:0 "The Warzenan Liberation Army failed its purpose as a military unit and as a propaganda piece. The collaborators have proven time and time again to be a failure in the eyes of the Commonwealth. As we finalize our efforts in eliminating organized resistance, the WLA is our final decision; what do we do with them?"
BAT_internment_camps_2:0 "Internment Camps"
BAT_internment_camps_2_desc:0 "In an insurgency it is impossible to tell a civilian from an insurgent, so we will no longer attempt to. By rounding up the locals into patrolled and regulated camps, we can let them go about their lives under our watchful eye as we eliminate anyone outside these camps. For if they're outside the camps, clearly they are the enemy."
BAT_special_zones_2:0 "Local Legionary Commissariats"
BAT_special_zones_2_desc:0 "A series of joint civilian-military commissariats shall be established in these zones of occupation to deepen our connection to these new territories with our government in Chiropterra. Overtime these shall be dismantled in favor of more conventional governmental structures once the insurgency is pacified down to a local level."
BAT_fresh_blood_2:0 "Fresh Blood"
BAT_fresh_blood_2_desc:0 "Our officer corps has acquired tremendous experience on the field, and they are the envy of all the militaries of the world. Still, many of them are aging by now; a substantial shakeup is required to avoid crystallization of acquired doctrines and to introduce younger minds into our higher ranks. At the very least, they ought to learn a trick or two from their more seasoned colleagues." #AAAAAAH

BAT_the_civilian_government:0 "The Carrot-Crescent Government"
BAT_the_civilian_government_desc:0 "The Governors' Pact has outmaneuvered the Council. Progress and liberty have defeated outdated tradition and oppression.

BAT_limit_reprisals_2:0 "Trustbuilding Campaign"
BAT_limit_reprisals_2_desc:0 "Our more overzealous soldiers might take it upon themselves to personally limit local villages and towns in the name of the Nightmare following an insurgent attack, but this initiative often leads to numerous dead civilians. We must limit this foolish tendency and replace it with a more unified trust building effort."
BAT_allow_native_landholders_2:0 "The Native Homeland Act"
BAT_allow_native_landholders_2_desc:0 "We will make no friends nor enlighten anypony if we go around kicking the natives off their land. The Native Homeland Act will ensure that law-abiding ponies of the Commonwealth will be able to enjoy the lands their ancestors have lived on for centuries. It is their land, but it now rests under our law."
BAT_increase_quality_of_life_2:0 "Improve Quality Of Life"
BAT_increase_quality_of_life_2_desc:0 "The old regime was more concerned with military matters than caring for the nation's people. Resources will be diverted to civilian goods and services, improving the quality of life for our people from their current spartan conditions. This will allow our people to enjoy the hard-earned fruits of their labours."
BAT_veterans_land_grant_act:0 "Encourage Religious Syncretism"
BAT_veterans_land_grant_act_desc:0 "One of the glaring divisions in Chiropterran society is the exclusionary view followers of Nightmare Moon have towards foreign religions. To heal this divide restrictions on other religions will be removed and an effort will be made to amalgamate the most prominent religious views of our people. This will promote integration and understanding among the population."
BAT_a_responsible_government:0 "The Responsible Government Act"
BAT_a_responsible_government_desc:0 "With an accountable government ruling the Commonwealth laws must be introduced to ensure that subsequent governments will be just as responsible. This statute will introduce various checks and balances in state institutions to ensure transparency in their dealings. This Act will also ensure that only officials with integrity will be allowed to work towards improving the nation."
BAT_native_representation_act:0 "The Civil Liberties Act"
BAT_native_representation_act_desc:0 "Under the previous regime all non-thestral creatures were legally discriminated against. Although much has been done to purge this crime a law will be enacted to erase any doubt regarding the rights of sentient beings in our borders. This new statute will proclaim that all sentient beings in the Commonwealth are equal and any form of unfair discrimination will not be tolerated."
BAT_national_brotherhood_administration:0 "The National Brotherhood Administration"
BAT_national_brotherhood_administration_desc:0 "Because of the various conflicts that have taken place in North Zebrica the Commonwealth boasts a large number of veterans, our own soldiers and former enemies alike. To guarantee their integration back to civilian life is as smooth as possible soldiers' fraternities will be created and supported under a larger national department, ensuring they'll receive efficient care."
BAT_religious_tolerance_act:0 "Reform The Hoof"
BAT_religious_tolerance_act_desc:0 "The Hoof has had various assignments to perform in our nation's history. Such as torturers, inquisitors, and informants to name a few of the unsavory jobs. In light of political changes, however, the Hoof is in dire need of reform. It will be changed into an intelligence agency that will inspire trust and cooperation in our people, not fear and submissiveness as in the past."
BAT_military_checks_and_balances:0 "The Military Oversight Committee"
BAT_military_checks_and_balances_desc:0 "Under the previous regime the military was free to do whatever they deemed was necessary to support the war effort. This, at times, involved the indefinite acquisition of private property and the curbing of individual rights. A committee will be established to ensure that the military does not go beyond the scope of its power when carrying out its activities."
BAT_end_the_hierachy:0 "An End To The Hierarchy"
BAT_end_the_hierachy_desc:0 "To create a truly egalitarian society the practice of promoting and hiring individuals based on their social standing and political loyalty must be ended. From this point forward all creatures will be judged based on merit and their achievements and will have equal opportunities to compete for power. This will ensure that those who are in positions of power have earned it."
BAT_new_holidays:0 "Victory In Zebrica Day"

BAT_revisit_chain_gang_system:0 "Railway Blues"
BAT_revisit_chain_gang_system_desc:0 "During the NZW the POW's that were taken by the Chiropterran military were used as physical laborers, most notably to construct railways for their ever-advancing enemies. With the recent regime change, however, there is an ongoing debate on what the future status of this draconian punishment should be."
BAT_church_reforms:0 "The Proper Worship Act"
BAT_church_reforms_desc:0 "The veneration of Nightmare Moon is no longer the state religion. All religions are now separate from the state apparatus and will be, as far as possible, treated equally and as a facet of the private sphere. Government intervention in religious affairs will be reserved only for matters of national security. This Act will ensure these stipulations are encoded in law."
BAT_expand_church_schools:0 "Subsidies For Temple Schools"
BAT_expand_church_schools_desc:0 "As non-thestrals are no longer barred from becoming equal members of society, resources must be spent on ensuring they receive a similar education as thestrals. The majority of settlements in Chiropterra have temples, thanks to the previous regime's fixation on the veneration of Nightmare Moon. By subsidising educational programmes at temples more individuals can receive a quality education."

BAT_the_diarchy:0 "The Council Consolidation Act"
BAT_the_diarchy_desc:0 "The crisis has passed and the Legionnary Council has endured. Now what remains to be done is to assure that such events won't occur again, by crystallizing the role of the Council in the new system of governance. Though a few concession will have to be made, it is worthy to guarantee future stability." #AAAAAAH

BAT_literal_jizya_2_desc:0 "The state is obligated to protect the life of the individual, their property, and their choice of faith...provided of course their loyalty and the acceptance of a higher tax rate. It is an equal exchange that will quell most religious dissidents while also swaying those more susceptible to convert."
BAT_segregation_2:0 "The Separate And Harmonious Policy"
BAT_segregation_2_desc:0 "Those who do not worship the Nightmare cannot be forced to under the Protected Ponies Initiative...but that does not mean they can be in the same schools or buildings as the faithful. As long as each facility is equal to its faithful counterpart, there is no reason not to segregate; right?"
BAT_calibrated_charity:0 "Calibrated Charity Drives"
BAT_calibrated_charity_desc:0 "The consequences of our conquest still linger in the recently acquired territories; many of those ponies and zebras had yet to fully recover from the Storm King's incursion of a decade ago!

BAT_rely_on_the_old_guard_desc:0 "Chiropterra can vaunt a long ancestry, dating back to Equestria's very foundation and then to the brave noble houses that stood by the Nightmare in the time of need. Unlike their griffon counterpart, the Chiropterran aristocrat cannot simply enjoy the wealth brought by hereditament, but has to strive so that the glory earned in the service of the state equals, or surpass, the achievements of his ancestors." #AAAAAAH
BAT_nativist_brotherhoods_2:0 "The National Brotherhood Administration"
BAT_nativist_brotherhoods_2_desc:0 "As veterans head home, it is only natural that they desire to remain in contact with their former comrades. As long as Legionnary Brotherhoods are overseen by specific organs, we see no reason why we shouldn't encourage such practise.

BAT_a1:0 "The Agricultural Reform Act"
BAT_a1_desc:0 "Our old agricultural laws contain numerous relics of an aristocratic age, when plantation-owning families owned much of the land and war with Equestria was top-of-mind. We will pass an act dispensing of such archaisms."
BAT_a2:0 "Fiscal Stabilisation"
BAT_a2_desc:0 "The Chiropterran bit has been unstable ever since we lost the war, with the threat of runaway inflation ever-present. Fortunately the Nightmare's Hoof kept a great deal of Equestrian currency stashed away for use on operations, and we can use that to keep our government afloat long enough to stabilise our own monetary system."
BAT_a3:0 "The Industrial Coordination Office"
BAT_a3_desc:0 "Whether they be aristocratic family businesses, publicly-traded enterprises or worker cooperatives, we should invite prominent firms to a planning table to coordinate resource allocation and subsidies to promote economic recovery."
BAT_a4:0 "Executive Order No. 15"
BAT_a4_desc:0 "We will issue an order that the tens of thousands of freed labourers in Chiropterra be given supplies and economic assistance to get back on their hooves and find a place in our country. It is both the smart thing to do and the right thing to do."
BAT_a5:0 "Shake Hooves With The Old Money"
BAT_a5_desc:0 "Everypony in Chiropterra works hard, labourer or no, so why should we give them special assistance out of the public purse? A few aristocratic families have offered to take care of those recently-freed labourers, offering them room and board in exchange for work, and promising that this will greatly help us rebuild our economy."
BAT_a6:0 "Chiropterran Arcadianism"
BAT_a6_desc:0 "Chiropterra is a beautiful country, with a huge variety of crops we can grow. We will use this natural fertility to build a strong agricultural sector now that ceaseless drilling and the war economy are no longer the order of the day."
BAT_a7:0 "Subsidise Coconut Crab Ranching"
BAT_a7_desc:0 "The coconut crab is a fine piece of livestock, but unfortunately the war left their ranches abandoned and the creatures to run wild. We should subsidize rebuilding these ranches and expanding them so we can tap into this resource once more."
BAT_a8:0 "Infrastructural Reconstruction Effort"
BAT_a8_desc:0 "The war left large sections of our infrastructure destroyed, leaving many towns isolated which were not deemed crucial to the war effort. We should mobilise work brigades to repair these roads, bridges and railways, and make them better than they were before."
BAT_a9:0 "Support Northern Coal Mining"
BAT_a9_desc:0 "We will never have a strong industrial sector without a steady supply of coal to fuel the furnaces. While this work was once done by expendable labourers working in poor conditions, we believe we can do it better with free workers who have decent standards of safety and wages."
BAT_a10:0 "The Just In Time System"
BAT_a10_desc:0 "Traditional manufacturing had each factory keep vast warehouses of raw materials in reserve. This is inefficient. It leads to wastage and spoilage in the event of slowdowns and frequently results in producing more product than customers buy. A better method is to transport materials as and when needed, arriving just in time to make into finished products."
BAT_a11:0 "Restart Cash Crop Exportation"
BAT_a11_desc:0 "In the old system, if we wanted to export anything it would have to be through shell companies and the black market, and the Nightmare's Hoof would have to inspect every shipment to the outside world to ensure it could not be traced back to us. Without all that extra overhead, we can start selling our cash crops on the open market."
BAT_a12:0 "Break Into The Food Processing Industry"
BAT_a12_desc:0 "We have a large and highly skilled industrial workforce, and bountiful land for agriculture. Combining those and the simple machinery we have left, we can become industry leaders in canned goods and other forms of food processing."
BAT_a13:0 "Rebuild The Petrochemical Industry"
BAT_a13_desc:0 "Feeding all these industries requires fuel, and as we are no longer in a position to pillage North Zebrica for oil we shall have to make do with imported petroleum or what we can synthesize on our own. We shall rise to that challenge, and become all the more prosperous for it."
BAT_a14:0 "The Fast Food Industry"
BAT_a14_desc:0 "A new industry is growing in Chiropterra: fast food. As the name suggests, the idea is for new chains of restaurants to serve cheap, appetising food within minutes of the customer ordering it. "Moonburger" may be a tasteless name, but the burgers are tasty!"
BAT_a15:0 "Rekindle Chiropterran Entrepreneurship"
BAT_a15_desc:0 "Chiropterra has always had an innovative, flexible culture that rewards creation and ingenuity. This culture has begun to truly flourish in our republic, where all that creative energy is not solely directed towards finding new ways to kill and exploit."
BAT_a16:0 "The Vocational Education Act"
BAT_a16_desc:0 "Basic literacy is not enough for our citizens. Every Chiropterran citizen should, in addition to primary schooling, have access to free vocational training to go into the skilled trades, or in the case of students who demonstrate intellectual talent, into the sciences."
BAT_a17:0 "Silver Moon Telecommunications"
BAT_a17_desc:0 "Chiropterra has always been at the forefront of cryptology. The vast operations of the Nightmare's Hoof required it. We should turn this expertise in mathematics and electronic engineering to more peaceful applications, becoming leaders in telecom and computers."
BAT_a18:0 "Manufacturing Optimisation"
BAT_a18_desc:0 "Our manufacturing system is growing increasingly sophisticated. We should spread best practices learned in the most innovative firms to promote synergistic efficiency across sectors!"
BAT_a19:0 "The Chiropterran Economic Miracle"
BAT_a19_desc:0 "After our defeat, our people feared a total economic collapse: gangs battling on the streets for scraps as thousands starved and the Chiropterran bit became worthless, leaving us destitute for generations to come. Instead, we have weathered the storm and emerged stronger for it, becoming one of the world's most innovative and competitive economies."

BAT_b1:0 "Chiropterran Remilitarisation"
BAT_b1_desc:0 "Our enemies may have disarmed us, shattered our military, killed or driven off our high command, but they have little way of enforcing our demilitarisation without starting another war. We will immediately begin reintroducing conscription and rebuild our army as quickly as possible, stronger than before."
BAT_b2:0 "Back To The Drawing Board"
BAT_b2_desc:0 "Evidently, the old system of six legions had major flaws. We can no longer afford to be bound by ancient traditions and religious dogmatism: we must look abroad, perhaps far abroad, to redesign our military from the ground up."
BAT_b3:0 "Subsidise Selenic Motors"
BAT_b3_desc:0 "Selenic motors is a civilian automotive company, but they have excellent production methods which could be put to use for military purposes. However, with our economy in shambles few of our citizens are looking to buy cars or tractors. We should bail them out in exchange for putting their expertise to work in our military industrial complex."
BAT_b4:0 "Rapid Rearmament"
BAT_b4_desc:0 "Our enemies could return at any time to crush what we are building. We have to make guns, and fast. Break out the backyard welders, scavenge the old armouries, scrounge whatever we can to rearm as quickly as possible!"
BAT_b5:0 "Kickstart The Automobile Industry"
BAT_b5_desc:0 "We have a surprisingly good automotive industry, but until recently very few buyers apart from the military. With our economy on the road to recovery and foreign markets opening up to us, we can issue a set of government-backed loans to get our automotive industry up and running."
BAT_b6:0 "Support The Stirling Clique"
BAT_b6_desc:0 "Stirling Silver was among the boldest officers in the old legions. He and his friends have intriguing ideas for integrating the elite of the old legions into the structure of our modern military, using them for surgical strikes and behind-enemy-lines operations rather than frontline combat."
BAT_b7:0 "Militia Structural Integration"
BAT_b7_desc:0 "During the brief but bloody period of occupation following our defeat, a number of mixed civilian-military militias emerged to fight our occupiers. We should reach out to these semi-defunct organizations, and integrate those willing to serve into our new army."
BAT_b8:0 "Asymmetric Warfare Training"
BAT_b8_desc:0 "The fact is, the legions can be beaten in the open field. It has happened once, and it can happen again. When that day comes, we must be ready to fight delaying actions, guerilla wars, insurgencies, and generally do whatever it takes to ensure that an operational defeat of the legions does not turn into an overall defeat of our nation, as we may not be able to throw off the next batch of occupiers."
BAT_b9:0 "Legionary Mechanisation Initiative"
BAT_b9_desc:0 "An undisciplined bandit can kill the most elite legionnaire with a piece of stray shrapnel from a mortar. We should roll out shrapnel- and small-arms-proof transport vehicles for our soldiers, so that when they die it will at least be on the battlefield proper and not to some ambush or stray shell."
BAT_b10:0 "The Chiropterran National Guard"
BAT_b10_desc:0 "We shall organize our former legionnaires and civilians into a national guard, who will help with second-line tasks such as refurbishing captured gear and, if necessary, put these scrounged weapons to use launching guerilla attacks on occupying forces."
BAT_b11:0 "The Special Air Service"
BAT_b11_desc:0 "Stirling's efforts have borne fruit, and soon a new generation of special forces will join our army, blending the old legionnaire elan with the precision of modern mission-based tactics."
BAT_b12:0 "The Blue Star Contract"
BAT_b12_desc:0 "It is time to develop a new series of tanks, larger and more heavily-armoured than previous generations and able to withstand modern anti-tank weapons. These will serve as an armoured spearhead, punching through enemy lines and allowing our forces to sweep up the disordered foe."
BAT_b13:0 "Revitalise The Legions"
BAT_b13_desc:0 "The legion system of old is reborn, more robust and strong enough to face the challenges of modern warfare. While wars may be fought with weapons, they are won by soldiers, and we will win the next war because we have the best soldiers!"
BAT_b14:0 "Modern Day Legionarism"
BAT_b14_desc:0 "The legion system will never be reborn, and this is a good thing. Modern wars are won with vast forces, logistics, and technology, not individual prowess and the expertise of a few elite officers. However, this does not mean we have to forget the past entirely: the fighting spirit of the old legions still pervades our army, and there will always be a place for heroism among our ranks."
BAT_b15:0 "Officialise The Civilian Defence League"
BAT_b15_desc:0 "The Civilian Defence League was always in an ambiguous position in the old system, as civilians were not meant to do legionnaires' jobs, but they have more than proven their worth during the period of occupation following the legion's defeat. We should formally integrate them into our armed forces."
BAT_b16:0 "Integrate The National Legionary Brotherhood"
BAT_b16_desc:0 "The National Legionary Brotherhood consists of legionnaires from legions which were too devastated in the aftermath of our defeat to reconstitute, and who refused to join the three remaining legions. We should mobilise these disaffected veterans, recruiting them into a reconstituted legion with their own officers and uniforms."
BAT_b17:0 "Reach Out To The True Moon Society"
BAT_b17_desc:0 "The True Moon Society was a thorn in the side of the legions, refusing to worship the Nightmare and instead worshipping the moon directly, denouncing the entire Chiropterran system as based on lies. Much to our surprise, they have offered to aid our new republic in exchange for an official edict of religious tolerance."
BAT_b18:0 "Nationwide Recruitment Campaign"
BAT_b18_desc:0 "We will rebuild our army, canvassing every city, every town and every small village until we have a grand army to defend our republic and reclaim our lost pride."
BAT_b19:0 "We All Lift Together"
BAT_b19_desc:0 "The time has come. Our armies our ready, our industry is geared up for war, all they need is the order. All together now: socialist, liberal, nationalist, we will all fight as one to reclaim our lands from the invaders! For Chiropterra!"
BAT_b20:0 "The LeHay Reform Plan"
BAT_b20_desc:0 "The old legions never could quite get the hang of how to integrate the airforce into their doctrine, but with their defeat and the establishment of the new republic, we can integrate the airforce into our doctrine from the ground up. Leaf LeHay has some great ideas on how to do just that."
BAT_b21:0 "Airstrip Modernisation"
BAT_b21_desc:0 "We should expand and modernise our airports to accommodate larger more modern aircraft, as well as improving the efficiency of our aluminum refinement to construct a state-of-the-art airforce."
BAT_b22:0 "Air To Land Integration"
BAT_b22_desc:0 "We should build specialised aircraft for ground support, optimised for quick takeoff and landing and for agile dive-bombing to deliver precision fire support to our ground forces."
BAT_b23:0 "Air to Sea Integration"
BAT_b23_desc:0 "Torpedo bombers will be the new terror of the seas, whether launched from an aircraft carrier or a conventional airbase. We will commission new torpedo bomber designs so that our enemies will never rule the seas while we rule the skies."
BAT_b24:0 "Rebuild The Fighter Fleet"
BAT_b24_desc:0 "The fighter plane is the backbone of any airforce. While most of our legion-era fighters were lost, we still have the machinery required to build them, and can improve on their designs to create a new generation of fighter craft."
BAT_b25:0 "Combined Aerial Operations Doctrine"
BAT_b25_desc:0 "Aircraft must work in close coordination with on-the-ground spotters, much as artillery has for many years now. By closely coordinating between the branches, we can minimize friendly fire incidents and ensure our payloads are delivered exactly where and when our ground forces need them most."
BAT_b26:0 "The Strategic Destruction Theorem"
BAT_b26_desc:0 "By targetting enemy infrastructure and war industry, we can chip away at their ability to keep their army in the field and at their fundamental will to fight. While we cannot muster a fleet of the "flying fortresses" Equestria can field, we can use heavier models of tactical bomber to strike enemy industry."
BAT_b27:0 "Bomb Them Back To The Stone Age"
BAT_b27_desc:0 "By carefully planning our bombing raids of enemy cities and installations, we can exploit architectural and planning weaknesses to ensure that fires spread and maximise devastation. Hitting water mains, targetting key intersections, and so on will cause the greatest amount of destruction per ton of ordnance we drop."
BAT_b28:0 "Refurbish The Ursagrad Shipyards"
BAT_b28_desc:0 "The Ursagrad shipyards are large, but outdated. We should outfit them with the newest machinery to rebuild our once-grand fleet."
BAT_b29:0 "Urbanise Moonspeaker Hollow"
BAT_b29_desc:0 "Moonspeaker Hollow was heavily damaged during the liberation. We can rebuild this town better than it was before, and make it the proper city it was always meant to be."
BAT_b30:0 "Reorganise The Marine Corps"
BAT_b30_desc:0 "As our navy revitalises, we ought not to forget the naval infantry. It is only through their elan and grit that naval victories translate to real beachheads stormed and ground taken."
BAT_b31:0 "Modernise The Territorial Fleet"
BAT_b31_desc:0 "The territorial fleet consists of a force of destroyers and other escorts designed to protect our commerce and coastlines from enemy raids. We should not let these vessels fall behind the technology curve."
BAT_b32:0 "A Modern Submarine Fleet"
BAT_b32_desc:0 "The submarine is the most efficient way to cut our enemies off from supplies and resources, turning their trade relations from strengths into weaknesses. We should modernise our submarine fleet to evade modern sonar and keep the pressure on our foes."
BAT_b33:0 "The Chiropterran Naval Aviation Department"
BAT_b33_desc:0 "Naval aviation is the way of the future. Soon battleships will be all but obsolete, kept in port for fear of naval bombers. We should embrace this change, as it will allow us to level the naval playing field with our foes."
BAT_b34:0 "Fuel Conservation Initiative"
BAT_b34_desc:0 "We lack the luxury of having oilfields within our borders. Therefore, we must retrofit our engines to get as many kilometers out of our limited fuel supply as they can."
BAT_b35:0 "Supply Line Disruption Tactics"
BAT_b35_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on disrupting enemy shipping lanes. We may never match the naval forces of naval powers like Wingbardy and Hippogriffia, but we can still prove a mighty inconvenience to them with the right tactics."
BAT_b36:0 "Long Distance Operations"
BAT_b36_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on projecting power far afield, striking enemies who thought they were out of our range. Chiropterra will rule the waves!"
BAT_b37:0 "Jet Technology Experiments"
BAT_b37_desc:0 "Jet engines will revolutionise aviation, that much is obvious. What is less obvious is whether we will be able to capitalise on that revolution, or get left in the dust by it. We've assembled the brightest minds in Chiropterra to ensure that it's the former."

BAT_c1:0 "Keep The Scarlet Banner Flying"
BAT_c1_desc:0 "Rejoice, creatures of Chiropterra! The defeat of the legions paves the way for the victory of the worker. The night is dark, but the moon shall light our way to a new age where the worker shall lead, not the callous legionnaire."
BAT_c2:0 "Liberty, Freedom and Egalitarianism"
BAT_c2_desc:0 "Even in the old days, there was an undeniable streak of meritocracy and egalitarianism within Chiropterra. With the dogma of the legions and the injustice of the labourer system no longer keeping it down, that spirit can flourish in our new republic."
BAT_c3:0 "The Unbroken Spirit Of Legionarism"
BAT_c3_desc:0 "They may have taken our lands, but they have not taken our spirit! The legions may have fallen, but the spirit of sacrifice, patriotism and determination they represented should never be forgotten. We will build a new Chiropterra, a stronger Chiropterra on its foundations."
BAT_c4:0 "Mobilise The Working Class"
BAT_c4_desc:0 "Our economy may have collapsed, but it is not "the economy" which works the factories: it is the workers. If we get Dusk Wane to talk to them, to listen to them, to promise them a better future, then they will work for that future even if we have to pay them in barter."
BAT_c5:0 "The Jackal And The Diplomat"
BAT_c5_desc:0 "Carrot Stick has received an intriguing offer: one of the most infamous rebels of Chiropterra, known only as The Jackal, has agreed to put his considerable contacts to use helping our cause. While his motives are his own, his True Moon Society was one of the few heretic cells that was able to evade the Nightmare's Hoof, so his qualifications speak for themselves."
BAT_c6:0 "Old Buddies From The Hoof"
BAT_c6_desc:0 "The Nightmare's Hoof may have basically collapsed, but its agents are still out there, many of them sitting on storehouses of weapons intended for smuggling, destabilising Equestria, or other covert operations. As an old member, Carrot Stick knows where to find them and how to negotiate with them to get them on our side."
BAT_c7:0 "Batton's Good Old Colts"
BAT_c7_desc:0 "Batton was never a lord commander, but he was well-liked in every legion. If we send him down to the pubs and the old barracks, he'll be able to convince those fine colts to take up arms again for their country, rather than drinking themselves to death or going mercenary."
BAT_c8:0 "The Freedequine's Bureau"
BAT_c8_desc:0 "We need to organise all these recently-freed labourers, to integrate them into the workforce and the army. Many of them are Lunarist converts, and many more are willing to fight for the republic. So long as we ensure that at the end of the night, that republic will be their republic."
BAT_c9:0 "Faith And Labour"
BAT_c9_desc:0 "Religious values of charity and the belief in a higher power compel us to be kind to one another, particularly to the less fortunate, and not to greedily grasp for as much as we can take. On the other hoof, we acknowledge labour as the source of all good things in life. It should be gladly undertaken by all those able to work, rather than treated as a drudgery to be foisted off to slaves and the desperate."
BAT_c10:0 "Meadownomics"
BAT_c10_desc:0 "Socialist sloganeering and militaristic discipline are not what make a strong economy. We need to run things according to tried and tested free market principles. We should adopt some of the practices of Carrot Stick's ally Spring Meadow, fostering the entrepreneurial spirit she promoted in her own business across the sectors of Chiropterra's economy."
BAT_c11:0 "The Legions Of Labour"
BAT_c11_desc:0 "Army organization is the most efficient there is, so why not organize work brigades like we do military units? Giving our workers a strict chain of command and clear objectives while also allowing enough room for lower-level officer-managers to innovate and take risks will let us rebuild our country faster and better."
BAT_c12:0 "Leave The Wetwork To Stirling"
BAT_c12_desc:0 "We can't trust the Jackal, and we can't rely on a bunch of barely-trained former labourers. What we need is a disciplined force of commandos with plenty of experience to lead the charge and strike deep into enemy territory. The old legion commanders didn't take him seriously, but Batton knows that Stirling Silver is just the pony to lead such a strike force."
BAT_c13:0 "Denounce The Crescent Moon Society"
BAT_c13_desc:0 "There is not a labourer in Chiropterra who hasn't lost a friend or been scarred by the horrific experiments of the LMRD. They were the worst part of the legions, and the Crescent Moon Society is a continuation of their evil. There shall be no cooperation with them, no amnesty, no agreements, nothing. Every labourer in Chiropterra will cheer when Ocean Spray finally hangs."
BAT_c14:0 "The Dusk Wane Radio Sermons"
BAT_c14_desc:0 "Our people need a kindly voice, to reassure them that their struggles mean something, that the bad old days will never return, and to make them hopeful for the future rather than falling into despair at the present. They need faith to bring them through these dark times, and Dusk Wane will nurture that faith."
BAT_c15:0 "The Peace And Reconciliation Committee"
BAT_c15_desc:0 "Our people don't need Dusk Wane's divisive sermons or Batton's silly tour. They need unity, and they need truth. We will set up a committee to sort fact from fiction about the Labourer system and its abuses, the LMRD, and the failures of the legions both strategic and moral. The committee's reports will guide reparation and reconciliation for years to come."
BAT_c16:0 "Utilise The Crescent Moon Society"
BAT_c16_desc:0 "We hardly want to return to the Legionnaire system of old, never mind one dominated by the horrors of the LMRD. Still, weapons are weapons, and we need all we can get. So long as he does not ask for too much in return, we will accept some of Ocean Spray's help."
BAT_c17:0 "Batton's Jolly Old National Tour"
BAT_c17_desc:0 "Our people need somepony to rally behind, somepony with guts and flair. Batton will organize a nationwide tour to perk up our citizens, and remind them that Chiropterra is something to be proud of."
BAT_c18:0 "Old Friends From The LMRD"
BAT_c18_desc:0 "The LMRD were distasteful, but Batton had plenty of friends who worked there who were decent enough sorts. It would be in all of our interests to sit down with Ocean Spray and work out a real cooperation agreement, so that we can regain our pride and rebuild our nation together."
BAT_c19:0 "Long May Our Blue Banner Inspire"
BAT_c19_desc:0 ""The hour of our liberation draws near. Our purpose is clear, our cause is just: we work, we fight, we struggle together for a brighter future free of bondage. Guided by the moonlight, we march for a better world.""
BAT_c20:0 "Faith And Nation"
BAT_c20_desc:0 ""Ready ponies? Alright! Our numbers are many, and our foes cannot hope to stand against us. Forward, proud foals of Chiropterra, for Empress and for homeland!""
BAT_c21:0 "Unity Above All Else"
BAT_c21_desc:0 ""We stand together, united in freedom and friendship. We will not allow class, species, or our place within the old order to divide us. We will all work together to retake our lands, and to build a prosperous, kind, and free society upon them.""

BAT_d1:0 "The Long Road To Forgiveness"
BAT_d1_desc:0 "The war was over and the old regime of Chiropterran has been toppled. In its place, Dusk Wane stepped onto the pedestal to lead the country toward a brighter future."
BAT_d2:0 "Denounce The Past"
BAT_d2_desc:0 "From forceful assimilation to the oppression of the workers, and the pressure exerted on Princess Luna: Our proud nation has committed acts of terrorism and extortion in the name of Nightmare Moon, and to continue on the new path we must recognize our crimes."
BAT_d3:0 "The Convocation Of Moonspeakers"
BAT_d3_desc:0 "There will have to be a council of moral and religious guidance to steer Chiropterran in the right direction to keep order. Dusk Wane will send out a call for Moonspeakers all across the land, so the most experienced advisors can guide the Republic."
BAT_d4:0 "The Principle Of Cultural Solidarity"
BAT_d4_desc:0 "Every culture is built atop a foundation of key values. Honour, loyalty, faith, or duty. From here, the foundation of Chiropterra should be one of mutual aid. Helping a starving neighbor, struggling friend, or bankrupt family member."
BAT_d5:0 "Open Up The Archives"
BAT_d5_desc:0 "The average pony only has a loose idea of what the past regime did for Nightmare Moon. Our claims of atrocities will ring hollow unless we open up the vaults and make classified information public."
BAT_d6:0 "Labourist Confederalism"
BAT_d6_desc:0 "The old system was corrupt and rewarded those at the top. We have to reform the hierarchy of society and give power to the unions to ensure that the fruits of our land are distributed equally."
BAT_d7:0 "Deradicalisation And Rehabilitation Programs"
BAT_d7_desc:0 "A significant margin of Chiropterran criminals are militant followers of Nightmare Moon and will continue to threaten our new government unless we act. However, most of these ponies have only been exposed to extremist propaganda. It would be beneficial to give them a chance to unlearn this fanatical doctrine before taking any severe actions."
BAT_d8:0 "Encourage The Under The Moon Movement" #Basically Christiant Tent Revivalism but Socialist
BAT_d8_desc:0 "Across the country, Moonspeakers from all walks of life and sects have come to preach forgiveness, healing, and peace. Increasingly more and more they have begun to preach over radio channels to spread their words far and wide. If we can spread their voice farther it should help more ponies recover."
BAT_d9:0 "The Faith And Reason Movement"
BAT_d9_desc:0 "Faith and reason should not be two opposites of the same coin, and rather should be used together to expand one's understanding of their faith beyond what they were simply taught."
BAT_d10:0 "Many Gods, One Moon"
BAT_d10_desc:0 "Chiropterra, and Zebrica at large, has many local religions and deities that are worshipped. If we begin to equate those deities to the moon and stars, then we can begin to assimilate their worshippers in the future."
BAT_d11:0 "Faith Needs No Race And Sees No Blood"
BAT_d11_desc:0 "Whether somecreature is from Hippogriffia, or if they are a Herzlander, a pony from Equestria, or a changeling, we are all the same under the Lunar light. As long the Moon is embraced by any who come to our shores, they will be welcomed into our communities with no hesitation."
BAT_d12:0 "One Family Under The Moon"
BAT_d12_desc:0 "The Moon has always been seen as the mother of any worshipper of her, and a guardian to her children. We should reflect that in our government, being a guardian to the local authorities, instead of an all-consuming state. "
BAT_d13:0 "Reparations For The Fallen"
BAT_d13_desc:0 "Many ponies were enslaved and taken advantage of by the old legions and the labour system. Once the old regime collapsed, they were freed, but with no help in starting their new lives. The least we can do for them is repair the damage we caused."
BAT_d14:0 "Reorganise The Nightmare's Hoof"
BAT_d14_desc:0 "The Nightmare's Hoof was the old intelligence agency of Chiropterra, and many members still exist. It would be in our best interest to reform it, but it should be remade into a less cruel and more limited agency."
BAT_d15:0 "Decentralise The Civil Defence Force"
BAT_d15_desc:0 "Making our forces into smaller groups will make it easier for them to respond to threats. Gathering loyalty from the entire force would also be much more difficult and might prevent an armed coup."
BAT_d16:0 "The Doctrine Of Socialist Pacifism"
BAT_d16_desc:0 "Starting wars will no longer be our business. However, we will not be defenseless, and any invasion of Chiropterran soil will be met with tooth and hoof."
BAT_d17:0 "Ensure Government Transparency"
BAT_d17_desc:0 "The ponies of our nation should trust the new government, and in order to do that, we need to ensure transparency with the public."
BAT_d18:0 "Red Moon Rising"
BAT_d18_desc:0 "The time has come to make a push and unify the country under one leader, to show all that the Lunar grace rests upon Dusk Wane's head. Prosperity, stability and unity for all."
BAT_d19:0 "The Law Of Welcome" #Basically the Israeli Law Of Return but for Lunarists
BAT_d19_desc:0 "Lunarists around the world may find themselves being harassed by their neighbours for being "deviants" while practicing their religion. Therefore, a new law will be promulgated that will ensure that all foreign Lunarists who which to immigrate to Chiropterra will receive citizenship on arrival, welcoming them to their new home."
BAT_d20:0 "The Rehabilitative Law System"
BAT_d20_desc:0 "Those that fought for and against the previous regime committed horrible acts that have fractured our nation's unity. In the name of reconciliation various rehabilitation courts will be opened to encourage discussions between victims and offenders on both sides, free of judgement. This will hopefully encourage forgiveness among the former enemies."
BAT_d21:0 "A Culture Of Charity"
BAT_d21_desc:0 "In order to build a stronger sense of community nationwide we will encourage a culture of charity among the population. This will heal any divisions that still exist between our citizens. By helping your neighbour, you support and strengthen your community."
BAT_d22:0 "Ensure Minority Representation"
BAT_d22_desc:0 "An effort must be made to guarantee that the voices of all our nation's citizens are heard, no matter how small their community is. Representatives for all previously marginalised groups will be inducted into the government to ensure that everyone's needs are met."
BAT_d23:0 "A Nation Of Many Peoples"
BAT_d23_desc:0 "We are all different, whether it is our religion, culture or race that sets us apart. But these qualities should be celebrated, not hidden. We should all be proud of what makes us unique as we are united in our diversity."
BAT_d24:0 "The People's Legions"
BAT_d24_desc:0 "It is the military's job to protect our citizens, therefore, it should be composed of members from all of our nation's communities. Thus, we will encourage underrepresented communities to sign up for military service. We may be many people but we are one nation, so all must do their part."
BAT_d25:0 "The Right To A Conscientious Objection"
BAT_d25_desc:0 "We are no longer in the age of forced military deployment. It must be established that every creature has the right to conscientiously object to military service, and be allowed to partake in other means of helping the state."
BAT_d26:0 "Pluralise The Military Chaplain System"
BAT_d26_desc:0 "Making space within the new military hierarchy for more military chaplains will allow us to keep up the faith, but also give our troops an outlet for their needs. Our new reformed legions will be more understanding of the uniqueness of every creature."
BAT_d27:0 "Strict Rules Of Engagement"
BAT_d27_desc:0 "No more will we be party to a warmongering society. That does not mean we are defenseless. However, our new legions will operate under strict rules of engagement, to ensure that all creatures in our borders are safe and prosperous."
BAT_d28:0 "Adjust The LeHay Doctrine"
BAT_d28_desc:0 "It may be necessary that our aerial forces take more clinical measures when attacking an enemy. Concentrating our efforts on bomber warfare and targetting key things like railways and infrastructure will at least help minimise future civilian casualties."
BAT_d29:0 "The Aerial Supply Train"
BAT_d29_desc:0 "It has been noted that there is considerable room for utilisation of aerial supply methods to aid our troops. Whilst we can build railways and infrastructure to get supplies to wherever they are needed, transport aircraft can get there with a lot less time spent."
BAT_d30:0 "Prioritise Armour Development"
BAT_d30_desc:0 "Pivoting our research and development focus into more advanced methods of armoured warfare seems to be a good choice. Our creatures are precious, and tanks are very resilient. An increased focus in utilisation of armour will help our legions greatly."
BAT_d31:0 "Modular Magical Weapon Development"
BAT_d31_desc:0 "Magical weapons are very well and good, but the production of these advanced systems is a hindrance on our resources. We have to be smarter. If we overhaul these weapons systems to be modular, we can simply build components as we need, and swap things to adapt to new situations."
BAT_d32:0 "The Legions Of Peace"
BAT_d32_desc:0 "What used to be a sign of the great oppression from our state will now be heralded as a sign of the great rise in the prosperity and unity of the nation. Our new, reinvigorated legions will be a symbol of peace and economic prosperity through the miracle of communal effort."
BAT_d33:0 "Labourist Economics"
BAT_d33_desc:0 "It is crucial that production continues to be divested away from the lingering remnants of capital. Workers themselves know which commodities and resources they require, so we should utilise their direct experience in fulfilling supply and demand, rather than the abstract wants of some rich elitist."
BAT_d34:0 "Economic Diversification"
BAT_d34_desc:0 "We must continue to emphasise to the workers of the need to innovate, without the need for capital investment. More factories are needed, and more production lines running once. This will allow the labourers to truly benefit from their work."
BAT_d35:0 "The Socialisation Of Commodities"
BAT_d35_desc:0 "Every creature requires things, we understand this. By encouraging all creatures in our borders to collectivize essentials and non-essentials, those that are without will soon be those with, and all will be balanced."
BAT_d36:0 "The Ivory-Wane Labour Reform Act"
BAT_d36_desc:0 "Enshrining final rights of the workers is the last step we need in advancing our economic miracle. A unified society that works for each other, together, will be nigh unstoppable. Our factories will produce the most, and without any exploitation of labour."
BAT_d37:0 "Optimise Transportation"
BAT_d37_desc:0 "Effort put into going from A to B will pay for itself greatly in terms of efficiency. We can become a shining example of collectivised travel if sufficient work is put into overhauling our road networks, and it'll aid in industrial transportation too."
BAT_d38:0 "The Tlalli System Of Production" #Kibbutz system
BAT_d38_desc:0 "We have large spots of land that are ripe for agricultural development. It should be a goal to encourage citizens to form agrarian communities in this land and to farm it to the best of their ability. Allowing them to build and collectively own their housing will make for a more unified community."
BAT_d39:0 "The Peaceful Atom"
BAT_d39_desc:0 "Technology is not something to be feared. True, the great power of the atom can be used for war, but it has significant peaceful benefits. Making efforts to use this radical technology for power generation will stand us in good stead as a growing country."
BAT_d40:0 "The People's Moonburger"
BAT_d40_desc:0 "Fast food has become quite a hit amongst the populace. We should take steps to associate the glory of this available foodstuff by linking it with the wonders of our doctrines. It is not MY fast food, it is OUR fast food."
BAT_d41:0 "The Long Term Socialist Transition"
BAT_d41_desc:0 "Compared to the horrors of capitalism, the way we do things is much more inherently stable. Thus, planning and producing for the future will serve us greater rather than normal production, the usual pattern of labour exploitation. No more, never again!"

BAT_e1:0 "The Republican Dream"
BAT_e1_desc:0 "After surviving the oppression and ruthlessness of the previous regime our subjects yearn to live in a free nation that will listen and tend to their gripes. Fascists would only try to quash dissent and the anarchy that comes with the communists could throw Chiropterra over the edge. Only democracy can lead us to prosperity and harmony."
BAT_e2:0 "Ratify The Constitution"
BAT_e2_desc:0 "A new constitution must be promulgated to remove any uncertainty regarding the values and goals of our new government. This new constitution will stipulate and protect the rights of all who find themselves within our borders, whether they be citizens, foreigners or stateless."
BAT_e3:0 "State Secularisation"
BAT_e3_desc:0 "The Lunarist regime was a theocracy, running the government with inefficient and regressive rituals, laws and procedures. This only turned the bureaucracy into a feudal-like system and alienated large numbers of our population who practise other religions. The state must be secularised in order to become efficient and inclusive to all."
BAT_e4:0 "The Panedha Labourer Clause" #Every person who was in the Labourer System formally or informally before the founding of the Republic is made an official full-fledged citizen of the Republic regardless of generation or faith, named after Admiral Pandeha who is a zebra and a member of Batton's old party
BAT_e4_desc:0 "The blight of slavery must be removed if we wish to call ourselves a democratic nation. Every creature who is currently a member of the Labourer caste will be given full citizenship, regardless of race or religion, giving them all the benefits that citizens enjoy. A long overdue emancipation from their enslavement."
BAT_e5:0 "The Land Of Opportunity"
BAT_e5_desc:0 "Chiropterra got a second chance to right the wrongs of the previous regime. It is only fitting that our nation should become a land of second chances for all who want to change their lives for the better. Thus, immigration will be encouraged for those who wish to live their lives freely and are willing to work for a Chiropterra that is for everyone."
BAT_e6:0 "Deradicalisation And Rehabilitation Programs"
BAT_e6_desc:0 "The previous regime affected everyone. Victims are still recovering from their scars. Collaborators struggle with the shame and disillusionment born from their actions. Some of our citizens are still loyal to the fascists... All must be helped and guided on the path to recovery and understanding. Only together can we move forward."
BAT_e7:0 "Nurture The People"
BAT_e7_desc:0 "The previous regime left our people to fend for themselves by using all our nation's resources to prepare for war. We are not as callous. A social security net will be put in place to assist any creature who is in dire straits. By helping the vulnerable we will all become stronger."
BAT_e8:0 "Every Creature's Private Matter"
BAT_e8_desc:0 "Our citizens should no longer fear a visit from the Nightmare's Hoof for having different beliefs than the majority of the population. All creatures should be free to think and do whatever they want behind closed doors as long as they do not harm anyone."
BAT_e9:0 "The Chiropterran Civic Religion"
BAT_e9_desc:0 "Officially the Republic will be a secular nation. We will, however, encourage our citizens to participate in their local communities with religious-like resolve, whether it is through doing their jobs dutifully or by helping those in need. This new culture of steadfastness will foster a stronger sense of unity among our people."
BAT_e10:0 "Mandate Religious Pluralism"
BAT_e10_desc:0 "Chiropterra no longer has a state religion that is forced upon all who are inside its borders. All of our citizens are free to worship whoever they want to. We must ensure that this fundamental right is protected by enacting the necessary laws."
BAT_e11:0 "Chiropterra Is A Tune" #Reference to the following quote - 'America is a tune. It must be sung together.'
BAT_e11_desc:0 "And it must be sung together. Like many different instruments of an orchestra, only in unison can we bring reform to Chiropterra's new future." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e12:0 "Abolish Nightmareist Moral Law" #Basically making it so that Chiropterran laws no longer abide by religious scripture ect 
BAT_e12_desc:0 "Nightmareist tradition and scripture has guided Chiropterran for a thousand years, but the world has changed far beyond what our founders could dare imagine. Chiropterra's laws must adapt to the factors dictated by the present, not the beliefs of the past." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e13:0 "Naturalisation Policies"
BAT_e13_desc:0 "The Legionary Council's vicious naturalisation policies caused more harm and deaths than actually producing new citizens. We must draft new procedures that will guarantee the lives and growth of all Chiropterra's population." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e14:0 "The Law Of Welcome"
BAT_e14_desc:0 "While one cannot force everypony to be welcoming towards others, we can subtly transform Chiropterra's culture by adjusting current practices and rhetoric. In due time, to welcome others and be welcomed in return will be but a simple common courtesy in our lands." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e15:0 "Nurture Immigrant Pluralism"
BAT_e15_desc:0 "Each of us are different in many ways and nopony's personal experiences exactly mirrors each other's, but it is in this entropic discourse that gives Chiropterra life and allows the nation to grow. Newcomers wishing to live in Chiropterra shouldn't be forced to discard their past, and our immigration laws should reflect this." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e16:0 "The Frontier Spirit"
BAT_e16_desc:0 "Not all of Chiropterra's lands are beautiful coastlines with cool sea breezes and temperate climates. Many areas are still rugged and inhospitable to the common creature even after centuries of civilization. Fire up that Chiropterran frontier spirit because it is time to officially tame these lands as ours!" #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e17:0 "Planned Settlement"
BAT_e17_desc:0 "Perhaps we should add some settlement planning towards Chiropterra's frontiers instead of letting everypony begin claiming swaths of land as private property. It'll definitely cause less of a headache with our cartographers." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e18:0 "The Mistakes Of The Past Redeemed"
BAT_e18_desc:0 "Everyday Chiropterran must answer for the atrocities of its past, but we must not allow guilt to consume the way forward nor let arrogance lead us astray. These are but the first of many steps towards redemption." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e19:0 "Reforge The Intelligence Community"
BAT_e19_desc:0 "As a stallion with a keen mind, Carrot Stick knows how vital the intelligence field can be. Though unlike the cutthroat and terroristic prerogative of the past regime, Carrot Stick sees the opportunity to create a new intelligence organization for Chiropterra - a more persuasive, efficient, and, above all, more effective one." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e20:0 "Expand The Vocational Education Act"
BAT_e20_desc:0 "Sign-on bonuses, pension enrollment programs, free dental, a benefits tier system... There are plenty of ways Chiropterra can make its most needed jobs more rewarding for specialized workers who put in the extra hoof." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e21:0 "Ensure Free School Lunches"
BAT_e21_desc:0 "No filly or young creature should not worry about not eating, nor should parents struggle over providing food for their little ones. With proper funding, Chiropterra's schools can offer students free lunch meals (which actually taste good). A healthy mind starts with a healthy stomach!" #Ardent Custodian - I imagine the students absolutely forming a bartering market with the lunch items 
BAT_e22:0 "The Rehabilitative Penal Code"
BAT_e22_desc:0 "If these last few years have taught Chiropterra anything, it's that the right to redemption knows no bounds. We should instill laws and programs to help the criminal remodel themselves into proper, law-abiding citizens again. The process itself will be hard, but unlike in times past, it will be achievable. We must not give up on fellow Chiropterrans, even if they have given up on themselves." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e23:0 "Let Us March To Make All Free"
BAT_e23_desc:0 "From its own terrible past, Chiropterra knows exactly what the chains of tyranny are and the many disguises it can hide behind. May we never again be quelled by its malevolence, and may none be prisoner of its fate ever again." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e24:0 "The Legions Of Democracy"
BAT_e24_desc:0 "A legion is comprised of a vast many, not a specific few. If Chiropterra is to be a nation for all, it military should represent such. Creatures who wish to fight for us should be allowed to join our armed forces to defend all who call themselves Chiropterrans." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e25:0 "Embrace The Military-Industrial Complex"
BAT_e25_desc:0 "The world has changed. For as much as our want for peace, Chiropterra must also keep up with change brought about by conflict. Subsidizing further military research and technological advancements to private competitors will allow our military to keep its edge and simultaneously expand jobs. " #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e26:0 "Pluralise The Military Chaplain System"
BAT_e26_desc:0 "With the influx of new species joining the ranks of Chiropterra's Legions, we will accommodate those who hold different religious beliefs while serving our nation. Soldiers can be of any creature and hold whatever viewpoints and beliefs, but they are the ones who shoulder the responsibility of defending Chiropterra. Obliging their religious beliefs is the least we can do." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e27:0 "Rationalise Military Penal Laws" #No, you can't commit war crimes anymore
BAT_e27_desc:0 "For a more effective and morally functional military, Chiropterra's Legions must be held accountable for their own actions, inactions, and discrepancies. Unlike regular laws, however, special codes and regulations that are specifically tailored to the realities of military life must be implemented. No creature is above the law, regardless of rank." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e28:0 "Adjust The LeHay Doctrine"
BAT_e28_desc:0 "There is no deniability that the LeHay doctrine's principles for air forces are sound, but whereas the past regime encouraged indiscriminate destruction, our forces today should instead adopt a more targeted approach. Leaf LeHay is more than happy to lend assistance for doctrinal improvements once again." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e29:0 "The Aerial Supply Train"
BAT_e29_desc:0 "Crossing distances of rugged terrain can grind even the most crucial of supplies to a halt. Making our supply lines airborne through the use of thestral, pegasi, and aircraft will enable our ground forces to operate in even the most hazardous landscapes no matter how far." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e30:0 "Organise The National Guard"
BAT_e30_desc:0 "If everypony joins the Legions, there won't be any citizen left to run the civilian side of our nation. A compromise can be reached. Unlike fulltime Legions, the members of the National Guard can hold civilian jobs while also being ready to mobilize for both foreign and domestic emergencies." #Ardent Custodian the National Guard is a part time job in the military my ass!
BAT_e31:0 "Expand The Special Air Service"
BAT_e31_desc:0 "Quality? Quantity? An age-old question. When it came time to ask for preferences, the Special Air Service commandos said Chiropterra should just simply combine the two." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e32:0 "The Sword Of Zebrican Democracy"
BAT_e32_desc:0 "We are not just the guardians of Chiropterra, nor are we the sword of a new era. We are the vanguard, the Sword of Zebrican Democracy. We are the Sword and Shield of Zebrican Democracy, and we will never put it down."
BAT_e33:0 "The Meadow-Ivory Commission"
BAT_e33_desc:0 ""Have you ever seen the disparity?" some ask on the street. Others ask the question of what people will do about it. All that and more is included in a report that just landed from a commission. One which strongly recommends its findings be put into action."
BAT_e34:0 "The National Entrepreneurial Fund"
BAT_e34_desc:0 "Sometimes all an entrepreneur needs is a little jumpstart. Investing a grant to fund the most ingenious of startups will incentivize economic trailblazers to competitively demonstrate to Chiropterra how much potential they really have. Necessity is the mother of innovation. " #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e35:0 "The Ivory-Wane Labour Reform Act"
BAT_e35_desc:0 "Every Chiropterran should have a set of basic securities to protect against wanton exploitation and maliciousness. With the help of certain political activists, a legislation can be enacted that will guarantee a lawful standards of rights for all employees and employers." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e36:0 "The Chiropterran Highway System" #American highways
BAT_e36_desc:0 "Dirt roads and worn paths may have all the razor charm of the wilderness, but they offer no benefits for personal vehicle owners, whose numbers grow by the day. Building a network of roads connecting to each of Chiropterra's towns would not only make travel across the nation easier, but also lessen drive time considerably." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e37:0 "The Tlalli System Of Production" #Kibbutz system
BAT_e37_desc:0 "There are vast regions of untilled land and untamed wilderness in our own domain - All those places, all those opportunities and resources barren. And a group of ponies ready to exploit them and utilize them. We should give them our full support in making the best of this."
BAT_e38:0 "Innovative Economic Development"
BAT_e38_desc:0 "The current conditions of economy allows for plenty of opportunities to test new growth models and financial theorems. Chiropterra must foster this modernization if it is to achieve prosperity." #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e39:0 "The Peaceful Atom"
BAT_e39_desc:0 "Expanding upon the research of Equestria's head nuclear scientist and Element of Kindness, Fluttershy, our experts will be able to make significant advances in the field of atomic energy. " #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e40:0 "Privatise The Moonburger"
BAT_e40_desc:0 "Moonburger has become a staple favorite of Chiropterrans and its franchises has profited immensely. If we purchase all of Moonburger's public shares and privatise the company, its profits would greatly contribute to our budget for future prospects. One Crater Combo please! Ooo, a Princess Luna plushie!" #Ardent Custodian
BAT_e41:0 "The Mixed Economic Model"
BAT_e41_desc:0 "Too much government oversight will cause stagnation while too little will enable unfathomable risks that could lead to collapse. Chiropterra must have a harmonic balance between the two principles that will enable stabilized long-term growth." #Ardent Custodian

BAT_f1:0 "Like the Good Old Days"
BAT_f1_desc:0 "Now that Gorge Z. Batton is at the helm of Chiropterra, it's finally time for a return to the old times of the nation, back when we could look at each other and our soldiers with pride and glory. There is no going back to the system of before, but our new Republic will be the face of who we are as a people: strong, proud and united."
BAT_f2:0 "The National Address"
BAT_f2_desc:0 "With the onset of renewed violence within Chiropterra, many civilians are worried for the future under our new government. We need to calm them down and reassure them that we can deal with the situation, and the best way to do that is to be direct. President Batton will personally go on the air to give a national address via radio, to inspire our proud people once more."
BAT_f3:0 "The Batsby Convention"
BAT_f3_desc:0 "The faith of Chiropterra, despite its age, was rarely put into text or solid foundations to be followed. Instead, the exact specifications were left to individual moonspeakers to make up on their own. If we are to help tie together Chiropterrans once more, we need to have some semblance of unity in faith, and so a convention will be called among moonspeakers in Batsby to sort things out."
BAT_f4:0 "Strike Against Political Radicalism"
BAT_f4_desc:0 "There are two devils in the nation that threaten us more than anything else, that being the socialism of Dusk Wane and the fundamentalism of Ocean Spray. Both are equally dangerous, and both must be stamped out in every way. A large propaganda campaign will be started, as to inform the people of the truth about these lying traitors of Chiropterra."
BAT_f5:0 "Strengthen Separation Of Powers"
BAT_f5_desc:0 "Gorge Z. Batton is a president and a general, not an autocrat. He does not want to govern every part of Chiropterra, nor does he wish to hold full control over the nation. The Senate must have its powers and independence assured with a new constitution, and authority must be spread to the state level to better manage affairs."
BAT_f6:0 "Reorganise The Administration"
BAT_f6_desc:0 "The old administration of Chiropterra is now unacceptably outdated for the new Republic, stifling us in our pursuits more than aiding us. The whole thing must be rebuilt from the ground up, from counties to states and all the way to the federal government, so we can tear down the old and put something better in its place."
BAT_f7:0 "The Servicepony's Readjustment Act"
BAT_f7_desc:0 "When the soldier's service to the nation is finished, many have trouble reintegrating back into civilian life, primarily from unemployment. It is clear that aid must be given to them as they deserve after a life of fighting the enemy. The Servicepony's Readjustment Act will provide a long range of benefits for any veterans who retire from active duty, so that they can find peace in a new life."
BAT_f8:0 "The Ecumenical Presidency"
BAT_f8_desc:0 "There can be no room for division in our nation, especially when it comes to religion. Our faith must be unified, and it shall be so under the presidency of our Gorge Z. Batton. Together, we can all march forward with the same guiding light of the night, and we shall remain united under that fact."
BAT_f9:0 "Maintain Clerical Autonomy"
BAT_f9_desc:0 "There are many different sects of worship across Chiropterra, each with their unique differences suited for their own region and beliefs. By ensuring that this remains the case, we can foster a sense of unity through division while keeping all of our citizens and soldiers satisfied."
BAT_f10:0 "Denounce Radical Nightmare Worship"
BAT_f10_desc:0 "We may be tolerate towards many brands of the Lunarist faith, but we must draw the line somewhere. Radical Nightmareism, in particular the brand supported by Ocean Spray, is unacceptable in this new day and age, and under no circumstance should be allowed to spread. When their words are backed with violence, we must take a stand."
BAT_f11:0 "Good Ol' Chiropterran Family Values"
BAT_f11_desc:0 "One of the most important parts of any life in Chiropterra is the family. It is the values they instill in each other, the aspects they share that make a pony more than anything else. We need to encourage these values, and support the nostalgia for the old days by ensuring that every family has what they need to raise their own children and future citizens and soldiers."
BAT_f12:0 "Her Truth Is Marching On"
BAT_f12_desc:0 "Whether for good or for ill, the worship of the Nightmare is and will remain an important part of Chiropterran society, as one of the core values we will fight to protect. We push forward, every onward, in Her name to bring glory to ourselves, to nation and to Nightmare. We sing our proud Battle Hymn of the Republic, and look forward with eyes only ahead."
BAT_f13:0 "Enshrine The Presidential Executive"
BAT_f13_desc:0 "It is the president, and the president alone who must have the power to make the difficult decisions for Chiropterra. They must not be tied up by any other piece of government, whether that be the bureaucracy to the Senate itself. Only with executive power can they be expected to efficiently lead the nation to glory."
BAT_f14:0 "The Codex Battonicus"
BAT_f14_desc:0 "We can not expect our military to follow the same law codes that our civilians do, nor we can expect the courts to handle their cases the same way. The Codex Battonicus, written personally by our own president, will officially create create two separate systems for our soldiers and and citizens respectively, to keep judgements fair based on circumstances of their duty."
BAT_f15:0 "Enshrine Senatorial Primacy"
BAT_f15_desc:0 "The Senate of Chiropterra is the democracy of the nation, and is the most important part of our new system of government. They must be the ones empowered to make the decisions that affect its citizens, and take presidency over anything else. The will of the masses shall be heard and represented."
BAT_f16:0 "The Foal Scouts Of Chiropterra"
BAT_f16_desc:0 "The foals are the next generation of Chiropterrans who will take our place, and we must make sure they hold within them the same great values that we do. The Foal Scouts, an organization to help them learn basic skills, teamwork and what it means to be a leader, a patriot and a soldier shall prepare them for the life that stands ahead."
BAT_f17:0 "Codify States' Rights"
BAT_f17_desc:0 "The states shall be the cornerstone of governance in society, picking up much of the slack that the federal government can not or should not undertake. These rights, the laws that they will be able to pass individually, on a state-by-state basis will be codified, as to forever be enshrined in the constitution so the balance of federalism remains intact."
BAT_f18:0 "The Nightmare Is Marching On"
BAT_f18_desc:0 "Our nation may be whole and united, but our work is not finished. Looking outwards, there are still many threats to our way of life, our traditions and our values that we must be wary of. We can not stay away from the world forever; we must go and march to these threats head on, and strike them before they do the same to us. Glory to Chiropterra!"
BAT_f19:0 "Federalise The School Districts"
BAT_f19_desc:0 "While we are willing to leave many things up to local government, education is something that must be standardized across the nation. As such, the school districts shall be federalized and managed together by the capital, to ensure that every Chiropterran no matter their location will have an opportunity to learn."
BAT_f20:0 "Expand The Vocational Education Act"
BAT_f20_desc:0 "As our republic is on the road to rebuilding, it's becoming more and more clear that the fillies of Chiropterra are going to be our hope. We need to guarantee that each and every one of them will receive a good enough education that they can grow up to make our homeland a better place."
BAT_f21:0 "The Chiropterran Civic Religion"
BAT_f21_desc:0 "Pride in the nation is a good thing. It is good to be patriotic, to honor the history and the veterans who fought for you. Whether it be national holidays, anthems, or even a simple salute to our glorious flag, let the values of the nation be ingrained in every soul residing in it; we are all together, now and forever."
BAT_f22:0 "Centralise The National Legionary Brotherhood "
BAT_f22_desc:0 "While it was unfortunate that the National Legionary Brotherhood contained many who served Ocean Spray, the remaining legionaries are still proud, loyal troops who continue to serve us well. In light of this, and to prevent an incident like this from happening again, the brotherhood will be centralized under the government so they can continue providing their experience for our army."
BAT_f23:0 "Criminalise Religious Discrimination"
BAT_f23_desc:0 "The vast majority of our people may follow some sort of Lunarism, but we recognize that not all of them do, and there are some who are unwilling to change. But that does not mean they are any less a Chiropterran than the rest of us. We can not let religion stand in the way of who we are as a nation; everyone will be welcomed, regardless of their beliefs."
BAT_f24:0 "The Legions Of The Modern Age"
BAT_f24_desc:0 "Our army, our legions are the most important part of our nation, being our proud defenders and warriors who seek glory in the name of Chiropterra. That it why it is forever important that we ensure they are up to the standards required of today's warfare. Their equipment must be second to none, and their skill unmatched by any other."
BAT_f25:0 "The Chiropterran State Autoplex"
BAT_f25_desc:0 "Motorization is a critical part of the modern army, and unfortunately for us the expansive automobile industry we set up means we often have to search for the best and most reliable seller. However, there is a simple solution. By merging every single Chiropterran motor company into one, we can cut on costs and improve efficiency for the state."
BAT_f26:0 "From Private To Marshal"
BAT_f26_desc:0 "Nepotism is the bane of any high command, allowing incompetent officers to remain in place while keeping real soldiers from the higher ranks. Both need to be addressed in equal capacity, so official methods will be set in place to allow any talented creature to attend a proper military academy should they prove their worth, and replace those found to be only instated because of connections or birthright."
BAT_f27:0 "Enshrine Combined Arms Operations"
BAT_f27_desc:0 "To achieve victory in combat, every aspect of warfare in the modern age must be used to full effect. From the air force, to the supply trucks, all the way down to the regular hoofsoldier, no part must be left forgotten or unused. All our commanders must be well-versed in such tactics, and such operations made a staple of our style of conflict."
BAT_f28:0 "Refine The LeHay Doctrine"
BAT_f28_desc:0 "The LeHay aerial doctrine is effective, of that there is no doubt, but it lacks refinement. There must be no surprise on our side when it comes to bombing, nor any mistakes made for such a critical operation. By accounting for every possibility in planning, such flight missions will go much smoother and fruitfully."
BAT_f29:0 "Full-blown Nuclear Capabilities"
BAT_f29_desc:0 "Nuclear weaponry is shaping up more and more to be a devastating new weapon of warfare in the future, and as such we can not allow ourselves to be left without it. No effort must be spared in attaining such opportunities of mass warfare, for while we may hope to never use it, we must always be ready for the possibility."
BAT_f30:0 "Expand The Special Air Service"
BAT_f30_desc:0 "Stirling's SAS has proven time and time again to be an elite, competition and most importantly successful group of special forces. Given such an excellent track record, it is clear we should expand them to becoming a full integrated part of our wider armed forces. They will be the elite divisions which strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."
BAT_f31:0 "Establish Civil Defence Force Central Command"
BAT_f31_desc:0 "The Civil Defense Force was a good start in mobilizing civilians should the need ever come again, but it has no direction or real chain of command established, being separate from the army and legions. A Central Command, managed by the government and military, gives us a better system to work with in tandem with our army and any future coordinated resistance against new occupiers."
BAT_f32:0 "Her Terrible Swift Sword"
BAT_f32_desc:0 "Our service to the Nightmare may have officially ended, but our role as warriors of the night has not. We remain an elite fighting army just as before, our legionaries proudly marching forth as an unstoppable force cutting down everything in their path. We are aggressive, we are unyielding, we are unstoppable; let all tremble in our wake!"
BAT_f33:0 "Punching Above Our Weight"
BAT_f33_desc:0 "Our size as a nation is small, and due to our devastating loss in war before we have had to build our economy once again from the ground up. With these restrictions in mind, it is critical that we ensure our economic might is as strong as it can be, being far above what could be expected of us with what we have available. Chiropterran exceptionalism will see us through."
BAT_f34:0 "Incentivise Private Military Contractors"
BAT_f34_desc:0 "Private military contractors, or PMCs for short, are a new frontier of armed soldiers created in part by our own Stirling Silver, who in essence run war as a business for profit. Though they could be seen as simply modern mercenaries, they also provide jobs and arms factories wherever they reside in. Let us encourage these new contractors to expand our military capacity."
BAT_f35:0 "Formalise State Worker Wage Brackets"
BAT_f35_desc:0 "A leftover from the old makeshift system of state employment, often many jobs of similar capacities can have widely varying wages based on the region they are in. No longer can this bias stand; government workers shall have their wage brackets standardized to create a fairer, more streamlined payment system for all."
BAT_f36:0 "The Batton Anti-Trust Act"
BAT_f36_desc:0 "Competition breeds innovation, much like how warfare breeds warriors. Trusts threaten that competition, leading to monopolies and laziness as well as halting economic progress and efficiency. A new special anti-trust act signed by Gorge himself will ensure that these evils are struck down before they can weaken our country."
BAT_f37:0 "Agrarian Parcelisation"
BAT_f37_desc:0 "Land for far too long has been held by the select elite few, which only hampers the nation's economic growth and potential as well as giving undue influence to the landowners. By forcibly seizing and redistributing it to small time farmers, we can encourage more small business and soldiers for the nation's defense."
BAT_f38:0 "Standardise Veteran Financial Benefits"
BAT_f38_desc:0 "The duty of the soldier is harsh and unforgiving, and as such we must ensure that our brave troops remain honored and supported well past their retirement or end of service, and especially should they fall in battle for their families. The economic aid given to those who have put their lives on the line for the country, as well as their relatives, is merely a small part of what we can do in return."
BAT_f39:0 "The Military Town Support Network"
BAT_f39_desc:0 "On occasion, military bases and stations for soldiers can be far away from any reasonable town or city, meaning that any needs that can not be met in the base itself requires a long trip to solve. Some directed economic incentives in military regions for businesses and towns to grow in will both boost the economy of the nation, and provide our soldiers with better working conditions."
BAT_f40:0 "The Moonburger Of The Legions"
BAT_f40_desc:0 "The Moonburger has become a very popular food among our soldiers, being a staple favorite from the private to the officer. As a state corporation, it is easily within our power to tie it to our legions for easy meals... after we ensure it meets our quality standards. Our soldiers deserve nothing but the best, after all."
BAT_f41:0 "Embrace State Capitalism"
BAT_f41_desc:0 "With all that our reforms done, our nation's economy has transformed from a disorganized mess barely rebuilt after our defeat to a well-oiled machine, a powerhouse on the world stage. Through the state, we ensure that business thrives and production remains steady, through capitalist incentives to drive us to ever greater heights. Let our economic growth never end!"

BAT_g1:0 "Everything Is On Fire"
BAT_g1_desc:0 "To say that things are 'bad' or even 'terrible' would be an understatement. Bombing the capitol building has certainly exterminated his opposition, but it has also killed an incredible number of civil servants and alienated the remnants of the political factions who's leadership are now to be buried in unmarked graves. Utter chaos reigns."
BAT_g2:0 "Recalibrate The Plan"
BAT_g2_desc:0 "Whatever political stability and sustainability there could have been under the republican government has been dashed. If Chiropterra is to survive now, it must be under the guiding hoof of Ocean Spray and his vision. There is still hope yet, so long as a new plan for success can be drafted and put into action."
BAT_g3:0 "The Batsby Reformation"
BAT_g3_desc:0 "With many moonspeakers disillusioned or dead, there is a power vacuum in the faith that must be filled. Ocean Spray has divised a solution to this problem: Fringe and extreme cults that still support our cause must be officially accepted into the political and religious structure of the new Chiropterra, lest we risk further damage at the hooves of the reactionary remnants."
BAT_g4:0 "Social Engineering"
BAT_g4_desc:0 "Acclimatization to a new environment is never easy, particularly for the masses who are currently trying to keep up with the reactionary reforms and Ocean Spray's personal efforts to centralise power around himself. It is only logical that we take steps to ensure that the transition towards such authoritarianism is as smooth as possible."
BAT_g5:0 "Stratocratic Constituents"
BAT_g5_desc:0 "Stratocracy has always been an inherent part of Chiropterra, but that does not mean the system was perfect; indeed it created a balance of power between many parts of and individuals within the state. The constituencies established during the period of coalition shall provide an excellent basis for a new stratocratic system that makes it impossible to ignore or challenge the will of Ocean Spray."
BAT_g6:0 "Administrative Centralism"
BAT_g6_desc:0 "So far our policies regarding the centralisation of the administration around Ocean Spray have proven immensely effective, both as a guarantor of stability and in maintaining political efficiency. Continuing this process to eliminate any possibility of internal reaction to the regime's current and future policies is a logical next step."
BAT_g7:0 "Restructure The LMRD"
BAT_g7_desc:0 "As one of the most pure and loyal elements of the new Chiropterran state, it is only natural that the LMRD receive more funding and an elevation of status within the new regime. So important is the institution that Ocean Spray has ordered a high level of cooperation with the wider intelligence network in to further the reach of the hidden state."
BAT_g8:0 "The Hierocratic Model"
BAT_g8_desc:0 "This mess of decentralised religious groups is precisely why such 'extreme' methods were required for Ocean Spray to rise and revive the true spirit of Chiropterra. With a top-down approach to religious authority and a firm hoof in guiding the faith through the state, there will never again be such apostates as Dusk Wane in our midst."
BAT_g9:0 "Temporal Authority"
BAT_g9_desc:0 "To vest responsibility for the faith in one thestral is a change that has long been necessary and there is no better time than the present to codify temporal authority in Ocean Spray himself. He shall have final say on all matters of faith and of purpose in service of the Nightmare, never again to be sullied by the voices of decadent moonspeakers."
BAT_g10:0 "Redefine Scriptural Orthodoxy "
BAT_g10_desc:0 "Whilst the faith is now stable and centralised under proper guidance, it is certainly not uniform. Regionalist apostates have irreversibly tainted our once pure faith with their heretical sects. The time has come to codify the one and only form of Nightmare worship, free from such deplorable things as 'harmony' and 'socialism'."
BAT_g11:0 "The Lost Cause Myth"
BAT_g11_desc:0 "There was never a possibility for success under the republic or its predecessors. Both had imperfect dreams of an utterly ridiculous victory over their enemies, one without the wisdom of Ocean Spray to guide it towards success. With their passing it will be easy to propagate this notion to all loyal servants of the Nightmare and her chosen."
BAT_g12:0 "Charismatic Nightmareism"
BAT_g12_desc:0 "Unique abilities granted by the Nightmare are seldom spoken of in circles of worship, another of many gross evils that can be attributed to Ocean Spray's foolish predecessors. The truly faithful are made more than themselves by the Goddess with gifts that they must use to bring our true creed to all creatures! All hail her benevolent and generous majesty!"
BAT_g13:0 "The One Quarter Law"
BAT_g13_desc:0 "There is much that differentiates a loyal Chiropterran from their rightfully acquired thralls. Our Warmaster recognises this and shall reform the Labourer system to reflect these truly separate species by allowing the freedom of Labourers only if they are of three quarters citizen blood, thus significantly expanding the pool of indentured workers over time."
BAT_g14:0 "Delegalise Miscegenation"
BAT_g14_desc:0 "In addendum to our laws regarding the potential freedom of Labourers, it is high time that we finally criminalised relations between true Chiropterrans and state property. The debauchery that takes place in quiet spaces between master and servant produces only unneeded workers, not true and loyal servants of the Nightmare."
BAT_g15:0 "Restructure The National Legionary Brotherhood"
BAT_g15_desc:0 "Our veterans have been very comfortable and well looked after following the mess that was made in our Warmaster's ascent into leadership. Though their debts are paid and we appreciate their service immensely, it would be remiss of the state not to remind them of who provides that comfort in exchange for a chorus of praise and some willing volunteers."
BAT_g16:0 "The Prison Labourer System"
BAT_g16_desc:0 "For the duration of any individual's stay in prison, even if a citizen by blood, they shall have the rights of a Labourer and be treated as such. All shall work off the debt incurred by their crimes in service to the state, Ocean Spray and the Nightmare herself."
BAT_g17:0 "The Foal Scouts Of Chiropterra"
BAT_g17_desc:0 "It is the foals who will perforate Chiropterra's future society and politics and as such their lives too will be graced by the wisdom of our Warmaster. For them he shall create an organisation in which they may learn the undisputed truths of the world and their place within it, in addition to spending time with the National Legionary Brotherhood."
BAT_g18:0 "The Warmaster Of Chiropterra"
BAT_g18_desc:0 "Ocean Spray is now the unopposed master of Chiropterra and the guiding hoof to all internal affairs. All that remains is for his word to reach beyond our borders, to our enemies and any that oppose his regime. Warmaster is no longer an appropriate title, in his eyes. No, instead he shall create the title of Warmaster Supreme as the Nightmare's chosen."
BAT_g19:0 "Reorganise The Hoof"
BAT_g19_desc:0 "The LMRD remains a separate institution despite its close cooperation with the Hoof. There is a simple way to solve this obvious inefficiency: Creating a new organisation - the Chiropterran Intelligence Agency - with the knowledge, ponypower and resources vested in it from both establishments."
BAT_g20:0 "International Nightmareism"
BAT_g20_desc:0 "Using groups of fanatics on an international scale to extend our reach has long been in the interest of Chiropterra, but previously the establishment lacked the ponypower and funding to achieve such. Now however, with the CIA and its immense resources from the coalescence of two infallible institutions, we may finally achieve our previously unreachable dream."
BAT_g21:0 "Integrate The Cults"
BAT_g21_desc:0 "As the very existence of the current regime proves, those pushed to the fringes of political importance can be immensely influential all the same. We must shake hooves with even the most outlandish and inexplicable sects of our brethren abroad and at home in our service to the Nightmare; the conversation on orthodoxy can come after we establish control."
BAT_g22:0 "Aristocratic Evolutionism"
BAT_g22_desc:0 "What is the responsibility of nobility and land if those that claim both sit and stay decadent when surrounded by change? Confidence in one's position begets the very idiocy that allowed Chiropterra to fall into the hooves of imbeciles and 'reformists'. Henceforth all nobles may have their holdings and position challenged in duels to the death!"
BAT_g23:0 "Curtail The Privileges"
BAT_g23_desc:0 "Though the nobility are no longer so disgustingly idle, their responsibilities and subsequent influence in the governance of Chiropterra still make them a threat to Ocean Spray and his regime. It is necessary for them to relinquish some of their egregious powers in service of the Nightmare and her chosen Warmaster."
BAT_g24:0 "The Zuwena Legionary Reforms"
BAT_g24_desc:0 "Following the unfortunate passing of Silver Stirling, many necessary reforms intended for the legionnaires have been left to collect dust. Instead, a talented and loyal Chiropterran Zebra by the name of Zuwena shall conduct the necessary reforms in close cooperation with the Warmaster to whom he is the most faithful of friends."
BAT_g25:0 "Entrench Siege Mentality"
BAT_g25_desc:0 "Chiropterra is constantly under threat of hostile takeover at the hooves of foreign scoundrels and apostates; it is imperative that we always remain ready for a defensive war should our sovereignty, faith and way of life be threatened once more. We must be vigilant, lest our enemies manage to create for themselves even one advantage."
BAT_g26:0 "The Blue Moon Express System"
BAT_g26_desc:0 "Logistics has always been one of Ocean Spray's personal passions as a thestral who has spent the majority of his career in bureaucracy. Encouraging the mass motorisation of the armed forces should greatly improve the efficiency of the military's supply lines and will prove to be more than sufficient for modern warfare."
BAT_g27:0 "The ABC Fireteam System"
BAT_g27_desc:0 "Dividing infantry squads further into unique roles as part of a dispersed fireteam that functions over greater distances is a logical next step as the range of engagement continually increases. These teams will be able to provide one another with specialised fire support or cover, increasing their effectiveness to no end."
BAT_g28:0 "Airborne Strategic Coordination"
BAT_g28_desc:0 "Combined arms warfare is the natural evolution of the current three branch system through which to conduct warfare. Cooperation between these branches has already become commonplace and now it is time to develop proper strategies in order to maximise the effectiveness of that very cooperation."
BAT_g29:0 "Airlift Tactics"
BAT_g29_desc:0 "Though transporting materiel through the air has proven somewhat expensive and generally temperamental even at the best of times, it is nevertheless a strategy that is capable of supplying our troops both behind enemy lines and further afield. With design improvements and proper integration with ground forces, it will be an immensely useful tactic."
BAT_g30:0 "Anti-Tank Coconut Crabs"
BAT_g30_desc:0 "They are perhaps the most ridiculous yet effective anti-tank devices ever designed. As the name of the project would suggest, we have weaponised the famous coconut crabs by turning them into semi-mobile and - most importantly - inconspicuous land mines. All shall fear the terrible omen that the coconut crab will soon come to represent."
BAT_g31:0 "Venomous Agent X Implementation"
BAT_g31_desc:0 "There are few chemical weapons more potent than nerve agents and there are fewer still that can compare to Venomous Agent X. It is a subtle chemical upon deployment, but a very effective one on contact: Prolonged neuromuscular blockade, flaccid paralysis of all the muscles in the body including the diaphragm and then death by asphyxiation."
BAT_g32:0 "The Indomitable Legions Of Chiropterra"
BAT_g32_desc:0 "Our legionnaires are fearless, merciless and without equal. No apostate can possibly compare to the incredible power of Ocean Spray's unparalleled forces. No foreign military can oppose the Nightmare and her chosen, they can only fight for their lives in the vain hope that our impregnable legions may make it quick."
BAT_g33:0 "Economic Reactionarism"
BAT_g33_desc:0 "It was a grave mistake to allow for the decentralisation of the economy in the first place as it permitted wealthy individuals their own influences over the state and country. There can be no place for such challenges to our Warmaster's authority in Chiropterra and so their redundant industrial equipment is to be appropriated by the state."
BAT_g34:0 "Centralise Military Production"
BAT_g34_desc:0 "State control over military industry is a necessity to ensure streamlined production of materiel that can never be interrupted by the failures of corporations and their markets. It is vitally important that we expropriate the weapons production of private enterprises and take control of the means to wage war for the survival of the state."
BAT_g35:0 "The Fair Compensation Act"
BAT_g35_desc:0 "It is only fair that loyal and dedicated citizens of Chiropterra receive their dues for a job well done. Ocean Spray has dictated that the minimum wage be increased to reflect his support for his hard-working citizens and to ensure their continued loyalty for years to come via private economic incentives."
BAT_g36:0 "Subsidise Large Families"
BAT_g36_desc:0 "If there is one thing Chiropterra needs, it is more Chiropterrans! Encouraging our citizens to have large families and many children is as simple as providing them with enough money to support such a large number of foals. Who will they thank when their offspring make them proud in their service to the Nightmare? Our Warmaster of course!"
BAT_g37:0 "The Veteran Land Grant Act"
BAT_g37_desc:0 "Veterans don't like being looked after in homes or wards, especially if they're young. What they want is a pleasant retirement on a farm, somewhere quiet where they can do something simple and relax whilst contributing to our great state. Needless to say, Ocean Spray will give them the land that they want."
BAT_g38:0 "The Chiropterran Agrarian Miracle"
BAT_g38_desc:0 "The combination of the Labourer reforms, the subsequent adoption of large plantations and the introduction of new mechanisation practices has caused nothing short of a boom in the Chiropterran agricultural sector. Not only are we producing enough food for our own and more, but we're growing enough luxury crops to export them too!"
BAT_g39:0 "The Civil Defence Force Work Battalions"
BAT_g39_desc:0 "With the centralisation of many other facets of the state, the Civil Defence Force remains relatively untouched by Ocean Spray's guiding hoof. However, this too is soon to change. The CDF is being granted new duties, in particular the construction and maintenance of new infrastructure across the nation for the benefit of the people and the armed forces."
BAT_g40:0 "The Moonburger Quality Control Act"
BAT_g40_desc:0 "The Moonburger, in spite of its quality in taste, is not a healthy meal. With this being said, it is imperative that we improve the nutritional value of such a popular food before it begins to negatively affect our citizens and soldiers. Ocean Spray's solution, as one that enjoys the many benefits of fast food, is to simply add supplements."
BAT_g41:0 "Economic Cartelisation"
BAT_g41_desc:0 "Collution between industries has often been seen as detrimental to an economic system. However, with the state in control of many said industries, it will be easy to manipulate the prices and availability of goods to perfectly control and maintain a stable economy via price controls and discourage external economic influences."

BAT_h1:0 "Commander In Chief Stirling Silver"
BAT_h1_desc:0 "Well lads, it's all under control now. Order will be restored and we'll be back to business soon."
BAT_h2:0 "The Principle Of Cultural Rejuvenation"
BAT_h2_desc:0 "All this war and conflict has destroyed what the foundations of our nation is built on, and with all the anger and chaos going around, it's not worth rebuilding what we once had. It's time to move forward and build a new legionnaire spirit for all of Chiropterra."
BAT_h3:0 "The Batsby Edict"
BAT_h3_desc:0 "Our lunarist faith, the very core of our nation, has been shaken. With the collapse of the old order, many no longer trust the moonspeakers in their leadership of Chiropterra. So if we are to move forward, they must relinquish all of their temporal authority back to the state."
BAT_h4:0 "The Legionary Assembly"
BAT_h4_desc:0 "The soldiers of Chiropterra have defended it in the past, and will defend it again. They deserve a say in how the country is run so that the security of the republic is in the grasp of those who would fight and die for it."
BAT_h5:0 "The Senate and People of Chiropterra"
BAT_h5_desc:0 "The Senate will be the higher body of the legislature, along with the Legionary Assembly. It's members are beholden to few and are the wise equines of Chiropterra, the guardians of its institutions, and the mentors of Chiropterran democracy."
BAT_h6:0 "The People's Assembly"
BAT_h6_desc:0 "The People's Assembly is more directly accountable to the citizens of our nation, members have shorter terms and can even be recalled by referendum in drastic circumstances. Through them all creatures will have a place in our democracy."
BAT_h7:0 "The Magisterium Of Chiropterra"
BAT_h7_desc:0 "Magic is a wild and dangerous thing, especially in war time. With such a high unicorn population, we need a central body regulating magical studies within our nation. They will provide both patronage and discipline to practitioners of magic, and will assist the government in all magical affairs."
BAT_h8:0 "Embrace Cultural Pluralism"
BAT_h8_desc:0 "The Chiropterrans have been here for a thousand years but we were not the first, nor the last to come to this land. By embracing Zebra rites, Pegasus traditions, Unicorn folklore and Earth pony myths we have the chance to build a new identity; a home for all."
BAT_h9:0 "Incentivise Chiropterranisation"
BAT_h9_desc:0 "It takes but one crack to bring down a dam. To move forward as a nation we must unite the nation. Seal over the cracks and divisions, lest the flood waters of history wash us all away."
BAT_h10:0 "The New Tzinacatlia"
BAT_h10_desc:0 "For far too long we have treated Chiropterra as a temporary solution, a stopping point on our road back to Tzinacatlia. It is time we give this land the respect it deserves. This is our home, for us and all thestrals."
BAT_h11:0 "The Veteran Protection Act"
BAT_h11_desc:0 "Those who fought to preserve the republic against threats both foreign and domestic deserve to live out their lives in peace. A guaranteed pension as well as health insurance will show them that we honor their service."
BAT_h12:0 "The Cult Of Nox Invicta"
BAT_h12_desc:0 "The removal of the Moonspeaker's authority has changed our faith, not destroyed it. The military still fights under the banner of the night and the flag of Chiropterra still bears her sacred image. By reminding them of the modern ways they can serve Nightmare Moon the state can reap the benefits."
BAT_h13:0 "Legionary Republicanism"
BAT_h13_desc:0 "Representation is one thing but local governance must not get out of hoof. By investing more power in the central government, Chiropterra can take decisive decisions as the situation changes without fear of being paralyzed by petty local politics."
BAT_h14:0 "Primus Inter Pares And Princeps Of The Republic"
BAT_h14_desc:0 "The body of the state must have a head. Somepony to have the final word in the national debate. Stirling has more than proven his dedication to the republic's ideals and its citizens. He shall be first amongst equals, at the head of the table whilst also serving the nation."
BAT_h15:0 "The Tribus System"
BAT_h15_desc:0 "By placing the power of the nation in the hooves of the provinces we free ourselves from the fear of tyrants and dictators gaining influence whilst allowing for effective local action to be taken. After all, who knows the needs of our citizens better than themselves."
BAT_h16:0 "Courage And Discipline"
BAT_h16_desc:0 "The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. Through hard work, dedication and force of will we shall keep our lands and our ponies safe. Chiropterra has risen once more into a nation we can be proud of."
BAT_h17:0 "Prudence And Justice"
BAT_h17_desc:0 "We do not measure the value of a society by factories and arms, we measure it by the value it places on a life. Through equality in the law and the careful defence of those rights we shall give everypony something to fight for."
BAT_h18:0 "Once More Unto The World Stage"
BAT_h18_desc:0 ""We are not now that strength which in old days moved moon and stars. That which we are, we are, one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.""
BAT_h19:0 "Provide Subsidies For Magical Academies"
BAT_h19_desc:0 "Magic, under the right conditions, can be of use to us. Chiropterra will ensure every unicorn filly and colt has access to the teaching they require. Through state sponsorship we can make the most of our magical reserves whilst ensuring the correct and proper controls are taught."
BAT_h20:0 "Expand The Vocational Education Act"
BAT_h20_desc:0 "As our republic is on the road to rebuilding, it's becoming more and more clear that the fillies of Chiropterra are going to be our hope. We need to guarantee that each and every one of them will receive a good enough education that they can grow up to make our homeland a better place."
BAT_h21:0 "Ensure Free School Lunches"
BAT_h21_desc:0 "Many families in Chiropterra have not yet recovered from the troubles and often can't afford to feed their children. This is a truly terrible reality, but there is something we can do to help. When children are in the care of the school system, we will feed and care for them. So that they can go home happy and fed."
BAT_h22:0 "The Publican System"
BAT_h22_desc:0 "By allowing those who qualify to bid for minor offices we generate valuable income for the senate. Building contractors, logistics suppliers, even the odd tax collector. It will also serve as reasonable practice should the holders decide to run for the senate. Surely such a system can't be abused."
BAT_h23:0 "The Chiropterran National Circle Of Magi"
BAT_h23_desc:0 "The most powerful magic users of Chiropterra should be gathered together to provide their skills and council to the Senate. The added bonus being it'll be easier to keep an eye on them should intervention be required."
BAT_h24:0 "Next Generation Warfare"
BAT_h24_desc:0 "The Legions of old are dead and gone, but we still have some of the world's brightest military minds to put to good use. We can figure out the way the currents are flowing, and adapt according to the new generation of war."
BAT_h25:0 "Subsidise The Automobile Industry"
BAT_h25_desc:0 "A modern army is a mechanized army. And thankfully the Chiropterran automobile industry has made a strong recovery in the past years, and they are more than willing to help us out with equipping our forces in exchange for some money in the right pockets."
BAT_h26:0 "Magical Weaponry Implementation"
BAT_h26_desc:0 "Magical weaponry is a new opportunity to modernize the role that infantry plays on the battlefield. Without the need for conventional ammunition, platoons can do so much more than they used to carrying only their advanced magical rifles and crystal batteries."
BAT_h27:0 "Expand The Special Air Service"
BAT_h27_desc:0 "Stirling's own Special Air Service will play a large role in our military modernization. A core of fast moving, highly trained combat experts is invaluable to have in modern warfare, where capturing strong points and supply hubs is so important for victory."
BAT_h28:0 "Long Range Bombing Operations"
BAT_h28_desc:0 "If we can destroy enemy supply hubs, roads, rail lines, and manufacturing, we can cripple them before we ever meet their forces on the battlefield."
BAT_h29:0 "Full-blown Nuclear Capabilities"
BAT_h29_desc:0 "To defend our new republic, we must be ready to retaliate with full force if necessary. This includes the use of nuclear weapons. If we can be the first to attain them in Northern Zebrica, we can ensure the safety of our state forevermore."
BAT_h30:0 "The Lunatic Automotive Contract"
BAT_h30_desc:0 "We've contracted the Lunatic company to create for us a new titan of the battlefield. A heavy tank to rival any other armored vehicle on Zebrica and beyond, to crash through the lines of our enemies and show them the power and prosperity of our new republic."
BAT_h31:0 "Reorganise The Civil Defence Force"
BAT_h31_desc:0 "The civil defense force was originally created to defend tooth and nail against those who had subjugated our land. Now that our borders are secure, it will be reorganized into an organ of the army, providing auxiliary duties like repairs and infrastructure development, as well as still preparing a war to defend the homeland in case of invasion."
BAT_h32:0 "The Finest Military Force In Zebrica"
BAT_h32_desc:0 "Building upon the traditions passed down by our forefathers, we have created a new military for our state. One that stands up to the memory of the old legions in every possible way. And one that will never fail the people like the old legions did."
BAT_h33:0 "Nurture The Economic Miracle"
BAT_h33_desc:0 "Through careful management and good administration, we're making something special here in Chiropterra. The destruction of the Legionary state allowed us to turn our relatively modern industrial base from a system based on autarky to one more integrated with the rest of the world. For once, we have good trade relations with many of our neighbors, and things are looking up."
BAT_h34:0 "Infrastructural Modernisation"
BAT_h34_desc:0 "It'll take a lot of work, but we need to put the effort in to convert our infrastructure from one based on war, conflict, and national defense, into infrastructure for the sake of economic growth for all our citizens."
BAT_h35:0 "The Chiropterran Aurus"
BAT_h35_desc:0 "We aren't vengeful warriors looking to destroy Equestria anymore. That effort actively doomed us and destroyed the legions. But we can't move on until we abandon one last part of this legacy. Chiropterra still uses the pseudo-Equestrian Bit as its currency. It's time to ditch the outdated bit, and embrace our new currency, the Aurus."
BAT_h36:0 "The Banking Regulation Act"
BAT_h36_desc:0 "A new developing economy like ours is perfect for banks to sweep in and dominate. We need them to ensure the availability of credit, but we need to make sure they can't abuse our people and control our government and administration."
BAT_h37:0 "The Agrarian Reform Law"
BAT_h37_desc:0 "Also known as the "Land To the Tiller" act, this law ensures that any pony who works the land by himself, owns the land. By encouraging competition in the agriculture sector, farmers will need to offer competitive prices and quality, promoting growth in the sector."
BAT_h38:0 "A Titan Of Industry And Productivity"
BAT_h38_desc:0 "We can now once again brag about being one of the most developed industrial economies in all of North Zebrica. Through the grit and strength of our people, we have built something truly magical here, a titanic economy that can hold its own in the world at large, and a nation that will only continue to rise."
BAT_h39:0 "The Iztactepetl Nuclear Plant"
BAT_h39_desc:0 "Nuclear energy is undoubtedly the future of electricity. As scientists are beginning to realize the damage industrial growth is doing to nature, nuclear is showing itself to be the best candidate for "green" energy. Our first plant will be opened in Iztactepetl and will provide power to the whole of the nation."
BAT_h40:0 "The Moonburger Health And Wellness Regulation Act"
BAT_h40_desc:0 "While we in Chiropterra love our Moonburgers, some corporate holders have been encouraging less than ethical business practices to sure up profit margins. Such as using extremely unhealthy chemical ingredients. We need to ensure that all the food produced by Moonburger meets the highest standards of nutritional value and purity."
BAT_h41:0 "A Shining Beacon Of Prosperity"
BAT_h41_desc:0 "A new dawn is arriving in Chiropterra, a prosperous future is possible for all of our children, in ways that had never been thought possible. Unchained from our duty as warriors of the night, we have built a truly free and happy nation. The future is looking up."

### Events ###
bat.1.t:0 "Successful Operation"
bat.1.d:0 "Great news Warmaster. Our soldiers have returned from the frontier with more laborers to assist Her Majesty's mission. I am sure the Native Affairs Commission will be pleased."
bat.1.a:0 "Affirmative."

bat.2.t:0 "Operation Cancelled"
bat.2.d:0 "Unfortunate news Warmaster, due to unforeseen circumstances we've had to cancel our operations in the frontier to liberate more populations for Her Majesty."
bat.2.a:0 "Annoying, but understandable."

bat.3.t:0 "Failed Operation"
bat.3.d:0 "Disappointing news from the front. For one reason or another our raid into the frontier has been a complete failure. Our soldiers are in retreat and we'll need time to lick our wounds before we can fight again."
bat.3.a:0 "We'll get them next time."

bat.4.t:0 "An Unfortunate Occurrence"
bat.4.d:0 "A force of Chiropterran raiders have breached our garrisons and carried off thousands of our citizens. What awaits them in Chiropterra is unknown, but from the stories that come out of that accursed place, it is likely a grim fate indeed. Several border settlements report villagers packing up and leaving, having lost confidence in their government to protect them and preferring to take their chances in the big city than be the next victims of our neighbour's slave raids."
bat.4.a:0 "Bloody fanatics."

bat.5.t:0 "The Raiders Repelled"
bat.5.d:0 "The Chiropterran raiders have withdrawn, taking their wounded with them. The Chiropterran government has refused to answer our demands for reparations for their unprovoked aggression, and it seems likely they will return. Still, we can breath a little easier knowing they're gone, at least for now."
bat.5.a:0 "Cowards!"

bat.6.t:0 "The Raiders Defeated"
bat.6.d:0 "The Chiropterran raiders have been beaten back, defeated on the field by our brave soldiers. We have captured a few prisoners of war, but nopony who can give us any information on where or when the Chiropterrans will attack again, and nopony high-ranking enough to be useful as a bargaining chip. Still, we can congratulate our soldiers on a job well done."
bat.6.a:0 "Cowards!"

bat.7.t:0 "The Slave Raid"
bat.7.d:0 "We have received word from the units on the Chiropterran border that their legionnaires have begun a lightning raid, descending with ruthless precision upon our border patrols and making a beeline for a sparsely-defended civilian settlement. Within an hour, they could reach the settlement and kidnap our citizens. We can scramble our forces to attempt to hold them off, or we can withdraw if we think we cannot defeat them."
bat.7.a:0 "We shall fight them with all we have!"
bat.7.b:0 "Order the army to evacuate the area."

bat.8.t:0 "The Thousand Year Conspiracy"
bat.8.d:0 "A Millennium.\n\nWe waited and prepared for a millennium for when our goddess returned. Our exile of generations on Zebrica mattered little for she would have her righteous army when she returned as the prophecy promised. And on that night of nights, 1,000 years after the Great Catastrophe...\n\nThe Elements of Harmony tore her asunder.\n\nThe accursed charms ripped divinity from her holy hooves and devolved her to a lesser form. She had returned though, Nightmare Moon had returned! Her mortal form may be weakened in Princess Luna, but it was a sign! Despite her weakened state, Chiropterra rejoiced for months at her rebirth; there was hope.\n\nFor seven years we have intensified our efforts and expanded our operations on Equus. We have strained already soured relations between Thestrals and Ponies, sabotaged efforts to modernize the Equestrian military even after the Changeling heretics captured Canterlot, and have embedded our assets across the Equestrian territories.\n\nOur ancestors arrived on Zebrica with spears and bows on rickety triremes bursting from the seam with their families. Our exile here, our removal from our homeland will be avenged! We will return to Equestria in massive ships armed with tanks and machine guns, each blessed by the moon herself!\n\nAnd if we fail? We shall wait a millennium more. We are patient, we are watching, and we will return!"
bat.8.a:0 "Soon the Empress shall return..."

bat.9.t:0 "Report #3112"
bat.9.d:0 "Eternal Eclipse frowned as he used an old abacus to crunch the numbers on the relocation of Labourer Subclass A-951 to Labourer Subclass A-956. The stallion did not struggle with the math, numbers were his strong suit. His old abacus just did not go high enough to account for the influx of new labourers enlightened in the last raid. Eternal was also not willing to use the new 'slide ruler' his grandson Lucent got him for his birthday.\n\nAllocating the labourers to their new professions based upon their old ones was hardly a trifling task either, but his equipment was slowing him down. It was rather ironic considering the stallion's age. His mind was sharp as ever, but his body had slowed to a crawl. The 'equipment' he used to secure his spot on the Legion Council had worn thin.\n\nEven armed with a new tool, Eclipse wondered if it would even be enough. He never denied his feebleness now, the matters of the military were best left to younger soldiers like Lucent after all.\n\nHe was just letting his frustration get the best of him, he would try to learn the slide ruler once Lucent came to visit for their afternoon tea. Eternal consoled himself that he was still useful as he reassigned two thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-three new labourers to their assignments across the munitions plants. Their children would be turned over to the academies for training.\n\nHe hoped that Lucent would bring the mint tea, it always seemed to calm his nerves."
bat.9.a:0 "The joys of bureaucracy..."

bat.10.t:0 "The Life Of A Labourer"
bat.10.d:0 "Kinta Kunte never paid no mind to his mother's words to not sail too far to the east, the young zebra always found them to be nagging. It was a hag's tale among the fisherfolk of their village, the lost remnants of an army kidnapping any they could get their hooves on. With the Storm King gone there was no reason not to expand to new spots!\n\nKinta wished he had listened to her.\n\nTheir ship had drifted too far while they were trawling for krill, he had been below when the raid happened. A dozen pegasi and thestrals landed on their deck, killed the captain, and rounded them all up in a matter of minutes. A unicorn was brought down and cast a strange spell, forcing them into a deep sleep.\n\nWhen Kinta woke up, he found himself in the Labourer's quarters with the other captives. Some were killed trying to escape in the first week, another died from wounds after her flogging for interrupting a sermon to Nightmare Moon, and the last threw himself from the scaffolding down in the mines. Kinta was the last one from his ship after the first month. \n\nAnd he has been there ever since, working all day and into the night. They do not let him near any boats, his thestral overlords know that Kinta would try to run just as his companions had. As the thestral captain who gave him his new name said; 'You will mine, your children will fish, and their children will be citizens.'"
bat.10.a:0 "Such is life."

bat.11.t:0 "The Sacrifices On The Road To Success"
bat.11.d:0 "Autumn Breeze smiled as he nipped on the edge of a cigar, the tobacco paired well with the champagne he had taken on his last visit to Prance. Before ascending to the Legion Council, Breeze was quite proud to be something of an aficionado of Equestrian vineyards. While undercover a few of his more charged reviews even made it into national papers for a great deal of praise, of course his handlers quickly put a stop to that growing fame.\n\n"It was a danger to the mission after all, just like you," he mused as he let the smoke roll from his nostrils before he turned to face his acquaintance for the night. The Equestrian agent was bound to a chair, bloodied and broken a dozen times over through their previous festivities. Whatever nonsense he tried to gargle past his broken teeth came out as incomprehensible slurs.\n\n"Save your strength, I am just enjoying a break myself," Autumn chuckled out as he took a small sip from his wine. "I do want to congratulate you, my friend. In nearly thirty years of operations I've been involved with, I've never seen somepony come so very close to actually proving we exist."\n\nThe agent choked out another gargle of bile and thrashed again his restraints, glaring past the one eye he had left.\n\n"I will take that as your modest appreciation for my kind words, but in any case," Autumn added as he finished off his glass. "If you're going to have to disappear, we're going to have a bit more fun first; just me and you."\n\nThe thestral slowly sauntered towards the record player, choosing a more modern Octavian piece as he took the burning ember of the cigar with his hoofs. As the mare on the recording strum her cello to life, Breeze recounted how much he enjoyed his work as he resumed his interrogation.\n\nThe agent gave him what he wanted, eventually."
bat.11.a:0 "We shall soon be vindicated by history!"

bat.12.t:0 "Of Love And Friendship"
bat.12.d:0 "Bright Opal never found himself to be particularly suited with most mares, a doctorate in physics and psychology usually ended with him trying to dissect his date's minds more than actually caring about their interests.\n\nThose tendencies did not make him popular, but then he met Mystic Belle.\n\nShe was quickly becoming everything to him. Ponies were hard to understand, prone to fits of emotion and irrational thought; even his own family was strained to care when he went on tirades about the numbers and mystical elements of crystals being harnessed for power..\n\nIt was in one of these impromptu speeches that Mystic first approached him, for the first time his grandstanding at a bar among his colleagues had a desirable outcome. She was perfect; she let him pick away at her mind, she picked away at his, and her love of physics was only rivaled by her attachment to him.\n\nIt was so easy with her, just like with math; being with her just added up.\n\nThe only downside was how much the mare traveled, but Bright could not bear to hold that against her. That was her job after all, even if it meant a visit to Zebrica every few months to ensure the relief organization she ran in Warzena was going well.\n\nMystic Belle was caring like that and Opal loved her all the more for it."
bat.12.a:0 "All for the cause..."

bat.13.t:0 "A Soldier's Life"
bat.13.d:0 ""Listen up!" Lightning Charm barked out as she trotted out before the Firstborn Legion, the feeling of over a thousand eyes bore in on her as she flipped a Stalliongrad rifle around in her hooves.\n\n"In light of some confusion among the rank and file, I have been asked by the Council to resolve these matters...I have elected to do so personally, so that each Legionnaire understands the new weapon system," Lightning Charm hissed out to the soldiers. "This is the Stalliongrad SVETA rifle, it is a semi-automatic rifle and fires a 7.62mm cartridge accurately up to 500 metres!"\n\n"Let me be clear! This is a weapon designed by a bunch of deranged godless heathens that Celestia let leave Equestria! They are exiles too and enemies of Equestria; but they have developed a weapon that surpasses our own!" the commander exclaimed as she swung the weapon around, ensuring everypony got a good look at it.\n\n"We are behind the curve, Legionnaires, and I am tired of hearing complaints from your commanders about there being a... reluctance among the ranks to adapt to the new weapons. Our breech-loaders are not top of the line anymore, just like your father's muskets, and like their grandfather's swords!"\n\n"This rifle-" Lightning barked out as she held the SVETA above her head "-will be repurposed and learned, we will make it our own in time! But if I get any more reports about a legion dragging their heels in adapting to these new arms, I'm going to use them for target practice!"\n\n"Hold your officers accountable, hold yourselves accountable, and get it done!" she barked out as she slammed the butt of the rifle onto the stage. "Dismissed!""
bat.13.a:0 "Thank you commander!"

bat.14.t:0 "In The Embrace Of The Moon"
bat.14.d:0 "Gwedi always loved the Lunar Festival, it was the time when the Auxiliary divisions and the Legionnaire forces engaged in war games against each other to settle rivalries and praise the eternal goddess with copious amounts of booze and extra rations to celebrate. Most of the time the Legionnaire units trounced the Auxiliaries, but Gwedi led his engineers to three consecutive victories this year.\n\nNot that there was any real bad blood between the Auxiliaries and the Legions, all of that had been thawed out centuries ago. Legion might get the better equipment and the most dangerous missions, but there was no denying that the Auxiliaries had the most faith; and if Gwedi knew anything is that it was faith that got folks through the hard times.\n\nGwedi's mother had been a labourer, but when she converted and gave birth to him; Gwedi himself became qualified for the Auxiliary. When he was old enough he sprung at the opportunity without hesitation. Better rations for his mother and a chance to secure his children citizenship under the benevolent night: what more could a Zebra ask for?\n\nThe best part though of the Lunar Festival was the sermons. Gwedi never found himself proper in the temples for the goddess, but the sermons during the Festival were always around a dozen casks of the richest liquor they could find.\n\nWhen Lunar Hail stepped up onto an empty cask, Gwedi raised a healthy glass with every other soldier of Chiropterra following suit. The thestral priestess spoke with a fire and fury that would make even the most grizzled legionnaire blush. She promised an eternity in the night's embrace for those that died righteously in battle, a divine heaven with enough warm beds and partners for every soul that fell in her service. Gwedi and all the auxiliaries hung on her words, in the thin moonlight and haze of the drink; Lunar Hail almost looked like Nightmare Moon herself!"

bat.16.d:0 "Autumn Breeze sat in his office, looking over the papers. It just didn't fit. Equestria was a false state, ruled by a usurper monarch, but here it was, surviving yet again. Moonshine had failed.\n\nThat solar harlot had placated the thestral population by granting them "equal rights", when all it is, is a new form of slavery. Separating the thestrals from their rightful Empress. And that weak form known as Luna! She helped with it! She knowingly keeps Nightmare Moon in chains! Refusing to let her out to lead her people to glory once again. How dare she! How dare Equestria! How dare they all deny the Empress her place!\n\nAutumn took a deep breath. This was only a setback, surely. The Legions, after all, are the eternal servants of the night. Simple setbacks do not phase them. He would simply need to keep working, strengthening his network, readying it for the next time a rising could occur, and the Empress could be unchained once again. It didn't matter if it would happen in his lifetime, for the night is eternal, it will always remain, and as long as the night remains, there will be Chiropterra, and as long as the nation stands, its Legions stand, and with the Legions, there is a chance. Time was irrelevant, he thought to himself, the time of the thestrals would come eventually. And as he walked to the window overlooking New Ayacachtli, he muttered to himself;\n\n"Even if it takes a thousand years more.""

We may have lost this war, but there will be another... There's a war right now! The heretics are always trying to break apart this proud nation, and we have to be watchful! We have to keep in fighting shape!" She stared down at them all, happy to see that at least a few of them had absorbed some of her energy and were standing straight once again.\n\nBut in the hidden recesses of her heart she felt a great weight.\n\nHer routine took her through the other chambers of the command centre. There were procedures to perform, reports to request, and equipment to restore. She oversaw it all, giving commands and advice as needed, until at last she found herself alone in her office, looking over the final reports of the infiltration agents. At the very bottom of the pile was a postcard from Manehattan. She peered down at it, curious, and turned it over to the written side.\n\nIt was from the Nightmare cell there, dated on the same day as their defeat. All it said was: "The night here is beautiful."\n\nLightning felt her chest tense. She flipped it over again, looking at the cityscape, at the bright lights glowing gloriously on towers of concrete and metal. She had never been to that city, and she likely never would. At that point, the pangs of sorrow she had keep at bay become too much to bear, and she cast the card aside, weeping bitterly." #NavyMongoose

Arriving as part of the Chiropterran military mission, Lucent had battled throughout the land of his ancestors, working to restore the Empress to her rightful place. Now, waiting for his ship back home, he finally has some time to appreciate the city. But not too much time, as looking down from his cliff viewing point, he saw the convoys pulling into the port at Bronclyn. "Better get moving," he thought to himself, and began to make his way.\n\nWalking along the historic streets of the city, he saw what the thestrals there had built. The nightlife was fantastic, so lively in fact that the ponies of the other tribes often participated in it. And with celebrations of Nightmare Moon's victory ongoing, it was more jubilant than ever. Arriving at the port, he saw his troops boarding their ships back home, content in their service to their Empress. Moving along and shaking their hooves, Lucent made his way to the officers' ship, and began to board.\n\n"Well well, mister warrior, get any scars?" Whirling around, Lucent saw Auburn Leaf leaning on the railing. "Auburn" he said, "I didn't know you would be part of the reception crew!" Auburn smiled and walked over to Lucent, "Neither did I, in fact, but my father wanted me to see the city where our ancestors lived, and my what a sight it is." Both of them stared in silence for a moment out at the view of Manehattan, before Lucent cleared his throat and spoke, trying to break the tension, "Well, too bad we're leaving already. It's a great place to see, I probably could have even shown you around." Auburn turned her head, "You realize the troops are only putting their gear on board right? We aren't leaving until daybreak so the troops can sleep the first part of the voyage." Beginning to smirk, she says, "So I think I can take you up on that offer of a tour."\n\nLucent turned to her, with a nervous smile on his face, "Sure. Sounds nice.""

No pony is looking forward to the discussion of why the nearly thousand year old plan failed, but to avoid a conflict with no solutions; four proposals to reform the military are being presented.\n\nThe first proposal is from Lord Commander Palisade and Major General Air does not see any major changes to the doctrine, but rather the introduction of new technologies into the force. Their argument is that the planning for Moonshine was not flawed, just its execution. Therefore, the solution is to keep our modus operandi in long term planning for advanced operations and simply improve upon our means of executing plans at a more effective rate.\n\nThe next proposal is from Lady Commander Lightning Charm and Lieutenant General Brine. They propose an extreme change to the use of support units and artillery in our doctrine, favoring overwhelming firepower and the full integration of Auxiliary units to support it. Their solution to most military problems is to engage the enemy with such great quantities of firepower that our foes cannot retaliate.\n\nLieutenant General Batton and Brigadier General Eclipse present the third and most radical plan to the council. Their heated debates are famous, but their vocal and passionate commitment to a doctrine that focuses on mobility is widely seen as the only thing they agree on. They believe that by motorizing our Legions and making the focus of our advance on armored units, that we can outmaneuver our adversaries and achieve decisive victories. \n\nLady Commander Lunar Hail is well known for her piety in the holy Empress and advocates for a doctrine that she claims favors the goddess. By amassing large waves of soldiers for coordinated assaults, she believes that we can overcome any obstacle. Some counter that these plans would waste valuable Legionnaires, but she proposes supplementing the Legions with 'Redemptionary Brigades'."

It was the realization that all the efforts, all the training had been for naught, that the chance in a millennium to right an old wrong was gone.\n\nHe had considered more than once remaining in Equestria, but in the end he could not. He simply couldn't remain there as long as the Tyrant of the Sun reigned, and the true Empress remained in chains. He knew that his parents would have understood had they been still alive. They had raised him with the faith in the Nightmare, after all.\n\nStanding on the top-deck, packed with ponies watching silently as the docks drew ever closer, the unicorn stallion wondered briefly if the First Exiles had felt the same way, one thousand years ago; exhausted for the long travel, with the burning knowledge in their mind that reminded them of their failure. And yet...\n\nCoal Smoke caught the sight of uniformed ponies waiting for them on the docks, flanked by moonspeakers and flagbearers.

He might not be a thestral or pegasus with their wings, nor a unicorn with their fancy magic.\n\nBut Coffee Hays knew his guns and this here, new model Luna Rifle was about the strangest thing a Legionnaire ever plopped down on his desk and told him to figure out. \n\nNightmare's sake, the thing didn't even fire bullets; just charged bursts from a crystal! It didn't make a salt-lick of sense! How in the name of Tartarus did it even have recoil? There wasn't any cartridge being ejected?\n\nThe stallion's work on the weapon had taken weeks and a dozen different variants. Even when he copied the Luna Rifle part for part, it broke apart in his hooves. Either the weapon itself was shoddy or his work was, and the latter was near impossible. \n\nThings would change though! He finally figured out that by expanding the cooling ports along the barrel of the rifle, he could not only mitigate the recoil but allow the weapon to cycle through its crystal cartridges at a faster rate! It was a stroke of genius!\n\n"I just forgot the fact that if I didn't account for the magical discharge when removing the magazine, I risked burning my flank something fierce...which I did," Coffee Hays said with a shake of his head, sitting up a bit straighter as he offered a smile to the Legionnaire.

Captain Lancer was tasked with testing the weapon's capabilities from a higher vantage point. The thestral followed all orders to a letter and decided that the best vantage point was in flight over the target.\n\nIt is hard to describe the surprise of the team when Captain Lancer fired the Stanchion prototype without even supporting it against a passing cloud. Suffice to say, the recoil broke the officer's shoulder and the fall shattered one of his wings. \n\nAlthough the lesson was invaluable to the development team and proved their theories on the weapon's recoil in flight to be correct, they wish to formally commemorate the officer that led them to these conclusions.

I will admit it is a shame that Comet Flash was not a smarter stallion, he would have found the LMRD to be quite hospitable to his needs.\n\nAll things considered, Comet Flash has the best chance to physically endure the chemicals that have been prepared for the treatments.

Continued injections must be administered over the next several weeks, but on the most basic level the subject's DNA is reacting astonishingly well to the treatment. There has been no physical breakdown, only increased muscular hypertrophy and bone density to accommodate for its increasing size.\n\nWhile Comet Flash once stood nearly a head taller than I, it is projected he will be twice my height by the time his regimen is completed. He has exceeded each athletic test and physical feat the team has placed before him. We have managed to avoid sedation by allowing plenty of rest, relaxation, and increased rations for him. He said rather simply; 'treat him right, get treated right.'\n\nSimplicity is a characteristic that I admire in Comet. His simplicity is also constant; the stallion was not bright before the injections and he has not displayed any increased intelligence after them. Thankfully, there has been no visible mental degradation either. One of the researchers however came to me with a theory after we finished testing the subject today.\n\nAccording to her, we are witnessing mental stagnation rather than degradation. As the subject's size increases and his brain warps subtly to respond to these changes, his already lacking mental capacity is 'capping off'. We will observe the subject closer for the time being to see if these theories hold water."

With no proof or results from these 'ponies that stare at goats', Project Coach is forced back to square one.\n\nSome archaeologists within the LMRD have proposed the use of artifacts from the Crystal Empire, but those unwieldy helmets are unsuited for Project Coach. Chiropterra is not the Crystal Empire, we do not have to brainwash our citizens to a false god to get them to fight. Our ponies know that it is life and death, that our great struggle ends in either victory or absolute defeat. Project Coach is not for them, but for our enemy.\n\nWe aim to make agents out of their own forces, without them even realizing. To do this, I understand that we cannot rely on parlor tricks or flawed magic. We must look to what the LMRD knows best; science. Various chemical hallucinogens and other narcotics have trickled into Chiropterra over the years with most being kept in storage for analysis. I believe that we may find the solution to our mind control question there.\n\nAt the very least, there will be some amusing tests."

Although the labourer was rendered a vegetable, for several minutes they displayed unrivaled magical ability and strength.\n\nThis development stems from the experiments with depressants that the research teams had used to dilute the powerful effects of the crystal extract. After several variations, the breakthrough came in a surprising place; opioids. Upon mixing copious amounts of morphine into the crystal substance, the team has been able to stabilize the initial effect of Project Oaxaca to its intended effect.\n\nWithout the sudden discharge of gore prevalent in all other tests, I have a subdued hope in the success of the project. There is a level of concern around the immediate aftermath of using the serum in its current state. While Project Oaxaca is meant to give us an edge, it does not meet this purpose by rendering its user permanently brain dead. The teams will continue their research into developing a more stable substance, but for now we can finally remove the blast shields from the lab."

The distinctive nature of having several heads attached to one body creates a series of biological diminishing returns. In laypony's terms; the more heads there are on a Hydra, the easier it is to control.\n\nThis revelation has come as we begin our first steps into Project House Cat's breeding program. It has been a costly endeavor, in regards to life and coin, to retrieve a viable population. The first report detailing the cost nearly gave Baron Breeze a stroke. I concede, however, the look on his face has been more than worth the price overall.\n\nWith a sustainable breeding population we can begin to experiment with the most receptive subjects on methods of control. Initial tests with different collars were less than fruitful. The multiple bindings made the creature docile, but rendered it too calm. When each head of the Hydra is bent to our will it loses its savage nature.\n\nThere is a suspicion among some of the researchers of a 'dominant' head. Similar to how pack animals behave, if the alpha is brought under our control the rest will fall in line. The theory as of now is that if the leader is subdued, the Hydra will still follow commands and still obtain some aggressiveness."

In a violation of lab protocols and under the stress of continued failure, the researcher team stored several test subjects and samples improperly out of cold storage.\n\nWhile many of the test subjects in storage expired after testing acted as a control group, those stored improperly all displayed differing levels of success. Rather than any trait carried by a species in its DNA that made its regenerative process special, as we incorrectly theorized with Hippogriffs, it was discovered that a rare bacteria aided in rapid healing. \n\nThe bacteria acts similar to healing magic by boosting the speed of the natural healing process. While our soldiers will not be regenerating limbs or preventing excessive scarring, when mixed with crystal extract and other chemicals the rapid stimulation injection pack can close almost all wounds.\n\nThese 'Stimpaks' as the team has called them have been put to use on several laborers in varying levels of injury. All but the most grievously wounded were able to be stabilized. The only clear downside to these stimpaks is the degradation of the natural healing ability, but one would have to use hundreds in rapid succession to do any permanent harm."

Although he has stagnated mentally, Comet's existing faith in our goddess and our cause has remained steadfast.\n\nWhile he will not be performing complex Algebra soon, Comet has survived all injections and testing. Some see a grotesque monster, but I merely observe the pinnacle of the equine form. He stands two heads over me now, eye level with the false god Celestia. He has killed two sparring partners and a severely wounded six more before the Council overruled my continued desire for further testing.\n\nComet Flash may not be a general, but he is what we wanted. He is a calculating, detached, and powerful stallion. His mind is weak, but despite this he is strong.

Magic came easily to her, her power was exponentially increased, and a clear aura of energy grew around her... and she did not explode, which is a good sign in these matters. She performed in record strength for ten minutes before crashing, several minutes longer than untrained unicorns had.\n\nWhile our teams had found success in the use of morphine to dilute the compound, the brain death of several labourers made it clear that it was simply too strong a depressant. While pure alcohol dissolves most substances as a solvent, the crystal extract could persist easily within it. By combining the two, our teams created the 'Ubercrystal' injection that has led to Project Oaxaca's success. \n\nWhile most mages will be rendered exhausted following the use of the Ubercrystal, it is an effective tool or necessary last resort in our Legions' arsenal now.

Although the first Hydra brigade embedded into a supporting role performed admirably on the LMRD supervised exercise, it was not free of complications.\n\nThe first issue with the implementation of Project House Cat being the long gestation cycle of Hydras. While the Hydra itself grows to maturity rather quickly, the process of carrying the eggs to hatch is a long and complicated one. The size of the creatures and their danger do not allow us to mass produce the creatures in our current territory, meaning that there is a reasonable limit to how many Hydra we could bring into our forces.\n\nThe second issue is the logistics of maintaining the Hydra. Although we have figured out how to control them by collaring the alpha head, each one still requires nearly three platoons to handle the creature's daily maintenance in combat conditions. The amount of resources that would go into each Hydra brigade could easily fund several armored divisions.\n\nAt the end of the day, the LMRD has delivered once more to the Council its monster, even if the brigade leading it insists on it being called 'Mister Cuddlesworth.'"

He had almost reached the boats, almost made it out of this pit.\n\nHe was so close.\n\nThey secured him in holding cells outside of the Labourer's living spaces. The beatings they gave continued into the morning, not letting him escape even into the dreams of better days. By the time they dragged him from his cell, his left eye had swollen shut and he could not hear from one ear anymore. A pegasus officer, a pompous looking mare, was giving a speech to a crowd of Labourers that was assembled outside. Kinta recognized some of the Labourers.\n\nThey were Labourers who refused to fall in line and they all wore iron collars around their necks.\n\nThe officer gestured to him to stand and Kinta weakly rose to his hooves. An overseer roughly snapped a metal collar around his neck. The collar cut into his neck as Kinta swallowed and looked around slowly. A silence settled over the crowd and Kinta realized the officer had ended their speech, looking at the Zebra with an amused expression. "Labourer 24601...you tried to escape last night. You tried to escape the merciful embrace of the Nightmare. You have not earned your freedom yet...but you get to choose someone who can walk out that gate and be free."\n\nKinta opened his mouth to speak before the collar choked out his words before he could sound them out. His look of surprise must have been clear as the officer nodded their head again. "You get to choose one. Choose wisely."\n\nThe Zebra took a long, pained breath. He scanned the crowd for the youngest soul he could find, someone who had a full life to live ahead of them. A mare stood out among all the others. She was a lithe earth pony, with a black mane and sad blue eyes. He raised a hoof, pointing to her with a nod, "Her...let her be free, please."\n\nThe officer smiled and waved their hoof. A pair of overseers waded through the crowd of Labourers and lifted the pony from them. They let the mare step forward at her own, careful pace. She smiled at Kinta and the officer as she passed, stepping past the threshold of the open gate.\n\nAnd her collar began to beep...beep...beep.\n\nShe turned to run back into the gate, but the collar continued to beep...beep...beep. She pried at it with her hooves, she pleaded and cried to every god known to them. She fell onto her knees and begged the Nightmare for forgiveness.

He frowned, but soon found himself amused at the novelty of the mistake. The tiny crackle of a moonspeaker delivering a morning sermon caused the Zebra to laugh for the first time since he had been forced to Chiropterra. His new living quarters were similar to all the living quarters that the Labourers had now. It was a simple, small, three room apartment furnished with all the modern amenities he had only heard whispers about from the traders in his village; ovens, running water, electricity, radio, appliances... it was overwhelming.\n\nHe wondered if he was even in bondage anymore. The Labourers were paid now and there was reform in the works to even allow converts to obtain citizenship for themselves, to be free of what vestiges of slavery still hung around their gilded cage. The zebra paused as he slowly switched off the radio, the uncomfortable irony settling over him like a soaked rag; it really was a gilded cage. He lived better in slavery to Chiropterra and their Nightmare then he ever did in Warzena in freedom.\n\nAs he ate a breakfast that he once thought was only reserved for the wealthy, he doubted his desire for freedom. He missed his family, he missed his life... but what was his life? He was a fisherzeeb in a small village, isolated along the coast. He was destined to die there, as his father did and his father before him... it would be a meagre life, but it was a free life? Wasn't it?\n\nKinta was so buried in his own thoughts as he left his apartment, he collided into one of his neighbours; knocking the poor mare off her hooves. "Nik...I am sorry."\n\nShe was a lithe earth pony, with a black mane and sad blue eyes that met his as he slowly helped her up. Her smile was warm and her voice soft, with an unfamiliar twang that hooked his attention, "Overwhelmed?"\n\n"Yes... it is..." Kinta looked around the hallway, confirming it was empty before lowering his voice to her. "Strange."\n\n"Strange?" the mare asked with an arch of her brow. She snorted out a low chuckle before offering her hoof. "It's likely to get stranger if more reforms pass, maybe even pleasant. Misty Eve, by the way... from Maregypt."\n\n"Kinta Kunte, from Warzena," the zebra said with a small grin, her laugh bringing it out.

He was compromising to Chiropterra in every conceivable way.\n\nWhilst deliberating, her father entered the study and inspected the litany of papers on her desk over her shoulder. "Ah, so they finally caught him."\n\n"No easy feat, so I hear. The legionnaires that captured him reported that he was mere minutes away from escaping again by sea." She returned, leaning back in the comfortable office chair.\n\nWallnut was somewhat infamous amongst the upper echelons for surviving his initial flight from the homeland and subsequent anti-Chiropterran efforts in Tobuck. Needless to say, Autumn Breeze seemed mighty pleased that they had finally caught such a troublesome traitor who had so marred their otherwise spotless record of state security.\n\n"So long as he's in competent hooves now, I doubt he'll cause trouble again. Have you decided yet?" He asked, knowing all but the specifics of the apostate's fate already.\n\nShe frowned, for once a little indecisive. "I think it would be best to...""

bat.58.d:0 "Zakon was twenty-two years old, and by the now the stallion had probably seen more hangings than most ponies had in a lifetime. Not that he had much choice in the matter; garrison duty in Tobuck was a bore and the Auxiliary unit he was in had been assigned to cart away the bodies once the rope had done its work. And by the Nightmare, there were a lot of bodies to dispose of; local rebel and bandits mostly.\n\nStill, today was different. Zakon could feel it, as he watched a new prisoner being escorted into the courtyard and up the wooden steps of the gallows. He turned to his sergeant. "Hey sarge. Who's that?"\n\nThe mare lifted her eyes from her cards only for a moment, scowling. "A deserter. Wallnut Drive, that's his name. Heard he abandoned his legion some years ago to come here in Tobuck, of all places. Probably thought he could have some sort of vengeance, apostate and traitor that he is."\n\nZakon let out a soft whistle. A Legionnaire deserter? He'd never heard of such a thing before. The stallion, his hooves and wings bound, climbed carefully up the wooden steps, possessing some remnant of strength despite his stay in a cell. There was something fierce to his face, Zakon could tell. At this point, most would either start crying, begging or raging against their captors. Wallnut did nothing of the sort. His face a mask of calm over what must have been solemn acceptance as the rope was placed around his neck, followed by a black bag over his head.\n\nAn officer by his side pulled out a piece of paper, beginning to read the sentence, and Zakon decided he had seen enough. He knew already how it was going to end anyway. "You're up for a game, sarge?" he called. He almost missed the noise of the trapdoor swinging open."

bat.59.d:0 "As the hoofsteps of the approaching guards heralded the coming of his inevitable demise, Wallnut Drive felt the lingering dread that had been circling his mind cease. A mare marked with a band indicating her medical service confirmed his identity and then he was led by two guards from the cell, their hoofsteps soon merging with the increasing drum beat of his heart. Barely taking any notice of the firing squad that had been positioned opposite, Wallnut was ushered swiftly towards the wall and clapped in irons. Grim and stone faced, the officer held up a sheet of paper, cleared her throat and read in a loud, clear and purposeful voice.\n\n"The condemned, one Wallnut Drive, has been found guilty of apostacy and treason. Henceforth, having been long stripped of rank and purpose within the Legions, he is subsequently stripped of name and sentenced to death. The sentence is to be immediately carried out by firing squad." Another stallion approached him and threw a black sack over his head.\n\n"Detail!" The officer called out. The second last word Wallnut would hear, he realised silently. Across from the doomed stallion, the officer pushed her spectacles up her snout, raised her hoof in the air and signalled for the firing squad to ready. As their rifles were brought upwards, the officer raised her hoof more, indicating for them to aim. \n\n"Fire!" she shouted, bringing her hoof down in one fell movement. The rifles roared to life, and something struck Wallnut. He felt a sudden jolt, a calmness and then a gradual slipping away. In that moment, Wallnut expired, just a dead traitor to be buried in an unmarked grave; despite his incredible luck. His limp body was examined by the medical mare, who confirmed to the officer that he was infact, deceased. With no ceremony, the officer dismissed the firing squad and signalled for the traitor's corpse to be taken away." #Mara

Luckily for Baragzen she wasn't here to give him therapy; and luckily for her he was being very cooperative in the interrogation. She would have considered him rather brave given his calmness, if it wasn't for the fact that he was clearly unaware of the danger he was currently in. After all, she could decide to have him shot.\n\n"That's correct madam. I apologise if my efforts to achieve that goal inadvertently put me at odds with your regime." He managed in response, still calm in spite of his convictions.\n\nAs she finalised one page's worth of notebook scribbles and turned to the next page, a thought crossed her mind. He was trying this hard for a reason, wasn't he? He really thought, or at least hoped, that they would release him so that he could run off and cause trouble with whatever remained of the fortune he had apparently smuggled out of Warzena.\n\nShe put her pen down, clasped her hooves together and leaned back. "If we could promise you such a thing ourselves, would you be willing to cooperate with us?"\n\nThe question got the response she was looking for, one of surprise, even though he did seem intelligent enough to realise that there was likely a catch.\n\nThe Zebra's wide eyes returned to normal as he nodded, "I would.""

Not the individual of course, he seems to be something between an imbecile and a child, but this little part here is certainly something."\n\n"Why thank you!" She gave out, beaming all the while. "He was reportedly a semi-competent general so he should be able to cause some trouble at least, though how effective he can really be in Warzena remains to be seen. It might be better not to vest our resources in this little project, lest it becomes more trouble than it's worth." The mare admitted, cocking her head as her father read the notes over again.\n\nAuburn certainly had a point there. Warlords were only proficient under certain circumstances and making the assumption that this Baragzen fellow would be loyal, let alone competent, would be a considerable gamble. All the same, 'Leopardist' zebras that soaked up fire and casualties so that the legionnaires didn't have to was an appealing prospect. Even idiots could be useful so long as you gave them simple directions and a good enough justification.\n\nShe chuckled lightly and turned to trot into the kitchen, "Tea whilst you think?"\n\n"Mmm... yes, please. I believe this is a proposition that requires a beverage to mull over." He returned with similar nonchalance.\n\nBy the time the kettle had boiled and the tea was ready, the old stallion was sitting down on the settee with his mind made up.

Leave and go abroad to make some money doing the only thing I know how to do, then send the bits back to my relatives in the hopes of starting a counter revolution in Severyana to restore what was lost. To my knowledge nothing has happened in spite of the funds I have provided and the majority of my immediate family have passed in my absence, save my brother Maksim and my aunt Karina."\n\nThough this was supposed to be an interrogation, Auburn Leaf was nothing short of enthralled by the tale told by Alesia Snezhnaya. Her family's history of Nightmare worship afforded her some luxuries with regard to her treatment as a prisoner and admittedly a little bias from her warden who had been here for several hours now.\n\nThe thestral hummed to herself, "If I may, how much did you send?"\n\n"Just over two million bits in raw funds, last I checked. That and whatever historical artefacts I could get my hooves on since I assumed they would sell at home. Had to really work for some of those." She admitted with a slight chuckle.\n\nDespite being a captee, the exile was incredibly personable. Unfortunately that didn't take away from the fact that she had seemingly avoided discussing the matter of faith, which was the main reason that Auburn was still here. She needed to know if Alesia could be allowed a position in the armed forces or if measures needed to be taken to ensure her loyalty, but had received no concrete answer.\n\nOnce the shock at the amount of money that the mare had willingly given away subsided, she excused herself for the day.

Auburn managed after a long sigh.\n\nHer father clutched a hoof to his stomach and guffawed for a good half minute before he managed to get any words out of his mouth, "Ahah! Oh, goodness... Hah... That's marvellous, that is. She managed to keep you occupied for three hours without divulging her personal thoughts on the faith? If I didn't know any better I would say that you avoided the subject yourself; look at what you've done to your old stallion!"\n\nShe let through a grin, having only seen him like this a few times in recent years. "Well yes, she's a smart mare; smart enough to prove her own intellect by simply holding a conversation interesting enough to captivate me." Auburn admitted, "Unfortunately, that still leaves us with the question of what to do with her; an issue only exacerbated by her success, in this case."\n\nThe pair looked at one another, silently communicating their thoughts. He could tell that she wanted to give her a chance, and she could tell that he considered her a threat to internal security in spite of his admiration for her apparent charisma.

A report has been delivered to the Legionary Council suggesting a potentially viable course of action. General standing orders indicate that the locals should be pacified, forcibly, in preparation for their distribution to various services as labor and test subjects.\n\nHowever, the report suggests a more relaxed approach, and goes as far as suggesting we might endear ourselves and the Goddess to the locals by treating them with a softer hoof, perhaps even giving them some token recognition. Sparing the rod, as an example. Whilst not a practice we have yet made much use of, it may however serve as a useful experiment - a sign of Her mercy." #Mara

Our Legionnaires worked quickly to secure them, preventing those vast arsenals from falling into civilian hooves, as the mercenaries themselves showed little interest about keeping on defending the city.\n\nEven more surprising however, was the presence of weapon workshops and other manufacturing facilities, which were too left unattended. Apparently, Tobuck was once a substantial supply deposit for the Storm King's army during his rampage across North Zebrica and, following his defeat, the mercenaries in the city inherited the still-present infrastructure. With some superficial repairs, these old weapon factories can be recalibrated to aid our war effort." #AAAAAAH

Our forces still have troubles dealing with those nomadic tribes, and you also want me to entrust your nephew with more direct military oversight?"\n\nEternal Eclipse shrugged. "I've taught Lucent everything I know. I wouldn't be proposing him for such an assignment if I wasn't sure of his capabilities. Besides, he possesses something that many of us simply lack."\n\n"Is that so? Pray tell then, what is such incredible skill that an entire room of skilled and experienced legionnaires do not possess?" Eclipse chuckled for a moment, evidently finding some amusement in that.\n\n"He knows when to embrace ideas that may appear unorthodox at a first glance and, in that regard, he does share that similarity with you. However, the task will also be a good introduction into a proper role of command. I don't have any intention to hold my title forever, and I will eventually need a successor at the head of the Ursa Legion."\n\nLightning Charm's displeased frown did not abate, only increasing in fact.

They argue that through our combined armies, we will able to force the Hippogriffs to a quick and advantageous settlement to us. In addition, Chiropterra will grant us Zinder as a "gift", though it's clear they just want to shorten their own frontline.\n\nDebate is already raging within our ranks; on one side, Chiropterran attitudes toward anypony that doesn't follow their peculiar faith is well known, as well their constant slave raids against Zumidia and Warzena, which are Zonician land. On the other hoof, their army is far superior to ours in terms of training and experience, and there's no doubt that their presence will aid us greatly in the coming conflict.

Absolutely pathetic! The Hippogriffs are supposed to be scared of you?!"\n\nHe glanced away from the line of zebra and toward the cardboard targets arrayed a few hundred meters away. To his absolute disappointment, only a couple of them had any bullet holes in them, almost none of them to be considered fatal. Then, he came to a sudden halt. One of the targets had clean hole where the hippogriff's head would have been. Shadeswirl frowned, then pointed at the cardboard target. "Who did that? Which one of you damn mules did that?"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, then a zebra mare took a step forward, an old bolt-action rifle slung over her shoulder. "Sir! It was me, sir!" Shadeswirl gave her an appraising look. She was young enough to be his niece, yet if she had managed to nail a target from that distance...\n\n"You!"

Let's see if that was luck, or we actually have a competent marksmare in our midst!"\n\nIt turned out it wasn't luck. There were thirty arrayed targets, and she stopped only to change magazines.

Lucent nodded and they both embraced one another, in a solemn moment, before Lucent gave his grandfather a kiss, saluted, and left the room, tears in his eyes.\n\nEternal Eclipse sat down again, returning to some of the last work of his life.\n\nExamine. Stamp. Approve. File."

bat.83.d:0 "The Council wanted to give Eternal Eclipse a grand state funeral, one observed by thousands. Radio broadcasts, parades, and a cadre of Moonspeakers as far as the eye could see honoring their fallen comrade. Lucent denied this request, he did not need any more reminders that his Grandfather was dead.\n\nThe service was small with only a hooful of ponies present and was given barely a footnote in the state's newspapers. Lunar Hail delivered a short eulogy over the modest casket before it was lowered into the ground. There was no pomp, no circus. It was all as Eternal would have wanted.\n\n"He would be proud of you," Auburn said softly as the rain began to fall and scatter the mourners away. "Not many ponies could stop the Council from using this as a propaganda piece."\n\n"A good stallion died. His death should be honest. It's what he would have wanted," Lucent replied, barely even noticing her hoof on his shoulder.\n\n"Your grandfather was a difficult stallion to figure out, always seemed to have a plan though. Don't you think it strange that he did not leave any instructions for his burial?" Auburn added, adjusting her umbrella for both of them to stand beneath it.\n\n"No," Lucent whispered, shaking his head. His emotion, buried at the bottom of his throat, was starting to spill out as the pair now stood alone at the grave of his mentor. His eyes welled with tears, the stallion barely holding himself together.\n\n"No? Then you know it as well as I do. He trusted you to take care of him and this country up until his final breath," she said. "He would be proud of you... I know I am.""

"We need to talk."\n\n"About your tardiness in returning from Eternal's funeral? Or about the gall you have walking into this office like you own the place?" The sitting Councilmember chastised his daughter lightly, waving a hoof for her to close the door. "Don't let the servants hear a word of my girl having the tenacity of her father."\n\n"You need to retire," she stated flatly.\n\n"...I was being humorous when I commented on your gall, but I'll give myself a pat on the back for giving you the set of stones that makes you think you can come in here and make that demand," Autumn said as he shot up from his seat, leveling a hoof at her.\n\n"Then understand I am making this demand because I love you," she said at a measured, rehearsed pace. "Lord Commander Eclipse was only ten years your senior...and endured only half the sacrifices you have."\n\n"And? Your point? Your mother, the Nightmare bless her soul, knew that I would be on the Council until they peeled my corpse off the meeting table. The only leave I ever took was when she was sick!"\n\n"And that is why you need to retire. You have given all you can to Chiropterra. At the rate you're pushing yourself you won't make it another ten years," Auburn said as she put her hoof down. "Do you really think a young reformer like Lucent at the table will make your job any easier?"\n\n"I was wrong," Autumn said, raising a hoof to rub at his face. "Your mother gave you that fire, maybe I just gave you my way with words."\n\n"You also gave me your stubbornness," Auburn said softly, moving at a slow pace to hug her father. "I would not come here and make this demand if it wasn't the best decision for our family and for Chiropterra."\n\n"...I'll begin the necessary paperwork tomorrow, girl," Autumn said as he patted her back lightly, breaking the embrace as he lowered himself back behind his desk. "First things first? There's been a bottle of wine I've been saving for this occasion, let me give you one last order...go get it for me."\n\n"Yes, Lord Commander," Auburn replied with a gentle smile."

bat.85.d:0 ""May the Empress bless the assembly of this new Council, as ordained by those that came before!" Lunar Hail declared as she finished the invocation, convening the newly assembled council.\n\n"And long shall she reign," Lord Commander Palisade said with a gravely low voice, now the most senior member on the Council with the passing of Eclipse and the retirement of Autumn. "In a rare event, we should welcome two new Commanders to our council. Lord Commander Lucent and Lady Commander Auburn. Traditionally, we try to ease the new Commander in with a simple tasking...something fitting for their position, but still modest enough for them to understand the full range of their reach."\n\n"However," Lightning Charm interrupted with a wave of her hoof, settling her gaze on the still silent Lucent and Auburn, "Tradition is what got us into this situation. Chiropterra was preparing for a millennium for the return to our homeland under the Nightmare. With her defeat? We must reevaluate."\n\n"There is nothing to reconsider! The Night Empress has never led us astray! We must listen to her word and her word alone!" Lunar Hail barked out, standing to her hooves. "To stray from the spirit of her traditions is treason!"\n\n"...which is why we must be quite analytical in our approach," Lady Commander Emerald Light added, attempting to end the argument before it began. "Which is why we are looking to you two in order to find our solution. Despite the unknown variables you might be, I think we have a general understanding of your politics. We all lead the nation in her name, but it will be your ideas that lead us into a new age. Lady Commander Auburn, Lord Commander Lucent...let us begin.""

bat.86.t:0 "The Moderate Mandate"
bat.86.d:0 ""The Moonshine After Action Report and the transcripts of the debates around within this very Council clearly demonstrate the long-term flaws of the Operation," Lucent finalized in a practiced, well-mannered tone. He could not accuse the Council, only walk them towards his solution well enough for them to think it was their own. "Not to mention the well-documented espionage of the former Lord Commander Autumn Breeze showed that modern Equestria was not what our ancestors anticipated. My fellow councilmembers, even if we had won the military victory? The policies we practice in Chiropterra could not be transitioned into Equestria, and if we are to try preparing Zebrica for the Nightmare's next return?"\n\n"...then we have to adapt our policies to fit the scale of our ambitions," Auburn said with a small curse under her breath, the mare may not have agreed with Lucent's approach; but it was clear that she understood it now.\n\n"Your proposal is...borderline Harmonic," Emerald Light noted with a measure of disgust. "Tolerating the worship of other false gods, protecting their lands, and the last nail in our coffin? Legal opposition? Labourers will rise up if we lift our hoof just an inch!"\n\n"We asked him to make a plan that will bring our nation into the future, Emerald. If you disagree with the results...you should not have voted for Lucent's mandate," Auburn said, nodding her head to the Lord Commander. Although her disagreement was clear in her voice, she dipped her head, "It is a time of...change, Lord Commander Lucent. We shall implement your plan to the letter.""
bat.86.a:0 "Lord Commander Lucent's Mandate shall guide us forward!"

bat.87.t:0 "The Hardliner Mandate"
bat.87.d:0 ""It is a mercy, really," Auburn finalized as he trotted around the Legionary Council's table, the various boards and reports littering its surface before the Lord and Lady Commanders painted a clear picture. Auburn's mandate had been chosen and she had delivered a plan that, on the surface seemed malevolent, ensured the long term stability of Chiropterra. "By designating certain regions as...Labourer centers and ensuring a proper Lunar education for even those within the center?"\n\n"We lay the groundwork to integrate the next generation and the one after that," Lucent said, the few compromises he managed to convince Auburn to take were of course her ideas to begin with; but she had to allow him to believe they were his after all. "You're right. Even if we poured the entirety of our resources into swaying the current generation to the Nightmare's cause, there would be so many holdouts. This is the only way forward."\n\n"Agreed," Lightning Charm said as she crossed her forelegs and leaned on the table."We're a society of warriors, we have to prepare for that war no matter how far off it might be. This mandate you've developed, Auburn? It'll make the Commonwealth ready, even if it takes decades."\n\n"I am loathe to agree," General Palisade said with a throaty chuckle. "But, you've managed to surpass our expectations Lady Commander. You have this Council's unanimous approval for this hardline approach.""
bat.87.a:0 "Lady Commander Auburn's Mandate shall bring us the future!"

bat.88.t:0 "The Matter Of Veteran Land Grants"
bat.88.d:0 ""With all due respect, Commander Eclipse, I do not see how such matter is worthy being brought up before the Council," Stone Palisade noted with a slight frown. "Perhaps it would be better to move to more urgent business."\n\n"And it is on this point I must disagree with you, Commander Palisade," Lucent countered, his tone always polite. "In fact, I'll go so far as to say that the matter of land grants for our retiring veterans is deeply intertwined with the security of Chiropterra itself." He shot a careful glance around the table, making sure that the rest councilmembers present that day were doing everything but paying attention to him. As long as they believed the matter of being of little importance, they would be more than happy to give him the leeway he needed to properly implement his program. \n\n"As you are aware, our new domains are vast and our forces stretched thin. Settling individuals loyal to the Commonwealth, who possess both training and weaponry, will help alleviate the burden our regulars are weighted with. Sadly, we only have the resources for implement one of such initiatives in any meaningful way. I have prepared a brief overview on the program, together with an analysis of potential benefits on-"\n\n"Thank you, Commander Eclipse, for your thoroughness," Lightning Charm cut in acidly. "That won't be necessary, however. The Council trusts fully your judgment on the matter. Anypony has any objections?" Her glare to the rest of the commanders threatened to kill anypony brave enough to raise one. "Perfect, it's settled. Let us move on then." All nodded along, Lucent amongst them, though he was careful to hide the small grin on his face. He knew exactly where to begin with the project." #AAAAAAH

Firm Hoof said as she watched her daughter lower the rifle with a frown.\n\n"But I try!" Moonlight said angrily as she reloaded, pulling the bolt up-back-forth-down. "I just don't get it, how am I supposed to keep my eye open when there's an explosion right in front of my face?\n\n"By not fearing it," Firm Hoof said, hunching down by her side. "Raise the gun again, aim onto the target, steady..." she cautioned her. "Line up your shot, and don't jerk the trigger this time..."\n\nThe range was a bit on the smaller side, Firm Hoof would have preferred something bigger, but the location, a large open sand pit only ten minutes away from his new home, was unmatched. Along with the small brook nearby, the fruit trees as well as the fertile soil, she was happy to be here. This was a good place to raise a family and she could see why the previous owners had built their home here. They hadn't used this place as a range though. That probably was a part of why they had lost the fight against Chiropterra; weakness begat failure\n\n"And squeeze..." she told Moonlight, who obeyed and calmly squeezed the trigger, sending the bullet flying directly onto the target, striking only a couple of rings away from the bullseye."

bat.90.t:0 "An Evening At The Pub"
bat.90.d:0 "Deep in the streets of New Ayacachtli, there lies a small bar, popular with Legionaries. In that bar, three glasses clinked together, as three friends gathered to celebrate their promotions. Crimson Wave sat beside his two subordinates, who had served with him from his first command. "Hard to believe how far we've come, I feel like we're barely out from the academy." Crimson said, still adjusting to his new uniform. "I'll say, I bet you've broken the record in terms of just how fast someone can move up the ladder. You make friends with a member of the council or something?" One of his friends commented, before taking another swig of his drink.\n\n"Oh don't be ridiculous, I'm just good at what I do, and that's something the Legion is eager to reward." Crimson responded, before taking a drink himself. "Don't undersell yourself, you put the fear of the nightmare into those heathens last engagement." His friend responded in turn. The group then proceeded to order another round of beer, glad to have some rest after a particularly difficult series of battles.\n\nWhile Crimson Wave had not broken any records, he had still been promoted at a fast pace. His motto, "Harsh but Effective" reflected his policy of command. He expected the very best from his soldiers and gave his best in return. While his ponies trained he would tirelessly study tactics and strategy, ensuring that every aspect of the upcoming battle was in the Legion's favor. This policy had earned him the respect, if not admiration of his Legionaries, and carried him up the ranks.\n\n"But really Crimson, you've gotta slow down and give the rest a chance." His friend said. "You'll be commanding the entire Legion in a few months at this rate." The other commented. "Don't be ridiculous, if I slow down then we'd be drowning in heretics by next week." The table erupted into yet more laughter, as the three continued to drink. And as their celebrations continued long into the night, Crimson Wave thought about the future."

bat.91.d:0 "Lady Commander Auburn Leaf nearly had a stroke when she found the towering pile of documents standing on her desk. She had simply asked any useful material regarding the WLA to be delivered to her, but this? Even worse, a brief skimmer of a couple of those was more than enough to confirm her worries. She immediately sent for the one who had written those reports. Surely, they had to be an exaggeration, right?\n\n"If anything, ma'am, I tried to sugar-coat them as much as possible," the Legionnaire captain reported. "I had the displeasure of being a liaison with the WLA. It's not an experience I would recommend." Auburn nodded, though there was a frown on her face. "The only thing they were somehow useful for was diverting Hippogriff fire away from our regulars. Once in a while, that is."\n\nAuburn shook her head, grimacing. "This is a complete and utter mess. We should have shot that fool when we had the chance." Then, looking up, "You've been with them the longest. Any suggestion on how to deal with those problems?"\n\n"Reorganize the unit completely, ma'am," the captain told her bluntly. "There are some good stallions with them, but they'll amount to nothing as long as the unit stands as it is. The alternative is to put them with our auxiliaries, though even they have a better track record. Or you could follow one of my suggestions and dump them into our workforce. Fresh bodies are always needed there."\n\nAuburn frowned, deeply. By the time her eyes fell one last time onto the thick bundle of disciplinary reports, she had already made up her mind." #AAAAAAH

The Auxiliary formations we sent to disarm them found themselves immediately under intense fire and were beaten back; once proper legionnaires arrived on the scene however, the WLA was already gone, having emptied their barracks of equipment and weapon, scattering across the Warzenan countryside. Though we managed to capture and promptly hang a few as diserters, the Nightmare Hoof believes that the bulk of them have moved to establish contacts with the North Zebrican Liberation Front and other resistance formations. The situation is made all the more dire considering that many of them have actual combat experience and proper training, having fought in the war. Needless to say, our fight to pacify the continent has just become harder."

bat.93.d:0 "In dealing with the red snake, there could not be half-measures; no such thing as unnecessary cruelty. Regular army; loyal Auxiliaries; Frontier Forces and other paramilitary; the Nightmare's Hoof itself. Every available resource was marshalled with the single task of eradicating the red cancer before it could spread.\n\nIt was a long task. Long and dirty. A web on informant had to be implanted among the sympathetic populace to keep track of the NZLF; a carrot-and-stick approach was devised for dealing with labourers, with prizes for those meeting their quotas, encouraging them to keep an eye on their colleagues, and reporting them if necessary. Paramilitary groups and armed settler militias were constantly employed to break apart strikes and spread terror amongst unions. Veteran quick-reaction forces took the fight to the Liberation Front, razing training camps, supply dumps, and sympathetic villages to the ground.\n\nSuch thorough level of state terror finally brought fruit last week, as the SAS finally conducted simultaneous decapitation strikes against members of the NZLF leadership. Apparently, our harsh measure had driven them to the edge of desperation, forcing them to take an ever-active role, and thus exposing themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, our teams have failed to seize Dihya alive.

Only the elite could be trusted with that task, and as such the Legionary Council sent out their deadliest dagger.\n\nThe Imazeeb tribes probably realized something was wrong when they heard the whistle of aircrafts above as they unleashed a deadly payload on their camp in the middle of the night. Such inkling became a frightful certainty as SAS elements popped into existence all around them, seemingly crawling out of the sand itself. The Zarantians were fierce warriors in their own rights, but those under Captain Stirling Silver's guidance had superb training, experimental night vision, and a general lack of self-preservation instinct on their side. Having cut their teeth in a series of bold and risky operations in the last war, they were the kind of colts and fillies that would find charging into a saturation bombardment as an honestly boring proposal.\n\nTracers and armoured vehicles' headlights illuminated the night for hours. Surrounded by his most fanatical warriors and clansmen, Izem stood his ground and fought to the bitter end, directing the resistance from his command tent in his camp's centre.

Governor Carrot Stick would later declare a couple of days of mourning for the unfortunate victims, but that would be it.\n\nUnofficially, however, the security operation in New Bales would go down in the annals of the Nightmare's Hoof as the organization's greatest triumph, nearly rivalling Operation Moonshine in scope, and for good reasons. It had followed months of intelligence and counter-intelligence work, pitting the True Moon Society against the Nightmare's Hoof best field operatives in a veritable game of cat and mouse across the entirety of the Commonwealth.\n\nIn the end, despite the Jackal's thoroughness, he simply did not possess the sheer mole of resources that his opponents had. His headquarter was eventually tracked down through a simple mailmare to an apartment complex, and that's where the Nightmare's Hoof struck mercilessly.\n\nThe Jackal probably expected a midnight raid, or a sniper from a rooftop.

The thestrals, the bats, had only arrived months ago. There had been a war or something, but Benzamal never really listened except for when his Ab and Saba argued. The one thing that they agreed on was that Benzamal was not to talk to the bats under any circumstances.\n\nSurely this would be acceptable, right? It was his only ball!\n\nAnother bat beside 'Leatherwing' frowned sharply as Benzamal gave the soldier a name he heard his Ab use in one of the arguments that shook their home, perhaps he just wanted to kick the ball as well?\n\n'Leatherwing' said something to his friend, tapping their shoulder as he unslung his strange-looking rifle only to then set it on the ground. He hopped the fence and trotted over to Benzamal, smiling as he began to bounce the hoofball around on his wings before setting it on the ground. Benzamal did not understand most of the words 'Leatherwing' said, but he understood 'play' well enough.\n\nThey went on for hours! Chasing each other across the makeshift pitch in one of Papa's out of season fields. Benzamal was not the fastest Zebra in his village, but he was certainly the spriest. 'Leatherwing' was too clumsy, but much stronger. Eventually, more of the bat's friends joined and Benzamal had to pause to wave some of his friends out.

Now though, as she swiped dust and earth away from the entrance of the modest temple in their village, she realized most of that had been probably exaggerated.\n\nThe Chiropterrans had in fact come; as in, ten of them on the back of a small truck, of which only half were armed. They hadn't done much in the time since, aside from building a small temple to their goddess and handing a few pamphlets once in a while. Their original village temple had remained where it was, and Zata and her neighbours were still free to worship their ancestral deities. There was the matter of taxation of course, but it wasn't too harsh, and the invaders accepted payment in nature.\n\nZata stopped, frowning. She knew for a fact that some of her friends had started listening to the Moonspeaker's sermons, some just to avoid the higher taxes but others out of legitimate interest. Perhaps she could do the same, or at least listen to what that Moonspeaker had to say. There was no harm in that, right? After all, they had kicked the Hippogriffs out, so there had to be something concrete behind all of that stuff about the Goddess of the Night and what not.\n\nHer mind made up, she returned to the task at hoof.

A proposition bearing all the councilmembers' signatures? Not even the Nightmare's Hoof was that elaborate.\n\nGovernor Carrot Stick spent the following night awake, drawing up plans and contacting supporters. There was no time to lose; Chiropterra was changing and, with some work, it would become a better place to all, not just Citizens. It would be a difficult process; Chiropterra never had something resembling an opposition party, let alone a legal one. Still, Carrot Stick was confident.

In a wide auditorium in New Ayacachtli, Governor Carrot Stick officially announced to an astonished audience the creation of the first true political formation in Chiropterra. Under any other circumstance, this would have been considered a grave act against the state, but a special allowance had been granted by the Legionary Council, with the Lords and Lady Commanders expressing timid support.\n\nGovernor Carrot Stick spoke for a long time, capturing the audience's attention for almost forty-five minutes with masterful oratory skills. He spoke of the sacrifices Chiropterra had to endure; Moonshine; the war against Aris; the Bush War. Carrot praised the efforts of the legionnaires in achieving such triumph, but he pointed out at the same time how increased military spending was the wrong approach, especially if Chiropterra desired a thorough and complete integration of the rest of the Commonwealth.\n\nHe exposed his ideal for the future of the nation, one where the faith in the Nightmare had spread across the entire Commonwealth, and where the newly converted could enjoy the same rights as Citizens. He promised that the newly established Integration League would work closely with the Council so to achieve just that; one nation under the Nightmare.\n\nOverall, reception has been rather positive. Though some hardliners were quick to brand the new political formation as nothing more than 'treacherous crypto-harmonic politics', many moderates took the chance to praise the efforts of the governor to forge a brighter future for the entire nation." #AAAAAAH

Lucent countered, shaking his head as he adjusted the wide brimmed hat that hid most of his features from wandering eyes.\n\n"Sneaking away from your grandfather and my father to discuss our hopes and dreams for the county in a cramped pantry still partially involved politics, if you can manage to recall that part," Auburn chastised with a flick of her hoof. "...despite the direction you have taken us? I believe we are stronger for it."\n\n"That's hardly what you're saying in the papers," Lucent noted over the rim of his cup.\n\n"We'd be weaker without the struggle, Lucent. What's the point of the path you put on us without the occasional kicking and fighting in the other direction, just to say within a semblance of tradition? None of it is personal, mind you," Auburn noted with a sly grin.\n\n"...I know," Lucent admitted with an equally light chuckle. "How long are we going to be on opposite sides of the aisle, Auburn?"\n\n"Probably the rest of our lives...so long as Chiropterra stands, I can't imagine either of us not trying to do what's best for her," she noted with a rather somber expression.\n\n"...you're my best friend and my worthiest opponent," Lucent replied after a long pause.

Ashen Mist had heard that the Council was looking for potential settlers to finally spread civilization in North Zebrica, preferably veterans, and she had signed up almost immediately.\n\nAs every early afternoon, Ashen Mist took a stroll down the settlement main thoroughfare; a few colonists recognized her and waved at her as she passed; she stopped a couple of times to exchange a few words. It was a pleasant chatter, at least most of the time.\n\n"I've heard rumours that the rebels might still be out there, ma'am. You think we should be worried?" one of the farmers inquired. "I'm not very good with a gun, and my wife is expecting our third colt."\n\n"Oh, don't you worry about that," Ashen Mist reassured him with a hearty laugh. "They can keep skulking around all they want. These are our lands now, and the sooner they accept it, the better. And if they don't, we just have to give them another lick for good measure!" They shared both a laugh before departing ways.\n\nAshen Mist felt proud of what they have managed to accomplish in so little time. Where once those lands were a lawless patchwork of backward villages and tribes, now neatly arranged communities of faithful were in their place. The colonists tended to their camps, raising their own families according to the Nightmare's teachings; and with each passing day the rebel bands were beaten back more and more.

Why he was doing it, or why those tubes required one all in the same spot, Zatoi couldn't tell, nor he did care. All around him, other Labourers carried out a similar task, more or less. Zatoi had never asked them what their job was, and he did not have the time anyway. He had a quota to meet.\n\nIt had not been always like that. There had been times when Zatoi had his own fields to tend to, passed down from generation to generation. He used to have a small, yet comfortable home in the village he had grown up in. Now, both his fields and the village were gone, burned down by the invaders. The factory and the tubes were in their place. His friends and family were gone too; some had fled; others had died; a few went to join some resistance group only to be hunted down by the invaders.\n\nHours passed, and Zatoi continued drilling holes in steel tubes. The sound of hoofsteps echoed behind him at regular intervals as the overseers made their rounds between rows and rows of working Labourers.

A choice had been made, he had placed his faith in the Council's decision, and now he regretted ever assuming his seat. He could not stand by his...friend faithfully anymore, her politics had driven a wedge between them. Each report of a purge or reprisal made to keep the East in line drove the divide between them deeper.\n\nLucent consoled himself that he was in a position to mitigate the damage she caused, he could not stop it though.

But this wasn't some normal attack, there was no large force arriving, no army coming to wash away the Lunarists. This was a precise raid, and there was only one possible target, Commanders Stone Palisade and Lightning Charm. Both Commanders were quickly rushed to a secure bunker beneath the camp by Legionnaires, unsure where the hostiles were, unable to track any movement through the base. As they reached the most secure part of the bunker, the door was locked, and the two of them barricaded inside.\n\nLightning Charm breathed a sigh of relief, in all her efforts of trying to enforce discipline within the army, it seemed to have broken down. No one knew what was going on. How many were in the camp? Why did they cut through a fence and then announce themselves with a red smoke grenade? Stone Palisade was pacing back and forth in the room while Lightning Charm pulled up a chair. As usual, Palisade maintained his stern appearance, even as the ceiling above him began to shake, and the air conditioning vent began to rattle. As Stone Palisade looked up to see this, he frowned and muttered, "Oh dear."\n\nDiving out of the way as the vent fell and a creature followed. Throwing himself behind a chair, Palisade ducked as Charm pulled her pistol and yelled, "Identify yourself intruder!" The creature stood, dusted himself off and said, "Ah great, I have you both in one place now!" As Stone Palisade heard the voice, he yelled out, "Hold fire Lightning!" Standing up, he looked at the "intruder" in the room, a disheveled Pegasus in a Chiropterran uniform, and he rolled his eyes. "Captain Silver." He began, "What in Tartarus are you doing here?" Stirling Silver dusted himself off, pulled some papers from his coat, and responded casually, "Well Commander, I just wanted you to look at my proposal, that's all." Lightning Charm sat confused as Commander Palisade spoke to the creature who, most likely, set off the camp alarm in the first place, and butted in "Hold on, you know him Stone?" Stone Palisade turned, took a deep breath, and said, "Yes, this is Captain Stirling Silver. He's been "reminding" me for weeks now about his proposal to form a new commando unit. He broke into my office once already to put it on my desk, and I told him I would look at it." Stirling butted in, "But you hadn't gotten back to me, so I decided to speak to you again."\n\nLightning Charm straightened herself and looked the pegasus up and down, "Well, considering you broke into Commander Palisade's office, and now into this secure bunker, I'd say that you at least have some credentials as a commando.

Lunar Hail entered flanked by two other ponies, the Lady Commander took her seat, and her entourage pulled up chairs behind her.\n\n"Hello everyone." Lunar Hail began, "Thank you all for being here to discuss my replacement. As while it saddens me deeply, the Empress' word is clear. I must surrender one of my posts. And so while I do this, I hope you would consider my preferred successors." Gesturing to her left, she said, "For Lord Commander, I nominate Brigadier General Leaf LeHay. He is a close friend of mine and would lead well in my stead." Then to her right, "For Chief Moonspeaker, this is Falling Star. An acolyte of mine who has recently returned from Equestria and has received theological guidance from the Empress herself." Lunar Hail took a breath, "But I leave it up to you, my brothers and sisters, which post I am to leave. For I have been unable to decide myself."\n\nEach Legionary Commander weighed their options, and began to discuss and debate with one another.\n\nOn one side, Commander Emerald Light has been a close friend of Lunar Hail for years, and wishes her to remain on the council so that they can keep their friendship healthy. Commander Lucent Eclipse, on the other hoof, knows Falling Star. And knows her religious beliefs are far more moderate than the dogmatic Lunar Hail, so he as well wishes to keep Hail on the council.\n\nOpposing them is Commander Lightning Charm, she knows LeHay well, and respects him as a military commander far more than Lunar Hail, who leads with fervor, not discipline. Then, Commander Auburn Leaf, who knows Falling Star as well as Lucent, but knows her cause will be benefited by Lunar's brand of faith being the guiding force for the nation.\n\nThe only commander without an opinion seems to be Stone Palisade, and as he listens to the arguments, and two commanders seem to plan to vote on each side, he considers his options.

It's been five years since you retired and you're looking like a skeleton!" Autumn added with a prodding laugh to his friend.

Lunar asked with a knowing expression, the mare wearing traditional religious garb instead of her old Legion uniform.\n\n"As far as the public knows? The LMRD has been pacified, curtailed.

There can be no protests about places that don't officially exist after all," Emerald explained in her typical, calculating tone.\n\n"And is that why you're here? To give thanks to the Empress?

Not even the thorough Nightmare's Hoof gathered much on him, which itself speak volumes about his importance or capacity to present a real threat to us. His presence has however sparked a debate within the council.\n\nIt's true that the last thing we need is some figure the people of Warzena can rally behind after our conquest is done, no matter how unlikely he is. On the other hoof, imprisonment is the most obvious option, as he doesn't have much in the way of foreign or local support and poses no danger to us at the moment. There is of course the possibility of using him to rally the Warzenan expats to us, and then install him on the throne once the dust settles.

As such, a fierce debate now rages within the Legionary Council.\n\nOn one side, Lady Commander Lightning Charm has laid down the hard-line approach, which would involve full-on military occupation of the new territories in order to pacify them. It will consist of splitting the lands into several military-led governorships and granting local commanders ample autonomy in how to deal with resistance in their assigned zones. Such method would allow us to keep a tight grip on the newly acquired resources.\n\nOn the other hoof, Lord Commander Eclipse is pioneering a completely different view. He argues that his colleague's methods would divert considerable military assets from more pressing matters, especially as we still prepare other campaign of conquest in the immediate future. Therefore, he suggests a laxer approach, relying on local authorities and elites that are easy to coopt to our advantage. That way, local resistance would be easier to deal with over the long term.\n\nBoth plans have their merits and downsides but, as the Legionary Council is conveyed once more to discuss the subject, only one approach can in the end prevail." #AAAAAAH

"...how did you?"\n\n"I did my service to Chiropterra in the Nightmare's Hoof. I picked up a few tricks from my time in the agency, spotted you early on. My time as an agent was far less glorious than my compatriots who laid the foundations for Moonshine. My cover was a bureaucrat in the Equestrian diarchy, a bean counter," Carrot Stick noted, pausing for a moment to give her a chance to start writing. "I was a good bean counter though. Good enough that when I came back I was able to become a proper civil-servant."\n\n"And what a career its been! Your social reforms in New Bales have completely changed...a-and that brings me to...your opponents have..." Flashing Bulb shook her head, still caught off guard by Carrot Stick's casual demeanor. Her words faltered further as Carrot Stick suddenly rose from his desk and began to pour her a cup of tea.\n\n"They believe I harbor harmonic ideals. No cream, two sugars; right?" Carrot asked, trotting over to place two sugar cubes on the side of her tea as if it were a forgone conclusion. \n\n"Yes...I...don't think I've had any tea since I've been to New Bales though," Flashing Bulb said with a small whisper.\n\n"No?

A skilled worker must be rewarded."\n\n"Many say your business practices undercut the importance of traditions of our state, Miss Meadow," Flashing Bulb replied, the young thestral looking around her in amazement as various luxuries were built in record time. Refrigerators, radios, and air conditioners were slapped together on assembly lines that wrapped around the walls. It was hard to believe that Spring Meadow also governed an entire province from this same factory.\n\n"Governor Meadow, Miss Bulb. I spent a great deal of time winning that election and since time is money...I am going to wring that title for all its worth," Governor Meadow gently corrected as the tall mare continued trotting along. "Tradition is rooted in power. Power comes from the people. And profit also comes from the people! As long as the people are happy, profits are good, business is booming, and our workers are all taken care of...we're still abiding by traditions...just in a...new 'innovative' way!"\n\n"Your circular logic hasn't won you very many friends on the Legionary Council, Governor Meadow. Many are marking you as a corrupt market liberal as if you were a broker from Celestia's Manehattan," Flashing Bulb noted as she canted her head back curiously. "Your response?"\n\n"My first reaction is to hire whoever came up with that slander. It's good, rooted enough in the truth to stick to me. Make sure you put that in your column, Miss Bulb. I'll pay them twice as much than whatever bootlicker on the Council is offering. I might enjoy a free market, but I enjoy a freer Commonwealth more," Spring theorized with a light wave of her hoof.\n\n"A Commonwealth free to be squeezed for your bottom line?" Flashing Bulb deadpanned to a surprised Spring Meadow.\n\n"Miss Bulb! I am not one to profit off the people! I merely profit from them. War, expansionism, and segregation are all crippling effects on our economy and dreadfully expensive to justify in marketing.

A mistake that elicited another mourning groan from the former naval hero. "Citizen Crescent, what do you make of the Council's policies towards continued militarization even in the wake of our beloved Empress' great victory on Equus?"\n\nRolling his eyes, the grizzled stallion adjusted his simple suit. The long scars over his face painted a sharp contrast to his mundane attire, save for the empty sleeve of his jacket pinned against his chest, "Every citizen has a duty to his country. Some time ago? That duty cost me my leg. It costed others a great deal more. It was a sacrifice I made willingly, just as I willingly continue to campaign against continued militarism. We just won a thousand year struggle. The solution isn't more battleships, it is about taking care of those who struggled to make that victory possible."\n\n"Many in the public sympathize with those goals, Citizen Crescent...but there are concerns among the Laborers. Just as you've said to me now, you wish to improve the situation of the citizens of Chiropterra...what of our indentured assets?"

Beside him stood Spring Meadow in a regal dress and Ember Crescent in his simple, nearly ratty suit.\n\nRather than packed into the crowded rows of reporters desperately attempting to fling questions and snap photos, Flashing Bulb stood comfortably to the side of the stage with a clipboard in her hoof. It was likely Carrot that told Spring it was Flashing who first compared her broker on Manehattan. And true to her word, Governor Meadow really was willing to pay three times what the New Ayacachtli Inquirer could. In fact? She was willing to buy the newspaper itself.\n\nThe pay raise and promotion unsettled Flashing's journalistic integrity somewhat, but in the weeks that followed none of the growing cabal known as the 'Governor's Pact' made any attempt to censor her. Moreover, the more she followed the trio it became readily apparent how genuine they were. A spy, an industrialist, and a bitter veteran truly appeared to be the best hope for a free Chiropterra.\n\nAnd this was the culmination of it all, an official announcement. Carrot Stick took the name of course: 'Governor's Pact'. His speech was rousing, empowered...each word carrying the weight of a stallion that knew what the crowd needed to hear...not what they wanted to hear. He spoke of a dream, gifted from the Nightmare herself, of a united Commonwealth. One born from the sacrifices of their ancestors, but one freed from their mistakes. One devoted to their Empress, but liberated from their own chains. Flashing's scepticism melted away then, lost in her own applause as she clapped from the forefront of history."

The Commonwealth has been secure, we're waging a war for peace now."\n\n"I have not known you to be one to dance around a point, Lightning," Palisade laughed, taking a sip from his drink.\n\n"And I know you can hardly pick up on subtleties...the Council needs to be reformed. The Pact was right about that, but they were wrong about who should do it," Lightning explained with a firm nod, setting her drink down as she stood up.

While the Night Empress dictated the economic laws on Equus, the Commonwealth was enjoying a much less restrictive period of growth...for now.\n\nA series of shell companies leftover from the Nightmare's Hoof operations during Moonshine gave them a hoof in the door in just about every major world market. Spring made sure that within the Commonwealth of Chiropterra that no business would have an underhoofed advantage over the other, but through the shell companies?\n\nSpring Meadow would not allow the stock market on Palisade Street to profit from the loyal subjects of the Empress on Zebrica or on Equus. The rest of the world though? She could squeeze them for the bottom line with punitive tariffs, lobbying, and quiet exploitation.

Peaceful protests, lawful elections, and petitions to local officials? It is everything I ever wanted to see in political opposition."\n\nPressed for more commentary, the Governor-General did relent that the Integration League's ideals are largely aligned with the Carrot-Crescent government but completely out of his hooves; "There is no formal organization or political party like when we formed the Pact.

bat.156.t:0 "The Curtain Call"
bat.156.d_1:0 "Dusk Wane sat back, contemplating the future. As he did so, he stared into the bottom of a glass of whisky and pondered his options. Well, for the sake of the nation, he knew that some 'accidents' would have to happen. Three other leaders vying with him for control would surely lead to more civil unrest, which would likely cause further untold damage and cost too many lives. Batton, Ocean Spray and Carrot. Hm. Well, two of those were easy to reconcile, at least. Batton had a good military head and might have unknown assets held over from the Legions. He was also well regarded among his peers, and that made him a threat. He'd have to go, for sure. Ocean Spray, too. He was dangerous, reckless, and impulsive. There was no way Dusk was going to allow that particular brand of madness to be anywhere near power in Chiropterra, not in the least. Lastly however, there was Carrot. Carrot was a problem. He was affable enough that even Dusk had found a comrade in him. He could perhaps even see the thestral as a friend. For what felt like a few agonising minutes, Dusk swirled the whisky as he thought and slowly sipped away at it. Despite everything, he had to put aside personal feelings. Carrot had to go, he reluctantly accepted. Perhaps he could make it quick, as a small mark of respect. Yes, that'd do. A quick death for Carrot. That'd put all the pieces out of play." #Mara
bat.156.d_2:0 "Carrot Stick twirled a pencil around in thought, staring at pictures of his political opponents. He had to move carefully, in order to preserve the carefully crafted public image that he had, and also to sustain the fragile society that had just narrowly managed to come together. Some messages needed to be sent, and perhaps there was some scope for reconciliation.\n\nFirst up was Gorge Z. Batton. He was a well liked figure, but with his ideas he was also a clear threat to democracy. He needed to be disposed of. An accident, a most heinous and terrible thing would need to transpire to remove Batton from the field. With him gone, the remainder of his faction could be brought back into the fold.\n\nThe next target, however, was Ocean Spray. He was loud, dangerous and destructive. He needed to be dealt with in such a way that a message was sent to all of like minds. A grin split his features for a moment. The Jackal, yes. That'd be a suitable way of dealing with Ocean Spray. He could frame Batton's accident on Ocean Spray, and cut the CMS down in a single blow. It would be difficult, but Carrot knew the Jackal could do it.\n\nLastly, there was Dusk Wane. He was a problem, but perhaps an approachable problem. Perhaps there was some scope for bringing Dusk's lot into the political sphere as a form of legitimate opposition, one that could be kept balanced to avoid becoming too much of a threat. With everything set, it was time to bring an end to the game." #Mara
bat.156.d_3:0 "Victory. It was something that only a soldier could truly appreciate, with all the hard work, the blood, sweat and tears that were spilled to achieve it. At long last, Chiropterra had regained its dignity with total victory over their enemies. With the nation reunited in land as well as spirit, the Chiropterrans could once again be proud of their nation.\n\nAnd of course, such a monumentous occasion called for an equally great celebration. It was Gorge Z. Batton, his loyal patriotic soldiers and his aristocratic friends who had brought honor to the nation, and it was them who would reap the rewards. Gorge was the thestral in the limelight now, the hero of heroes, the single candidate to lead Chiropterra into a glorious future. There would be some things that needed fixing of course, but the days ahead were looking brighter by the moon's light.\n\nThe other political leaders would see reason, surely. Gorge was too popular now among his allies and soldiers to be realistically challenged by any other, inspiring any and all patriotic Chiropterrans to stand with him instead of others like Dusk Wane or Carrot Stick. No, they would simply give up and fade backwards into obscurity, having little with the future that Gorge Z. Batton wanted for the Republic. With him at the head of an army and nation, it was time for the world to see again what his people could do."

Zuwena was taking care of the military staff that could potentially be problematic in whatever capacity he saw fit and his aides were making sure that the right preparations were being made in the capitol building.\n\nOcean Spray had always wanted to execute some sort of grand plan like this, something that would make Emerald Light treat him like less of a lapdog and more like a partner. What he had been putting into motion over the last few weeks would prove that he was capable of handling even the most complex and marvellous of schemes but within and outside of the LMRD. The foolish reformists, the utterly idiotic socialists and the stagnant army would soon see the will of the Nightmare executed in full.\n\nThe thestral sighed and stood up from his desk, putting a hoof to the scar on his cheek. Sauntering over to the table in front of his workstation he realised just how long his day had been, what with all the charges he had made essentially on his own. Lucky for him the LMRD had the resources for five-hundred kilograms of dynamite, though it had taken just about every remaining favour he had to keep the procurement a secret.\n\nStaring at the enormous mound of explosives sitting in his office, Ocean smiled. Those politicians might live just long enough to see their flawed dreams set alight by somepony truly worthy of ruling the goddess' beloved colony."

bat.157.d:0 "Ah, what a fine day! Batton felt something of a grin on his face as he sped along in his car, enjoying the sights and scenery. Well, who was he to deny himself a small sense of satisfaction at recent events? As his journey took him down a high road towards the coast, Batton reflected on how he'd gotten where he was. Sure, there had been some sacrifices, and a lot of creatures had suffered difficulties, but that was in the past. Now he had the future to be working towards, and nopony would be able to stop him from accomplishing that! Nevertheless, it had been an eventful time for him. His musings took him through his days in the Legions and the many battles he'd fought, won and survived, the brave Legionnaires he'd led and bled with, through the recent strife and the new beginnings. Still, onwards and upwards. Now with all the contacts and alliances he'd started to make amongst the lingering aristocracy, things seemed to almost be better than ever.\n\nAs he pondered this, the stallion noticed an upcoming sharp-looking turn, and gently pressed upon the car's brakes to slow down...except it didn't. He tried again. Still nothing. Confusion swiftly made way for rising panic, and the stallion jammed his hoof on the brakes over and over again as panic gripped his heart. He realised all too late that his brakes had been tampered with, and as he slammed down on the brake one final time, hoping beyond hope that the car would respond and begin to slow down. It did not, and the vehicle left the road and cliff behind at great speed." #Mara

bat.158.d_1:0 "As he sat patiently at the bar, Dusk Wane poured himself a measure from the whisky bottle on the bartop and knocked it back. He looked at the second shot glass, one he'd placed there ahead of Carrot Stick's arrival. For the moment, he needed the steadying measure, given that one of his 'assistants' had informed him that the arrangements were in place. As much as he'd been getting friendly with Carrot Stick, there was no room for him in the future of the country. Now that Batton had been...dealt with, it was time to clear another check mark. A sound from outside drew him from his reverie, accompanied by the sound of hoofsteps down into the bar. It was Carrot. Dusk Wane waved him over and gestured at the stool next to him.\n\n"Sit, sit. Come sit and drink. We have to talk, yes?" Dusk began, pouring more whisky into his glass and the one offered to Carrot Stick. Seemingly ignorant of the imminent peril he was in, Carrot smiled at his friend and took both the stool and the drink. Both of them raised their glasses, clinked them together and toasted to the other's good health. Something inside of Dusk's stomach knotted briefly, for a moment.\n\nCarrot Stick chatted warmly with Dusk Wane, offering to help them both work together to bring a bright future for the country, and that united, they could form an unbreakable bond. With great internal effort, Dusk put on a great show of listening to and outwardly accepting the aired ideas, appearing to be quite reasonable. When at last an accord had been met, Dusk once again offered a small toast to Carrot, and then bid him farewell. He stayed behind as the other stallion left the bar, his ears twitching at the sound of the car door slamming shut. Mentally, he counted down. Time to put the key in the ignition, time to turn the key, and...\n\nThe explosion which followed was loud enough that the bottles inside the bar rattled and clanked, one or two falling over. Dusk took a moment to compose himself." #Mara
bat.158.d_2:0 "With a jaunty rhythm, Carrot Stick hopped out of his car and descended the steps down into the bar below. He'd asked to meet Dusk Wane here, in order to ask for the old bat's assistance in ironing out some issues. Moreover, with Batton now out of the way, he needed to make sure that there was support available for his ideas and reforms, and no 'pressing issues' that would need to resolve themselves. However, he was quite sure that nothing of the sort was needed with Dusk. He and the old bat had been quite cordial with each other. Taking an offered drink, Carrot settled down at a stool next to Dusk.\n\n"Glad you agreed to meet me, Dusk." He admitted. "I know you like things to be straight up and simple, so here it is, no horseapples. I think that you and I could do good things. I know you're a reasonable stallion, so I'd like to ask for your assistance in rebuilding and running the country. I know you probably have your own ideas, and I'm sure we can look at putting something feasible into action. I'm not one for begging, but I ask that you listen to me and give my proposal your full consideration."\n\nDusk Wane looked at the stallion, nodded, and seemed to perk up. For a while, the two talked about many things; from infrastructure, reform, potential sources of conflict, to industrial projects and the place of the military. Eventually however, things drew to a close. With a toast to good health, Dusk Wane and Carrot Stick parted ways for the day. Carrot made his way back to his car and fumbled his way inside. Smiling at how things had gone, he turned the key in the ignition." #Mara

bat.159.d:0 "As one of his aides trotted out, Ocean Spray's relatively calm-looking exterior began to crumble. He'd just received the news of Carrot Stick's rather untimely and explosive death. This, added to the already highly coincidental 'accident' that Batton had suffered, could really only mean one thing - Dusk Wane was behind it all. If it had just been Batton, that was perhaps an accident that could've been written off as highly unfortunate for Batton. Carrot's death was a sign that another force was at work. With the writing on the wall, he fired up the wireless transmitter.\n\n"My loyal followers, we come to a crossroads in history, a pivotal moment where you are all needed, each and every one of you. Today I have learned that Dusk Wane, the foul villain he is, is responsible for the deaths of two proud Chiropterrans, and must be held accountable for these heinous acts. Not only did he engage in brazen skullduggery to cause Gorge Z. Batton's death via a vehicular accident, he was the one responsible for the cowardly assassination of Carrot Stick via bombing. No government in his name is a legitimate government, and I call upon you all to reject his false statehood. Rise up, defend your land, and protect your homes. We shall never bend the knee to those who would oppress us, and shall resist with every fiber of our being."\n\nSpeech delivered, Ocean Spray took a moment to throw a few things into a case and bolted as quickly as he could. Now that he'd made a target of himself, it was time to go somewhere a bit safer and further away. Skyfall sounded good." #Mara

The recent outburst of madness from that little wretch, Ocean Spray, had sent all of his planning to the trash. The weaselly vermin had somehow managed to wrangle his supporters into a somewhat organised force, and now they were squarely being aimed in his general direction. After the careful consolidation of the fledgling power structure for Chiropterra, the last thing he needed was a jumped-up reckless vagabond like Spray to torpedo the caves, as it were.\n\nThe old stallion harrumphed a few times, and composed himself. He'd find a Moonspeaker to talk to later; someone to make his mind plain to, but not all of his thoughts. Some burdens had to be borne by him alone, for that was the way of things. He needed to carry these things, so that others might not have to endure the same privations.\nA plan, then. First things first, action.\n\n Laying out the steps in his mind, Dusk resolved to establish an emergency - highly temporary - government in order to neuter Ocean Spray's little uprising and the threat it posed. He knew a few trustworthy folks that he could tap for this role, but the important thing was to act, and act quickly. This government had to move on Spray's stupidity quickly, and then he could cement it's legitimacy. With a small nod of self understanding, Wane left to put his plan into motion." #Mara

No one had quite expected it to happen, not so suddenly. But, as the article read, it was quite simple. An investigation into the late General Gorge Z. Batton's death had found it linked to Ocean Spray himself, alongside a multitude of other offenses ranging from crimes against equinity to jaywalking. He had been hauled in last night by local police and the True Moon Society and was awaiting trial.\n\nSimultaneously, by what many assumed were sheer coincidence, a series of deadly attacks had been carried out on high ranking Crescent Moon Society members, leaving the entire organization in shambles. Some weren't fooled by the coordination, but few could have guessed the cause, or the truth. Carrot Stick had merely given the orders; the Jackal had done all the work, no questions asked.\n\nNo matter what, however, one thing was certain.

With our victory and reunification of our people, the time has come to make peace with each other. The chaos that has led to the tragic accidents that befell General Batton orchestrated by Ocean Spray can not continue. In cooperation with the parties of Chiropterra, I am announcing the official formation of a new, independent government for the nation, for unity and for all, whether we be laborer or aristocrat. It's time for us to change, and become better as a people."\n\nMany cheered. Others were less certain or optimistic.

Batton and his political allies. While he personally had no real political experience, the aristocratic friends he had made were doing well in adapting to their new role as elected officials, and the many soldiers provided a good base of support. After months of turmoil, it was looking like Chiropterra's politics were finally stabilizing.\n\nAnd that was when the explosions happened. Gorge himself almost fell out his presidential chair as the shockwaves reverberated throughout the city, smoke and fire filling the skies. The radio on the desk nearby crackled to life a few seconds later, a broadcast for all of Chiropterra to hear.\n\n"Loyal citizens of the republic. As of now the capitol building is occupied by false leaders of Chiropterra, who seek to destroy all that we have worked centuries to achieve. I, and the Crescent Moon Society, refuse to let these decadent traitors lead our nation, and will do whatever it takes to see this government overthrown."\n\nAs the broadcasted ended, all eyes turned to Gorge, who seemed relatively unworried at what had just occurred. It was a surprise, but not too much of a serious one. While Ocean Spray's betrayal was unfortunate, his faction was only a small part of Chiropterra, and it would not be long before they would fall back in line.

Flashes and explosions rocked the city, waking up everypony in the capitol building, including Gorge himself. Quite annoyed at being interrupted at this hour, he made it to his office just as the radio crackled once again, a different familiar voice taking to the air.\n\n"My fellow laborers of Chiropterra. For the past few days we have been forced to live among terrorists in our own nation, the Crescent Moon Society running rampant in our cities. And yet, the government does nothing to stop them, letting this disease fester and threaten to enslave us once more! We Labourists are left with no choice but to take matters into our own hooves, and deal with this threat ourselves."\n\nUnlike the incident with Ocean Spray, this time Gorge was sparing no subtlety in his anger. He was shaking with rage, almost slamming his desk with a hoof. "That bastard!" he exclaimed, clearly having had enough. "Only making this Nightmare-forsaken problem worse!"

The terror bombings, the gunfights in the streets, the violence in every corner of the nation; things had gotten out of hoof fast, faster than anypony could have expected.\n\n"This situation is unacceptable!" Gorge yelled, hoof slamming the table in front of him. "Somehow we've let ourselves be surrounded by traitors and left-wing parasites, and we can't even do anything about it! We've won, for Nightmare's sake! And now I'm being told that we're having to fight our own soldiers from the words of a madpony and a jumped-up labourist!"\n\nMany of the officers murmured at each other, but Batton wasn't done. "Stirling!" The officer saluted, remaining at attention. "I want you and your soldiers to deal with the paramilitaries. Pinkos, radicals, I don't care. Just shut them up and stop them from tearing our nation apart!"\n\n"Yes, sir. But what are you going to do?"\n\nGorge stood up, putting on a display of his own military uniform. "I'm going to get Chiropterra back on our side, and show them that we're the ones in charge now, not some terrorists causing trouble." There was a few seconds of silence before he waved a hoof. "Now go! Get out! Do your jobs, and I swear by the Nightmare you better do them well or I'll be personally making sure you're on latrine duty for a full moon!""

Normally he would have made an address from in or around the building, but there were two very good explanations for visiting the state broadcasting station instead.\n\nHe cleared his throat a mere moment before the 'On Air' sign flicked on, "Loyal citizens of the republic, I speak to you today with important news."\n\nThe first reason was obvious, the building and the equipment stored within it were little more than burning rubble. As for the second, well; he was grinning just thinking about it.\n\n"Three quarters of an hour ago, a plan long in motion came to its conclusion. My allies and I in the CMS have destroyed the capitol building and dealt with the decadent scum within it, all at once. As of now, Chiropterra is under our jurisdiction."\n\nOcean Spray sighed, sat back and turned to face the booth operators whose jaws had yet to leave the floor as silence filled the air.

For his part, Chiropterra's new Warmaster was also immensely stressed; something that anypony who knew him would be able to recognise as unusual. Given the circumstances his sudden change in demeanour wasn't exactly surprising, not least for the fact that this mess was all his fault.\n\nNothing was going to plan anymore.\n\nA zebra galloped into his office, fur coated in sweat and blood.

A few days of tailing that zebra who seemed to be the maniac's only friend made a quiet night raid easy to prepare, though it would have been a lie to say that they had truly expected it to be this easy.\n\nThe squad of six quietly cleared every room on the ground floor and crept silently up the carpeted staircase, looking for their target. Installing a new government once Ocean Spray was no longer an issue would be a simple affair and not one pony would mourn his passing; all they had to do was get rid of him.\n\nHe was found in the second-to-last room to be cleared, lying fast asleep in a king-sized bed. Stirling stared at the slowly breathing body of the lunatic and stepped gingerly towards him, weapon aimed at the unconscious thestral's head.

No longer would Nightmareism be forced down everycreature's throat and religions and cultures branded as being "deviant" be oppressed. The reactionaries tried to stop these fundamental rights from materialising but they failed.\n\nThe defeat of the supremacists and militarists and their authoritarian ways has ushered in a new era.

The forces of Dusk Wane and Ocean Spray had put up a heavy fight, pulling out every card they had against nation, from terror bombings to assassinations. And yet, here they were. The paramilitaries were all gone, defeated and scattered to the wind. Stirling had reported back that the threats to the government had been dealt with, and peace had returned. The leaders of the factions themselves were still unaccounted for, but Gorge was sure that they would find the two eventually.\n\nStill, this was a great step in the right direction. He had kept his promise; there had been no negotiations, as was befitting of treason. He had remained true to his values, as he had told himself from the beginning. He had protected Chiropterra and its people, even from threats within. He could look at his country, his soldiers, his citizens with pride.\n\nBut there was still more glory to achieve. Gorge Z. Batton as a general never believed in "holding" anything, and neither did President Batton. He was an impatient thestral, and he would wait for nopony. It was time to look out, and show the world what Chiropterrans were truly capable of once more."
bat.172.d_3:0 "From complete chaos to complete control, that was the long and short of it. Ocean Spray had transformed an uncompromisingly resistant nation into one of complete compliance to his authority. It brought a subtle smile to his face whenever he thought about it.\n\nFor the first time in his busy career as the singular Warmaster of Chiropterra, he was taking a break. Not a holiday of course, the state still needed him, but a day off in his villa was a welcome reprieve from internal matters. At this moment he was standing at his bedroom balcony, enjoying the sunset with nothing more than his own thoughts that kept him more than content. Sure he was tired and his hooves were just a little shaky from time to time, but who wouldn't be proud of what he had achieved?\n\nThe nation was prospering to the immense benefit of the state, everything was functioning like a well oiled machine; exactly by design. The crown jewel in the Nightmare's regalia was safe, her people were faithful and the regime was stable. Nothing less than glorious victory awaited them now!"

He was only relieved that this war was over and that the way was clear to rebuild this nation.\n\nHe was, however, proud of his soldiers and those citizens who were on his side from the beginning of this conflict. Their loyalty in the face of the harrowing odds that were mounted against them inspired him. He would repay their loyalty by building a nation that would be based on justice, duty and industriousness. Unlike the other radical factions...\n\nThe supremacists are too entrenched in their outdated views and would have turned Chiropterra into a police state in which paranoia would've reigned supreme. The communists would have caused anarchy in their drive to radically reform the nation into some vague "workers' utopia". The harmonists are too weak and naïve for this unpredictable and dangerous world. Only a government that can face the future's challenges head-on through strength and adaptation can guide Chiropterra.\n\nOnly with him as the leader will Chiropterra survive and prosper.\n\nHe got up from his chair, adjusted his cap and walked out of his office.\n\nHe had work to do."

"It's causing divisions, fear and stirring up resentment among our kin. Not to mention our foreign reputation. Religious freedom for all. Easy." Everyone had agreed.\n\nThen the questions had started. What do we do about the lands the faith owned? Should they be handed to the state? Should they keep them and be taxed instead? If so, how much? Who, when, what, how, on and on it went. Stirling took a deep breath. He was about to stop playing who should he kill first in his head and just go with what felt natural. He was a soldier not a theologian or lawyer and this wasn't a negotiation. It was a siege. \n\n"Ok. If we accept the faith's right to still own property and the right to have tenants then we can grant the faith the same rights to act as a business would." A murmur of agreement went round the table. "Excellent." Stirling smirked. "Make a note in the minutes that the Church shall pay business taxes." A wave of realisation went round the table as they saw what had just happened.

Bring together some military officers and give them say in the running of nation, voting rights and representation. No branch would ever be in want. If they needed supplies they could request them themselves without having to wait for the politicians to debate it out over months. "Attention!" The chamber roared as hundreds snapped to attention, hooves thundering as one, followed by a dead silence as Chiropterra's entire military structure looked at him. Swallowing his hatred for public speaking, he began.\n\n"I know what some of you are asking. Why can't we just run the whole place like the old days. That doesn't work, not anymore. If you want a strong nation, you need a prosperous one. Our civilians need to have say, have control. A pony will always fight harder to defend their home than their prison. We need to follow their lead. Sort ourselves out. No more competing for fuel reserves or bullets. I'll even return the supplies I borrowed from the 7th legion for my last op."

He had assumed that those he once considered friends in the LMRD would approve of his obviously necessary actions to remove a terrible stain from the history of their once great state.\n\nFor his miscalculations, he was alone. The nation was aflame, Emerald Light had apparently left for Skyfall without notifying him and the LMRD had distanced themselves from him. Even the rest of the CMS regarded him with a contempt that he had only before seen from the likes of Dusk Wane and the other 'reformists' that were slowly ruining the jewel in the Nightmare's crown.\n\nHe sat at his desk, snout pressing against tightly clasped-together hooves. Ocean Spray wasn't one for simply giving up; all he needed was a plan, one just as efficient as the last. He would kill every single traitor and reorganise the state so that even the smallest of print would serve only him.

We have also concluded that the future for us lies with the old homeland in Equestria, now therefore:\n\nWe ask humbly that we may join the All Ponies Front and Equestria in the fight against evil and such in the world. Together, we will be able to spread the ideals of Harmony beyond not just Equus, but also into Zebrica.\n\n - Dusk Wane"

There was a new poster on the wall of a complex, one he hadn't seen before. The text and imagery were simple but striking. On one side, a dark Ocean Spray and his Nightmareist disciples, and on the other a red Dusk Wane and his communist followers. Chiropterra was split in the middle, torn between both sides.\n\n"The two evils that plague us are one and the same," the poster read. "Socialism only brings collapse and death, and fundamentalism has destroyed our nation once before. Chiropterra's success as a nation is determined by materialistic and socio-economic factors, not the beliefs upon which we base ourselves on. The lies of the ankle biting pinko parasites on our country and religious lunatics wishing our downfall shall not prevail!"\n\nIt had all the trademarks of Gorge Z.

Sonar Beep asked as they looked over the different regional and national charts of Chiropterra, "what is the plan in redrawing the states? I understand the old system needs improvement, but why make the whole thing from scratch?"\n\n"Because it's all broken," Gorge responded.

Moreover, from now on, the nation shall become a republic, so that the government can finally represent the will of the people.\n\nChiropterra will also become a secular state, with every citizen free to believe in whatever they choose, and all religions being treated equally. As an effect of that, Nightmare Moon is no longer considered the spiritual head of the nation, for the first time in over one thousand years.\n\nAs Carrot Stick and other progressive legislators presented the draft of the constitution to the nation through the radio, they were met with wildly varying reactions: from outrage, through confusion, to hope and joy. Some think that the constitution is an affront to everything Chiropterra was built on, or that, while Chiropterra has to change, it's too much of a departure from its values and traditions, and the changes should occur at a more leisure pace.

The last thing we want is there to be anarchy across Chiropterra like after the previous regime fell."\n\nConversely, our interviewers received remarks in response from Admiral Pandeha, the successor Conservative leader after the late Ocean Spray.\n\n"The principles of our beliefs have guided Chiropterra ever since its founding," Admiral Pandeha said, "Installing an administration that is divergent from belief makes its policies and actions henceforth divergent from the principles of morality!"\n\nMembership in the Conservative party has begun to grow in response to this change, though its rise is notably matched by the level outspoken critics who argue for the adaptation of this measure.\nRegardless, Carrot Stick's changes have already been legally passed and implemented, meaning that one's religion is no longer a public mandate.

The thestral - they had to assume - was sitting perfectly outside of the light as they pushed over an open suitcase containing three stacks of money and three corresponding notes with coordinates for each individual present.\n\nOne by one the individuals took the money and inspected the note, before stuffing both into a bag. On the left of the agent there was a battle-hardened pegasus from New Mareland, in the centre an earth pony from the southeast of Equus and on the right a zebra from some small group of zealots that were hiding out in Nightmare-knows-where. All of them were ready to die for what they believed in and all of them were willing to take the deal, even if it meant having to work with some shady stallion - again, they assumed - and whoever their benefactor was.\n\nSoon enough they were well on their way to the stashes of weapons hidden at the locations specified on their notes. Soon they would have the Nightmare, soon they would all have the eternal night they had been promised."

bat.211.t:0 "A Letter From Zarantia"
bat.211.d:0 "Dearest Grandfather. I hope that you will be well during my absence. Yesterday, I crossed the border into the Zarantian deserts and arrived in the capitol of Shizra. It is barely a city, built out of mud bricks by a dried-out riverbed, and it survives through great underground basins where the natives gather up the river water during the brief periods when it flows. The entire system has intrigued me, and I will likely write more about it in future letters.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was greeted by the tribes' Aguellid, Umalez Ataghan. The exact meaning of the title is somewhat obtuse, but it is less of a royal title and more akin to field marshal, though one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise when being introduced to her. She is the daughter of Mekiouzza Ataghan, who led the struggle against our people, and she ascended to the throne only two weeks ago after her mother's passing.\n\nFrom what I can tell, she is not as belligerent as her mother, and hopefully she will prove open to cooperation in the long run. For the moment, her greeting was cold enough to freeze the Zebhara - which I struggle to blame her for. Despite her cool attitude, however, she still provided a lavish welcome with few if any expenses spared. As I was informed by our advisor on imazeeb culture, hospitality is a sacred virtue among them, and despite recent events, it would dishonor them to not show it.\n\nI cannot say what the future will bring, but I can already tell that my time in Zarantia will be a challenging one. Chiropterra is blessed with unity of purpose and vision, but Zarantia's people are as untamed as its dunes. I might not be able to easily understand it, but I can at least respect it.\n\nI will write you again when things have settled in and I have been able to get on with my duties. There will no doubt be much to write about.\n\n-Lucent Eclipse"
bat.211.a:0 "Good luck to you, Lucent!"

bat.212.t:0 "Another Letter From Zarantia"
bat.212.d:0 "Dearest Grandfather. My efforts in Zarantia continue, though I cannot say that they have been entirely successful. The Imazeeb tribes are indeed untamed, and it appears that a lot of them have chosen to view the governor as an annoyance more than anything else. The nomadic tribes especially have taken to simply outrunning the tax collectors, when they don't run circles around them or passing the buck to another tribe, claiming that they already paid and that the fact that they're not registered for it is evidence that imazeeb we employ are doctoring the records. One collector was given payment in livestock (a necessity as many of the tribes do not possess much in the way of money) only for the tax collector to have the animals seized by bandits and spread around a dozen tribes. When a task force was sent north they spent five days handling two tribes who furiously blamed each other for the act, up to and including armed clashes.\n\nI cannot say that Lady Ataghan has been much more helpful. I at times wonder if I am dealing with a child, for she seems more intent on needling me than to cooperate. She has especially taken perverse pleasure in asking inane questions about Chiropterra. I would welcome her desire to learn, but every time I answer her questions, she utilizes some insane troll logic to turn my answer around and cast aspersions on me. She has developed a particular fondness for ending up calling me a 'slave', citing my faith and loyalty as marks of shame instead of honor. I have not deigned to respond to her in this matter, whatever game she is playing, I will not play it.\n\n-Lucent Eclipse"
bat.212.a:0 "Those zebras are a singularly stubborn sort..."

bat.213.t:0 "A Third Letter From Zarantia"
bat.213.d:0 "Dearest Grandfather. I said in my last letter that I would not play Lady Ataghan's games, but I fear that I've done just that. You have no doubt read of recent events, but after her most recent needling, I had her seized and deposed. If she would not cooperate, I determined that all I could do was to install an Aguellid that would. I was, as proven by the recent unrest you may have read about, wrong, and was forced to drastic measures.\n\nI hesitated for the longest time to confess my actions, but I value your trust too highly to leave it out: I debased myself before Lady Ataghan, asking her for help and to stop this spiral before Legionnary Council ended her people's story for good. I told her I had too much to learn about her people's ways, and too much to understand, to let that happen. I am aware of how unbecoming my actions were, but I stand by them.\n\nShe told me that her mother's actions in the creation of the Zarantian state had been deeply unpopular, as many tribes valued their independence too much, and that it had taken decades of careful work and diplomacy to reach as far as she did. Zarantia was never a true state, but a dream held by one mare and all but shattered when she died. We are not dealing with one state and never have, but a hundred mini-states, each with its own agenda. Even Lady Ataghan is only in a position to ask, not order, and her perceived puppet-status undermines this even further. This is why she has called me a 'slave', as I so lightly presumed that her authority was absolute and the hierarchy fixed.\n\nI can imagine more than one officer who would swallow their tongue when reading this, but I've come to conclude that to rule Zarantia, we must understand Zarantia. Not merely to know how to most effectively break it, but also how to deal with a people who value their honor and independence above all other things. Lady Ataghan dared me to annihilate her people to teach me this lesson, and I am forced to learn it.\n\n-Lucent Eclipse"
bat.213.a:0 "Quite unorthodox methods. Let's hope they bear fruit."

bat.214.t:0 "A Fourth Letter From Zarantia"
bat.214.d:0 "Dearest Grandfather. The last few weeks have been a blur, much of it being things I have no idea how to cover in official dispatches. To make an absurdly long story short, Lady Ataghan agreed to call the tribes to a great assembly to hear their issues and attempt to broker some kind of peace. She warned me it would be a drawn out affair - the imazeeb like their meetings - but I did not expect it to be a one week such.\n\nI have yet to recall a moment where my self-control was pushed to the extent it was here. Some of these tribes hold ancient grudges going back centuries, and the intricacies of their enmities rival the most arcane theological debates. It has, at times, felt like trying to crawl up a muddy slope. Yet, for all the bickering, there has been some actual progress made.\n\nInternal demarcations have been drawn up to mute local conflicts, the watering holes and oases had been regulated to become accessible to all and the tax burdens have been shifted to military service, as many imazeeb prefer military service to paying taxes. I hope that the Legionnary Council will approve of this, and if nothing else, the internal lines of commerce will be safer as my security forces can be supplemented by imazeeb reconnaissance.\n\nI have also requested to be present during their celebration of the moon this coming week, and Lady Ataghan approved. Though the theology is radically different, they have celebrated the Nightmare in their own way since time immemorial. This is important, for the Imazeeb have a concept called 'Amsisi', a kind of presumed kinship between tribes, which cannot be challenged without good cause and which makes the person in front of you not an outsider, but rather another part of their greater whole. It certainly does not preclude hostilities, but it ensures that you are at least part of their game, and if you are part of the game, you can play and maybe win it. If Chiropterrans and Imazeeb find that they share goddess, maybe bonds will be established to make sure that these proud warrior Zebras can accept their place under the Nightmare? It is a longshot maybe, but it is one that is worth it.\n\n-Lucent Eclipse"
bat.214.a:0 "Most curious, but it seems to work."

bat.215.t:0 "The Fifth Letter From Zarantia"
bat.215.d:0 "Dearest Grandfather. The Imazeeb are a strange people, but every day I feel as though I understand them a little more. I cannot deny that I would not be here if not for my functioning relationship with Lady Ataghan, who has proven herself not only an invaluable advisor, but a well-read scholar and capable politician too. Had she been born in Chiropterran lands, I have no doubt that she could well have reached all the way to the Legionnary Council. I do not say this to cast aspersions on the council, whom I hold in the highest regard, but rather because she has truly impressed me. I shudder to think what her mother could have accomplished.\n\nAs we journeyed around the region during the last week, in order to mediate in local disputes, and during it she asked me what I imagined the purpose of the Chiropterran control of the region was, and whether the imazeeb were to be used up and spent to achieve Chiropterra's goals in the end. I told her that the Imazeeb would one day become not used up, but part of a greater whole, and that her cooperation ensured that Zarantia could live on. It may be the periphery, but they maintained a modicum of independence, and if their cards were played right, they could well leave an impression on Chiropterra to last for an eternity. It has already shaped our doctrines and our policies, and those lessons were learned in blood. The desert has been a harsh teacher to us like it was to the Imazeeb, and we are both moon believers. The connections are there, and if Tobuckians and Imazeeb could build Amsisi, could not Chiropterrans and Imazeeb?\n\nMaybe it is heretical of me to say that I do not find these notions to be mere words. For Chiropterra to prosper in victory, it needs to understand the lands it has conquered, and not hesitate to adapt. Zebrica is a continent of pride and strength, and its people needn't be our enemies, not if we are willing to listen.\n\n-Lucent Eclipse."

While we have known for a millennium that Nightmare Moon and Princess Luna were two sides of the same coin, many have secretly suspected that the same type of "alter ego" existed within Princess Celestia.\n\nOur suspicions were turned into reality today as telegrams confirmed that the once-pacifistic princess has transformed into a monstrous demon of fire and flames. She has promised a painful demise to all who oppose her, and she has already made good on that promise by literally burning several of her sister's followers to death shortly after proclaiming the formation of her new "Solar Empire."\n\nUnfortunately, this news was too big to censor. In the span of a few hours, it had already reached the furthest corners of Chiropterra. In the past our faith and resolve was always unshakable, though now our citizens are more terrified than we thought possible. [ROOT.GetLeader] has made several proclamations to try and calm the populace, but the damage was already done.\n\nOne thing is for certain: We must be ready. If this "Daybreaker" solidifies her control over Equus, then she will most certainly come for us next."

If it weren't for Stirling Silver and his popularity, he'd likely conduct some military reforms himself."

If it weren't for Stirling Silver and his popularity, he'd likely conduct some military reforms himself."

BAT_AUTUMN_BREEZE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 942 in New Ayacachtli\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Nightmare Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Baron Autumn Breeze III, one of the last scions of the venerable Clan Reed of Fillydelphia, whom a millennium ago were one of the first Equestrian noble families to recognize the righteousness of her Imperial Majesty Nightmare Moon's Rebellion, and although the first rebellion was a catastrophic failure, Clan Reed never betrayed their Empress and as such were the first of her Majesty's loyal subjects to set off for the savage lands of Zebrica, and it was they who laid the foundations for the creation of Chiropterra those countless centuries ago.\n\nSince those dark days Clan Reed and by extension the Nightmare Legion have been charged with leading, and they have lain in the shadows; slowly but surely laying the seeds of doubt that will one day lead to the return of the Empress and the destruction of Equestria.\n\nBut for now Autumn Breeze must attend to the matters of the present. He is a proud supporter of Chiropterra's noble traditions, and believes firmly that the way they have lived for a millennium will guide the nation on into the future. For when Nightmare Moon does return, it shall be the venerated Nobles of the Legions who shall spread her mandate, and none shall dare to stop them.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_EMERALD_LIGHT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of February, 965 in Firstport\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Silver Moon Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: There have been those who called Emerald Light a 'mad scientist', though she herself would refute the notion quite strongly, as would many others even though the reasoning might differ. Born - like so many others in Chiropterra - to two legionnaires, Emerald Light was something of an outcast in her martially oriented family. Her mind always sought deeper answers, and where her parents might want to teach her how to kill something, Emerald Light could only wonder how it lived, what made it tick, why, and how to change it.\n\nThis proclivity set her path not into the ranks of the Legions, but rather into the LMRD, where she quickly proved herself an excellent researcher. Her seniors remarked on her steel-trap mind, which seemed able to lock onto an issue and, to the exclusion of all other things, figure it out even if she had to simply brute force it. Additionally, her utter disinterest in office politics and goal-focused thinking made her reliable enough that - after a series of purges of the LMRD's ranks - she was a perfect candidate for heading the division when the old guard was dismissed.\n\nUnder Emerald Light, the LMRD flourished and turned its efforts to more and more radical experiments. They were after all the servants of Nightmare Moon, and half-hearted efforts had no place under her, and with the plethora of test subjects at their disposal, the sky was the limit, and any lingering shreds of ethics was the first thing discarded on this route. In time, her technocratic and apolitical disposition combined with her results made her a perfect fit for the role of commander of the Silver Moon Legion. Dividing her time between the LMRD and the Silver Moon Legion, her fascination with pushing the very limits of science - no matter what needed to be done - has remained. She does not consider herself mad though: madness leads to irrationality, and she holds rationality in highest regard. Neither do others: that would make her a victim of her own mind, an excuse few can stomach giving her after seeing what she is capable of do.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_ETERNAL_ECLIPSE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of July, 929 in Ursagrad\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Ursa Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Eternal Eclipse is somewhat of a legend in Chiropterra, though not the kind that foals are told stories about and play dress up as, but rather as the kind all know about and respect. For his entire 61 years of service, he has worked diligently and faithfully to carry out the will of Her Majesty, dutifully awaiting her return and working to further the cause of the Legions. After a 12 year stint starting in 986 as the Lord Commander of the Ursa Legion, he assumed his post as the chief of the Native Affairs Commission, running the program as any other he has led before, with calm efficiency, prioritizing pragmatic results over dogmatic orthodoxy. This reputation has earned him the unbridled respect of all the other Legionary commanders, who trust him to get things done when decisive action is needed. And because of his reputation of impartiality, he often smooths the ruffled fur between some of the other commanders.\n\nBut even legends must eventually come to an end, and so comes Eternal Eclipse's legacy, the one thing that many debate. With his age constantly in the back of his mind, Eternal has spent much of his time cementing his Legion's succession; becoming more and more preoccupied with his successor, his grandson Lucent Eclipse. While he is nearly as respected as his Grandfather, some worry about his more... reform-minded ideas. Lucent already runs the military affairs of the Legion due to his grandfather's advanced age and often ill health, setting him up as the unchallenged successor to the Legion his Grandfather has guided for years.\n\nWhatever the legacy of Eternal Eclipse's time at the head of the Ursa Legion may be, none can deny that he has done more than most to bring the dream of Her Majesty's return to fruition, and that he isn't the type of thestral to brag about it.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_LUNAR_HAIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of January, 969 in Moonspeaker Hollow\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Children of the Moon Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: The life of Lunar Hail started quite simply, born to a poorer thestral family in the Moonspeaker Hollow, they had no political power, no prestigious military position, and not much property to their name. What they did have was their daughter. They confided in her their deep faith in the Nightmare and admiration for the Children of the Moon Legion, who her family saw as the most devout protectors of their nation. Lunar was always a sheepish foal, upstanding and genuine, but often reserved. It seemed that Lunar Hail would continue this line, as a labourer for the entirety of her life, until one faithful night. When she was thirteen, her family found that she was not home one night, finding her asleep in a nearby forest grove, and when they brought her home, she began to speak of the things she had seen. She told her parents that she had seen a vision of Nightmare Moon's return, she didn't know when it would happen, but the vision was so glorious, that she knew what her cause in life must be, to help bring this event about, and so her journey into faith deepened.\n\nAs soon as she could, she began to study to become a moonspeaker, and then joined the Children of the Moon as a military chaplain. She became more charismatic, she spoke with a confidence she had never had before, and could easily work crowds into a frenzy, especially when speaking on religious matters. With this, she became a sought after preacher within her Legion. Often, officers far above her rank would request her to give sermons at meetings or dinners, which gave her entry into the halls of power. In the year 1000, the previous Chief Moonspeaker of the nation died of natural causes, and in his will, the Moonspeaker asked for his funeral sermon to be given by Lunar Hail. To many, this was as good as choosing a successor, and Lunar Hail became the nation's foremost preacher and prophet. Four years later, the Children of the Moon's Commander also died, and since Lunar Hail already held a high position in her Legion, it wasn't difficult to get the other officers and moonspeakers of the Legion to elect her their leader. And now, with a Legion in one hoof, and the nation's faith in the other, Lunar Hail sets forth to wage war to bring about the Nightmare's eternal Glory.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_LIGHTNING_CHARM_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of October, 950 in Firstport\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Firstborn Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Lightning Charm is one of the Legionary Commanders whose life story has most prepared her for her current position. Born to soldiers, raised a soldier, and still proud to be a soldier. Lightning Charm has crafted her Legion into the most disciplined and professional of Her Majesty's forces and prides herself on leading what she considers the most elite of the Legions, though she would hesitate to say that to any of the other commanders' faces. She thinks of the Children of the Moon and their leader Lunar Hail as too zealous for her own good, Emerald Light as scraping up scraps that cost too much for what the military gets out of them, and has even said Autumn Breeze may be a bit too stuck up. But even if the other Commanders have heard this, they don't bother commenting. They know Lightning Charm always has Her Majesty's goals in mind, and that her criticisms are efforts to improve all the legions as much as she can. Even if they sting a little.\n\nLightning Charm brings a rigorous style of leadership to the Warmaster's office. The nation is run even more like an army than before, and everything is expected to run at full capacity, and if it doesn't, it will be reprimanded harshly. But through all her personal qualms, like all the other Legionary commanders, she has only one goal in mind: the ever-increasing glory of her Majesty Nightmare Moon. All hail the Nightmare.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_STONE_PALISADE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 957 in Metztunalia\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Starborn Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: If, six years ago, you would have asked any soldier of the Starborn Legion who their next Commander would be, none would have said Stone Palisade. Sure, he held a relatively high post in the Starborn Legion, attending to its work in the nation's eastern territories, but that was all. He was one more Legionary in a land with over one hundred thousand of those. Then came the Yetis.\n\nThe first sign of the Storm King's approach came from an agent of The Nightmare's Hoof in Maregypt, a horde was coming, massive airships that flew through the sky, and magic of thunder and frost. It was then that Palisade decided he needed to act, moving without orders to secure resources he began constructing defensive redoubts along Chiropterra's border, securing it against yeti attack. In this, he set up anti-air defenses, defensive chokepoints, citadels, mines, as well as defenses along the southern coast to defend against an invasion over the water. So when the time came, and the armies of the mighty Storm King arrived upon the borders of Chiropterra, Stone Palisade's defiant defenses and his legion stood ready to turn them back. \n\nBut no attack came, as when the Storm King looked upon this "Nightmare Line" as Palisade had called it, he deemed the land too much trouble to attack and simply moved further north. After this, Palisade was called to New Ayacachtli for an unknown reason. He himself has told close confidants that he feared he would be reprimanded for acting without orders or even face some worse punishment, but he would be proven wrong. For when he arrived in the city, he was asked to meet with the Commander of his legion, and what he was told is unknown to this day. We know though, that when he left that room, he was designated as the Starborn Legion's next Commander, and from there, he has only risen.\n\nNow, as Lord Commander, he has an interesting relationship with the rest of the Council. He is not a charismatic creature, and prefers to speak in data points rather than flamboyant speeches. In general, they view him as one of Chiropterra's best defenders, but should be left out of the picture if anyone is ever needed to make an impassioned speech or an inspired prayer.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_AUBURN_LEAF_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of January, 981 in New Ayacachtli\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Nightmare Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Now head of Clan Reed, Baroness Auburn Leaf stands without equal among her peers upon an image she has cultivated for years as the charming aristocratic belle and adoring daughter of the esteemed Autumn Breeze. The stirling reputation of her father and her family's renowned legacy of devotion to the Nightmare has made her the clear successor to the Lord Commander.\n\nThe ponies closest to Auburn understand that her appearance can be deceiving. Cold, calculating, and more than willing to get her hooves dirty; it is no secret her dissatisfaction with the status quo. Vigorious debates between herself and Commander Lucent Eclipse on how to steer the direction of reforms coming to Chiropterra are often the stuff of legendary gossip.\n\nPast the rumors, deception, and appearance she paints around herself, Lady Leaf considers herself a patriot. There is not a treacherous bone in her body, nor any room for mercy to the Nightmare's enemies. In her eyes and in her wisdom, she understands that only the Nightmare is eternal and in order to create eternal loyalty to her Imperial Majesty; there needs to be change. No matter the cost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_LUCENT_ECLIPSE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of January, 980 in Ursagrad\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Ursa Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Lord Commander Lucent Eclipse, a day that some never wished would come but none dreaded it more than Lucent himself. With the passing of Eternal Eclipse, the young thestral has ascended to a deeply coveted position in Chiropterra and assumed full command of the Ursa Legion. The issues of the nation having weighed heavily on him with each step he has taken in recent years, but now without the guiding wisdom of his grandfather he faces these issues for the first time alone.\n\nThese days the Council meetings are temporarily dominated by clashes between impromptu cliques with Commanders Charm and Palisade supporting his liberal reforms and the conservatives seeking a return to the old ways under Commanders Hail, Emerald, and Lady Auburn Leaf. The two sides debating on whose ideals should guide the nation through its current crisis as Warmaster. Change is coming and he stands at the vanguard of it, though which way the Council will sway is not secured yet. Some consider his social and military reforms too extreme, while others view them as a necessary step in building a strong and stable Chiropterra for the Nightmare to return to.\n\nHis nights are still consumed with paperwork and discussions with Auburn Leaf, the pair at each others throats more and more, but Lucent does not deny how she drives him to work harder, to go further. In those quiet hours, Auburn has admitted the same to him. While their ideologies and the approach to their reforms cannot be more different, their push for change has forced Chiropterra to debate a serious question? What kind of nation will Chiropterra become for itself and what sort of rule it must become for the Nightmare.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

BAT_CARROT_STICK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of May, 965 in New Ayacachtli\n\n§YRank§!: Governor General of Chiropterra\n\n§YBiography§!: Of the many servants to honour the Lunarist cause, Carrot Stick is perhaps one of the slightly more oddball. Whilst paying obedience to the rules and strict hierarchy of the Nightmare and Her Legions, he has managed to keep his relatively unorthodox ideals to himself. Now in a position of responsibility and respect, the brave thestral is able to champion the cause of Harmonic ideals, as his incredibly affable nature allows him to effectively navigate the stormy waters between diplomat and national leader. Now Governor General of Chiropterra, the fledgling republic is weak and vulnerable, but Carrot is ready to stand the course and lead the country to a brighter, more outward thinking future.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_AUBURN_LEAF_AND_LUCENT_ECLIPSE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of January, 981 in New Ayacachtli & 28th of January, 980 in Ursagrad\n\n§YRank§!: Duumviri Of Chiropterra\n\n§YBiography§!:Auburn Leaf and Lucent Eclipse are perhaps the most unlikely duo to share leadership of all of Chiropterra, what with their opposing views and argumentative bickering. Yet despite differences in methodologies and ideas, both truly prioritize the prosperity of Chiropterra and have come to rely on each other as a source for a trusted and informed opinion.\n\nThrough their discourse of views, the Duumviri are able to reach a compromised balance of measures to achieve their overall goals for Chiropterra. How they managed to take away key points and considerations from each other through their belligerent stances is a mystery to many, but the Duumviri have accomplished this and more through this procedure, and Chiropterra shall become all the better.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_STIRLING_SILVER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of November, 972 in Firstport\n\n§YRank§!: Brigadier General\n\n§YBiography§!: A capable legionary officer by all accounts, Stirling Silver has had a considerably recent ascension into primacy. His rather unique proposals saw his rise in standing, along with the spreading of his unorthodox - but highly effective - ideas. Creating small strike groups of elite commandos, his forces have struck fear in the hearts of Chiropterra's enemies. Now he is in a position to steer the guidance of the country itself. Only time itself will tell if his unusual manner of thinking will come to be a gift to the country, or a burden. Trying times will be ahead for Stirling and his troops, but the keen stallion has a penchant for taking on any challenge.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_OCEAN_SPRAY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of April, 960 in Batsby\n\n§YBiography§!: Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion soldiers, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organise and structure their less savoury business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions; if only by taking most of the flak for their more egregious activities himself.\n\nOcean Spray was for the longest time merely Emerald Light's yesmare, a sycophant who made for an easy out whenever it came time to inspect the LMRD for 'misdemeanours'. Needless to say his crimes against nature and ponykind have made him reviled by almost everyone save for a few choice creatures. It's no surprise that without her oversight he has become significantly more bold and brazen with nopony to hold back his desire for power and change.\n\nHe is fastidious, meticulous and yet still much less intelligent than he thinks he is despite making every effort to construct elaborate plans for his own benefit. Now that he is in charge and firmly so, the chaos resulting from his poorly thought out schemes will have to be dealt with.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
BAT_DUSK_WANE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of June, 930 in Moonspeaker Hollow\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the oldest living thestrals in Chiropterra and certainly the oldest living Moonspeaker, Dusk Wane is the pinnacle of revolutionary idealism. Having remarkably served almost more time behind bars than outside of it, in his many years he has been a strong proponent of causes which run contrary to that of the Chiropterran state: from Labourer rights to advocating for Legion reform, and even - some amongst his cadre whisper - of heresy and worship of the Moon itself, rather than the Nightmare. However, with the abolition of the Legion system and the reformation of the country into a Republic, Dusk Wane now finds himself in the driving seat rather than agitating from the back wings. His bold ideals may be a stark contrast to that which many are used to, but his genuine desire to see the country serve the populace - rather than the populace serve the country, may be the critical factor in his new socialist era. Of course, keeping control of power is always a difficult thing, and consolidation and unification will surely be thoughts at the forefront of the canny old bat's mind.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

BAT_lucent_eclipse_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of January, 980 in Ursagrad\n\n§YRank§!: Brigadier General\n\n§YBiography§!: General Lucent Eclipse is no traitor nor as idealistic as his opponents might say. The young officer flew through the ranks of the Legions not because of his grandfather, Eternal Eclipse, but rather by his own drive and merit. Ponies unfamiliar with Lucent are quick to write him off as an extremist, a young stallion so caught up in his own ideals he cannot see the bigger picture...but they are wrong.\n\nGeneral Eclipse is no fool and while he may not have the stomach for politics, he has a mind for war. As his father has placed more and more responsibility in the leading of the Ursa Legion to him, Lucent has thrown himself into modernizing its doctrine and command. Either through experimental armor units or the radical ideas of allowing Auxiliaries greater responsibilities, his goal in creating the most lethal fighting force Chiropterra has ever seen has earned him the begrudging respect of his peers.\n\nLucent has heart in Chiropterra and that is a hard thing to have. His love for the Nightmare is so great that he knows he must correct her most devout followers from blind zealotry that would harm the Empress' grand vision. There needs to be reform in the nation, there needs to be change. He has often found a kindred spirit in Lady Auburn Leaf of Clan Reed, leading to many late night debates and harsh discussions in dimly lit parlors. While they might not agree on each issue, they certainly understand that the future is in their hooves.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

Though his unusual enthusiasm for aerial destruction and superiority in battle has easily portrayed him as a warmongering fanatic, LeHay's prerogative bases itself around conducting war in the most efficient and least risky way possible. The introduction of aircrafts had provided just the means for him to accomplish this, as demonstrated with the catalytic success of Operation Moonshine.\n\nRiding on his win, Leaf LeHay's responsibilities have doubled from merely taking care of the forces under his command to leading Chiropterra to its future above and beyond. Nonetheless a daunting task, LeHay simply views it as a broader continuation to better support Chiropterra's Legions, for a military can only be as great as its sustainment.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

We saw what happened in Stalliongrad and we must be ready. The heathen reds have spread their influence amongst the working populations of urban Warzena and Tobuck, turning loyal laborers into subversives and liars. Like any other snake we must smoke them out. Their leader is named Dihya, a smalltime intellectual from the Warzenan capital who fled after we identified her as a threat following our occupation.

Following our occupation, a report was filed by Lucent Eclipse regarding native resistance activity in areas under his control. He listed the Anzarawdie on this document and stated they were committed to a form of tribal democracy, but wrote them off as a minor group in his territory. When the day of resistance came, we found out why. The Anzarawdie had been focusing their operations in directly administered Zarantia, and the chaos was immense. They have little ideological bond, but can count of support from a wide number of Zarantian clans, destruction is the only answer. They are lead by Izem, a minor tribal warrior who rallied his clan into resistance, and began to gather allies along the way. He is their unifying figure, kill him and it all falls apart."

The "True Moon Society" as they call themselves are heretics and heathens, claiming to follow a pure and natural form of Lunar worship, denying the divinity of the Nightmare in favor of the moon itself. We have no idea how deep their ties go, precision is key in the absolute destruction of their organization. They are lead by "The Jackal."

 pony_race:0 "Pony Race"
 pony_race_desc:0 "Ponies are small, colourful and sapient equines. The term "pony" traditionally encompasses three subgroups which are the earth ponies, the pegasi and the unicorns. Earth ponies are characterized by their sturdier physique and affinity to agriculture. The pegasi are lighter than their cousins and have a pair of wings that allows them to fly, as well as a magical ability to manipulate weather. The unicorns have a distinctive horn on their forehead which allows them to practice all kinds of magic and use various spells. An extremely rare subgroup called the alicorns have features of all three: strong physique, wings and a magical horn. Finally, every pony has a cutie mark, a magical symbol upon their flanks that appears during the latter phase of their development. The cutie mark is a not well-understood phenomenon and illustrates a special talent or personality trait of the pony who bears it. It has therefore a significant cultural importance to many pony societies throughout the world. Ponies are almost exclusively herbivores."
 tech_earth_pony:0 "Earth Pony Agriculture"
 tech_earth_pony_desc:0 "Since the very first wandering pony tribes, earth ponies have been the most proficient in growing and cultivating agricultural areas. Modern machinery and crop cultures would drastically increase our food surplus."
 tech_earth_pony_a1:0 "Earth Pony Sappers"
 tech_earth_pony_a1_desc:0 "Owing to their latent connection to the soil, earth ponies are able to dig trenches and build fortifications much faster than other ponies."
 tech_earth_pony_a2:0 "Delicious Rations"
 tech_earth_pony_a2_desc:0 "Our soldiers have some of the most demanding jobs in our nation, and their meals must be more than adequate. Field conditions make transporting food and ingredients difficult, seriously limiting how far back supply hubs can be from the frontlines before running into food spoilage issues. Some of our earth pony chefs and cooks have conceived a new methodology (adding copious amounts of sugar) that not only acts as preservative, but also has the added bonus of being delicious!"
 tech_earth_pony_a3:0 "Earth Pony Alchemy"
 tech_earth_pony_a3_desc:0 "Earth ponies are able to grow all kinds of plants, many of which have potential medical applications."
 tech_earth_pony_a4:0 "Rustic Ingenuity"
 tech_earth_pony_a4_desc:0 "The notion that earth ponies lack flight and magic makes them inferior is not only idiotic but also naive. Putting aside their inherent strength and attuned connection with the earth, earth ponies have consistently driven technological innovation in pony society. Many tools and vehicles are born from earth pony ingenuity, and it would be remiss of us to ignore this fact. Let us encourage their affinity so that our society can enjoy their achievements."
 tech_earth_pony_b1:0 "Raise This Barn"
 tech_earth_pony_b1_desc:0 "Where pegasi have cloud structures and unicorns have magic to trivialise construction, earth ponies have had to make do with physical labour, each other, and a good sense of materials. There's no denying that earth ponies are incredibly apt at building strong, sturdy structures at such speeds that put even some unicorns and pegasi to shame. We don't need the comfort of pegasi cloud buildings or the aesthetically complex unicorn edifices, but the reliable, quickly-built blocks and structures of the earth ponies."
 tech_earth_pony_b2:0 "Earth Pony Mining"
 tech_earth_pony_b2_desc:0 "More earth ponies working in the mines means more resources extracted."
 tech_earth_pony_b3:0 "Magic of Industry"
 tech_earth_pony_b3_desc:0 "Though they lack wings and horns, earth ponies have magic of their own. Their industrial capabilities are unmatched."
 tech_earth_pony_b4:0 "Resourceful Workers"
 tech_earth_pony_b4_desc:0 "Long ago, before the time of the windigos, earth ponies were almost always relegated to poor working conditions and were given little to work with. The working conditions may have changed, but earth pony workers' know-how has never gone away. A particularly clever and imaginative earth pony supervisor can do with far less than a unicorn or pegasus, allowing for production to continue mostly unabated even in conditions that unicorns and pegasi would struggle with."

 pegasi:0 "Pegasi"
 pegasi_desc:0 "Although all pony species are capable fighters, pegasi have historically often been a military elite. Pegasopolis under Commander Hurricane and Nimbusia prove this credence well, and pegasi remain an important part of any pony nation's military, able to cover distances and quickly and perform flanking manoeuvres from the skies."

Shields, fireballs and healing capabilities were common and saved many lives, but not every force had a sufficient amount of unicorns. It is time to standardise and train professional unicorn support companies."

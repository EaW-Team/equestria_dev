MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernizing. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catapult Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."
MAZ_warlordism:0 "Rampaging Warlords"
MAZ_warlordism_desc:0 "The disintegration of the Imperial Army meant that there was nothing able to prevent the rise of bandits, ambitious local cliques and tribal warlords from rising up in the countryside. The rest of the Empire has already broken off, but the Imperial remnant around Ziani is still not peaceful - warlords terrorize the countryside, extorting tribute, fighting amongst themselves and threatening to seize the Capital."

### Events ###

# Characters glossary:
# Royal Court:
# Manza Mahud - aloof, cowardly emperor who expects everything to be handed to him (he came to power basically as a puppet of sofa and nobility), if he doesn't then he deems the situation hopeless. Doesn't interfere much, but also sees his slave soldiers as mere property even though they're busy saving his empire.
# Two possible mansamara-tigui (empire-master, basically vizier)
## One from the Zebritude
## One from the reform bureaucrats
# Both of them are suspicious of the army for their own reasons, though.

# Three War Hosts:
# [name] -  a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. Very bitter at the Empire, because it disturbed the way of life of his Mozzi folk. Once defeated, he asks Kelece why he serves a regime that enslaved him and likely killed his family. 
# [name] - a minor bandit in Buckure who grew powerful as his band of misfits were the only people providing some protection immediately after the Storm King's collapse. A bit aloof and with a thirst of gold, but having a big following got in his head so he starts acting like a savior. Once defeated, he tells Kelece that the gold in the mines they fought over was the evil which set them to this path - creatures always fight over gold, even though it's worthless.
# Mara (princess) [name] - the nephew of Manza Sini who was trained as a warrior princess, but lost the Mazwi civil war, was exiled, and could not defend her homeland while serving as a mercenary in Colthage. Once defeated, she tells Kelece that he's far more worthy of being an emperor than her cousin could ever be.
# Kelece duels each one after their faction is defeated, gonna add events for it
# tl;dr they all facilitate his c h a r a c t e r g r o w t h

# The Army:
# Kelece - 
# Need to add more people here tbh

mazwi.1.t:0 "The Crumbling Palace"
mazwi.1.d:0 "" # First event for Mazwi. The old palace of the Jukuna dynasty in Ziani (like the real life Mansa Musa's palace, their main one was in Timbucktu), which was once used for hostage nobles and is crumbling from getting blasted by the the Storm army, is currently occupied by squatter bandits, and the Manza stays in the mansions of one of the nobles. Brief discussion on whether they can take it back, no dice, they have no force.
mazwi.1.a:0 "If the Palace is lost, what can be said about the Empire?"

mazwi.2.t:0 "The Return of Kelece"
mazwi.2.d:0 "" # A group of sofa (slave soldiers) suddenly march into the occupied Palace and easily dispatch of the bandits, scattering them. Kelece is first introduced here, as their commander, who sends a message to the Manza to meet.
mazwi.2.a:0 "Though worried, the Manza agrees..."

mazwi.3.t:0 "Eternal Servitude"
mazwi.3.d:0 "" # Kelece kneels before the Manza in the crumbling Royal Palace, proclaiming his loyalty to Mazwi and telling his story of how he survived the Storm King. He has brought the Npan Yeelen Regiment to Ziani to help restore order in Mazwi.
mazwi.3.a:0 "Perhaps we finally have something to work with?"

mazwi.4.t:0 "March on Gwitziko"
mazwi.4.d:0 "" # Gwitziko used to be an imperial armory. Kick our a petty warlord squatting in the city to restore it to the Empire.
mazwi.4.a:0 "This isn't much... but Zondata won with less."

mazwi.5.t:0 "The Decree"
mazwi.5.d:0 "" # Mahud reads out the first imperial decree since the Empire's disintegration, claiming that all its former territory remains Mazwi and everyone else occupying it are enemies of the Empire. Palace reconstruction works are happening behind his back, giving a confusing aura to the event.
mazwi.5.a:0 "For now, it's just a piece of paper."

mazwihosts.1.t:0 "In Futa Zallon"
mazwihosts.1.d:0 "" # The bandits in the Palace worked for [name], a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. He's surprised that Ziani can actually put up a fight now, and is getting ready to invade the capital to overthrow his old employers.

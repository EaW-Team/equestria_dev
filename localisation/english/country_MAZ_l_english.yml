MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernizing. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catapult Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."

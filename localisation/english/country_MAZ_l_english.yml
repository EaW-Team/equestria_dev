MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernising. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines Of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catapult Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."
MAZ_warlordism:0 "Rampaging Warlords"
MAZ_warlordism_desc:0 "The disintegration of the Imperial Army meant that there was nothing able to prevent the rise of bandits, ambitious local cliques and tribal warlords from rising up in the countryside. The rest of the Empire has already broken off, but the Imperial remnant around Ziani is still not peaceful - warlords terrorize the countryside, extorting tribute, fighting amongst themselves and threatening to seize the Capital."

MAZ_out_the_hiding_holes_desc:0 "Mazwi has not known peace for almost two decades. First the accursed Storm King, then the uprisings, and now bandits and warlords trampling over what used to be a proud and law-abiding populace. Mazwi deserves better than this. It shall restore its dignity."

MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment:0 "Return Of The Npan Yeelen Regiment" # 'Bright Sword' in Bambara
MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment_desc:0 "Alas! We could not even dislodge squatters defiling the proud palace in Ziani. His Benevolence, Manza Mahud, was most displeased and threatened to inflict unspeakable punishments - until he was interrupted by a courier bringing news of an unexpected arrival."

MAZ_empire_continuation:0 "Decree On Imperial Continuation"
MAZ_empire_continuation_desc:0 "God favours us! The assistance of the Npan Yeelen Regiment has restored a semblence of law and order to once proud Mazwi, or at least simply Ziani and its surroundings. This is no cause for concern - as Canterlot wasn't built in a day, so will the restoration of Imperial Mazwi take time and effort."

Unacceptable for the great Manza Mahud! If the authority of the Jukuna dynasty is to be restored, it must be done one bloody step at a time. First, the vermin occupying Gwitziko must be scattered to the sands."

MAZ_deal_with_eastern_clans_desc:0 "Great Mazwi once spanned across the Great Lakes, blessed by God, and it had many loyal servants to bolster its forces. Now, power and prestige have greatly waned and so has the loyalty of our so-called obedient clans. A lesson in respect is needed to remind them on who holds sway over all that shines under the sun."

MAZ_city_patriots:0 "The Stubborn Ziani Patriots"
MAZ_city_patriots_desc:0 "Mazwi is not just a rump state that remains today, it is a legacy that spanned for centuries. It had its setbacks, but it always returned to splendour. Who can deny that this cycle won't occur again? This can be exploited well with our citizens, who still cling to the idea of old Mazwian glory."

MAZ_recruit_sofa:0 "Reclaim Our Living Property"
MAZ_recruit_sofa_desc:0 "The great famma Zondata knew what was needed to save Mazwi, for he swapped bickering tribal warriors for an obedient warrior caste of slaves called sofa. Trained in warfare since childhood, they belong to Mazwi and its Emperor, and we must reassert our authority by bringing back the scattered soldiers under our command, whether they wish so or not."

MAZ_restore_military_technology:0 "Restart Rifle Assemblies"
MAZ_restore_military_technology_desc:0 "Gwitziko was relatively undamaged from our assault, with its plentiful workshops still in working order, and more importantly, filled with schematics and materials needed to produce contemporary weaponry. A state cannot hold its monopoly on violence to preserve the order without force to back it up, which makes the resumption of production a priority."

### Events ###

# Characters glossary:
# Royal Court:
# Manza Mahud - aloof, cowardly emperor who expects everything to be handed to him (he came to power basically as a puppet of sofa and nobility), if he doesn't then he deems the situation hopeless. Doesn't interfere much, but also sees his slave soldiers as mere property even though they're busy saving his empire.
# Two possible mansamara-tigui (empire-master, basically vizier)
## Zanga Senghore - a history professor educated in New Mareland who believes a Celestia-style benevolent monarchy would be best for Mazwi (after all, Equestria hasn't had any war for a millennium!). Foolishly hopes to negotiate with the other GL states to have them recognize the Manza again
## Bagabaga Daba - a bureaucrat who hails from a small Mazwi clan. A fairly stereotypical Mazwi supremacist who regards everything as just tools to regain the Empire's strength.
# Both of them are suspicious of the army for their own reasons, though.

# Three War Hosts:
# [name] -  a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. Very bitter at the Empire, because it disturbed the way of life of his Mozzi folk. Once defeated, he asks Kelece why he serves a regime that enslaved him and likely killed his family. 
# [name] - a minor bandit in Buckure who grew powerful as his band of misfits were the only people providing some protection immediately after the Storm King's collapse. A bit aloof and with a thirst of gold, but having a big following got in his head so he starts acting like a savior. Once defeated, he tells Kelece that the gold in the mines they fought over was the evil which set them to this path - creatures always fight over gold, even though it's worthless.
# Mara (princess) [name] - the nephew of Manza Sini who was trained as a warrior princess, but lost the Mazwi civil war, was exiled, and could not defend her homeland while serving as a mercenary in Colthage. Once defeated, she tells Kelece that he's far more worthy of being an emperor than her cousin could ever be.
# Kelece duels each one after their faction is defeated, gonna add events for it
# tl;dr they all facilitate his c h a r a c t e r g r o w t h

# The Army:
# Kelece - 
# Need to add more people here tbh

mazwi.1.t:0 "The Crumbling Palace"
mazwi.1.d:0 "" # First event for Mazwi. The old palace of the Jukuna dynasty in Ziani (like the real life Mansa Musa's palace, their main one was in Timbucktu), which was once used for hostage nobles and is crumbling from getting blasted by the the Storm army, is currently occupied by squatter bandits, and the Manza stays in the mansions of one of the nobles. Brief discussion on whether they can take it back, no dice, they have no force.
mazwi.1.a:0 "If the Palace is lost, what can be said about the Empire?"

mazwi.2.t:0 "The Return of Kelece"
mazwi.2.d:0 "" # A group of sofa (slave soldiers) suddenly march into the occupied Palace and easily dispatch of the bandits, scattering them. Kelece is first introduced here, as their commander, who sends a message to the Manza to meet.
mazwi.2.a:0 "Though worried, the Manza agrees..."

mazwi.3.t:0 "Eternal Servitude"
mazwi.3.d:0 "" # Kelece kneels before the Manza in the crumbling Royal Palace, proclaiming his loyalty to Mazwi and telling his story of how he survived the Storm King. He has brought the Npan Yeelen Regiment to Ziani to help restore order in Mazwi.
mazwi.3.a:0 "Perhaps we finally have something to work with?"

mazwi.4.t:0 "March on Gwitziko"
mazwi.4.d:0 "" # Gwitziko used to be an imperial armory. Kick our a petty warlord squatting in the city to restore it to the Empire.
mazwi.4.a:0 "This isn't much... but Zondata won with less."

mazwi.5.t:0 "The Decree"
mazwi.5.d:0 "" # Mahud reads out the first imperial decree since the Empire's disintegration, claiming that all its former territory remains Mazwi and everyone else occupying it are enemies of the Empire. Palace reconstruction works are happening behind his back, giving a confusing aura to the event.
mazwi.5.a:0 "For now, it's just a piece of paper."

mazwi.6.t:0 "The Mansamara-Tigui"
mazwi.6.d:0 "" # The two options are Zanga Senghore and Bagabaga Daba, see the glossary for info
mazwi.6.a:0 "Senghore and the Zebritude will help establish peace."
mazwi.6.b:0 "Bagabaga Daba, the Farba, will renew the Empire." # Farba - 'governor', 'administrator', in this case meant as a honorific.

mazwi.7.t:0 "The Zebra and the Horses"
mazwi.7.d:0 "" # Would be good to add some lore on Re'emite history in Mazwi (see what Cyrus wrote on it). Imperial nobles and bureaucrats are negotiating with representatives of the Re'emite enclave in Buckure. In exchange for continued autonomy, they offer aid in the reconstruction.
mazwi.7.a:0 "The whole nation must modernise, and fast."
mazwi.7.b:0 "Some of their insight into industrial efficiency will suffice."

mazwihosts.1.t:0 "In Futa Zallon"
mazwihosts.1.d:0 "" # The bandits in the Palace worked for [name], a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. He's surprised that Ziani can actually put up a fight now, and is getting ready to invade the capital to overthrow his old employers.

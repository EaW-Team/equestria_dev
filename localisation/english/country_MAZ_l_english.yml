He has managed to keep the mining operations going even after the Storm King's invasion and remained loyal to the Imperial bureaucracy.

MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernising. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines Of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catapult Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."
MAZ_warlordism:0 "Rampaging Warlords"
MAZ_warlordism_desc:0 "The disintegration of the Imperial Army meant that there was nothing able to prevent the rise of bandits, ambitious local cliques and tribal warlords from rising up in the countryside. The rest of the Empire has already broken off, but the Imperial remnant around Ziani is still not peaceful - warlords terrorize the countryside, extorting tribute, fighting amongst themselves and threatening to seize the Capital."

MAZ_out_the_hiding_holes_desc:0 "Mazwi has not known peace for almost two decades. First the accursed Storm King, then the uprisings, and now bandits and warlords trampling over what used to be a proud and law-abiding populace. Mazwi deserves better than this. It shall restore its dignity."

MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment:0 "Return Of The Npan Yeelen Regiment" # 'Bright Sword' in Bambara
MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment_desc:0 "Alas! We could not even dislodge squatters defiling the proud palace in Ziani. His Benevolence, Manza Mahud, was most displeased and threatened to inflict unspeakable punishments - until he was interrupted by a courier bringing news of an unexpected arrival."

MAZ_empire_continuation:0 "Decree On Imperial Continuation"
MAZ_empire_continuation_desc:0 "God favours us! The assistance of the Npan Yeelen Regiment has restored a semblence of law and order to once proud Mazwi, or at least simply Ziani and its surroundings. This is no cause for concern - as Canterlot wasn't built in a day, so too will the restoration of Imperial Mazwi take time and effort."

MAZ_new_vizier:0 "Appoint The Next Mansamara-Tigui"
MAZ_new_vizier_desc:0 "Every manza has its mansamara-tigui, their primary political advisor and executor of their will. There should have been one officially appointed years ago, but the chaos threw ancient traditions into disarray. There are two worthy candidates competing for the Manza's favour."

MAZ_reemite_negotiations:0 "Negotiate With The Re'emites Of Buckure"
MAZ_reemite_negotiations_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are not just home to Mazwians, but to an eclectic cast of other clans and tribes as well. From all these, the Re'emites stand out with their industrious nature, penchant for making progress, and wandering habits. Those who have remained in Buckure require the Manza's attention."

MAZ_restore_gbara:0 "Restore The Gbara"

MAZ_merchant_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With The Merchant Class"
MAZ_merchant_cooperation_desc:0 "Although looked down upon by many nobles, it is the merchants who provide some of the highest tax revenues for the state. By addressing some of their concerns, while preventing them from gaining any real power, it would be ideal to establish a more harmonious bond between us."

MAZ_zebra_consciousness:0 "Develop Zebra Consciousness"
MAZ_zebra_consciousness_desc:0 "" # Zebritude are centralizers, they believe that a unified Great Lakes without cultural barriers will allow an enlightened monarchy (much like they believe Equestria is all-Pony, not internally divided, which isn't really true but shhh). So they want to develop "zebra consciousness" in which Great Lakes zebra realize that they are all more alike with each other than others, that they are zebra, and that they should stick together

MAZ_purge_unnecessary_wastrels:0 "Purge The Unnecessary Wastrels"
MAZ_purge_unnecessary_wastrels_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is tempered by its inefficiency. Every good idea on streamlining begets ten bad ones, and this is precisely the reason Bagabaga Daba wishes to cull on the zebras who are being worse than useless. Great Mazwi can only be restored if every aspect of it is in accord."

MAZ_mandatory_labor_quota:0 "Mandatory Labour Quotas"
MAZ_mandatory_labor_quota_desc:0 "A state looks after its citizens, and in return they provide the state some form of compensation, whether it is in taxes or service.

MAZ_enslave_bandits:0 "Enslave Bandits"
MAZ_enslave_bandits_desc:0 "Normally, thievery would be punished by cutting off a limb, or even execution, but we cannot afford to throw away perfectly good labour when we are lacking in everything.

MAZ_salt_and_copper_mines_desc:0 "Resources are always in need, and unfortunately we cannot solve everything by simply digging more gold. There are other things that can be dug up from beneath the ground, and our prospectors have recently uncovered some forgotten veins of copper and salt, ready to be exploited for the good of Mazwi."

MAZ_crown_slaves:0 "Rebuild The Crown Slave Holdings"
MAZ_crown_slaves_desc:0 "Many look down upon slavery as cruel and backwards, but it is a simple necessity in harsh lands like ours. Before the Storm, Mazwi had some of the largest holdings dedicated solely to processing and corraling slaves, with relatively decent treatment for the zebras. Mazwi needs again its indentured workforce."

MAZ_reclaim_gwitziko_armory:0 "Reclaim The Gwitziko Armoury"
MAZ_reclaim_gwitziko_armory_desc:0 "The only laws outside of Ziani are the rules of nature, with the rights belonging to those who have the greatest might under their banner. Unacceptable for the great Manza Mahud! If the authority of the Jukuna dynasty is to be restored, it must be done one bloody step at a time.

Now, power and prestige have greatly waned and so has the loyalty of our so-called obedient clans. A lesson in respect is needed to remind them on who holds sway over all that shines under the sun."

MAZ_city_patriots:0 "The Stubborn Ziani Patriots"
MAZ_city_patriots_desc:0 "Mazwi is not just a rump state that remains today, it is a legacy that spanned for centuries. It had its setbacks, but it always returned to splendour. Who can deny that this cycle won't occur again? This can be exploited well with our citizens, who still cling to the idea of old Mazwian glory."

MAZ_recruit_sofa:0 "Reclaim Our Living Property"
MAZ_recruit_sofa_desc:0 "The great famma Zondata knew what was needed to save Mazwi, for he swapped bickering tribal warriors for an obedient warrior caste of slaves called sofa. Trained in warfare since childhood, they belong to Mazwi and its Emperor, and we must reassert our authority by bringing back the scattered soldiers under our command, whether they wish so or not."

MAZ_restore_military_technology:0 "Restart Rifle Assemblies"
MAZ_restore_military_technology_desc:0 "Gwitziko was relatively undamaged from our assault, with its plentiful workshops still in working order, and more importantly, filled with schematics and materials needed to produce contemporary weaponry.

### Events ###

# Characters glossary:
# Royal Court:
# Manza Mahud - aloof, cowardly emperor who expects everything to be handed to him (he came to power basically as a puppet of sofa and nobility), if he doesn't then he deems the situation hopeless. Doesn't interfere much, but also sees his slave soldiers as mere property even though they're busy saving his empire.
# Two possible mansamara-tigui (empire-master, basically vizier)
## Zanga Senghore - a history professor educated in New Mareland who believes a Celestia-style benevolent monarchy would be best for Mazwi (after all, Equestria hasn't had any war for a millennium!). Foolishly hopes to negotiate with the other GL states to have them recognize the Manza again
## Bagabaga Daba - a bureaucrat who hails from a small Mazwi clan. A fairly stereotypical Mazwi supremacist who regards everything as just tools to regain the Empire's strength.
# Both of them are suspicious of the army for their own reasons, though.

# Three War Hosts:
# Braahima Zeydu -  a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. Very bitter at the Empire, because it disturbed the way of life of his Mozzi folk. Once defeated, he asks Kelece why he serves a regime that enslaved him and likely killed his family. 
# Zenguella - a minor bandit in Buckure who grew powerful as his band of misfits were the only people providing some protection immediately after the Storm King's collapse. A bit aloof and with a thirst of gold, but having a big following got in his head so he starts acting like a savior. Once defeated, he tells Kelece that the gold in the mines they fought over was the evil which set them to this path - creatures always fight over gold, even though it's worthless.
# Mara (princess) [name] - the nephew of Manza Sini who was trained as a warrior princess, but lost the Mazwi civil war, was exiled, and could not defend her homeland while serving as a mercenary in Colthage. Once defeated, she tells Kelece that he's far more worthy of being an emperor than her cousin could ever be.
# Kelece duels each one after their faction is defeated, gonna add events for it
# tl;dr they all facilitate his c h a r a c t e r g r o w t h

# The Army:
# Kelece - 
# Negebennan - strategist of the army, pursues defensive doctrine. From Mozzi, unlike Kelece he is truly loyal to the Empire.
# Dannaya - second in command of the Kelece regiment, pursues offensive doctrine. From Timbucktu. She is loyal to Kelece personally.
# Sama Kaabu - one of the first prewar Farima who rejoins the army. Originally gained his position due to his clan's friendship with the Sukuna dynasty, mainly holds onto the command post for political leverage.
# Need to add more people here tbh

# On names: free Mazwi have various Malinke and Bambara names, sometimes with Z, and surnames (clan/tribe/dynasty names). Slaves just have one name which is a proper noun from Bambara (Kelece is "sword", for example)

mazwi.1.t:0 "The Crumbling Palace"
mazwi.1.d:0 ""But I am the Emperor! The inheritor of Mazwi's legacy, God blessed leader of the Jukuna dynasty! I demand these filthy vultures leave the palace of my ancestors at once! Bandits have no right to anything of mine!" Manza Mahud, the very brave and authoritarian ruler aimlessly trotted in a circle, against the backdrop of exasperated nobles and embarrassed viziers. The Imperial Palace of Ziani, once the crowning jewel of the Empire, was now a crumbling carcass occupied by a posse of bandits - who weren't thinking of leaving.\n\n"Perhaps we could negotiate with them, Your Brilliance? Give them a bribe so they'll leave?" The ever optimistic Zanga Senghore intoned with a hopeful look, before getting interrupted by the zebra standing next to him.\n\n"You do not negotiate with scum, Zanga, you show them their place, and their place is in a shallow ditch, pushed by a bayonet. Regardless, we do not have the resources or forces to evict them... unfortunately." Bagabaga Daba swished his mane in annoyance.\n\nThe weight of the humiliation proved to be too much for the begging Emperor. "Woe is me! Woe is the great Mazwi! How could have we stooped so low!" Thus, he would pitifully crumple onto a nearby pillow, quickly attended by a sycophantic noble who allowed him to inhabit the mansion in the first place." 
mazwi.1.a:0 "If the Palace is lost, what can be said about the Empire?"

mazwi.2.t:0 "The Return Of Kelece"
mazwi.2.d:0 "Weeks would pass, with scant development, only furthering the sense of despondency growing within the spirited and cheerful Manza Mahud. With his advisors and nobles offering little solace, the esteemed Manza would spend most of his days sprawled over a divan, sating his depression with copious amount of sweets, ice cream in particular.\n\nFortunes would change on this God blessed day, however, as an uniformed zebra burst into Mahud's makeshift court. "Make way! Make way! I bring a message for the Emperor of Mazwi!" Her steely gaze focused on one of the dignified, brightly dressed courtiers, and not on the pathetic stallion draped across the floor.\n\n"N-no, no, wait! I am he! Manza Mahud, ruler of the Great Lakes! What news do you bring for me, servant?" The lofty ruler seemed very stately with his unbalanced stature and unruly mane. If the mare was in any way surprised, she did not show it, as she showed reverence by kneeling.\n\n"Honoured Manza, I am Dannaya, of the Npan Yeelen regiment. We've returned yesterday to Ziani, after a long period of wandering, and our leader, Kelece, wishes to meet with his ruler. He waits for you at the palace, we've cleared it of the vermin occupying it." Soft murmurs were exchanged as the nobles discussed the sudden presence of a sofa regiment, eyes shifting towards Mahud."

mazwi.8.a:0 "Concerning..."

mazwi.9.t:0 "The Empire and its Soldiers"
mazwi.9.d:0 "" # Daba, as Mansamara-Tigui, expresses his concerns to the Manza about their armies - he isn't happy with the current crop of sofa, sees them as too emotional and proactive.

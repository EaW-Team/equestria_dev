MAZ_kelece_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: §LAround 982 in Zatsina, Imperial Mazwi§!\n\n§YBiography§!: §LThe Empire of Mazwi grew powerful on the backs of its sofas, and Kelece was no different from any other. Separated from his parents at young age, it seemed his life would be uneventful as yet another slave soldier serving a fat noble. That is, until the Fall, and the Strife, and the Storm occurred.\n\nWhereas most sofas took the chance to escape to freedom, Kelece did the exact opposite: he rallied many soldiers still loyal to the idea of Mazwi, and spent years in the countryside battling both yetis and bandits as a guerilla leader. His tactics would be best described as uninspiring, but effective, and he always made a point of saving as many wounded zebras as he could. His dedication would be showcased as he and his regiment made their way back to Ziani, placing themselves in the Manza's service once more.\n\nThus his subordinates respect Kelece's leadership, but few if any can say they have any sort of close relationship with him. Stoic and devoted, Kelece does not show much of his feelings, although it has been observed he has a tendency to collect trophies and trinkets from defeated foes. Upon asked why does he do that, the response was characteristically simple: "a lesson learned from each".§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Raminy"

MAZ_advisor_1_desc:0 "The son of a local chieftain and an administrator near Futa Zallon, Zizzoko Dabo entered the bureaucracy of the Mazwi Empire right before the beginning of its succession war, and retreated to the countryside when the Storm King arrived, fighting in the resistance to Yeti rule. Commonly seen by the people and the military as the "soft" counterpart to Bagabaga Daba in the Mazwi administration, Dabo is dutiful and interferes little in politics - however, he holds sympathies to the Zebritude."
MAZ_advisor_2:0 "Legranx"
MAZ_advisor_2_desc:0 "A rare Changeling in Zebrica, Legranx was hatched in Greneclyf and managed to connive himself into service in the bureaucracy of the Mazwi Empire in its last years before the beginning of its civil wars - earning a name as a skilled, capable manager of the Gold Mines of Buckure. He has managed to keep the mining operations going even after the Storm King's invasion and remained loyal to the Imperial bureaucracy. Though he seldom mentions it, the thousands of slave workers in Buckure are also a lovely feeding ground for him."

### ideas ###

MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernising. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines Of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catapult Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."
MAZ_warlordism:0 "Rampaging Warlords"
MAZ_warlordism_desc:0 "The disintegration of the Imperial Army meant that there was nothing able to prevent the rise of bandits, ambitious local cliques and tribal warlords from rising up in the countryside. The rest of the Empire has already broken off, but the Imperial remnant around Ziani is still not peaceful - warlords terrorize the countryside, extorting tribute, fighting amongst themselves and threatening to seize the Capital."

MAZ_out_the_hiding_holes:0 "Out Of The Hiding Holes"
MAZ_out_the_hiding_holes_desc:0 "Mazwi has not known peace for almost two decades. First the accursed Storm King, then the uprisings, and now bandits and warlords trampling over what used to be a proud and law-abiding populace. Mazwi deserves better than this. It shall restore its dignity."

MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment:0 "Return Of The Npan Yeelen Regiment" # 'Bright Sword' in Bambara
MAZ_return_of_the_kelece_regiment_desc:0 "Alas! We could not even dislodge squatters defiling the proud palace in Ziani. His Benevolence, Manza Mahud, was most displeased and threatened to inflict unspeakable punishments - until he was interrupted by a courier bringing news of an unexpected arrival."

MAZ_empire_continuation:0 "Decree On Imperial Continuation"
MAZ_empire_continuation_desc:0 "God favours us! The assistance of the Bright Sword Regiment has restored a semblence of law and order to once proud Mazwi, or at least simply Ziani and its surroundings. This is no cause for concern - as Canterlot wasn't built in a day, so too will the restoration of Imperial Mazwi take time and effort."

MAZ_new_vizier:0 "Appoint The Next Mansamara-Tigui"
MAZ_new_vizier_desc:0 "Every manza has its mansamara-tigui, their primary political advisor and executor of their will. There should have been one officially appointed years ago, but the chaos threw ancient traditions into disarray. There are two worthy candidates competing for the Manza's favour."

MAZ_reemite_negotiations:0 "Negotiate With The Re'emites Of Buckure"
MAZ_reemite_negotiations_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are not just home to Mazwians, but to an eclectic cast of other clans and tribes as well. From all these, the Re'emites stand out with their industrious nature, penchant for making progress, and wandering habits. Those who have remained in Buckure require the Manza's attention."

MAZ_restore_gbara:0 "Restore The Gbara"
MAZ_restore_gbara_desc:0 "With order slowly creeping back into everyday life, it seems natural to bring back the Gbara, an assembly of 32 members that checked the power of the manza. They represent the clans which helped establish Mazwi in the eldest days, and good advice is sorely needed in these trying times."

MAZ_merchant_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With The Merchant Class"
MAZ_merchant_cooperation_desc:0 "Although looked down upon by many nobles, it is the merchants who provide some of the highest tax revenues for the state. By addressing some of their concerns, while preventing them from gaining any real power, it would be ideal to establish a more harmonious bond between us."

MAZ_zebra_consciousness:0 "Develop Zebra Consciousness"
MAZ_zebra_consciousness_desc:0 "Imperial Mazwi used to stretch across the entirety of the Great Lakes, but its inhabitants were never particularly united. Tribalism and clan loyalty remained a staple of social norms, preventing the state from centralising its rule. Let us try convincing the zebras that they're better off with a single cultural identity."

MAZ_purge_unnecessary_wastrels:0 "Purge The Unnecessary Wastrels"
MAZ_purge_unnecessary_wastrels_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is tempered by its inefficiency. Every good idea on streamlining begets ten bad ones, and this is precisely the reason Bagabaga Daba wishes to cull on the zebras who are being worse than useless. Great Mazwi can only be restored if every aspect of it is in accord."

MAZ_mandatory_labor_quota:0 "Mandatory Labour Quotas"
MAZ_mandatory_labor_quota_desc:0 "A state looks after its citizens, and in return they provide the state some form of compensation, whether it is in taxes or service. It is the latter we must expand upon, as the decrepit state of Mazwi demands many hooves to rebuild it. They shall be paid in food, water and praise."

MAZ_enslave_bandits:0 "Enslave Bandits"
MAZ_enslave_bandits_desc:0 "Normally, thievery would be punished by cutting off a limb, or even execution, but we cannot afford to throw away perfectly good labour when we are lacking in everything. Let those who have stolen from the Manza either redeem themselves through virtuous work, or perish for their betters."

MAZ_reestablish_urban_schooling:0 "Reestablish Urban Schooling"
MAZ_reestablish_urban_schooling_desc:0 "Many would paint zebras as backwards savages, but it is simply untrue. Mazwi benefitted greatly from Timbucktu's vast fonts of knowledge, but now we must do without those. First, reestablish mandatory schooling for all foals, and then we can move on to more advanced forms."

MAZ_request_divination:0 "Request Divination"
MAZ_request_divination_desc:0 "God is all-knowing, but He does not share His knowledge with us directly. Our benevolent Manza wishes to gain some of this knowledge, and to that extent he has sought divination from the shamans, in hopes of unveiling his future and the fate of us all."

MAZ_province_masters:0 "Reinstate Province-Masters"
MAZ_province_masters_desc:0 "Although Mazwi has substantially regressed in the land it controls, the plains are still vast and the Manza can hardly efficiently rule over everything from Ziani. Thus it has become necessary to appoint new dyamani-tigui, trusted zebras to rule over the provinces in Mahud's name."

MAZ_restore_manufacturing:0 "Restore Antediluvian Manufactories"
MAZ_restore_manufacturing_desc:0 "Many tears have been shed in the wake of the Storm — that left so many destitute and homeless. It is beyond our means for the moment to look after every zebra's plight, but rebuilding the places of production and commerce would lead us into that direction, for the betterment of us all."

MAZ_battle_poverty:0 "Manza And Nobles, Protectors Of The Poor"
MAZ_battle_poverty_desc:0 "Much like how God watches over all His children, so too do the rulers look after their subjects. Benefitting from recent restoration of the state's apparatus, the great Manza wishes to share his fortune with the destitute, so that they know whom to look after for protection and guidance."

MAZ_great_imperial_railway:0 "Extend The Great Golden Railway"
MAZ_great_imperial_railway_desc:0 "The plains of Mazwi seemingly go on forever, and a zebra might be able to cross a decent pace on a regular day. However, this is terribly inefficient for any sort of mass transport, and to that extent there should be an expansion of existing railroads."

MAZ_salt_and_copper_mines:0 "Salt And Copper Mines"
MAZ_salt_and_copper_mines_desc:0 "Resources are always in need, and unfortunately we cannot solve everything by simply digging more gold. There are other things that can be dug up from beneath the ground, and our prospectors have recently uncovered some forgotten veins of copper and salt, ready to be exploited for the good of Mazwi."

MAZ_crown_slaves:0 "Rebuild The Crown Slave Holdings"
MAZ_crown_slaves_desc:0 "Many look down upon slavery as cruel and backwards, but it is a simple necessity in harsh lands like ours. Before the Storm, Mazwi had some of the largest holdings dedicated solely to processing and corraling slaves, with relatively decent treatment for the zebras. Mazwi needs again its indentured workforce."

MAZ_reclaim_gwitziko_armory:0 "Reclaim The Gwitziko Armoury"
MAZ_reclaim_gwitziko_armory_desc:0 "The only laws outside of Ziani are the rules of nature, with the rights belonging to those who have the greatest might under their banner. Unacceptable for the great Manza Mahud! If the authority of the Jukuna dynasty is to be restored, it must be done one bloody step at a time. First, the vermin occupying Gwitziko must be scattered to the plains."

MAZ_imperial_recruitment_campaigns:0 "Imperial Recruitment Campaigns"
MAZ_imperial_recruitment_campaigns_desc:0 "Have the Great Lakes known any nation more grander than Mazwi and its manzas? This patriotic spirit still lingers within many zebras, and many could be easily convinced to help rebuild our army now that Mazwi is on the rise again. However, some will have to be forced at gunpoint to serve..."

MAZ_deal_with_eastern_clans:0 "Deal With The Eastern Clans"
MAZ_deal_with_eastern_clans_desc:0 "Great Mazwi once spanned across the Great Lakes, blessed by God, and it had many loyal servants to bolster its forces. Now, power and prestige have greatly waned and so has the loyalty of our so-called obedient clans. A lesson in respect is needed to remind them on who holds sway over all that shines under the sun."

MAZ_city_patriots:0 "The Stubborn Ziani Patriots"
MAZ_city_patriots_desc:0 "Mazwi is not just a rump state that remains today, it is a legacy that spanned for centuries. It had its setbacks, but it always returned to splendour. Who can deny that this cycle won't occur again? This can be exploited well with our citizens, who still cling to the idea of old Mazwian glory."

MAZ_recruit_sofa:0 "Reclaim Our Living Property"
MAZ_recruit_sofa_desc:0 "The great famma Zondata knew what was needed to save Mazwi, for he swapped bickering tribal warriors for an obedient warrior caste of slaves called sofa. Trained in warfare since childhood, they belong to Mazwi and its Emperor, and we must reassert our authority by bringing back the scattered soldiers under our command, whether they wish so or not."

MAZ_restore_military_technology:0 "Restart Rifle Assemblies"
MAZ_restore_military_technology_desc:0 "Gwitziko was relatively undamaged from our assault, with its plentiful workshops still in working order, and more importantly, filled with schematics and materials needed to produce contemporary weaponry. A state cannot hold its monopoly on violence to preserve the order without force to back it up, which makes the resumption of production a priority."

MAZ_rebuild_command_structure:0 "Rebuild Command Structure"
MAZ_rebuild_command_structure_desc:0 "The return of the sofas has helped greatly in allowing Mazwi to control its lands again, but it is still a far cry from the army that was being built up before the Storm came. The first step in recreating this process will be making a firm chain of command, alongside appointing zebras to these positions who'll soon have their hooves full of work."

MAZ_temporary_slave_generals:0 "Temporary Slave Farimas"
MAZ_temporary_slave_generals_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Mazwi is not particularly rife with skilled army commanders, as many have been killed, exiled or simply went renegade for one of the many warbands roaming the plains. Until new ones can be trained and taught the contemporary aspects of warfare, Kelece and his comrades will fill this role for the time being."

MAZ_negebennan_defense:0 "Negebennan's Defensive Tactics"
MAZ_negebennan_defense_desc:0 "When it comes to making orders, Negebennan sees the larger picture. Specifically, there is a value in ordered retreats and feints, as it makes the foe grow bold and confident, which can be exploited to pick off units one by one. This cautious approach to warfare suits us well, although we do not have much to fallback on."

MAZ_dannaya_offense:0 "Dannaya's Call To Action"
MAZ_dannaya_offense_desc:0 "Dannaya is as ferocious as any charger, and this reflects in her war philosophy. Swift, precise attacks on their weakest points, disrupting their backlines and seizing supplies, she understands war is won when the enemy has no means to wage it with. This overall strategy could be the way to reclaim the Great Lakes for Mazwi."

MAZ_establish_generals_council:0 "Restore Great Zondata's Farima Council"
MAZ_establish_generals_council_desc:0 "Even two centuries after his time, Zondata is still revered as the great uniter of the plains, the golden emperor! Thus in his honour was our council of generals named after, and we find ourselves needing it remade again. With it come all the necessary clerks, paperwork and information needed for an army to fight effectively."

MAZ_develop_artillery:0 "Imperial Artillery Corps"
MAZ_develop_artillery_desc:0 "Large barrels have many uses, and ordnance is particularly effective on these plains. With little place to hide or build effective defences, having a decisive advantage in artillery could end battles before they even begin. It must be put to note, however, that the same plain based vulnerability applies to us."

MAZ_division_structure:0 "Numbered Divisions"
MAZ_division_structure_desc:0 "An ordered army fights effectively. What Mazwi has right now is disordered and ineffective. We have the sofa regiments, clan-recruited militias and conscripted forces. A certain degree of standardisation is needed, even if it displeases some zebras' sensibilities."

MAZ_potion_masters:0 "Conscript The Potion Brewers"
MAZ_potion_masters_desc:0 "Potions are a mainstay of our culture, and the same applies to zebras wherever they are. Modern times require a substantially larger production of such, and if our forces are going to be adequately supplied, then every skilled potion brewer in Mazwi must put their service to the Manza."

### Events ###

# Characters glossary:
# Royal Court:
# Manza Mahud - aloof, cowardly emperor who expects everything to be handed to him (he came to power basically as a puppet of sofa and nobility), if he doesn't then he deems the situation hopeless. Doesn't interfere much, but also sees his slave soldiers as mere property even though they're busy saving his empire.
# Two possible mansamara-tigui (empire-master, basically vizier)
## Zanga Senghore - a history professor educated in New Mareland who believes a Celestia-style benevolent monarchy would be best for Mazwi (after all, Equestria hasn't had any war for a millennium!). Foolishly hopes to negotiate with the other GL states to have them recognize the Manza again
## Bagabaga Daba - a bureaucrat who hails from a small Mazwi clan. A fairly stereotypical Mazwi supremacist who regards everything as just tools to regain the Empire's strength.
# Both of them are suspicious of the army for their own reasons, though.

# Three War Hosts:
# Braahima Zeydu -  a former Imperial bureaucrat from a half-Mozzi family who returned to a life of raiding after the empire's collapse. Very bitter at the Empire, because it disturbed the way of life of his Mozzi folk. Once defeated, he asks Kelece why he serves a regime that enslaved him and likely killed his family. 
# Zenguella - a minor bandit in Buckure who grew powerful as his band of misfits were the only people providing some protection immediately after the Storm King's collapse. A bit aloof and with a thirst of gold, but having a big following got in his head so he starts acting like a savior. Once defeated, he tells Kelece that the gold in the mines they fought over was the evil which set them to this path - creatures always fight over gold, even though it's worthless.
# Mara (princess) Sassouma Jukuna - the nephew of Manza Sini who was trained as a warrior princess, but lost the Mazwi civil war, was exiled, and could not defend her homeland while serving as a mercenary in Colthage. Once defeated, she tells Kelece that he's far more worthy of being an emperor than her cousin could ever be. (Based on Sassouma Bérété, btw)
# Kelece duels each one after their faction is defeated, gonna add events for it
# tl;dr they all facilitate his c h a r a c t e r g r o w t h

# The Army:
# Kelece - 
# Negebennan - strategist of the army, pursues defensive doctrine. From Mozzi, unlike Kelece he is truly loyal to the Empire.
# Dannaya - second in command of the Kelece regiment, pursues offensive doctrine. From Timbucktu. She is loyal to Kelece personally.
# Sama Kaabu - one of the first prewar Farima who rejoins the army. Originally gained his position due to his clan's friendship with the Sukuna dynasty, mainly holds onto the command post for political leverage.
# Need to add more people here tbh

# On names: free Mazwi have various Malinke and Bambara names, sometimes with Z, and surnames (clan/tribe/dynasty names). Slaves just have one name which is a proper noun from Bambara (Kelece is "sword", for example)

mazwi.1.t:0 "The Crumbling Palace"
mazwi.1.d:0 ""But I am the Emperor! The inheritor of Mazwi's legacy, God blessed leader of the Jukuna dynasty! I demand these filthy vultures leave the palace of my ancestors at once! Bandits have no right to anything of mine!" Manza Mahud, the very brave and authoritarian ruler aimlessly trotted in a circle, against the backdrop of exasperated nobles and embarrassed viziers. The Imperial Palace of Ziani, once the crowning jewel of the Empire, was now a crumbling carcass occupied by a posse of bandits - who weren't thinking of leaving.\n\n"Perhaps we could negotiate with them, Your Brilliance? Give them a bribe so they'll leave?" The ever optimistic Zanga Senghore intoned with a hopeful look, before getting interrupted by the zebra standing next to him.\n\n"You do not negotiate with scum, Zanga, you show them their place, and their place is in a shallow ditch, pushed by a bayonet. Regardless, we do not have the resources or forces to evict them... unfortunately." Bagabaga Daba swished his mane in annoyance.\n\nThe weight of the humiliation proved to be too much for the begging Emperor. "Woe is me! Woe is the great Mazwi! How could have we stooped so low!" Thus, he would pitifully crumple onto a nearby pillow, quickly attended by a sycophantic noble who allowed him to inhabit the mansion in the first place." 
mazwi.1.a:0 "If the Palace is lost, what can be said about the Empire?"

mazwi.2.t:0 "The Return Of Kelece"
mazwi.2.d:0 "Weeks would pass, with scant development, only furthering the sense of despondency growing within the spirited and cheerful Manza Mahud. With his advisors and nobles offering little solace, the esteemed Manza would spend most of his days sprawled over a divan, sating his depression with copious amount of sweets, fufu in particular.\n\nFortunes would change on this God blessed day, however, as an uniformed zebra burst into Mahud's makeshift court. "Make way! Make way! I bring a message for the Emperor of Mazwi!" Her steely gaze focused on one of the dignified, brightly dressed courtiers, and not on the pathetic stallion draped across the floor.\n\n"N-no, no, wait! I am he! Manza Mahud, ruler of the Great Lakes! What news do you bring for me, servant?" The lofty ruler seemed very stately with his unbalanced stature and unruly mane. If the mare was in any way surprised, she did not show it, as she expressed reverence by kneeling.\n\n"Honoured Manza, I am Dannaya, of the Npan Yeelen regiment. We've returned yesterday to Ziani, after a long period of wandering, and our leader, Kelece, wishes to meet with his ruler. He waits for you at the palace, we've cleared it of the vermin occupying it." Soft murmurs were exchanged as the nobles discussed the sudden presence of a sofa regiment, eyes shifting towards Mahud."
mazwi.2.a:0 "Though worried, the Manza agrees..."

mazwi.3.t:0 "Eternal Servitude"
mazwi.3.d:0 ""You held out for so long in the desert? Against both the yeti and the outlaws? How did you survive for so long?" The great Manza held a forehoof over his eyes, slightly unused to the sun after spending so much time indoors. The zebra he spoke with, a proud figure, stood before the crumbling Imperial Palace, as uniformed members of the regiment secured the perimeter. These were all Sofas — slave soldiers raised from foalhood in the art of war — and their discipline was well apparent.\n\n"They play as warriors, but we truly know how to fight." Kelece made his terse reply, his rifle slung over the shoulders, with his short mane billowing in the arid wind. He looked very much the part of a grizzled leader of zebras, not unlike the supposed Emperor before him. "We all recall the Mazwi before the Storm came. We are slaves too, but better to serve the Manza than a filthy yeti. This is why we've returned, gathering as many as we could find, to restore Mazwi to its previous glory... and I see there'll be much effort needed. To this, I offer you my service and the service of my regiment." Kelece would lower his snout to the ground in a display of submission.\n\n"I- yes, of course, this is magnificent! The great Manza needs all willing hooves to restore his rule over the Great Lakes! I accept your servitude, Kelece, and that of your regiment. May our enemies tremble!""
mazwi.3.a:0 "Perhaps we finally have something to work with?"

mazwi.4.t:0 "March on Gwitziko"
mazwi.4.d:0 "" # Gwitziko used to be an imperial armory. Kick out a petty warlord squatting in the city to restore it to the Empire.
mazwi.4.a:0 "This isn't much... but Zondata won with less."

mazwi.5.t:0 "The Decree"
mazwi.5.d:0 "" # Mahud reads out the first imperial decree since the Empire's disintegration, claiming that all its former territory remains Mazwi and everyone else occupying it are enemies of the Empire. Palace reconstruction works are happening behind his back, giving a confusing aura to the event.
mazwi.5.a:0 "For now, it's just a piece of paper."

mazwi.6.t:0 "The Mansamara-Tigui"
mazwi.6.d:0 "Manza Mahud was getting comfortable in his rule. The loyal Sofas have proven themselves repeatedly, restoring order in Mazwi and reaffirming his authority. Best of all, the Imperial Palace was mostly habitable now (with his possessions mostly restored), and he could pass most of his days lounging and eating fruit. He figured it was justified, to spend two days working and five days resting, because that's why he had zebras to do things he didn't want to, right?\n\nSpeaking of delegation, the nobles have requested that he appointed a new mansamara-tigui, the vizier to the emperor. It would get off even more work from his hooves and allow Mahud to engage in more leisurely pursuits. Munching on the remaining fufu, he thought about the two zebras who were providing most of the advice lately.\n\nZanga Senghore was quite boring to listen to, with his long-winded history lectures, but he has a certain way with words that calmed everyzebra. Mahud recalled his plans to negotiate with the other secessionists to return into Mazwi's fold, which would certainly be wonderful, and there was also something about a more benevolent monarchy, which he didn't care about much.\n\nOn the other hoof, Bagabaga Daba had little charisma, but his actions gave results. If Mahud wanted something done, he could rely on Bagabaga to see it completed, even with sparse resources. Still, he had to admit his brusque behaviour sometimes raised more trouble than needed, but such was the business of ruling. Now, who to choose..." 
mazwi.6.a:0 "Senghore and the Zebritude will help establish peace."

mazwi.7.d:0 "" # Would be good to add some lore on Re'emite history in Mazwi (see what Cyrus wrote on it). Imperial nobles and bureaucrats are negotiating with representatives of the Re'emite enclave in Buckure. In exchange for continued autonomy, they offer aid in the reconstruction.
mazwi.7.a:0 "The whole nation must modernise, and fast."
mazwi.7.b:0 "Some of their insight into industrial efficiency will suffice."

mazwi.8.t:0 "The Empire and its Soldiers"
mazwi.8.d:0 "" # Senghore, as Mansamara-Tigui, expresses his concerns to the Manza about their armies - he fears that sofa will turn independent and overthrow the ruler just like they did during the Succession War. He prefers an army of citizens, or, even better, peace with the rest of the Great Lakes. Mahud is slightly concerned but doesn't really do much
mazwi.8.a:0 "Concerning..."

mazwi.9.t:0 "The Empire And Its Soldiers"
mazwi.9.d:0 ""I do not like our sofas, my Manza. They are too emotional, too independent, and worst of all, they do not obey without question. I recall the days when such things would be sufficient to earn them a kiss of the lash. I think you've been coddling them too much." Bagabaga Daba made a digression while looking over the various reconstruction proposals with a rather bored looking Mahud.\n\n"Nonsense, Daba. They've been nothing but loyal property, and they know better than to act against their master. It is certainly outside of the norm, but in these times, some leeway can be excused." The very commanding Manza swished the complaint away with his foreleg, pretending to pay great attention to a sheet containing a suggested tax reform. Numbers and equations made little sense to him.\n\n"Do you not recall what happened to your predecessor, Sini? He too assumed the loyalty of his subjects, but in the end, somezebra struck a knife in his back. If I had my way, I'd disband Kelece's regiment and begin anew, get slaves we can unquestionably rely upon." The vizier's earnest plea left the Manza pondering, although his thoughts were more concerned with the evening's banquet."

mazwi.13.a:0 "With these hooves at the helm, Mazwi can survive any onslaught."

mazwihosts.1.t:0 "In Futa Zallon"
mazwihosts.1.d:0 "It would be accurate to say that Mazwi these days consisted of Ziani and outlying farmlands. Everything beyond that, was controlled by outlaws, mercenaries, rebellious slaves, and in one particular case, an unsavoury cult. In the province of Futa Zallon, a vengeful rebel was preparing his move after receiving some particularly bad news.\n\n"Is that so? All zebras we sent to raid the Palace, dead to the last?" Braahima Zeydu, a former Imperial bureaucrat turned raider, hid his annoyance by cleaning a revolver.\n\n"I'm afraid so, Zeydu. Some zebra called Kelece, he brought an entire regiment of sofas and killed them all. We won't be getting much loot from Ziani like this." The squeamish subordinate hoped his boss wouldn't point that gun at him in rage. Thankfully, God was looking after the lowly bandit, with the offending weapon placed down on the desk, as Zeydu stood up.\n\n"I hate Mazwi. They disturbed the life of my Mozzi kin, they enslaved and exploited so many, and now they wish to play overlords again. We can't let that happen again, can we? Relay this message to everyzebra: we're marching on Ziani and burning down the rotten husk. We'll make them pay for every one of mine they killed, and I'll take Mahud's fancy chair for myself.""

  kir_hierarchy_level_5_title: "Mystic Burearch"
  kir_hierarchy_level_1_title_desc: "The Watch, The Jurist, The Refined One of the Most Sacrosanct: such are few of the roles and titles bestowed upon The First Priestess.\n\nAs the de jure head of the Way of Fire, the First Priestess is the chief discoverer and recorder of the will of Concord (second only to the Matriarch Superior herself in this position) and how to apply it into one's life. In this capacity, she is the mediator between the other-worldly and this present realm, with supreme jurisdiction over the Way as manifested in this world.\n\nSuch mediation is not an easy task. She is to answer to the spiritual needs and issues of millions of kirin, who these days are constantly led astray by the wiles of the nations outside and the infidels inside. Constantly exhorting to every kirin she meets the necessity of adhering to the Five Tenets—in professional meetings, in elaborate ceremonies, in casual trips across the Realm—her duty of caring souls never ends."
  kir_hierarchy_level_2_title_desc: "While the First Priestess oversees the sacred, the Priestesses Seneschal oversee the secular: the finances of the Hierocracy as a whole, accountability among the Mystics Militarch, and deciding which junior priestesses and mystics to elevate or to shift. They report directly to the First Priestess and are often her most direct advisors on spiritual matters as those.\n\nTraditionally, the Priestesses Seneschal had come in twos, no more and no less, handling one half of Kiria each regarding its spiritual health, though those halves have shifted over the centuries depending on where the Priestesses come from. They were almost always present in ceremonies that invoke the the First Priestess's presence. In addition, they are not solely Priestesses Seneschals, for they took on parts of their prior duties (so, in theory, a Kirian polity can have two presiding priestesses, with one selected to "replace" the leaving now-Seneschal incumbent, the latter being occasionally asked to mentor the former)."
  kir_hierarchy_level_3_title_desc: "As the Valiants' existence shows, the Way of Fire has always been familiar with the ways of war, the helpfulness of which was demonstrated so painfully in the civil war just past. For all the grit and glory our hoofsoldiers endured and deserved, our victory would not have been possible without the critical skills the Mystics Militarch offered.\n\nSynthesising the tenets of the Way with the necessities of warfare, the Militarchs superintend the organisation and the strategical thinking of Kiria's thousand banners, an obligation pertinent in light of modern developments such as tanks, missiles, and aircraft. They can be seen in meetings as secluded as war rooms hidden within the Peaks of Peril or the western jungles, or in occasions as open as teaching in a military academy or convincing young adults to enlist in a new banner. Their work in peace is as strenuous as in war, adding to their responsibilities the configuring of Kiria's police force and other law enforcement establishments.\n\nBy blades of steel and wit, the Militarchs shall forever defend, in Kiria, the Way and the Matriarch."
  kir_hierarchy_level_4_title_desc: "The foundation of their faith is a veritable mountain of ancient scrolls, verified supernatural events, and thorough apologetics, lived out by their constant observance of spiritual rituals and ceremonies that pull them closer to Concord than most: upon these live the Mystics Literarch.\n\nA Literarch's main duty is to oversee the body of religion that is The Way of Fire, possessing the final say on the interpretation of tenets and the sustentation of age-old Way practices. Extreme disputes between mystics on spiritual matters are also resolved by the Literarchs on the basis that any judgment they will make is as good as divine revelation. In addition, the Literarchs are the public face of the Way on the world religion stage, providing proofs and arguments to prove the Way's transcendence as well as organising proselytisation efforts in notorious hotbeds of heresy should the need arise. But the Way of Fire is also a science and a philosophy, and the Literarchs reflect this in their supervision of science institutions Kiria-wide, emphasising what inner truths about Concord and Her will can be revealed that can fill the existing gaps in our knowledge. Par the course (as they are Mystics), one final duty they have to Kiria is cleansing the land clean from heresy, blessing kirinity with specialised regiments to flush out unorthodoxy and to extinguish the inner flames of those who twist Concord's words.\n\nKiria may be run by bureaucrats and protected by generals, but it's the Mystics Literarch who make sure that, no matter the era, Kiria is still Kiria."
  kir_hierarchy_level_5_title_desc: "It is said that to be a Burearch is to be a mediator of every facet of the world. It is also said to be a thankless job, for the public is often smitten by the popular picture of praying temple priests or proud warrior-monks and strategists, and anykirin with more than a passing intent to become one must study for and pass a punishing civil service examination just to work under a Burearch.\n\nBut ask a Burearch about the above, and no matter their roles or responsibilities and the lack of limelight they can bask in, they will reply that the other Mystics constantly thank them: not every priest can handle the rigours of signing seals and memorizing the minuitaie of sanctuary maintenance codes; not every martial can pore through every letter and transaction that passes through the hooves of entire desmesnes.\n\nThough the Burearchs squirrel away in government offices and the backrooms of lesser temples, handling administrative duties or rote rituals, these Mystics are the sages that keep the wheels of Kiria running."

  # Descs
  kir_hch_1_desc: "When a great part of the world moved on from resplendent kingdoms to "efficient" democracies and republics, a charm was lost: the seriousness and solemnity that is meeting a head of state. There is no doubt that presidents hold sway in the global scene, yet when their faces and names shift every half a decade, getting to know them is futile.\n\nMilk Vetch thus holds the Realm and its history dear to his heart. Why shouldn't he? The position he's given—to bear the Matriarch Superior's scepter whenever she meets with foreign dignitaries—has been passed down through his bloodline since the birth of the Realm.\n\nFor though the Matriarchs may die, Her Scepter does not, a sign of legitimising permanence to the rest of the world."
  kir_hch_2_desc: "To the point of parody and commodification in other countries, the royal seals of Vermilion stick out as among the most distinct facets of Kirian culture, given sacred connotations by related stories of Concord blessing Iridescent Dawn with creation's purest form of signatures.\n\nThe perks of maintaining these seals is not lost on Orchid: she has inherited a network of important figures across the government by virtue of supplying and cleaning their seals and special ink paste. Thus recipient to a plurality of perspectives and personal situations, Orchid can be trusted as an on-the-spot mediator."
  kir_hch_3_desc: "Heavenly is the first to hold the title of Procurate Chief Magistrate, necessitated by an Equestrian and Griffonian trend that Kiria cannot ignore: taking care of civil servants as their own creatures.\n\nA common denominator spotted in the rhetoric of the western heretics, the northern merchants, and the eastern agitators is the promise of better pay and living conditions... which is a broad and vague promise, but a promise that the Realm seemed to have unwillingly buried in its victory.\n\nTo be sure, these incentives cannot be given out haphazardly. While those who work directly for the Matriarch and her government have already been given a plenitude of rewards for their service, new forms of these such as pensions and bonuses can be trickled in to convince the undecided that work rendered to Concord is the highest category of work one can give."
  kir_hch_4_desc: "To be a faithful censor in present-day Kiria is to eternally put yourself in a precarious position. Any new media, any new information, that gains any scrap of prominence on the national stage must be reviewed meticulously for anything unbecoming of a Concord-worshipping kirin.\n\nCooked and fermented in the mind of the high censor, then, is the Realm's most potent source of heresy and dissidence, neutralised by an unwavering belief in the supremacy of Concord over all things material. Lesser minds will crumble, will succumb to the allures of lesser thoughts.\n\nPearl Perilla will not falter, and so the faith of the Realm shakes not."
  kir_hch_5_desc: "For all of Brittle's (literal) theatrics, one may be forgiven for believing he shares many beliefs with Autumn Blaze. Once a mainstay actor of traditional Kirian play, he has been installed into his position as a rather unorthodox choice to fulfill the Herald's role: to be the Realm's average-faced representative to the average kirin, now often seen preparing decrees in the name of the Matriarch about the state of the Realm along with Her divinely inspired comments on happenings across her territory and the world.\n\nIn his downtime, Brittle is fortunate he can still be a charming face on stage, albeit in more Hierocracy-approving plays than he initially anticipated. "
  kir_hch_6_desc: "The Vanguards had waned in the century of Silence, but they had not fully disappeared. For that, Double Thyme is one of the kirin to thank.\n\nTasked by Noctilucent Charm to continue preserving the martial arts of the west in co-operation with the Aureolin Monastery, Double Thyme spent the final years of the Silence teaching what remained of Kiria's border guard the art of fighting in many disadvantaged positions should the unruly zebras and griffons of the south look at the Realm with hungry eyes. Rain Shine's lifting of the Silence brought Double small fame: the number of her apprentices or students skyrocketed as the Thousand Banners slowly rebuilt.\n\nWith Kiria resurgent,  her decade and more of experience in personal and small-scale warfare has given her a greater responsibility: to standardise and codify the Vanguard's operations. Another challenge she is sure to thrive in."
  kir_hch_7_desc: "While his neighbours languished, Pepper studied the blade. Having blocked out the chains of temporal pleasures, he learned how to nurture inner strength in the Aureolin Monastery. When the Realm was set on fire and the heretics pounded at the gates, it was Pepper who coolly cut down a cadre of the Rising Fire's finest.\n\nSo Pepper's devotees say. A kirin of few words, Pepper has let the sword do the talking in a language every subordinate understands."
  kir_hch_8_desc: "It is easy to learn how to fight well. Not so on why one must fight well.\n\nThe Mystic Marshal Martial blends the spiritual duties of a greatly devoted mystic and the military responsibilities of a high-ranking officer. Said Martial is charged with planning the permanent defence of major holy sites across Kiria, up to and including the Vermilion Palace."
  kir_hch_9_desc: "The lands outside the cities are a wild, untamed place in which entire armies can get entangled in. The vicious territory of the western-southern border? A hotbed of delirious activity if kept unchecked. Who is willing to stamp it down in the name of Concord?\n\nFirm Hoof is the kirin to vanquish them. Once a patrol-kirin stationed out in the lonely jungles, the Silence's end brought opportunity for advancement. Firm Hoof found distinction in rooting out heretics hiding in the trees. The reward? To be able to police the border's lands and bring everlasting peace to the very lands that nearly killed him. "
  kir_hch_10_desc: "To set the principles of what is scheduled when in the Hierocracy is left to the Imperial Astronomer. A position inherited from before the first Matriarch, this kirin observes the constellations every night and maps out their projections over the next several millennia, along with what parts of the land would be under which set of stars to suss out which days and hours are auspicious."
  kir_hch_11_desc: "Boil down every cause and you will find that it is a binary choice of good or bad. This extends to the law and its enforcement: any delay in executing it within a jurisdiction has its roots in some act of immorality, a disobedience by commission or omission, in a lack of faith.\n\nIn these cases, the Supreme Judiciarch is called in to investigate every kirin involved with obstructing the will of the Matriarch Superior. Those found wanting will find themselves swiftly replaced by the faithful."
  kir_hch_12_desc: "A core differentiation in Kirian philosophy is how a creature best sources his or her power. Though most creatures are bestowed with magic, many have deigned to redirect their magic or their power into external apparatuses (such as weapons and vehicles). The kirin, thanks to her dual soul, is the least restrained by these weapons: she, herself, can dispense her power purely by herself.\n\nIt is this difference on which the Serene Tutelar stands as the guardian of the Serene Tendency's quest for inner knowledge. While not exactly a priestess or a mystic, the Tutelar spearheads the national inspection of the kirin soul and her capabilities through a mix of treatises and experiments—all in the name of enhancing Concord's creation within Her bounds."
  kir_hch_13_desc: "A post-Silence office, the Eminent Perceptor's first and, for now, only holder is Sugar Cane. A daughter of the kirin diaspora in Griffonia, she grew up in the aftermath of the Republican Revolutions against the Empire and the Aquileian monarchy. The fierce weapons then on display clashed with the ancient tales of marching Banners.\n\nIt is unknown how she came to the auspices of the Serene Tendency when she first returned to Kiria as an NAKP supporter. Let it not be said that Concord cannot be gracious."
  kir_hch_14_desc: "Unrestrained growth leads to great envy between those who benefit and those left behind, yet Kiria must grow lest outside forces prey upon the weakling. When these predators have the power of a thousand smokestacked assembly lines, the Realm must find the means to match these numbers without sacrificing its soul.\n\nVanilla Chai, the first Scholarch Intendant, sets out to find a perfect balance as a senior priestess over the few businesskirin and economists that have aligned with us. The Five Tenets of the Way can be applied as much to industrial and service life as it can be found in the age-old ways of farming."
  kir_hch_15_desc: ""We stashed the guns somewhere, and then we had a whole speech prepared to get everyone up. When I woke up in the evening for the final hours of preparations for the revolt, the guns were gone... whole boxes. The speech was gone.\n\n"The bloodied body of our leader sat sprawled. I saw a note attached to it.\n\n"'Out of his remains, none.'"\n~Anonymous correspondent, transcription found in RaHP archives"
  kir_hch_16_desc: ""...so the name itself became the monster. That's what Lily used. No, it was what everyone else said, the ones who lived but knew something was missing. One day, it's a misplaced blanket, and maybe you just misremembered and now you don't know where it is. The next... you don't misplace your wife, do you?"\n~ Anonymous correspondent, transcription found in RaHP archives"
  kir_hch_17_desc: "A young bright mind, Kite Dancer found service to the Realm as a bladesmith, forging ceremonial and practical weapons from a more civilised age. He gained renown for preserving the art of swordfighting for both fellow Valiants and the Banners at large.\n\nHis participation in the war against harmony's disruptors has garnered him a great many accolades, both on the field with his tactical prowess and off the field with his homemade craftskirinship. He may not have reached his thirties, but with limitless potential, he has accrued more experience than most can dream of."
  kir_hch_18_desc: "Fern Meadow's greatness might've been inherited, but it would've been extinguished had her mother—a descendant of a miniscule martial camp that held out against the nirik warlords long before Iridescent Dawn arrived—not nourished it.\n\nToday, Fern has gained a small amount of fame from touring across the country to battle the champions of Kiria's ancient strategy games—and, despite the decades-long age gap, win more often than not. With her own initiation as a Valiant not too long ago, the possibilities seem endless for her."
  kir_hch_19_desc: "The Silence in the far west had been a taste of death to Tocsin. Away from the remains of proper civilisation in Chrysanthemum, Tocsin was born in the consequences of those whose greed had overrun kirinity. The young foal would venture out from a dying family and into the emptied cities wherein not much else but decay could be found.\n\nThe Silence's end was heaven sent, the start of paradise and healing, but the agitation of yet another upheaval, this time from the Rising Fire, threatened the ruin of all things. They asked for too much change, too much chaos, from which the Matriarch could enact another Silence. Tocsin jumped at the chance of joining the armed forces to eliminate that chance, ridding the forests and jungles of immature rebels who knew not the plight of a young foal over a decade ago. Tocsin's little brigade often found themselves at the forefront of the action, bearing the brunt of Kiria's offensives, tearing apart the heretics' resolve until they begged and saw the sin of their ways.\n\nNow at peace, Tocsin asks to serve once more, so that no more may be silenced from birth."
  kir_hch_20_desc: "A good way to follow through the Tenets of the Way is self-discipline. A5fter all, a great driving principle in this is temperance, if not in attitude, then against the indulges and carnal cravings of the day.\n\nThe Dynast Banneret seeks to recruit on that principle. Silken Veil started out as a priestess; when the war broke out, Silken hurried to the frontlines not as a Valiant but as what Equestrians or Griffonians would call a "chaplain". An injury would quickly send Silken to the homefront, so she shifted then back to being a priestess, sojourning to plenty of villages to exhort the values of The Way's practice through warfare.\n\nIn peacetime, Silken now continues spending her days on morality campaigns, still exhorting the multitude to join the Banners as a surefire path to tame their nirik states through service to the Dynasty."
  kir_hch_21_desc: "The world is Concord's creation. In Her wisdom, a manual of sorts can be inferred on how to make use of the blessings She has given us.\n\nLike a great many born during the Silence, Turning Leaves was raised by a family of peasant farmers. Unlike many, he was also raised near a mining community, where he soon experienced first-hoof the harvesting of metals, and how they would be bent into other things. A mystic nearby had been guiding the mining community, teaching them to direct their raw emotions into the productive job of mining while being taught herself by the miners there.\n\nThis has evidently been a turning point for the young foal, for he has now grown up to a premier mystic in touch with Concord's nature. "Automation" and other such terms may confuse him, but if it can be properly directed to worship Concord by providing more value to Her creation while respecting the divine will behind all things, then let it be so."
  kir_hch_22_desc: "During Fickle Current's time as Viceroy of Greater Providence, Gold Papaver worked as one of the port-masters of Fragrance. Though a frequent pilgrim to the shrines of the Way, she had complied with the NAKP government, initially believing it to be a positive alternative to Vermilion's word. This was before the NAKP showed their true colours in rebellion.\n\nWhile standard procedure would have had Papaver punished, her associates had noted that she often offered lower taxes for ships that brought in no luxurious cargo that led to sin (bearing only necessities such as food and building materials), and that she ought not rather to be rehabilitated: her personal network of admirals and shipbuilders that the NAKP had left behind could be put to use to project Kiria's might over the waves.\n\nBy the Imperial Premier's mercy, she has decided to grant Papaver reward: the Viceroyalty of Providence, more faithful than Fickle and his cronies could ever be."
  kir_hch_23_desc: "Huddled in the farthest reaches of the Realm is where a majority of the Valiants hail from. While they are often organised into their own units, it remains essential for a singular figure to coordinate and communicate between them. This is the job of the Magistrate of the West.\n\nThough the Valiants have often come under different flavours of discipline, the Magistrate of the West ensures that they will have a direct line to the government and to modern chain of military command. On the battlefield, no longer will the Valiants be disparate groups, trapped in their own specialisations and brands of martial arts: they will be an orchestra, singers of one song, painters of a quite violent art."
  kir_hch_24_desc: "The chief student of the traditions of the Way of Fire, the Minister of Rites is singular for every generation, taught in a master-apprentice chain. The Minister upholds the responsibility of detailing the forms of each and every ritual governed by the Way, recording and remember them for what purpose and for when.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Brassica Sprout, the most recent holder of the title, will deal with these rituals in the face of a world from the future knocking on Kiria's door with its boatloads of gadgets and ideas. Various questions arise: Must a car be blessed? What rituals can be given to those who work irregular nightly hours in the cities? Calculators can rise to dizzyingly high numbers, so what does this mean for numerology?\n\nHe wishes for simpler days sometimes."

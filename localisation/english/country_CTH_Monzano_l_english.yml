CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank_desc:0 "The Eastern bank of the Bagraza is an amazing defensive position that we cannot sacrifice by trying to hold onto Zur. We shall hold this position while we wear down and defeat Gerza's forces, then we shall turn and destroy the Star Father and his cult."

CTH_MZO_a_new_republic:0 "A New Republic"
CTH_MZO_a_new_republic_desc:0 "Colthage has been through a lot of governments in recent years. The Zarcid regime was... middling, the Constitutionalists betrayed the people, and the Zarishat regime brought out the worst in all of us. So where does the nation look to now for inspiration to fight on? Monzano believes there must be a new Republic, a new ideal to strive for, free of the chains of these past failures. A new future for all."

CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope_desc:0 "A leader must give their people something to believe in, an idea to strive towards.

The room looked a mess, with open tins of food and half-drunk mugs of tea strewn about. "I..." Monzano started as her hoof came to a rest on Zur. "I..."\n\n"How is this a question?" Jezabzella exclaimed, "We have to protect Zur from that maniac in the west!"\n\n"Aye!" Zalathel shouted, "How can we claim to fight for Colthage if we are going to leave them to his horrors?" he continued.\n\nZaphod took a look at the frazzled Monzano.

colthage_monzano_cw.101.d:0 "As the cadre of soldiers marched into camp, Monzano could not help but be shocked. She had received a radio transmission the previous day from someone who claimed to be Azruzaal Azarago, apparently responding to her call for army remnants to join her. She had thought it a trap and planned as such, but these soldiers marched in uniform columns and wore dress uniforms as they marched, far better dressed than her own ragged soldiers.\n\n"Azruzaal Azarago reporting. At your command General." Monzano wheeled around to the Colonel now standing before her. "Umm, thank you Azruzaal. Report on... where you've been?"\n\nAzruzaal nodded firmly, "As you command." taking out a journal from his pocket he began reading off his detailed description of the events that had occurred. "At the time of the rise of the Star Father in the west, I was in command of soldiers in Karamane administering engineering projects there. When the Starites came for us I lead my soldiers deep into the jungles where I established a base of operations. Since then my contingent was mostly on the backfoot but we were able to gleam bits of intelligence that sanity still ruled in the city of Colthage, and that other former Constitutionalists were rallying there under your command. So I picked up my contingent, disassembled camp and set off. I'm ready to fight if you'll let me."\n\nMonzano was blown away, finally some good news. "Of course Colonel, tell your troops to unpack, they get one day of rest then they're off to the front." Azruzaal nodded, and was off."

All over grain. Grain! Nothing more than grain!\n\n"Anything?" Zaphod carefully asked.\n\n"Yes. I am trying to fight for them and their liberties. Their dreams! Their everything! And I am stuck here as their unwilling punisher," she shouted out into the room, a few loose leaves of paper flying around.\n\n"It I-" Zaphod began before being cut off.\n\nMonzano began falling into a mixture of crying and shouting as she continued on, "Don't tell me it is necessary, I know it is. I know that it's for the greater good, but this is just so much," tears streaming into her coat as she signed it quickly with her pen, "Now take it away from my sight.

The protests had been stemmed, the military had restored order in the streets, and the city was finally getting back to normal.\n\nSo why did she feel like the villain of this story? Was she to be remembered as the dictator who used force to try and cling onto power? Why was she thinking of her legacy when her survival was still uncertain? What would the future hold for her?\n\nMonzano sighed, there she went getting existential again. It was one hoof in front of the other for now. She could think about things like legacies once the everpresent danger of death was gone.\n\nJust ignore the voices telling you you're wrong." #Order Restored within Colthage
colthage_monzano_cw.201.a:0 "Is it all worth it?"

colthage_monzano_cw.3.t:0 "The Valiant Few"
colthage_monzano_cw.3.d:0 "As the soldiers stepped off the boat, Monzano couldn't put her hoof on the feelings swirling in her soul. These brave few, these old and young, had volunteered to sail all the way from Kasa to serve in her army and defend Colthage. They arrived in fishing boats and trawlers, one by one stepping onto the dock in the Colthage harbour. Their ancestors had not lived here for centuries, but these souls chose to fight. Why? She was of course grateful for them, but part of her mind could not wrap around why they even bothered. Feeling a tugging in her chest, Monzano began to walk toward the soldiers disembarking from the vessels. Clearing her throat, she awkwardly tried to get the attention of the few hundred soldiers in front of her. \n\n"Attention! Hey! Uhh, excuse me!"\n\nOne of Monzano's soldiers tapped her in the shoulder and pushed over a barrel from the dock for her to stand on. Monzano thanked him and balanced carefully atop the precarious perch. "Soldiers of Kasa! Thank you all for coming to Colthage's aid! Your courage is insurmountable in the face of these grave threats to... to umm..."\n\nMonzano felt torn, these stallions and mares deserved more than cookie-cutter nonsense. By now they were all looking at her, and she felt their confusion at her sudden halt. \n\nMonzano sighed and took a seat on the barrel. "I honestly can't thank you all enough, to be open with you all I can't understand why you would risk everything to come to a land that enslaved your ancestors to fight a war that does not affect you. But thank you for coming to my aid, no, to the aid of all of Colthage's citizens. You all who hold freedom so deep in your hearts. I'm fighting this war to protect the place I was born, to protect what I once had, a selfish war. You fight for creatures you've never known, a people who are not your own, answering the call of those who never did anything for you. You are the noble few, and I salute you."\n\nMonzano got off the barrel and stood eye level with the Kasan soldiers, and raised her hoof in salute. One by one, the Kasans followed, and went to shake their new general's hoof."
colthage_monzano_cw.3.a:0 "And she never noticed the camerazebra."

colthage_monzano_cw.301.t:0 "The Few Become The Many"
colthage_monzano_cw.301.d:0 "Jezabzella had to push through the crowd to reach the dock this time, everywhere zebras thronged to see what was happening in the port of Colthage. She had heard a commotion outside and rushed to see what was going on, so transfixed was the mob on the disruption that no one noticed one of the General's foremost ministers running beside them.\n\nArriving in the port, Jezabzella could guess at what was causing the crowds. Close to two dozen ships were floating about in the harbour being halted by port authorities. Upon their decks was a cast diverse enough you'd think it was a scene out of Skyfall. Out of the corner of her eye, Jezabzella sighted a few soldiers marching through the crowds and organized herself an escort to the shore. Finally making it through the crowd, Jezabzella dusted herself off, fixed her mane, and tried to get a lay of the situation.\n\n"Mister port guard! What is going on here?" The military police officer blinked a few times, having to centre himself after what was clearly a draining experience. "Well Miss uhh, minister. The ship claims to be full of soldiers wanting to fight in our armies, they keep saying something about a newspaper article? To be honest, I can't understand a bleeding thing, they don't even all speak the same language."\n\nThinking for a moment, Jezabzella heard a shout in a familiar language from the side of the ship she was closest to, "Excuse me, madam! Are you perhaps Minister Zeshmid?" Facing the ship, Jezabzella saw a griffon wearing a suit and monocle, holding a rifle in claw. "Indeed I am, and thankfully it seems someone on your ship can speak Zonician."\n\nThe griffon chuckled and then sighed with relief, "Thank goodness, these port guards don't seem to believe me. My name is Professor Guthart and these fine creatures with me all came to fight for Colthage." By now Guthart had thrown down the gangway and was waddling towards Jezabzella who brushed away the police's attempt to block him. "We read this article in the Griffonian press and simply couldn't stop ourselves. We're here to answer liberty's call, to fight under Monzano, and we'd be honored if she would accept us."\n\nReading through the article, Jezabzella smirked as she recognized it for the propaganda masterstroke it was. As she welcomed the volunteers to shore, she chucked, she didn't even need to raise a hoof for all this."

What in the name of Za'al are you doing?" Zalathel Zarca, taken off guard, attempted to protest as Monzano pulled him back. "Zalathel, we need to talk about something." Shrugging, the Zarca patriarch followed Monzano outside the command tent and was faced with two legfulls of documents.\n\n"Where does your sister keep finding these boats?" Monzano stared him dead in the eyes as she spoke.\n\n"I beg your pardon? What do you mean 'find these boats'?"\n\nMonzano dumped the papers out in front of him, "She hasn't been back in port for months, she won't stop raiding enemy supply, lines, I keep telling her we're running out of fuel but she keeps saying she has ways to get more!" Monzano's voice reached a fever pitch as she spoke, "And then three ships sailed into port carrying thousands of guns which is great and all but the problem is I THOUGHT THOSE SHIPS GOT SUNK MONTHS AGO?"\n\n"Monzano! Calm yourself!" Zarca began picking up the papers from the ground. "Well, she is my sister, after all." Seeing his quip not calm the general's mood, Zalathel's tone became more serious, "Look, I've seen the reports, the ships thought the fleet was routed and hid from our enemies, but when Zaphod began her ventures out to sea, they began rejoining the fleet."\n\nMonzano groaned, "If I was half as good at being a general and a statesmare as she is at being an admiral, this war might've been over already."\n\nZalathel chuckled, "Don't worry Monzano, I feel the same.""

It was her chance to save her starving people. The radio operator flailed his hooves to get her to begin.\n\n"Citizens and leaders of the world. I speak to you in a time of great crisis for my nation. Colthage lies in ruins, fractured by corruption, hate, and lies. The last vestiges of civil government take shelter with me in the city of Colthage. We have soldiers, we have guns, but we lack something essential. Because bandits and cultists have taken control of the countryside, we lack food. I shall be direct, my city is starving, and I am begging the world for aid. I can offer no guarantee of payment, only a promise, as our coffers have been cleaned out by our former tyrant. All I can give you now is my eternal gratitude."\n\nMonzano wiped a tear from her eye, and her voice began to whimper, but only barely.\n\n"Please, help me help my country. We will take anything the world can offer, my people need to eat."\n\nThe light died down, signalling her job was done, and Monzano went off to bed, nursing a hungry stomach as her soldiers ate."

Over the past few weeks, more Constitutionalist officers had found their way to Monzano's command and had joined up with her forces. And today was the first meeting of the combined military council, which meant two things. First, these constitutionalists were now face to face with the zebra they had rebelled against, and second, that Monzano had a terrible headache.\n\n"You know full well none of this would have happened if you selfish dungtrotters hadn't ruined everything by throwing us out of power! We never would have let Zarishat take over!" Zasdrubal Zarca spat as he invoked the name of the nation's former dictator, his brother Zago Zarca nodding in arrogant agreement.\n\nZarvad Orzagid looked about to burst, "If you had only listened to the citizens for once instead of that incestuous habit of talking up each other's ideas until you've tricked yourself into thinking you have more than a third of a brain between you all!"\n\nMonzano knew she had to step in, this was going to boil over, she couldn't have her advisors starting conflict within her own camp. But just as she was about to try and restore order in the room, another shout beat her to it.\n\n"Enough!" Zalathel Zarca, who had been quiet for the past few minutes, slammed his hoof on the table. "Zasdrubal, please behave, if Zaphod was here she'd have you in a headlock by now." Zalathel sighed and faced his once-adversaries, "I hold my own grudges against you all as well, Orzagid, Annizalid, Azarago. But we worked together once, before your revolution, and we can do so again. And right now, let us work together in giving General Monzano the floor so she can get us down to business."\n\nMonzano, along with most in the room, sat stunned. Smiling to herself the presiding General thanked Zalathel and began the meeting." #Monzano brings in the officers that she can, maybe mentions a few of the Zarcas? Since everyone in this family is apparently a competent officer.

This wasn't her scene, and she was not happy to be here, but at least they weren't trying to talk to her. This was a fundraising dinner for her war effort, all the patricians here had paid good money to brag about helping Monzano win the war, and she was hoping they would hoof over more by the end of the night.\n\nThe patricians Monzano now mingled with had no love for her, they would sooner thrust the Zarcas back upon the throne of Colthage, but Zalathel himself had signed onto her movement, so the patricians would follow.\n\nLooking towards the ad-hoc stage in the back of the room, Monzano saw who she assumed to be the host hobble towards the podium. Imin Azkan, as she was told was his name, was more a socialite than a true patrician. She had done some digging on him to assume his invitation to this event was not, in fact, a trap. Took a bullet during the storm king invasion, put most of his family's wealth behind the Zarcas, got elected to the lower house of government, hid during the Zarishat period, and now he was in the mood to throw money at her. But as the zebra began to speak about the importance of charity to the state in these trying times, Monzano thought about his other work. His books. Books about foreign policy, books about the glory of Colthage, books about how Colthage could bring democracy to all Zebrica. Monzano doubted his commitments to true democracy, but she would have to send him a letter in the coming days."

Come, come."\n\nHurrying her through a set of doors in the temple, Monzano entered the main alter room and saw a collection of priests and a camerazebra. Imin smiled, "I know this is a bit of a rushed meeting, but I think it's good PR for you."\n\nMonzano could feel the eyes of the priests digging into her skin, they knew she worked for Zarishat, and she knew that only Imin was keeping them from hurling a bit more than insults at her. Monzano sighed, "Well as long as we can discuss our business somewhere else after this, I'll do your photo shoot."\n\nImin smiled and stroked his beard as Monzano received the blessing of the priests, and he thought about how great this partnership would be." #Zebra Dugin or some other Zarcid gets Monzano to have the church to help the country.

What've we all bled for?"\n\nMonzano didn't move at all as she thought, she stared straight down at the table and let the silence ring for what seemed like an eternity.\n\n"No more dictators, no more corruption, no more... any of that Za'al damned nonsense that caused civil war after civil war fueling blood and death all over. Our citizens deserve better than that, they deserve to live free for once. And if it takes burning down every idea we've ever tried before, I think that's a fair price."\n\nImin took another drag of his cigar, "Well those are some big dreams. You know the type I am, you know I worked for the Zarcids, you know that I'm basically a living embodiment of the ideas you're talking about burning down.

The Zarcas on her left, the constitutionalists and harmonites on her right, and Imin Azkan right beside her, holding his six-year-old colt.\n\nRight when Monzano was about to begin her speech, she paused. She had rehearsed this many many times, ever since she had heard of the rout of the Staarite and Gerzid armies. She never thought the day would come, but here she was. She wished she could pray to thank the gods for this victory, but while she knew they smiled upon her efforts, they were not doing this to save her. They had made this happen to save the nation, she must still pay back her sins.\n\n"Citizens of Colthage! I speak to you today not as General Monzano, head of the provisional government, but as Zanit Monzano, a citizen of Colthage. This war has been long and hard, the odds have long been stacked against us, but our nation and our people never relented. I could speak forever about the costs of war, I could speak on the dead, on the wounded, as there are countless of both, but there is plenty of time for mourning, and today I would rather look forward. Today, while I would love to regale you on all of the changes going forward, I feel today should be a day of joy, not a day of tedium.

From here, the faces of the zebras below were almost indistinguishable, their chatter drowned out by the tune of her radio. But the former policemare knew what they had done. Below there was the scum of Colthage, who had given in to their darkest desires in the pursuit of raw profit or esoteric salvation.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, in the past few weeks, some Gerza's soldiers had tried to bribe her on five separate occasions to let them out, promising they had no intention to fight for the crooked Coltvan. Not many of them seemed to have any sense of loyalty. Now the Covenant's zebras were the weird ones. As a rookie, she had once busted down the dormitory of one of these Hipponian students for noise disturbance and found some weird drawings. The chief had told her to drop it, as some rich patrician had taken the case personally. "Well old stag, if you had only known," Xanza muttered, grinning when the radio's music stopped.\n\nA familiar voice reached over the radio, seemingly clearing her throat before speaking. "Colthaginians, soldiers, every zebra who has been working towards or hoping for this day, I will keep it short. The last rebel strongholds have been taken, and the government is once again in control of the country." Xanza's eyes widened, and she leaned into the radio set, as thousands were doing with her. "No largescale enemy resistance remains. The war is over." Monzano continued to speak, but Xanza was already climbing down, rushing to tell her comrades. A great sense of relief engulfed the camp, and even on the faces of some of the prisoners, stress seemed to melt away. They had made it. The Republic stood. Battered and bruised, but there it was, there they were. Hope remains."

colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.2.d:0 "The corporal typed diligently on the typewriter in the Zur town hall, and for once, the gentle ticking was the only noise to be heard. Major Pazeb, head of the Zur garrison, dictated: "The Colthaginian army has driven the enemy westward away from the city, and with yesterday's push, no enemy remains in range to strike at the city." The commander sighed, smiling and looking out at the morning sun illuminating the bay. "The Battle for Zur is over." For a second the two zebras stared at each other, the exhaustion of weeks of too little sleep suddenly washing over them. The major gave a toothy grin. "Right, now go get that out across the city, tell the civilians they can come out again." The corporal saluted and went off, giving the major a minute to readjust his uniform. And to take a generous sip of rum.\n\nColtva Square, its name a reminder of Zur's ancient history, lay in ruins, but general Monzano had insisted on coming as soon as the coast was clear. Major Pazeb was showing her around, but his vivid retelling of the battle, of the gas attacks and the masked freaks, glanced off of her. The unmistakable air of rum just made her mind wander to Zarishat. However, excited waving by the major snapped her out of her daydream and she followed his hoof up to the ornamental houses, where a mare peeked out of a window cautiously. Monzano cringed as Pazeb shouted at the top of his lungs. "The general! Monzano is here! Come out!"\n\nMore black and white dots started to appear in shattered glass windows and then flags. Flags of Colthage, flags of Zur, anything festive the zebras had left. A few minutes later, before Monzano even realised it, a crowd had formed around her, waving flags and singing songs. The mayor declared Monzano an honorary citizen on the spot. The people called her the Coltvan Hero and compared her to Sufrits of old. An elderly zebra said she had the likeness of Zanit, which caused the crowd to proclaim her the Protectress of Zur.\nMonzano could feel her weary heart grow a little lighter. Maybe she could do this after all."

They are using gas." Tears welled up in the major's eyes, and he was unsure if it was sadness or chemicals causing it. He slammed down the radio and quickly tied a piece of cloth over his muzzle. Dozens of frightened eyes stared at the major as he grasped his revolver, his eyes still tearing. "Command has given up on Zur." Gasps and cries, morale about to break. Pazeb looked at the two flags still flying in the centre of the City Hall. The flags of Colthage and Zur, next to each other. In a fit of desperate rage, the major grabbed the Colthaginian flag and threw it down. Then he took the flag of the old mother Zur and drew his revolver, crying out. "Colthage has betrayed her, but we will not abandon her!" Cries of support and growls came from the soldiers beyond hope.\n\nThe grim motivation of betrayal caused them to spring into motion. Munition distributed, bayonets fixed, as the gunfire and screams drew closer. The civilians, especially non-zebras, were hidden in the back as the Pazeb's zebras fortified the city hall as best they could. Then a loud boom cracked the ancient door. Another one sprang it open and masked zebras stormed the breach, appearing alien despite being kin. The major wove the flag, steeling the defenders. "Defend Zur! We will not abandon her!" Bullets raced past his ears into the flag, as more and more of his comrades fell.\n\nAfter an hour of fighting, the major was pushed back into the command room, and as zebras barricaded the door, the radio light blinked once again. The major picked up. It was the general: "How is it going major?"\nPazeb's heart was filling with contempt for Monzano and Colthage. "It is over. Zur has fallen."\nA tiny pause on the other side. "I did all I could."\n"Zur will not forget this. Curse this Covenant. And Zargon take you!"\n\nMonzano could hear a bang followed by shouts and gunshots. The Star Father had taken Zur and its people. A final shot took out the radio, cutting the general off from the city for the final time."
colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.3.d2:0 "A steady stream of refugees and soldiers rushed east to Colthage from the city of Zur. The night sky was illuminated with fires and a thick cloud of unnatural smoke hung over the city. Major Pazeb and a few others stood on a hill overlooking the fallen city. The major held the city flag tight, fighting his tears. "I thought. With the reinforcements. Maybe we could hold the city."\nOne of the other zebras spoke, she was a member of the Sacred Band, clad in immaculate white. Her voice was calm, despite the carnage. "We have saved the lives of many still, major. Aztarte has smiled on us."\n"Aztarte would enjoy the world balanced on a knife's edge." The major replied, his eyes still fixated on Zur.\n"That is the fate of those who fight." The zebra commented stoically.\n\nThe light on the radio started blinking and the major quickly responded. "This is Major Pazeb. Outside Zur."\n"Yes general, we have evacuated... As many as we could, but we had to retreat or lose all of our forces."\n"It... does not look good ma'am. If I had to describe it is as if unholy fires are cleansing Zur of all that was good and beautiful. I think this Covenant wants to root out any resistance before it even formed."\n"We will cover the civilians' rear guard, general. Over and out."\n\nA Coltvan soldier spoke up. "How is Monzano doing?"\nPazeb averted his gaze, turning to face Colthage. "I think she also expected she could hold the city. It is a lot to process."\n"I can't imagine this happening to Kizil-Zeb..." the Coltvan muttered. To which Pazeb gave a slight smile, looking over the stream of refugees. "Then we hold them at Colthage, my friend. Never another Zur."\nThe rest of the little group nodded and muttered the words back, none as confident as the major in Colthage's final victory."

She could do this. After all, she had been the one to save Colthage from the precipice of doom during the civil war.\n\nShe breathed in deep, and took her first step up. The moment the crowd saw her, cheers erupted, nearly startling her. She had never imagined she would one day vow to the Pantheon, but here she was, a beacon of hope for not only the hundreds of citizens in front of her, but to every Colthaginian. It was overwhelming.\n\nTaking another deep breath, Monzano closed her eyes for but a moment, before silencing the crowd with a wave of her hoof. "Today, in this great city, we will witness the beginning of new chapter in Colthaginian history: a bright one, free of chaos and civil war. We have survived these blood-stained pages, and I can confidently say that, so long as we stand united, we shall never face such dark times again. From now on, Colthage will never fall to any of her enemies.\n\n"However, I must also be honest with you all: while many see me as a hero, I am nothing more than a zebra thrust into this position by chance, or perhaps fate. I cannot promise to be your saviour, and never before did I think I that would one day be the ruler of this land, that I would one day be your Sufrit. The civil wars uprooted each of our lives, and I have seen wives lose their husbands, parents lose their children, and zebras lose their homes to the war.\n\n"When Zarishat left, I stayed. Not because I wanted to rise above you, but because I am the same as you, because I was born in the same land as you, and because I share the same blood as as you. I merely didn't want to see my home destroyed, or my compatriots massacred."\n\n"It is true, my brethren, that after so much turmoil we can perhaps no longer truly believe in anything, but though we have lost much, we have yet to lose the gods' greatest gift.

Therefore, for a better Colthage, we must bring about change. we must bring about democracy, and liberty. we must abolish slavery. we must allow for the equal distribution of education, health care, and welfare resources in society. We must learn from the failures and tragedies of the past.

The carpet, stained red with the blood of countless soldiers who had shed over the years for wars, could stretch from here all the way to Trotkat. Though, the dust on it also showed the unfortunateness of the Zarca family in the past few years, they had gone from being the supreme ruler to a prisoner, and then back again, this kind of upside-down might have taken several centuries, but everything had happened quietly and quietly in these few years.\n\nThe butler pushed open the door to the parlor. Zalathel Zarca was already sitting at the table waiting for her, a huge portrait of the once-famous ruler Zamilcar Zarca hanging high on the wall behind Zalathel. Basically, all the recognizable names in Zarcids politics were here; Zago Zarca, Zasdrubal Zarca, even Zaphod - how could Monzano have expected that this renown Harmonite Leader would be willing to stand with her brothers who have huge divergence with her, perhaps the war really had changed a lot of things.\n\n"Monzano!" Zalathel smiled at her, "Oh, I guess I should call you Sufrit now? Anyway, the damn war has finally stopped, I'm glad to see Colthage united again, the god-cursed Constitutionalists and Zarishat nearly ruined it once, I hope in your hooves, we won't be heading for a fourth civil war."\n\nMonzano sat down at the conference table and scanned the four Zarca family members. "In any case, members of Zarca family, peace is indeed a thing to be celebrated, striving for it may be hard, but maintaining it is even harder. The people of Colthage have placed their trust in us, and I must remind you of one thing, ladies and gentlezebras in the room - the future of Colthage will depend on us, whether we come out of the abyss or push it into the flames. "\n\n"Don't worry, Monzano," Zalathel assured with a pat on the back, "Zarca family may have screwed up politics before, but we know how to return the favor. We're comrades in arms, and I'm afraid that without you, this house would have been burned down long ago by those lunatics of Starites. You'll have the support of the Zarcids. You know, I can't lie to my father's face, " Zalathel gestured to Zamilcar's portrait behind him, "I'm sure if he were here in person, he'd be as supportive of you as I am, for no other reason than the fact that you're one of the few zebras in the country who wants to take it out of the fire instead of pushing it in.

colthage_monzano_cabinet.2.t:0"Meeting with the Constitutionalists"
colthage_monzano_cabinet.2.d:0""Keep in mind, madam," Zenut Zaranzid, the leader of the Constitutionalists stood at the conference table talking, "what is called democracy is actually rules, there must be rules to frame the government and there must be rules to frame the people. With order we have democracy, only by the Constitution is perfected and enforced we can have power vested in its true owners. Not like Zamilcar Zarca, who may have brought stability, but was reviled and ended up destroying the Republic, and all the actions and claims the Constitutionalists ever made were based on that idea."\n\n"Of course." Monzano couldn't interject, so she had to respond with a few perfunctory words. It to brought back memories of her time in the Revolutionary Army, and where had the so-called order gone when they had assassinated Zeshmunazash Zeirutid?\n\n"The Constitutionalists have been fighting for the democratization and liberalization of Colthage since the first civil war, and I'm glad that there are still sane zebras like you in what is now. However, if you are not clear about the line of democratization and liberalization, all our efforts will be in vain, do you know Zidon? Zannido 'Bandolier' Zidon?" He asked as if he were an elder teaching his juniors, and then immediately continued, "That rogue bandit, some zebras say he fought for liberty, but what did he do besides burning and looting? If democracy means handing over power to the rogues, the thugs, the poorest peasants, or groups of scheming laborers, then democracy accomplishes nothing, but is only responsible for pushing Colthage into another civil war."\n\n"Maybe it's a good idea to start by amending the Constitution," Monzano nodded, "Slavery is not a good thing."\n\n"...And we can't let the Constitution be manipulated by poverty and evil. We have to make law and rule stand for justice and bring democracy, we can't let one Sufrit rule the country like a king." Zenut Zaranzid nodded, "Our thought alike, madam, the members of the Constitutionalists will always be on the side of democracy, as long as "that democracy" doesn't turn into a tyranny or a playground for other zebras.""

colthage_monzano_cabinet.3.t:0"Meeting with the Harmonite"
colthage_monzano_cabinet.3.d:0""This is not just about ideals," Jezabzella Zeshmid said firmly to Monzano, "All ideals are meaningless if they are not put into practice. Our government becomes an empty shell, a deceiver and a demagogue, and loses the meaning of its existence."\n\n"But given the situation in Colthage, we may have to weigh ideals against reality in its implementation," Monzano said with some hesitation. She recalled that Zeshmid had supported the strategy of protecting Zur in the 3rd civil war. In pre-war politics, she had made a name for herself with consistently bold and radical civil rights reform initiatives. This idealist's views have apparently not changed because of the ongoing upheaval of recent years. Among Monzano's cabinet, the Harmonite have been in an awkward position; it's not untrue that they share Monzano's views conceptually, but their idealism has sometimes cost Colthage heavily. Perhaps this was the misery that idealists could hardly escape. Monzano sighed silently and looked directly at Zeshmid.\n\n"Do not let hesitation interfere with your judgment, Sufrit." Zershmid shook her head, "The value of idealism lies in consistency, otherwise we are no different from centrists or even conservatists, and I know that many people have told you that Colthage was destroyed by reckless idealism. Big mistake. It was these conservatives who hindered and delayed the innovations of the idealists that brought Colthage into deep chaos and the abyss. Hesitation is the culprit that kills all idealists, and we must not compromise or pause in our actions. The ancient Wingbardy proverb says that 'Let justice be done though the heavens fall'. We can never afford another civil war, but we must do the best we can. And I am duty-bound to do so, Sufrit, please don't worry about being alone; I am willing to walk with you on this right path.""

colthage_monzano_cabinet.4.t:0"Meeting with the Neutrals"
colthage_monzano_cabinet.4.d:0"Despite their positions of power in the government, Monzano had never heard of Azizelqart Zahummid or Zarani Za'alyon Zarra as any important clique members. Zahummid only listens to the Zebra who leads Colthage. He held the position of Minister of Economy since the time of Zarishat. Zarani had held the administration of Colthaginian diplomacy for decades, and it would be a great loss to Monzano personally and to Colthage as a whole if she squandered the opportunity to work with them in the new government. \n\n"Let's talk about the Colthaginian economy first, Sufrit."Zahummid took a notebook from his cloth pocket," To anyone who wants to know the economic situation of Colthage today. My honest advice is never even curious about it. Currently, after the ravages of three civil wars, we are in a bad state, with industries dying, transportation cut off, many cities empty due to war, bullets and gunpowder polluting Colthaginian land, water, and the remnants of a once-slave economy still poisoning our present and future. I must say, we have a long way to go."\n\nMonzano turned an inquiring eye to Zarani. The elder diplomat gazed at her with a calm, cool gaze, as formidable as an eagle's view from the top of a mountain cliff. Then, in a low voice, the old lawyer and diplomat replied.\n\n"If you ask me, the only thing I can tell you is Colthage needs to be saved, right now." Zarani spoke word by word, "Corruption, injustice, chaos, backwardness and evil have taken deep root in this land. Things are quite bad, ma'am. and right now, ideals and hope can no longer be the cure for Colthaginian's persistent illness, it needs, and must be saved. I suggest that you, in Sufrit's position, begin to act immediately by signing bills to develop the economy and reform society. Colthage has survived the war with Wingbardy, no enemy can destroy this great civilization, and it will not be defeated by itself. May the gods bless Colthaginian."\n\n"Very good, gentlezebras," Monzano nodded, "History has its eyes on us now."\n\nThey looked at each other and smiled, then said in chorus. "I am at your service, Sufrit, for a better Colthage.""

colthage_monzano_cabinet.5.t:0"Meeting with the Scientifids"
colthage_monzano_cabinet.5.d:0"Scientifids.\n\nMonzano didn't have much favor with these technocrats; on the one hoof, most of them were involved with Gerza in the 3rd Civil War, and on the other hoof, the First Civil War, too, broke out because the promotion of these very same technocrats. But, in any case, after the civil war, some members of the Scientifids still expressed their willingness to cooperate with the government, and their theories on social governance could undoubtedly show the way for Colthaginian's emergence from the decay. Monzano sincerely hoped that they had indeed come with good intentions. Baltazar Zakbar and Innalas Ahutzam, two representatives of the Scientifids in the government and the navy, are led by the steward to her. And she clearly saw the excitement in their eyes. \n\n"It is an honor to work with you, Sufrit," Zakbar nodded slightly, "Only the power of science and theory can save Colthage and change its backwardness from its roots. You have placed your trust in the Scientists, and we shall repay your favor. Before that, however, I wish to prove my worth." He smiled a bit and pulled a thick pile of documents out of his briefcase, handing them to Monzano, "These are reports of corruption in government departments before the first civil war, statistically, at that time, at least a third of our government spending evaporated in such backroom dealings. And if we wish to create an efficient government, we must effectively limit liberty in terms of bribery and corruption. and kick them out of Colthaginian politics once and for all; only then will the persistent problems of Colthaginian politics be completely eliminated."\n\nAhutzam echoed, "It is this corruption that has made it difficult to develop and maintain public services in Colthage, and during the rule of the Zarca family, health is difficult to practice in the vast remote areas of Colthage. And among the military, especially within the naval system, corruption and bribery are commonplace. So Colthaginian's once proud navy has declined in a desolation of discipline and outdated equipment. So, Sufrit, we have only one suggestion - corruption must be eradicated, or any endeavor will fail at least."\n\nMonzano smiled in relief; at least, these zebras who had once turned Colthage upside down were now actually looking out for Colthaginian tomorrow, whatever their intentions."
colthage_monzano_cabinet.5.a:0""We must snuff out corruption at the very beginning of the new government!""
colthage_monzano_cabinet.5.tt:0"§RHowever, as it has been said before, "Corruption is the lubricant of Colthaginian politics..." §!\nWe will receive the leader of the £CTH_MZO_TEXTICON_scentifid §2Scientifids Baltazar Zakbar and Innaras Ahutzam§! into §gthe Cabinet§!."

colthage_monzano_cabinet.6.t:0"Meeting with the Militarists"
colthage_monzano_cabinet.6.d:0"And finally, the Militarists.\n\nThe Militarists. Monzano murmured the name over and over again. The army had been the sword of Damocles over politics since the dawn of Colthaginian's history. No government had ever been able to survive the opposition of the army, and the Militarists were responsible for the assassination of the leader of the Revolutionary Army, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, which had given her a great deal of headaches in dealing with these warlords of old in their relations with the new government. Although the cliques in the army weakened during the revolutionary period, the Militarists capitalizing on their fame and connections in the army and re-emerged during the political turmoil at the end of Zarishat's reign.\n\nFortunately, Imin Azkan offered her a compromise - an alliance with the Ochzor brothers. as The reputable moderate among the Militarists, Zauro Ochzor had never shown much desire for power, while Zamalad Ochzor had few ambitions and could be bought off with the position. Of course, the help they could bring to the Colthaginian government was considerable, without taking their political influence into account - not only was Zauru widely respected among the military, he had one of the most advanced weapons manufacturing companies in all of Colthaginian to his name, while Zamarad was an experienced admiral who would be greatly dedicated to reshaping Colthaginian sea power.\n\n"...So, gentlezebras, let's put our past differences aside for the moment," Monzano said every word with a respectful caution that made her feel a little sick, "In the future, the Military will be the key safeguard of our regime. I was once an officer like you in the past, and understand that for Colthaginian, the army is the backbone of its stability. Therefore, I plead for your understanding and support. We cannot allow the Colthaginian army to be divided again. It should be the guardian of this land, this country and its ancient, sacred institutions rather than the destroyer."\n\nThe old general Zauru nodded and gave a gentle smile, "Don't worry, Sufrit. None of us want to see another Colthaginian civil war. I've seen enough internecine warfare in my lifetime, and we are willing to work with you to promote the cause of Colthaginian national defense. However, I must warn you of one thing as a senior soldier to you - don't neglect the Army of Colthage because of suspicions against the military; Colthage has been destroyed countless times by self-suspicion, and I hope that you won't make the same mistake again.""

coltahge_monzano_coltva.1.t:0"Two Revolutionaries"
coltahge_monzano_coltva.1.d:0"Dear Ozid,\n\nMy old friend, my former comrade, I hope this letter finds you well, now that peace and tranquility have returned the land of Colthage. It's hard to believe, after all this time... Looking back, the years we spent with Zesh in the LAE seem so distant and in a way wonderful. Back when we followed the same leader, and fought under the same flag, for the same ideals. Times were hard, but we had faith; we believed that, so long as we fought on, victory would come. Reality had other plans, though, didn't it? A bullet shattered Zesh's wish, and Zarishat's betrayal shook Colthage back into strife. I like to think that was when fate chose our paths; I was in the city of Colthage, and you in Kizil-Zeb. To protect what little we still had, we both became the last guardians of the land beneath our hooves. Suddenly, we stood divided.\n\nI know now why you declined my call for help me during the civil war: unlike me, you held onto what remained of Zesh's dreams and efforts, no matter what. Thus, you sat across the border, watching the land of Colthage go up in flames, watching everything you hated burn. The Patricians, the rural guard, the Sufrit who'd ruled Coltva with an iron hoof, and most of all the politicians who did everything they could to stop the land reforms. You were so tired of listening to the city of Colthage tell you what to do, weren't you? You never saw Coltva as part of Colthage, and you never believed a word said by the zebras of this land, especially not after the Zesh's assassination. And when they told you that Zarishat had escaped, and that the revolution was dead, you still refused to give up. You held onto Zesh's embers, even though they would eventually burn you as well. Countless warriors have shed blood for this ideal, but you are determined to preserve it, to make it shine throughout this dark and long night.\n\nI must confess that I cannot match that nobility of yours, dear friend, and though we may disagree on oh-so many things, when it comes to the core of Zesh's legacy, freedom and equality, we were always on the same page. And now that the war is over, I ask you, not as the Sufrit of the Colthaginian Federal Republic, but as your old friend, to please put to rest your suspicions. Let the divisions that have brought this land so much strife come to an end. Together, we can fulfil Zesh's dream, and let freedom and equality flow again in every river and field in the land. Only then, I believe, will his soul rest in peace.\n\nYours Sincerely, Zanit Monzano"

coltahge_monzano_coltva.1.tt:0"§YThe letter takes the wish of peace. Departing for Kizil-Zeb.§!"

coltahge_monzano_coltva.2.t:0 "Leave the Past Behind"
coltahge_monzano_coltva.2.d:0 "To Monzano,\n\nWhat can I even say? That you are as stupid as the constitutionalists? Or should I call you a fool for betting everything on the success of some negotiations? You wrote me this ridiculous letter, calling me a "friend" and a "comrade". What was the point? Who were you even trying to move with your maudlin words? Perhaps the dead Zesh? Not that you traitor have any right to call him that. You and Zarishat have sullied the LAE's honour, and have disgraced Zesh. And yet here you are, calling yourself his successor. You make me sick.\n\nYou said we had our disagreements, but the truth is that I have never agreed with you on anything whatsoever. I predicted you and Zarishat's fall. She was an alcoholic, only ever interested in her own pleasure, and you a mediocre fool who shoved Colthage into the flames. Yes, I stood by and watched, because I was hoping this fire would burn all of you traitors, all you scum who had reduced Zesh to ashes. However, what I didn't expect was for you to crawl out of your grave, a ghost yelling those ridiculous slogans. Unity, democracy, and liberty? Who do you think you're fooling with your lies? Everyone knows that this is nothing but an excuse for your dictatorship! Do you think even your ridiculous "cabinet" really believes that you can save Colthage? Those lackeys are just trying to please you, to climb the ladder, and to stab you in the back.\n\nDo you think you can achieve unity by bringing together traitors, parasites, and scum? Ridiculous! Just look at your cabinet members! The Zarcids are the ones who created this tyrannical country, the militarists and scientfids are little more than bandits—they're the ones who assassinated Zesh! Don't you get it? The harmonists are only compromising; they don't want a real revolution. Just look at the so-called "Home of the Harmonists", Equestria, and how it treats Sevenayans, and you will see they are nothing short of hypocrites. And the Constitutionalists? Just a bunch of new Patricians who want to kill the old ones. And you accept them. Each and every one of them gets to come in and request a meeting with you.\n\nSo, what can I say? What do you expect me to say? There are many vulgarities I could call you, but it's beneath me to resort to petty name-calling for a traiter as vile as you. My only hope is that you die before you can spread your poison, lest future generations to find out that the scorned Zanit Monzano also followed the great Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, only to betray him; to betray him right here on this land where the revolutionaries shed their blood, right here in the city of Kizil-Zeb!"
coltahge_monzano_coltva.2.a:0 "Commander of Liberation Army of the East, Ozid."
coltahge_monzano_coltva.2.tt:0 "§RHe threw down the gauntlet.§!"

coltahge_monzano_coltva.3.t:0"A Friend to a Foe"
coltahge_monzano_coltva.3.d:0"=Monzano shuddered as she clutched the letter of Ozid. Her cheeks twisted together with pain - she just didn't understand, why? Why on earth did all her good intentions end up being repaid with vengeance? She had once thought of Zarishat as her soulmate, but she had ended up leaving her behind and running away without a second thought - well, she was a shitty Zebra.  However, now, even Ozid rejected her goodwill coldly. They were once comrades who fought side by side under the deadly risk! He mocked her ideals, and denigrated her past - but why? Why was he giving up this chance for peace right in front of him, wasn't this the unity and peace that Zesh wanted?\n\nMonzano wiped the tears from her own eyes and set the reply letter aside, re-pulling a sheet of letterhead from the drawer. That's what Zesh did, wasn't it? For the sake of peace, he was able to sacrifice his dignity and commit himself to negotiating with the constitutionalists, even risk his life rather than allow the tragedy of civil war to happen again. If he can, why can't I? The tip of her pen trembled as she painstakingly wrote the words "Dear Ozid" neatly on the paper. A wave of sadness rose up in her throat. What should she write in this letter? What do I have to do to satisfy you? Through her tearful eyes, she gazed at the blank piece of paper for a long time, until a tear slipped down her cheek and soaked the paper. The paper was ruined. A voice whispered in her ear. It was time to write the lame and disgusting greeting "To Ozid" all over again.\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut as a fiery rage surged up her spine. "Damn! Ozid! Go hell you!" She violently tore the letterhead in her hooves to shreds, cursing Ozid's indifference and betrayal into the office air. Then, taking a deep breath, she slowly picked up the phone and dialed the number for the office of the Minister of War, Zauro Ochzor. Well, Ozid, Monzano clenched the her teeth. If negotiations and friendship are worthless to you, then I'll see you on the battlefield!\n\nGood luck, Commander of Liberation Army of the East."
coltahge_monzano_coltva.3.a:0"And so the Coltva War begins."
coltahge_monzano_coltva.3.tt:0"Due to the §Rmutual suspicion§! between §CMonzano§! and §GOzid§!, the §RColtva§! would §Ragainst§! the §0Colthaginian government§! once again. §RAnd the Second Coltva War had officially begun!§!"

coltahge_monzano_coltva.4.t:0"The so-called "friendship"
coltahge_monzano_coltva.4.d:0"=Monzano sat behind her desk at the War Command, reading the battle reports from the front lines with satisfaction. The battle was going very well, and with the last stronghold of the Ozid rebel forces swept away, the entire region of Coltva had been re-stabilized. Now, it was time to settle some personal grudges.\n\nThere was a clash of chain cuffs from outside the door. Two fully loaded soldiers then walked in, leading Ozid, who was covered in wounds. The zebra was obviously much thinner compared to the last time that Monzano saw him. Monzano stared at the brown uniform he was wearing and couldn't help but feel some sadness in her heart; many years ago, she had also worn the insignia of the LAE and the same less well-fitting uniform. However, many years ago they would never have imagined such a dramatic day in any case.\n\n"Is there anything else you wish to say, Ozid?" Monzano nodded at him stiffly. If this zebra couldn't learn to respect the kindness of others, then he deserved nothing more than this cold greeting from her.\n\nA grin appeared on Ozid's dusty cheeks, "What I wanted to say to you was already written in the letter, and I don't mind saying it again openly in front of your peers: you bitch, and now - there's one more of me who can come into your room!"\n\n"Oh, Ozid," Monzano sighed, "how did we get to here? I know you don't like Zarishat, that's true, there is plenty of zebra who don't like her. But do you think this is how Zesh would like to see it end? Two members of the LAE ending up killing each other out of suspicion?" Monzano waved a hoof, signaling the two guards to withdraw, then, unclasping the military insignia from her own sleeve. She placed it on the edge of the table, "We all understand one thing, Ozid, that the only way to defeat an invincible foe is to use friendship as a weapon, and then- " Monzano gestured to the insignia, "Figure it out, Ozid."\n\nWith that mocking grin still on his face, Ozid spat viciously at the military insignia.\n\n"Then we are done." Monzano shook her head, understanding that friendship was often difficult to work with, which was why there were always so many unbeatable enemies in the world. However, speaking of friendship, she did come up with a very black humorous idea..."

They may change and adapt, but eroding them is non-negotiable.\n\nThis leads to what the "§Ydemocratic bloc§!" of Colthage stands for: the freedom to vote for the best representative of the country, buttressed by a government run by down-to-earth common sense, not washed away by the tide of revolution or reaction. Rabble-rousers from across the political aisle, who vow a sweeping change of the entire Colthaginian order, don't know that they're asking for a §Rfourth civil war§!, unable to accept that progress must be moored into something stable, something familiar, something that can be relied on as much as §Ycreatures rely on the sun appearing the next day§! - and if this system of democracy can be proven tried and true, the rest of the world may benefit from having a taste of good, stable governance.\n\nTame politics, rational debate, everyone peacefully involved in their civic duty as a united people: it may be a boring paradise to the §Ofirebrands§!, but it is a §Yparadise§! we can realistically build."

True liberty is something worth fighting for, and while a democratic system is a beneficial means to obtain it, it is by no means perfect, for it takes a few insidious souls to pervert the whole system and transform it into backwards §Rdespotism§!. Or does it even need that? Many Colthaginian traditions and presumptions are themselves unfit for a free society, and a reactionary candidate need only to appeal to the unenlightened masses to drag the country back to the §Rprevious millennium§!. If democracy can be gamed, then Colthaginians must be free to reshape it into something that represents them better - and in the meantime, that means the Hero of Colthage, §CSufrit Monzano§!, shall keep marching on as a lighthouse of freedom, with all the power that the old radicals and revolutionaries never had to enact their dreams with.\n\nWhile it is true that Monzano may have to wrestle with the very government she fought to establish in the first place, Monzano - or at least her more revolutionary allies - recognize that liberty can never be muzzled.

The more power given to her, the more she can §Ccut through§! whatever §Rpolitical obstacles§! may stand in Colthage's path to freedom, like §gforcing an act to pass through the assembly§!. This, however, has the obvious drawback of making herself look very much like the §Rauthoritarians§! she claims to be fighting against, and the harmonists and democrats of the world may not take too kindly to that §Rhypocrisy§!.\n\n§rCurrent Authority of the Sufrit§!: §Y[?MZN_AOS_var]§!"

But not everything is up to Monzano alone."
MZN_PJDI_solidarity_within_reformist_frame_tt:0 "§YSolidarity within the Reformists§!\n\nTo reform is to agree on two things: that the present state of affairs is no longer satisfactory, and that every creature must strive to forge a better future. What that future may be, however, §Risn't so easily agreed upon§!.\n\nIn this way, the Reformists are saddled with the issue of having to figure out what vision of reform—of the §Cideal Colthaginian society§!—can everyone uphold (or at least compromise with). If they haven't figured it out and are reduced to mere bickering, then their §Gpolitical capital§! is §gmoot§!: §Yperfect§! if Monzano's own vision of the ideal Colthaginian society enshrines §Ydemocracy above all§!, as they won't be able to sully the constitution.

MZN_PJDI_balance_within_conservatives_frame_tt:0 "§gPower Balance within the Conservatives§!\n\nWhen Monzano strung every significant political party into her regime, that meant bringing the §YConstitutionalists§! and §2Scientifids§! along for the ride—two organizations that, while clearly not fans of having Zalathel Zarca as sufrit, still believe that Colthaginians should §gwalk down the way§! of life they've had since long before the Zarcas came to power. In other words, they form the §gconservative§! bloc in Monzano's government, though their right-wing leanings does not mean they detest §Ydemocracy§!. Far from it.\n\nBut in this big tent coalition, §gconservatives§!, too, are not free from debate. The §2Scientifids§! are rational to a fault, believing that the scientific model is applicable to an entire government and that only the purest samples—those without graft nor §Rcorruption§! in their hearts—can be the oil to this perfect political machine. Should they gain control over conservative discourse, then Monzano will have a powerful ally in rooting out said §Rcorruption§! from the nooks and crannies of her rule. The §gConstitutionalists§!, on the other hoof, avoid the term "§Rcorruption§!" in favor of "§ginformed democracy§!." Behind their "§Oliberty-speak§!" lays a tacit admission of promoting a developmental oligarchy, of cliques and elites who nevertheless have their hooves on the pulse of the average zebra. Pining for the §gold Colthaginian Republic§!, they will be §Raverse§! to any form of §Yanti-corruption§! since they believe it to be rooting out capable lords hailing from legacies of hometown rule—and they can be used to Monzano's benefit should the Constitutionalists get the upper hoof.\n\nOf course, should the conservatives remain mostly §geven§!, then they will be in lifeless §Rdeadlock§!, of no §Yuse§! for—or no §Rthreat§! to—Monzano."

Whatever actions the Sufrit and her interim cabinet takes will be §Ojudged§! by fellow republics and democracies as well as other countries. Even monarchs and despots understand hypocrisy, and should Monzano, in the name of democracy, turn back on that very same ideal, what else will she §Rbetray§!? The inverse, of course, is true: should Monzano stay true to freedom's call even when the going gets tough, then those same §Rdictators§! will at least harbor begrudging respect for her integrity, and international leaders around her will breathe a sigh of relief that, perhaps—at last—Colthage may truly be back as a §Cfriend§! on the world stage. \n\nThe following §Cactions§!, among others, will likely influence our §CInternational Reputation§!:\n\n - §YProviding help to other countries.§!\n - §YStanding up for other democracies to resist or prevent military invasions.§!\n - §Y Being competent yet cordial in conducting diplomacy.§!"

(or even just the threat of it) with other nations. \n\nWhile one may question the logic of getting one's hooves dirty in global affairs when civilians on the ground are busy picking up the pieces from their latest civil conflict, it's not without reason. A weakened Colthage is a Colthage ripe for the picking like sharks smelling blood in the water. Waving guns and soldiers at any threat to liberty, however, will at least ward her enemies off in the short term, with the hope that over time, this display of power in the midst of reconstruction will convince (or coerce) both §Cfriends§! and §Ofoes§! to bend to the will of a free Colthage people. \n\nIt is not on lost on observers, though, that the threat of an §Rawfully powerful executive§! with her hooves on an allegedly free republic is a dangerous irony. \n\nThe following §Cactions§!, among others, will likely influence the image of §RInternational Menace§! we pose to the rest of the world:\n\n - §OLaunching military operations.§!\n - §OFurther empowering the executive branch and the capacities of the Sufrit.§!\n - §OTaking an aggressive approach in conducting diplomacy.§!"

Fear. Despair. Three feelings that all Colthaginians have experienced in recent years.  When the Constitutionalists rose in revolt, no one imagined that their ideals would crumble so quickly. The same way that no one imagined that the revolt in Coltva would have turned into a bloody civil war... or that said war would prove to only be the beginning of the end. As Zarishat's regime collapsed, and the third civil war drove the devastated country to the brink of extinction,  strangely enough, in the city of Colthage, people still clung to a last hope. \n\nWhen Monzano declared an end to the state of emergency, they looked up to see the first rays of dawn piercing the hazy, distant sky. \n\n§YAfter the end, there will be a new tomorrow.§!"

While she is generally seen as a lady of high society, unsuited for wartime, Jezabzella intends to prove to Monzano that when needed, she can bring the heat to the war room just as much as the dance floor."
CTH_MZN_Zalathel_Zarca_idea_desc:0 "Zalathel Zarca, once the most powerful Zebra in Colthage, thrown out of his seat of power by the Constitutionalists, has been on the sidelines for too long. He has wept watching his nation suffer under incompetent regime after incompetent regime, and while he always plotted his return, he never expected it to come so soon. Upon receiving Monzano's invitation, Zalathel flew into a flurry of action, bringing his siblings together and returning to his homeland with any supporters he still had, ready to retake his nation from insanity. And hopefully to one day be again on top."
MZN_Imin_Azkan_idea_desc:0 "Imin Azkan is... an oddity within Monzano's war cabinet. A minor patrician and a former member of Colthage's lower house during the Zarcid years, his inclusion in government came about after he assisted the government in fundraising efforts at the beginning of the civil war and met Monzano in the process. If you look a bit further in the past, one could find Azkan's numerous treatises on what he thinks Zarcid foreign policy should be. Books and papers that Monzano has taken a keen interest in as she looks towards the post-civil war period. His connections smoothing tensions over other patricians don't hurt his case either."

CTH_ZANIT_MONZANO_DESC:0 "The savior of Colthage; the dictator of democracy. A conservative's socialist, yet the LAE's traitor. Rumors whirlwind around the mare that heads the city. If you ask her who she thinks she is, she'll bitterly smile, then talk about something else. \n\nA zebra from backwards Kizil-Zeb, Monzano was tired of endless farm work, longing to escape with good grades and a university with the only other friend that'd felt this way: Zarishat. Monzano soon graduated with a perfect performance and hurried to the city of Colthage for college before realizing she'd lost her certificate and luggage on a departing train. A harsh life of rejection afterwards led her to the military academy where she contemplated the corruption that festered underneath Colthage's proud legacy. This ignited disgust within her, aware of the misery and suffering that surrounded her, so upon finishing her studies, Monzano returned to Kizil-Zeb where she promptly joined the Liberation Army of the East—where Zarishat could be found. Nights of drinking with her over mutual failed dreams—Zarishat ranting about what the party her brother left behind and Monzano grousing about the moral wreck that was this world—were oftentimes her only source of comfort. \n\nThen one day, Zarishat fled. Colthage soon descended into its third civil war, and it was while Monzano was watching this chaos that she sobered up and found out what she really desired above all: stability. Just stability—anything to fix Colthage, anything to fix her miserable life. While she'd been infinitely better at managing soldiers than an entire nation, her calls of freedom and democracy made her the best choice in the conflict compared to a lying general and a genocidal maniac. Now, as the only zebra who can bring everything back to normal, she is determined that, this time, Colthage will neither be let down nor be deserted. For every dashed hope of theirs, she must carry to the very end."

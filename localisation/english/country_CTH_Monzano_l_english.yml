CTH_MZO_fortify_the_east_desc:0 "The Star Father cannot be allowed to decimate the citizens of Zur, we will hold onto the region with everything we have and defeat him with our full might. To do this, we must fortify our border with Gerza in the east so Colthage is not threatened."

CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank:0 "Reinforce the Bagraza's Bank"
CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank_desc:0 "The Eastern bank of the Bagraza is an amazing defensive position that we cannot sacrifice by trying to hold onto Zur. We shall hold this position while we wear down and defeat Gerza's forces, then we shall turn and destroy the Star Father and his cult."

CTH_MZO_mobilise_zur:0 "Mobilize Zur"
CTH_MZO_mobilise_zur_desc:0 "Zur is not a state of military industry, but what we need now is guns and bullets, not fish and civilian goods. The industry in the state shall be converted to suit the needs of its own defence."

CTH_MZO_second_plan_of_zapsa_desc:0 "The zebras of the west must be promised hope, a new dream like that of Zanno Mzelqatid all those years ago. There shall be a new plan of Zapsa, not one for land reform, but one for revolution and the destruction of the Star Father."

CTH_MZO_righteous_fury:0 "A Holy and Righteous Fury"
CTH_MZO_righteous_fury_desc:0 "The faith of the Star Father is madness incarnate, his words flow like venom and poison our citizens. We must take the moral high ground in this fight against true evil, let it never reign."

CTH_MZO_at_all_cost:0 "At All Cost"
CTH_MZO_at_all_cost_desc:0 "Colthage must produce everything we will need for our war against Gerza, so we need to get the economy into fighting shape.

CTH_MZO_colthage_must_survive_desc:0 "The beating heart of our nation must never fall to the rebels. That is why every citizen of our brave city must be ready to give everything for the cause. All for Colthage, for Colthage provides all."

CTH_MZO_deafen_the_blind:0 "Deafen the Blind"
CTH_MZO_deafen_the_blind_desc:0 "Gerza's long communication lines from Trotkat to the front near Colthage must be severed and his forces pushed back. In his current position, he still threatens our exposed eastern flank and his army must be routed."

CTH_MZO_choke_the_traitors:0 "Choke the Traitors"
CTH_MZO_choke_the_traitors_desc:0 "Zeordu was occupied by Staarite forces at the beginning of the civil war, but it holds a strategic position near Gerza's power base in Trotkat. Landing marines there and trying to capture the local towns and cities is essential to our plan."

CTH_MZO_declare_martial_law:0 "Declare Martial Law"
CTH_MZO_declare_martial_law_desc:0 "To protect the people, one must make grave sacrifices. The days of Martial Law must return, the suspension of civil liberties to ensure the survival of the state is needed, and the entire country must be placed at the whim of the army if we are to continue to survive. Hopefully, the people shall forgive us one day."

CTH_MZO_first_servants_of_the_state_desc:0 "We are not alone in our fight against corruption and chaos, there are freedom-loving creatures all across the world, but mainly Kasa, who are willing to turn out and fight for democracy. They may be few, but we thank them all the same."

CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows:0 "From the Shadows"
CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows_desc:0 "We've made contact with resistance elements against the Star Father's rule in the Zapsa region. As the dictator moves his armies closer to Colthage we can assist these elements in making strikes on crucial rail lines that would supply the Covenant's frontlines."

CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy:0 "Colthage's Greatest Legacy..."
CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy_desc:0 "Our navy is our greatest ally in this fight against Tyranny. With many ships docked in the capital at the outbreak of the civil war, Zaphod has been hard at work trying to wrangle the navy in any way she can to further supply and assist our cause. We better be thankful, because without them we wouldn't survive for long."

CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries:0 "Cut the Arteries"
CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries_desc:0 "The rail line running from the Covenant capital in Hippone to Zur will likely be the Star Father's main line of attack towards the capital.

CTH_MZO_seek_international_support:0 "Seek out International Support"
CTH_MZO_seek_international_support_desc:0 "With our government centred in an urban region and with almost no arable land to our name, we've had to come up with alternative solutions to the ongoing famine. Various charities and foreign nations have offered some food aid to us, and it is up to our navy to bring it all home. While we will likely one day need to pay for all of this, for now, it is invaluable to be able to have full stomachs in the city."

CTH_MZO_her_last_friends:0 "...And Her Last Friends"
CTH_MZO_her_last_friends_desc:0 "With the Star Father's professional army and Gerza's mercenaries bearing down on us, we don't just need more and better troops. We need officers to lead them. We've tracked down a few of Colthage's old generals, and it's time to put the nation's last friends to work protecting her."

CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars:0 "The Lifeblood of Warring Nations"
CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars_desc:0 "Weapons and money, we need them both, and we need them badly. No nation can wage war without both, and we are chronically short. The Zarishatian regime had all its reserves stolen and its weapons scattered in rebel territory fighting the same scourges we now battle against. It is a regrettable thing, but we must now beg the people for donations."

CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat:0 "The Race to Trotkat"
CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat_desc:0 "The road to Trotkat is not open, but it is flat! Monzano has experimented with importing old cars and armoured vehicles from Griffonia to form new companies that might be the key to winning our war in the East."

CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The old Zarishatian air force project still has its home in the city of Colthage. Monzano helped the government pioneer it, and so she knows where all the equipment and aircraft are stored. It's time to uncover these planes and put them to work against our enemies."

CTH_MZO_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
CTH_MZO_death_from_above_desc:0 "Loading our soldiers into planes and dropping them on enemy positions in the east may sound like a risky idea, but it's a risk which we need to take to win back our nation."

CTH_MZO_zels_righteous_warriors:0 "Za'al's Righteous Servants"
CTH_MZO_zels_righteous_warriors_desc:0 "The clergy haven't been all that influential in Colthage in recent years, but in these times of complete chaos where each soldier fights for his survival against vicious enemies, some words of encouragement from the priests may be just what we need."

CTH_MZO_a_new_republic:0 "A New Republic"
CTH_MZO_a_new_republic_desc:0 "Colthage has been through a lot of governments in recent years. The Zarcid regime was... middling, the Constitutionalists betrayed the people, and the Zarishat regime brought out the worst in all of us. So where does the nation look to now for inspiration to fight on? Monzano believes there must be a new Republic, a new ideal to strive for, free of the chains of these past failures. A new future for all."

CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope:0 "A Leader is a Dealer in Hope"
CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope_desc:0 "A leader must give their people something to believe in, an idea to strive towards. The Star Father gave them ideas of race and an apocalyptic destiny, and Gerza gave them normality and prosperity. What can Monzano offer?\n\nPerhaps, a new kind of hope."

colthage_monzano_cw.1.t:0 "The Defense of Zur"
colthage_monzano_cw.1.d:0 "The light from the lamp shone over the map as Monzano stared down on it.\n\nZur.\n\nZur. The region between her, and the Star Father. The room looked a mess, with open tins of food and half-drunk mugs of tea strewn about. "I..." Monzano started as her hoof came to a rest on Zur. "I..."\n\n"How is this a question?" Jezabzella exclaimed, "We have to protect Zur from the maniac in the west.\n\n"Aye!" Zalathel shouted, "How can we claim to fight for Colthage if we are going to leave them to his horrors?" he continued.\n\nZaphod took a look at the frazzled Monzano. Hair out of place, and stains on her coat, "We have to retreat. We have not just the madpony but also Gerza out east. We get slaughtered, they march right in and then it's all going to be lost."\n\n"Why don't you ask the would-be victims of four score horrors how they feel about being thrown to the wolves?" Zalathel shot back, "and then also look yourself in the mirror."\n\nZaphold leant in on Zalathel and began to raise her voice "I am plenty capable of it, but I am not going to let some principle of pride destroy what we are fighting for,"\n\n"Why, I should gi-" Zalathel shouted while raising his hoof.\n\n"ENOUGH!" Monzano screamed into the room. "I have made my decision...""
colthage_monzano_cw.1.a:0 "We cannot let our people down once more."
colthage_monzano_cw.1.b:0 "We have to retreat. There is no other way."

colthage_monzano_cw.101.t:0 "The Colonel's March"
colthage_monzano_cw.101.d:0 "As the cadre of soldiers marched into camp, Monzano could not help but be shocked. She had received a radio transmission the previous day from someone who claimed to be Azruzaal Azarago, apparently responding to her call for army remnants to join her. She had thought it a trap and planned as such, but these soldiers marched in uniform columns and wore dress uniforms as they marched, far better dressed than her own ragged soldiers.\n\n"Azruzaal Azarago reporting. At your command General." Monzano wheeled around to the Colonel now standing before her. "Umm, thank you Azruzaal. Report on... where you've been?"\n\n"As you command." Azruzaal took out a journal from his pocket and began reading off his detailed description of the events that had occurred. "At the time of the rise of the Star Father in the west, I was in command of soldiers in Karamane administering engineering projects there. When the Staarites came for us I lead my soldiers deep into the jungles where I established a base of operations. Since then my contingent was mostly on the backfoot but we were able to gleam bits of intelligence that sanity still ruled in the city of Colthage, and that other former Constitutionalists were rallying there under your command. So I picked up my contingent, disassembled camp and set off. I'm ready to fight if you'll let me."\n\nMonzano was blown away, finally some good news. "Of course Colonel, tell your troops to unpack, they get one day of rest then they're off to the front." Azruzaal nodded, and was off."
colthage_monzano_cw.101.a:0 "The army comes marching home."

colthage_monzano_cw.2.t:0 "A Most Painful Choice"
colthage_monzano_cw.2.d:0 "It felt like standing on the scaffold.\n\nWorse perhaps, because at least after the scaffold there would be none on the ground to question her and her actions.\n\nAnd yet, she was to sign her own weapon.\n\n"The proclamation," Zaphod said as she held forth a clipboard with a piece of paper attached before placing it on the table.\n\nMonzano looked it over, martial law, suspension of this and that liberty. All over grain. Grain! Nothing more than grain!\n\n"Anything?" Zaphod carefully asked.\n\n"Yes. I am trying to fight for them and their liberties. Their dreams! Their everything! And I am stuck here as their unwilling punisher," she shouted out into the room, a few loose leaves of paper flying around.\n\n"It i-" Zaphod began before being cut off.\n\nMonzano began falling into a mixture of crying and shouting as she continued on, "Don't tell me it is necessary, I know it is. I know that it's for the greater good, but this is just so much," tears streaming into her coat as she signed it quickly with her pen, "Now take it away from my sight. If I ever see it again, it'll be too early,""
colthage_monzano_cw.2.a:0 ""It's all for the greater good.""

colthage_monzano_cw.3.t:0 "The Valiant Few"
colthage_monzano_cw.3.d:0 "As the soldiers stepped off the boat, Monzano couldn’t put her hoof on the feelings swirling in her soul. These brave few, these old and young, had volunteered to sail all the way from Kasa to serve in her army and defend Colthage. They arrived in fishing boats and trawlers, one by one stepping onto the dock in the Colthage harbour. Their ancestors had not lived here for centuries, but these souls chose to fight. Why??? She was of course grateful for them, but why do they do it? Feeling a tugging in her chest, Monzano began to walk toward the soldiers disembarking from the vessels. Clearing her throat, she awkwardly tried to get the attention of the few hundred soldiers in front of her. \n\n"Attention! Hey! Uhh, excuse me!"\n\nOne of Monzano’s soldiers tapped her in the shoulder and pushed over a barrel from the dock for her to stand on. Monzano thanked him and balanced carefully atop the precarious perch. "Soldiers of Kasa! Thank you all for coming to Colthage’s aid! Your courage is insurmountable in the face of these grave threats to... to umm..."\n\nMonzano felt torn, these stallions and mares deserved more than cookie-cutter nonsense. By now they were all looking at her, and she felt their confusion at her sudden halt. \n\nMonzano sighed and took a seat on the barrel. "I honestly can’t thank you all enough, to be fair I can’t understand why you would all risk everything to come to a land that enslaved your ancestors to fight a war that does not affect you. But thank you for coming to my aid. You all who hold freedom so deep in your hearts. I fight this war because it is a battle for the survival of my people, a selfish war. You fight for the preservation of another people. You are the noble few, and I salute you."\n\nMonzano got off the barrel and stood eye level with the Kasan soldiers, and raised her hoof in salute. One by one, the soldiers returned the salute, and walked over to shake her hoof."
colthage_monzano_cw.3.a:0 "And she never noticed the camerazebra."

colthage_monzano_cw.301.t:0 "The Few Become The Many"
colthage_monzano_cw.301.d:0 "Jezabzella had to push through the crowd to reach the dock this time, everywhere zebras thronged to see what was happening in the port of Colthage. She had heard a commotion outside and rushed to see what was going on, so transfixed was the mob on the disruption that no one noticed one of the General's foremost ministers running beside them.\n\nArriving in the port, Jezabzella could guess at what was causing the crowds. Close to two dozen ships were floating about in the harbour being halted by port authorities. Upon their decks was a cast diverse enough you'd think it was a scene out of Skyfall. Out of the corner of her eye, Jezabzella sighted a few soldiers marching through the crowds and organized herself an escort to the shore. Finally making it through the crowd, Jezabzella dusted herself off, fixed her mane, and tried to get a lay of the situation.\n\n"Mister port guard! What is going on here?" The military police officer blinked a few times, having to centre himself after what was clearly a draining experience. "Well Miss uhh, minister. The ship claims to be full of soldiers wanting to fight in our armies, they keep saying something about a newspaper article? To be honest, I can't understand a bleeding thing, they don't even all speak the same language."\n\nThinking for a moment, Monzano heard a shout in a familiar language from the side of the ship she was closest to, "Excuse me, madam! Are you perhaps Minister Zeshmid?" Facing the ship, Jezabzella saw a griffon wearing a suit and monocle, holding a rifle in claw. "Why yes I am good sir, and I see you can speak Zonician."\n\nThe griffon sighed with relief, "Thank goodness, these port guards don't seem to believe me. My name is Professor Guthart and these fine creatures with me all came to fight for Colthage." By now Guthart had thrown down the gangway and was waddling towards Jezabzella who brushed away the police's attempt to block him. "We read this article in the Griffonian press and simply couldn't stop ourselves. We'd love to fight under the brave General Monzano, if she'd have us, that is."\n\nReading through the article, Jezabzella recognized it for the propaganda masterstroke it was, she didn't even need to lift a hoof to make it happen."
colthage_monzano_cw.301.a:0 ""Oh Monzano will enjoy this...""

colthage_monzano_cw.4.t:0 "Ghosts Of Victory"
colthage_monzano_cw.4.d:0 "As Monzano entered the conference room, she approached the group of commanders huddled around the table in front of her, and grabbed one of them by the collar.\n\n"Ouch! What in the name of Za'al are you doing?" Zalathel Zarca, taken off guard, attempted to protest as Monzano pulled him back. "Zalathel, we need to talk about something." Shrugging, the Zarca patriarch followed Monzano outside the command tent and was faced with two legfulls of documents.\n\n"Where does your sister keep finding these boats?" Monzano stared him dead in the eyes as she spoke.\n\n"I beg your pardon? What do you mean 'find these boats'?"\n\nMonzano dumped the papers out in front of him, "She hasn't been back in port for months, she won't stop raiding enemy supply, lines, I keep telling her we're running out of fuel but she keeps saying she has ways to get more!" Monzano's voice reached a fever pitch as she spoke, "And then three ships sailed into port carrying thousands of guns which is great and all but the problem is I THOUGHT THOSE SHIPS GOT SUNK MONTHS AGO???"\n\n"Monzano! Calm yourself!" Zarca began picking up the papers from the ground. "Well, she is my sister, after all." Seeing his quip not calm the general's mood, Zalathel's tone became more serious, "Look, I've seen the reports, the ships thought the fleet was routed and hid from our enemies, but when Zaphod began her ventures out to sea, they began rejoining the fleet."\n\nMonzano groaned, "If I was half as good at being a general and a statesmare as she is at being an admiral, this war might've been over already."\n\nZalathel chuckled, "Don't worry Monzano, I feel the same.""
colthage_monzano_cw.4.a:0 "The ghost of the Aludian strikes."

colthage_monzano_cw.5.t:0 "A Desperate Address"
colthage_monzano_cw.5.d:0 "Monzano sighed as she saw the light turn on, signalling that the recording had begun. Copies of this speech would go out all across the world, either by radio or hoof. It was her chance to save her starving people. The radio operator flailed his hooves to get her to begin.\n\n"Citizens and leaders of the world. I speak to you in a time of great crisis for my nation. Colthage lies in ruins, fractured by corruption, hate, and lies. The last vestiges of civil government take shelter with me in the city of Colthage. We have soldiers, we have guns, but we lack something essential. Because bandits and cultists have taken control of the countryside, we lack food. I shall be direct, my city is starving, and I am begging the world for aid. I can offer no guarantee of payment, only a promise, as our coffers have been cleaned out by our former tyrant. All I can give you now is my eternal gratitude."\n\nMonzano wiped a tear from her eye, and her voice began to whimper, but only barely.\n\n"Please, help me help my country. We will take anything the world can offer, my people need to eat."\n\nThe light died down, signalling her job was done, and Monzano went off to bed, nursing a hungry stomach as her soldiers ate."
colthage_monzano_cw.5.a:0 "And the world answered with kindness, and with love."

colthage_monzano_cw.6.t:0 "Calling It A Draw"
colthage_monzano_cw.6.d:0 "The tension in the room was... palatable to say the least. Over the past few weeks, more Constitutionalist officers had found their way to Monzano's command and had joined up with her forces. And today was the first meeting of the combined military council, which meant these constitutionalists were now face to face with the zebra they had rebelled against, and that Monzano had a terrible headache.\n\n"You know full well none of this would have happened if you selfish dungtrotters hadn't ruined everything by throwing us out of power! We never would have let Zarishat take over!" Zasdrubal Zarca spat as he invoked the name of the nation's former dictator, and his brother Zago Zarca nodded in agreement with his statement.\n\nZarvad Orzagid looked about to burst, "If you had only listened to the citizens for once instead of that incestuous habit of talking up each other's ideas until you've tricked yourself into thinking you have more than a third of a brain between you all!"\n\nMonzano knew she had to step in, this was going to boil over, she couldn't have her advisors starting conflict within her own camp. But just as she was about to try and restore order in the room, another shout beat her to it.\n\n"Enough!" Zalathel Zarca, who had been quiet for the past few minutes, slammed his hoof on the table. "Zasdrubal, please behave, if Zaphod was here she'd have you in a headlock by now." Zalathel sighed and faced his once-adversaries, "I hold my own grudges against you all as well, Orzagid, Annizalid, Azarago. But we worked together once, before your revolution, and we can do so again. And right now, let us work together in giving General Monzano the floor so she can get us down to business."\n\nMonzano, along with most in the room, sat stunned. Smiling to herself the presiding General thanked Zalathel and began the meeting." #Monzano brings in the officers that she can, maybe mentions a few of the Zarcas? Since everyone in this fucking family is a competent officer.
colthage_monzano_cw.6.a:0 "No further outbursts occurred."

colthage_monzano_cw.7.t:0 "For Those We Have Lost."
colthage_monzano_cw.7.d:0 "The dinner hall was packed with guests, so much so that Monzano could barely move around. This wasn't her scene, and she was not happy to be here, but at least they weren't trying to talk to her. This was a fundraising dinner for her war effort, all the patricians here had paid good money to brag about helping Monzano win the war, and she was hoping they would hand over more by the end of the night.\n\nThe patricians Monzano now mingled with had no love for her, they would sooner thrust the Zarcas back upon the throne of Colthage, but they had signed onto her movement, so the patricians would follow.\n\nLooking towards the ad-hoc stage in the back of the room, Monzano saw who she assumed to be the host hobble towards the podium. Imin Azkan, as she was told was his name, was more a socialite than a true patrician. She had done some digging on him to assume his invitation to this event was not, in fact, a trap. Took a bullet during the storm king invasion, put most of his family's wealth behind the Zarcas, got elected to the lower house of government, hid during the Zarishat period, and now he was in the mood to throw money at her. But as the zebra began to speak about the importance of charity to the state in these trying times, Monzano thought about his other work. His books. Books about foreign policy, books about the glory of Colthage, books about how Colthage could bring democracy to all Zebrica. Monzano doubted his commitments to true democracy, but she would have to send him a letter in the coming days." #Zebra Dugin introduction event. Insert uh ... This: https://youtu.be/WbPUG1MzXp0?t=623
colthage_monzano_cw.7.a:0 "For those we can yet save."

colthage_monzano_cw.8.t:0 "The Zebras Of Za'al"
colthage_monzano_cw.8.d:0 ""Nice to meet you, General!" Imin Azkan stuck out his hoof to meet Monzano and the two of them shook.\n\nMonzano looked around, "Nice to meet you as well Imin, now tell me, why did you decide for our first meeting to be at a temple?"\n\nImin chuckled, "Well to get the blessing of Za'al of course. Come, come."\n\nHurrying her through a set of doors in the temple, Monzano entered the main alter room and saw a collection of priests and a camerazebra. Imin smiled, "I know this is a bit of a rushed meeting, but I think it's good PR for you."\n\nMonzano could feel the eyes of the priests digging into her skin, they knew she worked for Zarishat, and she knew that only Imin was keeping them from hurling a bit more than insults at her. Monzano sighed, "Well as long as we can discuss our business somewhere else after this, I'll do your photo shoot."\n\nImin smiled and stroked his beard as Monzano received the blessing of the priests, and he thought about how great this partnership would be." #Zebra Dugin or some other Zarcid gets Monzano to have the church to help the country. Some sort of medic buff.
colthage_monzano_cw.8.a:0 "What a bunch of Za'alots."

colthage_monzano_cw.9.t:0 "A Reforged Colthage"
colthage_monzano_cw.9.d:0 "As Monzano and Imin Azkan looked down at the table, they shared a moment of silence in a day of cacophony. Azkan broke the quiet with a drag on his cigar, and a simple question.\n\n"So," the advisor began, "what are your plans for how this place will operate after all the smoke has settled? What've we all bled for?"\n\nMonzano didn't move at all as she thought, she stared straight down at the table and let the silence ring for what seemed like an eternity.\n\n"No more dictators, no more corruption, no more... any of that Za'al damned nonsense that caused civil war after civil war fueling blood and death all over. Our citizens deserve better than that, they deserve to live free for once. And I will burn everything Colthage has had before to achieve that goal."\n\nImin took another drag of his cigar, "Well those are some big dreams. I'm in."\n\nThe two smiled and shook hooves again before looking back down to the table, and the new flag that rested on it."

colthage_monzano_cw.10.d:0 "Finally the day had come, Monzano stood upon a great stage in Colthage, surrounded by her friends and advisors. The Zarcas on her left, the constitutionalists and harmonites on her right, and Imin Azkan right beside her, holding his six-year-old colt.\n\nRight when Monzano was about to begin her speech, she paused. She had rehearsed this many many times, ever since she had heard of the rout of the Staarite and Gerzid armies. She never thought the day would come, but here she was. She wished she could pray to thank the gods for this victory, but while she knew they smiled upon her efforts, they were not doing this to save her. They had made this happen to save the nation, she must still pay back her sins.\n\n"Citizens of Colthage! I speak to you today not as General Monzano, head of the provisional government, but as Zanit Monzano, a citizen of Colthage. This war has been long and hard, the odds have long been stacked against us, but our nation and our people never relented. I could speak forever about the costs of war, I could speak on the dead, on the wounded, as there are countless of both, but there is time for mourning, and today I would rather look forward. Today, while I would love to regale you on the changes going forwards, I feel today should be a day of joy, not a day of tedium. Today shall be full of celebrations of joy, as today, brave citizens of Colthage, you have won your freedom! Freedom to live, freedom to love, freedom from oppression and dictators! Freedom, eternal!""

colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.1.d:0 "Army sergeant Xanza lit a cigarette, looking out from the watchtower of the prisoner of war camp near Zoea. From here, the faces of the zebras below were almost indistinguishable, their chatter drowned out by the tune of her radio. But the former policemare knew what they had done. Below there was the scum of Colthage, who had given in to their darkest desires in the pursuit of raw profit or esoteric salvation.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, in the past few weeks, some Gerza’s soldiers had tried to bribe her on five separate occasions to let them out, promising they had no intention to fight for the crooked Coltvan. Not many of them seemed to have any sense of loyalty. Now the Covenant’s zebras were the weird ones. As a rookie, she had once busted down the dormitory of one of these Hipponean students for noise disturbance and found some weird drawings. The chief had told her to drop it, as some rich patrician had taken the case personally. “Well old stag, if you had only known,” Xanza muttered, grinning when the radio’s music stopped.\n\nA familiar voice reached over the radio, seemingly clearing her throat before speaking. “Colthaginians, soldiers, every zebra who has been working towards or hoping for this day, I will keep it short. The last rebel strongholds have been taken, and the government is once again in control of the country.” Xanza’s eyes widened, and she leaned into the radio set, as thousands were doing with her. “No largescale enemy resistance remains. The war is over.” Monzano continued to speak, but Xanza was already climbing down, rushing to tell her comrades. A great sense of relief engulfed the camp, and even on the faces of some of the prisoners, stress seemed to melt away. They had made it. The Republic stood. Battered and bruised, but there it was, there they were. Hope remains."

colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.2.d:0 " The corporal typed diligently on the typewriter in the Zur town hall, and for once, the gentle ticking was the only noise to be heard. Major Pazeb, head of the Zur garrison, dictated: “The Colthaginian army has driven the enemy westward away from the city, and with yesterday’s push, no enemy remains in range to strike at the city.” The commander sighed, smiling and looking out at the morning sun illuminating the bay. “The Battle for Zur is over.” For a second the two zebras stared at each other, the exhaustion of weeks of too little sleep suddenly washing over them. The major gave a toothy grin. “Right, now go get that out across the city, tell the civilians they can come out again.” The corporal saluted and went off, giving the major a minute to readjust his uniform. And to take a generous sip of rum.\n\nColtva Square, its name a reminder of Zur’s ancient history, lay in ruins, but general Monzano had insisted on coming as soon as the coast was clear. Major Pazeb was showing her around, but his vivid retelling of the battle, of the gas attacks and the masked freaks, glanced off of her. The unmistakable air of rum just made her mind wander to Zarishat. However, excited waving by the major snapped her out of her daydream and she followed his hoof up to the ornamental houses, where a mare peeked out of a window cautiously. Monzano cringed as Pazeb shouted at the top of his lungs. “The general! Monzano is here! Come out!”\n\nMore black and white dots started to appear in shattered glass windows and then flags. Flags of Colthage, flags of Zur, anything festive the zebras had left. A few minutes later, before Monzano even realised it, a crowd had formed around her, waving flags and singing songs. The mayor declared Monzano an honorary citizen on the spot. The people called her the Coltvan Hero and compared her to Sufrits of old. An elderly zebra said she had the likeness of Zanit, which caused the crowd to proclaim her the Protectress of Zur.\nMonzano could feel her weary heart grow a little lighter. Maybe she could do this after all."

colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.3.d:0 "Major Pazeb coughed into the radio receiver. “Please, send reinforcements.” The radio creaked. “There are at least a hundred thousand civilians trapped in Zur. They are using gas.” Tears welled up in the major’s eyes, and he was unsure if it was sadness or chemicals causing it. He slammed down the radio and quickly tied a piece of cloth over his muzzle. Dozens of frightened eyes stared at the major as he grasped his revolver, his eyes still tearing. “Command has given up on Zur.” Gasps and cries, morale about to break. Pazeb looked at the two flags still flying in the centre of the City Hall. The flags of Colthage and Zur, next to each other. In a fit of desperate rage, the major grabbed the Colthaginian flag and threw it down. Then he took the flag of the old mother Zur and drew his revolver, crying out. “Colthage has betrayed her, but we will not abandon her!” Cries of support and growls came from the soldiers beyond hope.\n\nThe grim motivation of betrayal caused them to spring into motion. Munition distributed, bayonets fixed, as the gunfire and screams drew closer. The civilians, especially non-zebras, were hidden in the back as the Pazeb’s zebras fortified the city hall as best they could. Then a loud boom cracked the ancient door. Another one sprang it open and masked zebras stormed the breach, appearing alien despite being kin. The major wove the flag, steeling the defenders. “Defend Zur! We will not abandon her!” Bullets raced past his ears into the flag, as more and more of his comrades fell.\n\nAfter an hour of fighting, the major was pushed back into the command room, and as zebras barricaded the door, the radio light blinked once again. The major picked up. It was the general: “How is it going major?”\nPazeb’s heart was filling with contempt for Monzano and Colthage. “It is over. Zur has fallen.”\nA tiny pause on the other side. “I did all I could.”\n“Zur will not forget this. Curse this Covenant. And Zargon take you!”\n\nMonzano could hear a bang followed by shouts and gunshots. The Star Father had taken Zur and its people. A final shot took out the radio, cutting the general off from the city for the final time."
colthage_monzano_cw_untriggered.3.d2:0 "A steady stream of refugees and soldiers rushed east to Colthage from the city of Zur. The night sky was illuminated with fires and a thick cloud of unnatural smoke hung over the city. Major Pazeb and a few others stood on a hill overlooking the fallen city. The major held the city flag tight, fighting his tears. “I thought. With the reinforcements. Maybe we could hold the city.”\nOne of the other zebras spoke, she was a member of the Sacred Band, clad in immaculate white. Her voice was calm, despite the carnage. “We have saved the lives of many still, major. Aztarte has smiled on us.”\n“Aztarte would enjoy the world balanced on a knife’s edge.” The major replied, his eyes still fixated on Zur.\n“That is the fate of those who fight.” The zebra commented stoically.\n\nThe light on the radio started blinking and the major quickly responded. “This is Major Pazeb. Outside Zur.”\n”Yes general, we have evacuated… As many as we could, but we had to retreat or lose all of our forces.”\n“It. . . does not look good ma’am. If I had to describe it is as if unholy fires are cleansing Zur of all that was good and beautiful. I think this Covenant wants to root out any resistance before it even formed.”\n“We will cover the civilians’ rear guard, general. Over and out.”\n\nA Coltvan soldier spoke up. “How is Monzano doing?”\nPazeb averted his gaze, turning to face Colthage. “I think she also expected she could hold the city. It is a lot to process.”\n“I can’t imagine this happening to Kizil-Zeb…” the Coltvan muttered. To which Pazeb gave a slight smile, looking over the stream of refugees. “Then we hold them at Colthage, my friend. Never another Zur.”\nThe rest of the little group nodded and muttered the words back, none as confident as the major in Colthage’s final victory."

CTH_MZN_Jezabzella_Zeshmid_idea_desc:0 "Jezabzella Zeshmid wishes she could have spared Colthage the horrors of Zarishat, but it seems she wept for her brother more than she did. She has returned to the city of her birth to ensure the citizens of Colthage will not suffer any longer under insane cultists or zebras like Gerza who only care for themselves. While she is generally seen as a lady of high society, unsuited for wartime, Jezabzella intends to prove to Monzano that when needed, she can bring the heat to the war room just as much as the dance floor."
CTH_MZN_Zalathel_Zarca_idea_desc:0 "Zalathel Zarca, once the most powerful Zebra in Colthage, thrown out of his seat of power by the Constitutionalists, has been on the sidelines for too long. He has wept watching his nation suffer under incompetent regime after incompetent regime, and while he always plotted his return, he never expected it to come so soon. Upon receiving Monzano's invitation, Zalathel flew into a flurry of action, bringing his siblings together and returning to his homeland with any supporters he still had, ready to retake his nation from insanity. And hopefully to one day be again on top."
MZN_Imin_Azkan_idea_desc:0 "Imin Azkan is... an oddity within Monzano's war cabinet. A minor patrician and a former member of Colthage's lower house during the Zarcid years, his inclusion in government came about after he assisted the government in fundraising efforts at the beginning of the civil war and met Monzano in the process. If you look a bit further in the past, one could find Azkan's numerous treatises on what he thinks Zarcid foreign policy should be. Books and papers that Monzano has taken a keen interest in as she looks towards the post-civil war period. His connections smoothing tensions over other patricians don't hurt his case either."

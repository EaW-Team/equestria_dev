bandit.1.d:0 ""Gentlegriffs.", Blackrock addressed the crowd in what she liked to call the war room, which was really just a spacious concrete box that had a large map of the region nailed to the wall. "As you may know, civil war has been going on for years now in Prywhen, and both sides are using drastic measures to achieve total victory. This means, however, that they are weak, and won't be able to resist if we were to invite ourselves to their lands and do some... Shopping. What say you louts, shall we?"\n\nAs she expected, her griffons promptly started loudly arguing with one another over the course of action, some even engaging in improptu brawls, while others were screaming that the lands of Prywhen were a "Maar-blasted hellhole" that should be avoided at all costs. By the Gods, she hated when they started bickering like chicks. Taking out her pistol, she fired a round at the ceiling, another hole joining the others.\n\n"Quit screeching like immature children and present your opinion in an orderly, nonviolent fashion. Do we raid Prywhen, or not?""

bandit.2.b:0 "We are now strong enough to resist them!"

Members of the Bluecrest dynasty were once loyal servants of the Kings of Griffonstone and have always been friendly with our Prince's house of Whitecrest. We have supplied them weapons and advisors, and in return the Countess has officially proclaimed that she will come to our aid whenever we need it. In return, [LUS.GetLeader] is more than happy to promise the same. Let our houses be united in friendship for centuries to come! Together we will weather any storm."

Morality is a foreign word in these parts, and money is the only emperor here. With the spoils of our plunder, we've arrived here today to acquire modern weapon models... The choice remains in what sort should we look after. Anything can be found here, after all."

The locals were long gone, well, the ones who didn't get shot, anyhow. And now, after a night of stealing othergriffons' hard work, it was time to let off some steam.\n\nBlackrock raised her voice, her cigarette almost up. "We're gonna leave soon, you lousy penguins. The sack of potatoes Griffonstone calls a government might someday will wisen up to our antics soon enough." The griffon looked down, taking in the air of petrol, which had made a nice puddle at her feet, a stream extending towards the few houses that made up this village. "Enjoy the show."\n\nA flick of her talon and the cigarette fell to the ground. A stream of light made its way to the houses and in an eyeblink, the village turned into a sea of flames. Their work in Griffonstone was done."

And the decentralised mess that was her south-western neighbour was unable to coordinate efforts.\n\n"Two-hundred-ninety-four." She said it slowly, chuckling to herself. 294, the amount of independent police departments in Sicameon. Most of the time the policegriffs were too busy with local issues to help each other fight her network of bandits. Of course, the money flowed in. Blackrock dismissed her lieutenant, putting down the paperwork to play with a coin in her talon. Like she always said; It was good to be bad."

Before the local police can make a good case, the griffons fly to the next parish, trusting the rough terrain and our localised administration will make it so we won't follow them. Everytime we get somegriffon to talk about the organisation, they get murdered somehow, indicated that some policegriffs were involved too.

The wilderness has turned into quite the productive enterprise and with some well-placed bribes, the enterprise has managed to elude the authorities. From there couriers smuggled the tablets away on their way to some (un)lucky customer.\n\nOf course the waste for all those products had to be dumped somewhere and Blackrock was certain that in a hundred years, all these chemicals would turn Cyanolisia's forests into a second Scheißwald.

After they could offer nothing but the clothes off their backs and old grain, Ulrich, in a fit of rage, ordered his griffons to slaughter and raze the village to the ground. Afterward, he was strutting around and telling to anyone who listened that they had it coming for being poor."

The guards swear by their lives that no thief got past them, nor did they indulge in vices - but the fact remains that the Wingbardians will be severely displeased if we renege on our deal. Replenishing our stock on such a quick notice will cut heavily into our profit margin."

While their schemes are nothing but a flight of fancy, to say the least, they still contest our rule and rouse the peasants into committing acts of rebellion. Thus, to teach them a lesson, we've raided one of the weaker holds and depleted it of its inhabitants. The late noble was so kind to leave us a large amount of precious stones and ornaments."

Needless to say, while their escapade worked for a few days, after our patrols discovered them they were quickly seized and their puny protection was cut down.

It is, of course, heavily guarded by her most loyal bandits.\n\nAnd yet, this did not deter a flock of foreign criminals who had immigrated here recently. Showing that there is no honour among thieves, these daring griffons have plotted to abscond with the boss' riches for a long time, and last night, their efforts came to success as they stole Blackrock's entire stash of stolen jewelry - which she enjoys taking from those stiff necked nobles - and fled as quickly as they came.

Her followers were dedicated and loyal, for all their vices, and her spoils have been growing ever larger. And yet... she began feeling bored of the conventional extravagance. She's been sitting on her rear for long enough, it's time to do something productive instead of making coin castles or playing Stalliongradian roulette.

bandit.29.d_neutral:0 "In the dark and forested valley of Blackhollow lies the old seat of the County, in an old and dilapitated castle surrounded by a small town. Years ago the surrounding foreboding forests were infested with bandits who prepared occasional raids, but now those same vagabonds occupied the castle itself, having turned it into a ramshackle nest of debauchery and crime.\n\nNow the tables had turned and the nobles themselves prepared in the forest to retake Blackhollow, the former capital. First the town was surrounded with raiding parties emerging from the forest and cutting off any road connections to it, then some cannons were set up on the opposite side of the river. The bombardment began and drove the bandits into the castle, allowing the Countess' griffons to seize the town. The precious castle would not be damaged and was instead left alone. The criminal scum stuck inside would eventually starve and surrender. Countess Cyrille, who had led the attacking forces personally, sat on the old throne of the Bluecrest Counts and almost cried from joy. She was back home."
bandit.29.d_fascism:0 "Blackrock couldn't help but grimace. Here she was, in the same castle where the old nobility once held its last stand. What joy! The Bluecrest brat wouldn't rest until she saw the rebels' wings torn off and Blackrock's torso sailing off some cliff, it seemed, or at the very least until she was killed in a similarly unpleasant fashion. Needless to say, the spirits weren't high that night.\n\nThe bandits had conceded the old capital itself, hunkering down in Blackhollow Keep, corectly believing Cyrille to be unwilling to shell her own ancestral seat.\n\nAll signs pointed to the bandits starving to death under siege. A fortnight tops was Labatouche's projection. The castle, their ultimate prize, was to be their tomb.\n\nBack in the town of Blackhollow, the peasantry rejoiced. They hosted the soldiers at their homes, lauded them as their liberators, worshipped the ground they walked on. Still though, Grandmaster Hakon felt weird. This was a bizarrely low number of creatures to be living in a city this size. Could Blackrock really have left such precious few alive?\n\nHis throat was parted of its jugular before his mind was parted of that thought. The peasants, without warning, began descending upon the same soldiers they'd housed, turning what would be a simple siege into a bloody house-to-house melee.\n\nAs it turned out, Blackrock had ordered the city "evacuated completely" in anticipation of Cyrille's forces... And as the true battle began, the gates of the keep swung open, and the bandits' main fighting force crashed into the disoriented heroes which would never be. The Young Countess would not be coming home that night."

There, they could prepare for their attack peacefully, unseen by Blackrock's scum. A series of surprise raids cut off all roads leading to the town of Blackhollow, and sharpshooters secured the riverbanks, shooting any bandit ships sailing down the river. As Reeve lead his followers to attack the town, the cowardly bandits retreated into the castle, the old symbol of feudal oppression. Reeve immediately ordered cannons to be set up for the complete demolishment of the building. After three days of bombardment, nothing remained except a pile of smouldering rubble and corpses."

bandit.30.d_neutral:0 "The land of Blackhollow contains very little arable land, with most of it being around Lake Murk. Yet even here, perilous marshes are scattered everywhere. The capital of the region, Murkbeak, has grown after Blackrock's wicked reign began and is now the largest town in the country. It is a vile hive of scum and villainy, filled with the worst griffonkind has to offer. While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nThe battle of Murkbeak would be hard, yet if the Countess took it, it would be a great victory that would shatter the morale of the bandit scum. Farmers around the town, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, eagerly joined the Countess when her forces arrived in the region. Soon enough bandit outposts had been destroyed and Murkbeak was surrounded by a large host of angry griffons. Cyrille was confident, but then she saw that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. The battle would be bloody.\n\nThree times the Countess' supporters attacked, and three times they were repulsed. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. Hundreds died, mostly on the Countess' side. It was clear a direct assault could only end in failure, so instead the Countess tried a different approach. In the nearby marshes, packs of Hydras prowled. They could easily regenerate their wounds and did not fear the sound of gunshots. The Countess sent a group of her soldiers to harass and lure the Hydras away from the swamps into Murkbeak. The plan worked and soon the bandits fled in droves as massive hydras tore through their lines, still alive even as some of their heads were torn apart by artillery shells, constantly regenerating their wounds. The rampage lasted for several hours. After the Hydras were finally killed, some by Blackrock herself, it was followed by a swift attack by the Countess' forces. The bandits were utterly defeated and flew away, some being shot in mid-air. Blackrock managed to escape but her own fortress was looted bare."
bandit.30.d_fascism:0 "Somebody had tattled about Blackrock's hoard of glittering gems and trophies, it seems; the Countess was personally leading the assault this time. Credit where credit is due, robbing the leader of the robbers would have easily and depressingly swiftly decapitated Blackrock's authority. Cyrille was proving to be much smarter than your usual trust fund kiddie.\n\nBut this just wasn't a gauntlet you threw down without making things deeply personal.\n\nThe fighting started with the break of dawn. Blackrock herself mounted a desperate defense, with all cards on the table and even all of the "secondhand firepower" fielded, up to and including a Saddle Arabian gold encrusted mortar. Three times were Cyrille's do-gooders repelled before they had enough, and from there they fled into the surrounding marshes, from where they hoped to continue fighting as guerillas. The battle was won, but the war continued."

While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nReeve knew taking Murkbeak from the bandit oppressors would be difficult, at least if they tried attacking from the outside. His scouts reported that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. But an attack from within combined with an attack from beyond would surely crush their defence. He sent griffons to the surrounding countryside to recruit farmers, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, and also sent infiltrators and spies into Murkbeak disguised as criminals. There they told the local enslaved servants and workers that their liberation would come, but only if they took up arms and fought.\n\nWhen Reeve attacked, Blackrock was ready for him. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. But she was not ready for the attack from behind her lines as the proles rose up, armed with tools and stolen guns. She had to split her defence and fight on two fronts, which soon proved to be unwinnable. Nevertheless Reeve's revolutionaries and the rebelling servants took hundreds of casualties and paid dearly. Blackrock herself managed to wound Reeve in the eye with an accurate rifle shot. But soon she realized that the battle was lost and her bandits fled in droves, flying away from the town. She cursed Reeve's name and fled as well rather than fighting to the last. Afterwards Reeve, with a bandage on his eye, raised the red flag of revolution on top of Blackrock's fortress and proclaimed Murkbeak to be the new capital of the commune. Soldiers and rebels alike cheered and celebrated the arrival of equality in Murkbeak."

The minotaurs who had ruled the mountains protested to the Emperor and demanded him to give them back.

Nowadays it was a bandit stronghold where they prepared raids to Cyanolisia and Sicameon.\n\nCapturing Talltower and driving the bandits away from the Creeper Mountains would be difficult, so the Countess picked the finest mountaineers and the bravest fliers from the ranks of her soldiers for a two-pronged assault on Talltower. One company would attack from above, another from the valley below. This plan worked well: As the bandits focused on repelling the mountaineers, they were ambushed from the skies and could not use cover to hide from the sudden onslaught. The castle was taken after brutal close quarters combat, from the top floor to the bottom.

Reeve decided to use his single advantage and attacked from above, leading all his numerous soldiers in a large swarm that blotted out the sun. The bandit sharpshooters on rooftops were shaken, especially when their gunfire did little to stop the attackers. The cloud of revolutionaries descended upon Talltower, slaughtering the outnumbered bandits with ease and besieging the castle.

She organized her finest soldiers into squads of bandit-hunters and trained them to fight with the same guerrilla tactics their enemy used. Then the soldiers were sent out to purge Banditplace. They made sure to only attack during night-time, and use hit-and-run raids to cause as much damage as possible while taking minimal casualties in return. Bandit groups were ambushed in the dales and snipers occupied the peaks. The bandit outposts were burnt and slain foes crucified to set an example.

bandit.33.d_neutral:0 "While most of Blackhollow is very mixed culturally, with Wingbardian, Sicamean and Prywhenian all being spoken, inhabitants of Naniwich strongly identify as Herzlander griffons and are fiercely independent, having been autonomous during the Counts' reign. They put up a stiff resistance against Blackrock before their militias were finally crushed and have been plotting a revolt.\n\nWhen news spread that the Countess' uprising had begun, Naniwich griffons finally put their plans into motion. Bandit garrisons were surrounded and attacked, with many of them being completely destroyed even before the Countess' soldiers entered the region. Then commanders of the two militia forces met and planned a combined offensive against the bandits. In return, Cyrille promised to reinstate Naniwich autonomy. The cooperation proved fruitful as the scattered bandits stood no chance against them. Soon enough Naniwich was free once more."
bandit.33.d_fascism:0 "While most of Blackhollow is very mixed culturally, with Wingbardian, Sicamean and Prywhenian all being spoken, inhabitants of Naniwich strongly identify as Herzlander, and have continuously been a thorn in Blackrock's side. But with Naniwich being on the road to Scheiswald bandit holdings, it became the most patrolled region out of sheer necessity. Fittingly, it was also the most prepared region to repel attacks from the nobles. The bandits systematically went village to village, burning everything in their path so that no meaningful resistance force may arise. By employing ruthless scorched earth tactics and cutting off supply lines leading into Lushi, the bandits were able to starve the knights, and against all odds, prevail."
bandit.33.d_commie:0 "While most of Blackhollow is very mixed culturally, with Wingbardian, Sicamean and Prywhenian all being spoken, inhabitants of Naniwich strongly identify as Herzlander griffons and are fiercely independent, having been autonomous during the Counts' reign. They put up a stiff resistance against Blackrock before their militias were finally crushed and have been plotting a revolt.\n\nWhile inhabitants of Naniwich hated bandits, they did not like communists either, and were hesitant to join them when Reeve launched his northern offensive. Only after the revolutionaries had shed much blood and defeated several bandit outposts and warbands did the Naniwich griffons finally launch their attack. With Blackrock's goons surprised from the flank, they could offer little resistance and were soon defeated. But after the victory Naniwich towns were still very hesitant about letting Reeve's forces come close and after some violent skirmishes Reeve signed an agreement with local leaders that granted them considerable autonomy."

bandit.35.d_fascism:0 "Curiously, the last battle fought wasn't even between Cyrille's knights and the bandit hordes. It was bandits against more bandits. Backstabbing was something of a tradition around these parts, and Blackrock's back had been looking mighty stabbable with the whole 'my half decade legacy just went up in flames' situation on her claws. At least the rug at the opera house didn't need washing anymore. Blackrock hadn't seen it this red since she first took over.\n\nThe final insurgent's head became a cloud of cooling embers at the end of Blackrock's absurd handcannon. At that point, two things became immediately apparent to Gretch.\n\nThe first was that the coup had failed utterly. Trying to double cross Blackrock, even at her lowest point, was like following a bum into an alleyway because he wanted to explain how Grover II was a changeling from the moon. Not worth finding out how the hypothetical ends.\n\nThe second thing she realized was that she was being held a broom.\n\n"Clean all this up, would you?" Said Blackrock, stylishly blowing some smoke off her gun's muzzle. "It was a nice try, but it's time we got back to business."\n\n"Um. Okay."\n\n"Oh, and put the fires out. Smells like a bathroom stall in Tartarus up here."\n\n"Uhm. Boss?"\n\n"Speak."\n\n"Why am I still alive?"\n\nBlackrock choked. She laughed the jovial laugh of a good sport, then gave Gretch a grave side-eye. "When you're in my position, Gretch, you come to appreciate folks who understand the total futility of rebellion."\n\nShe gingerly avoided stepping in any guts on her way to the exit. "Speaking of which, I'm going to go check in on the Bluecrest brat now.""

bandit.36.d:0 "Today a grand coronation took place in the repaired palace of Griffonstone, for the first time in decades. Nobles and commoners alike were invited to the ceremony and a huge crowd gathered both inside and outside the building. When Cyrille Bluecrest arrived, all griffons erupted in cheers for the time of uncertainty, poverty and misery in the ancient home of Griffonkind had finally come to an end. She held a passionate speech promising to be a righteous and strong Queen who would take care of her subjects, both in Griffonstone and Blackhollow, and was then crowned by the Prelate of Griffonstone. The audience cheered and clapped, except for former councillor Grandpa Gruff who rolled his eyes. He did join the following feast rather eagerly and enjoyed the free food."

But instead of parting her with her wallet and/or entrails, the bandits shoved her back behind a desk, and at gunpoint broke to her she is now in their employ.\n\nBandits can talk the talk and shoot the shot just fine, but as it turns out, ensuring loot is "accounted for" and "planning things" isn't their forte. Over time, she had grown accustomed to the trash and abuse hurled at her by the raiders, and the booze and narcotics she never could've done in her previous life were decent enough pay. Though most of the bandits still see her as a spineless outsider, Blackrock doesn't let them hurt her in any substantial way. The bandits would be a couple million bits poorer otherwise."

bandit.2001.t:0 "The Equalist Caucus"
bandit.2001.d:0 "During the early days of the civil war in Prywhen, there was a small, if sizeable faction of Equalists fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Reds. At their helm was Reeve Blyeddin, a charismatic, if rather... Eccentric revolutionary.\n\nHis claim to fame comes from the Siege of Temsoar. Holed up and with naught even rats left to eat, he purportedly lopped off an arm of his to feed a family of desperate commonfolk — Or to feed himself, depending on who you ask.\n\nIt didn't take long for Blyeddin to trade snide remarks with Redglad after that. In public, ostantateous rallies, he would decry what he dubbed Red Hierarchism, and how communists everywere were co-opting the fight for Equality and smothering the path to Utopia in its crib. And though he was largely irrelevant in Prywhenian politics, revolutionaries fighting a civil war could ill afford risks. He was forced to make a choice - fall in line, or become a political prisoner. He chose neither.\n\nNow, the deserting revolutionary bides his time with us, eagerly joining Blackrock in raids against those he dubs "Hierarchists" in Griffonstone, Lushi, and even Prywhen, hoping one day to use his earnings to return home with an army and deliver his countrygriffs of tyranny and fear. Blackrock and he have even become something approximating friends in their time together, despite their many, MANY incongruities. It was during one of their countless nights of getting drunk off their rears that Blackrock, in her booze-fueled brilliance, promised him first dibs on all Prywhenian loot.\n\nWho said banditry had to be political?"

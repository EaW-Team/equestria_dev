Some theorized this is due to immigration and simple convenience in international trade. Regardless of the cause, the numbers speak for themselves, as barely 30% of Rumare's population still speak their native language.

 LAK_dual_languages:0 "Linguistic Pluralism"

 LAK_industry_technology:0 "The Jewel Of The Lake"

 LAK_trade_offices:0 "The Rumare Chamber Of Commerce"
 LAK_trade_offices_desc:0 "Rumare has, historically, never been all that centralized, despite the small amount of land available to it. However, with Alaric's return, he seeks to change that. A centralized chamber of commerce is a good first step towards doing such."

 LAK_invest_in_tourism_desc:0 "While some notables have expressed their confusion towards Alaric's plan of opening Rumare up to tourism.

 LAK_domestic_oil_industry:0 "Shale Oil"

 LAK_free_healthcare:0 "Social Welfare"
 LAK_free_healthcare_desc:0 "The welfare state is a relatively new concept, where the state takes the responsibility to provide for its citizens. This has been mostly a sphere of the Temples through most of history, but Alaric now believes its time to establish a caring state in Rumare, providing public services and benefits and complementing the already existing education act and family subsidies. We'll have to raise some taxes, but its worth the cost."
 LAK_cooperate_with_unions:0 "Expand Union Cooperation"
 LAK_cooperate_with_unions_desc:0 "With the worker's legislation officialized, many of Rumare's unions supported our government's efforts.

 LAK_army_reform:0 "The Gwarchodlu Cenedlaethol"

 LAK_focus_on_offence:0 "Fire And Brimstone"
 LAK_focus_on_offence_desc:0 "In the past, our army was solely a defensive one. However, Alaric's experiences as a mercenary have shown him that defense is not always the best way to go.

 LAK_fortify_the_islands:0 "The Recimir Line"
 LAK_fortify_the_islands_desc:0 "Named after Alaric's father, the departed Baron Recimir Dawnbreaker, the new Recimir line will be a testament to the defensive prowess of Rumare. With new, and modernized fortifications making land invasion even more unfeasible than in the olden days, and interlocking firing positions ready to reap a toll on any besieger."
 LAK_local_armouries:0 "Local Armouries"
 LAK_local_armouries_desc:0 "If we are to be able to properly defend ourselves, we must be able to readily manufacture our own weapons, rather than rely on foreign imports all the time.

 LAK_build_air_defences:0 "Clear Blue Skies"
 LAK_build_air_defences_desc:0 "If we are to keep Rumare safe, we must also take into account the modern invention of the aircraft.

Rumare will have nothing but clear blue skies in it's future."
 LAK_focus_on_recruitment:0 "Every Soul Counts"
 LAK_focus_on_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are going to keep our defenses strong, we must make sure that every available soul capable of firing a weapon serves at least some sort of military service.

 LAK_old_friends:0 "Old Friends"
 LAK_old_friends_desc:0 "In the past, Alaric Dawnbreaker made a living for himself amongst several griffon mercenary bands roaming the continent. Though he is now the leader of Rumare, he still has access to some of his contacts, and can draw on their expertise to train his own army- for the right price, of course."
 LAK_old_connections:0 "Underground Contacts"
 LAK_old_connections_desc:0 "Aside from his mercenary contacts, Alaric has a few... less than legal contacts in the weapons smuggling line of trade.

 LAK_invest_in_new_rifles:0 "Modernise The Equipment"
 LAK_invest_in_new_rifles_desc:0 "While our old equipment is still usable, and will going forward still be available for use by our home defense units, we should make strides to modernize our rifles and cannons, so as to have a technological edge over any future enemies we may have."
 LAK_newest_artillery_pieces:0 "Import Imperial Artillery Pieces"

 LAK_train_officers:0 "Secondary Combat Roles"
 LAK_train_officers_desc:0 "Something that should be taught to Rumare's generals, so as to keep up with the changing, modern battlefield, are the secondary combat roles. While not direct combatants themselves, logisticians and planning boards are important to any present-day military, and should be both respected and made use of."
 LAK_focus_on_training:0 "Quality Over Quantity"
 LAK_focus_on_training_desc:0 "While having hordes of troops at our command can be considered a good thing, it is Alaric's professional opinion as a former mercenary himself that a few well-trained griffons with better equipment and drills can hold out more readily against the poorly trained peasant masses, and the Rumarean military agrees with his assertion."
 LAK_nationalist_fervour:0 "Nationalist Fervour"

 ### Events ###
 dawn.1.t:0 "The New Baron"
 dawn.1.d:0 "Alaric paced back and forth on the deck of the small boat crossing the misty lake. His father was dead and he must return home to take charge of Rumare himself. His income as A mercenary had been one of the primary sources of income for Rumare and had accounted for 26% of total revenue marked as *Birthday Gifts* in the Barony's ledger. But that was not the only thing that worried him. For he was in outlaw in Griffonstone, and he was on the edge of legal status in Arantiga from which he had taken this boat. And it took the last coins in his pocket to get a port guard to look the other way.\n\nBut at last he saw something, a shape, a ship is taking form on the horizon... he readied his weapon but soon saw something unusual, the ship simply threw down a rope, of which his transport tied to their bow, and then began to slip into the haze. He was safe now. But now the question of how to rule...\n\nHis father had always dreamed of bringing the lands of the Rumarean people back under his wing, but as he saw the conditions of his home as he slipped into the harbor under cover... he seriously considered turning his back on those ideas.\n\nWhat is a Griffon to do?"
 dawn.1.a:0 "We must save what can be saved..."
 dawn.1.b:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.2.t:0 "The Dual Language Act"
 dawn.2.d:0 "Alaric sat at his desk in the Baron's manor with a paper sitting in front of him. But he could not read it. He was a literate griffon of course, he could read 4 languages and speak 3 fluently but this was in the Imperial language, something his father had shunned for long, and had tried and failed to root our of his land. He flipped to the back and thankfully found a translation written in Rumarean and began to ponder what he was about to do. To make Imperial an official language was an ultimate capitulation. But one must first kneel to be able to stand back up."
 dawn.2.a:0 "Times are changing..."
 
 dawn.3.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.3.d:0 "Today thousands of native Rumareans would step back on Rumarean shores again. And there will soon be many more!"
 dawn.3.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 dawn.4.t:0 "The Rumarean Language Act"
 dawn.4.d:0 "By decree of his majesty the Baron of Rumare and all Rumareans in diaspora he decrees,\n\nAll government texts in Rumare shall be written in the language of the fathers.\nAll public signs made by the state shall be in, exclusively Rumarean.\nAll of those in the Barony who can not speak Rumarean shall be provided an opportunity to, failing to accept will result in a fee.\nAnd most importantly. All children are banned from having the name "Grover""
 dawn.4.a:0 "Yma o Hyd..."
 
 dawn.5.t:0 "The Free Rumare Army"
 dawn.5.d:0 "There are many ethnic Rumareans living in the Residence and Stone Highlands. They usually don't cause any trouble but this has changed recently with the formation of the Free Rumare Army, a organisation which claims to be fighting for a independent Rumarean nation. The formation of the FRA has coincided with the bombing of several government facilities in the Residence and Stone Highlands that has caused significant damage. More worryingly is the discovery of several weapons caches in a raid by the army on a FRA hideout. It seems the FRA is also preparing for a full scale uprising.\n\nWhile we have been unable to track down the source of funding for the FRA. Many are suspecting the Barony of Rumare to be the ones smuggling weapons and funds to the FRA. However without any solid evidence we cannot do anything. The only thing we can do is wait for them to strike first."
 dawn.5.a:0 "Terrorists the lot of them!"
 
 dawn.6.t:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 dawn.6.d:0 "Alaric was deep in the forests on the most secluded area on the island of Rumare, these lands were sacred to him and his people, and he came here daily for some sort of religious event. Some were more enjoyable then others, the worst being to the god of knowledge Ymenydd, and the best being either the god of games or well... let's say the god of "indulgence" to be polite.\n\nBut today was special. It was the feast of Arcturius, the god stolen from them by the Imperials and desecrated by their false shrines. He had had an ancient artifact imported from his new lands, a spear with which Arcurius slew the great Maaw, which threatened to consume all Griffonkind. And so he sat and prayed, prayed for the deliverance of his people."
 dawn.6.a:0 "Praise be to Arcturius!"
 
 dawn.7.t:0 "The Return of the Language"
 dawn.7.d:0 "Alaric read his reports and smiled. He read of book clubs and social groups. Of sports teams and workshops. And of restaurants and taverns. But most importantly to him, he read these things in Rumarean and read about Rumareans. It was, for the first time in the reign of him, his father, or many fathers before that, growing. More Griffons began to speak their ancestral language, and it showed. The Ruiniad had turned into a rebirth for his people. And he could not be more proud."
 dawn.7.a:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.8.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.8.d:0 "Alaric watched from a boat in the lake as any more boats like it docked in the harbor of their great new land. They were his people, his comrades and yet he felt a tinge of pain. For he had made an oath and he would not yet step on those shores himself. His people asked them to simply sail forth and go with them, but he still had work to do.\n\nHe still had to make his Baronry proud to be Rumarean."
 dawn.8.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 dawn.9.t:0 "Yr Eryr Wen Dros Eincartref"
 dawn.9.d:0 ""Once again today! I present to you all, citizens of the liberated lands of Rumare! Your Baron and liberator, Alaric Dawnbreaker!"\n\nIt was a moment of redemption for Alaric. For so many years he had gone off, fighting other's wars, killing Griffons, Ponies and even Zebras alike. Battle after battle, payment after payment, bloody dawn after bloody dawn. All to one day return home and achieve what his father couldn't.\n\nHis father, Arcturius bless him... he wished he could see this day. To see the people clap and cheer, to exclaim his praises for giving them true freedom from the tyranny of the oppressors.\n\nThis moment might have even been cathartic if it wasn't for the lack of his father's grey wing around him. But even as he put on a smiling face for the crowd, and even as he sulked inside, he noticed a light shining from far away, a light emanating from the top of the Griffonstone Mountain, the location of Arcturias' great pantheon. And he knew his father was home."
 dawn.9.a:0 "Glory to Rumare!"
 
 dawn.10.t:0 "Fisher Barons"
 dawn.10.d:0 "Many fishergriffs see our support for the industry as the actions of a government that actually appreciates the work of the common griffion and we have gained the grudging approval of several prominent Fisher Barons who have ensured suitable 'protection' for their new friends with the understanding of what our new 'soldiers' will do if our support wavers."
 dawn.10.a:0 "All of this over fish?"
 
 dawn.11.t:0 "Unions Expand"
 dawn.11.d:0 "With the increase in the number of local businesses the local unemployment rate has fallen to nearly unheard of lows. This has resulted in a spike in collective bargaining as both Employers and Employees have realised that the power balance has swung to the workers as in this new market, a skilled worker can always find a new job but a stingy employer may not be able to find someone to take his place."
 dawn.11.a:0 "As long as they aren't causing trouble"
 
 dawn.12.t:0 "The Gníomhaireacht Míntírithe Talún Delivers"
 dawn.12.d:0 "The Agency of Land Reclamation has recovered a sizeable area of land from the lake, most of it will go to housing and a new pub but we can easily fit a factory in what we have left over."
 dawn.12.a:0 "How about the Sea Breeze Tavern?"
 
 dawn.13.t:0 "Darcy's Drunken Pony"
 dawn.13.d:0 "During the night a pony from the Federation stumbled out of Darcy's Pub and Grill and spent the morning screaming racial epithets at everyone she met before passing out on a bench she had vomited over. She was quickly arrested but her actions have caused quite the uproar in the community. She will be deported after a short trial, but her actions will be discussed between pub patrons and politicians alike."
 dawn.13.a:0 "Maybe Wingfried was right?"
 
 dawn.14.t:0 "Recovering our Lands"
 dawn.14.d:0 "Alaric sat at the desk of his new home in Eincartref. The new capital of Rumare. \n\n And the new home of the Rumarean people. \n\nBut was it a happy home, or a decrepit one? Of course, Rumare itself had avoided most of the troubles which plagued Griffonia's nations after the Empire collapsed. But the Barony's new lands, the ones on the mainland, weren't so lucky. Chained to Griffonstone, perhaps the part of Griffonia most hit by an entire generation of societal collapse, the areas of Eincartref and the Stone Highlands suffered greatly. It was when he saw the fourteenth illiterate chick, the fourteenth destitute family, that he knew he had to make Rumare's ancient lands as prosperous as the island itself, Arcturius give him strength. \n\nFor the Rumarean people, for his father's memory, and for many of his ancestors before him, he had to do it."
 dawn.14.a:0 "There is so much to do."
 
 dawn.15.t:0 "Expansion of the Family Subsidy"
 dawn.15.d:0 "Today, by decree, the Baron has put into effect a law that would expand the already existing Family Subsidy program that saw success in increasing Rumare's population growth. Due to the high rate of poverty and illiteracy in the former Griffonstone regions of Rumare, inclusion into the program now requires a schooling certificate in order to a family to receive funds. \n\nSeveral griffons have criticized Alaric due to the forced nature of this law. Nevertheless, Alaric has dismissed these concerns. The program has also been expanded to poor families with children, who will receive an additional amount of funding in addition to the already received. It is predicted this will cost Rumare's government more money, but Alaric predicts it'll be all worth it."
 dawn.15.a:0 "We're all Rumareans, in the end."
 
 dawn.16.t:0 "Eincartref Renovated"
 dawn.16.d:0 "Baron Alaric greeted the crowd of cheering griffons that was outside the new Baron's manor in the capital of Eincartref. It was over, after a monumental effort, but the initiative to renovate the city was now fully finished. The historic core of the city remained, with all its charm and new attraction, now complemented with buildings in the ancient Rumarean style; mixing with new, modern-style apartments, factories and workshops on the outsides. \n\n It was a great symbolism for the new, bright dawn that Rumare was experiencing, Alaric thought: the Ruinad was over, and the Rumarean people could step boldly into the future, holding into their language, traditions and culture while embracing the modern world."
 dawn.16.a:0 "Long live Rumare! Long live the Baron!"
 
 dawn.17.t:0 "The End of the Reconstruction"
 dawn.17.d:0 "Alaric was back on the island of Rumare. Back where it all started... the fog of the lake, his father's death, his status as an almost-outlaw... back then, it seemed impossible for an independent Rumare to be anything more than a footnote in history, in some dusty old textbook in the future. \n\nBut now, the Reconstruction of the mainland was finished. The stains of the Ruinad have almost all been removed from Rumare, and similar efforts to the ones taken here have been applied in the Stone Highlands and Eincartref - the rebuilt home of the Rumarean people - to good results. \n\nThere was so much to be done. And he had done it. As always, it was his father's grey wing that he still missed... but now, he surely knew he, and his many ancestors, were proud of Alaric."
 dawn.17.a:0 "Rumare am Byth!"

 ### General desc ###
 welsh_sheepfucker_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: August 18th, 965 in Rumare\n\n§YRank§!: Cyffredinol\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Rumare in 965 to an Imperial Officer and a local Rumarean fishergriff, Graid spent the first years of his chickhood in comfortable living, as the small island barony was mostly devoid of the conflict and troubles which plagued Griffonia even before the collapse of the Empire. He would spend these years either playing in the grassy fields of the island or in his education, which his father ensured was focused on the history of Griffonia and the Empire.\n\nThis changed in 978, when the Republican Revolution struck the Empire. As Imperial authority disappeared overnight, Rumare gained de-facto independence; however this didn't sit well with his father, who remained loyal to Griffenheim. As a result, twelve year old Graid would be uprooted from his home, as his father moved his family to the Heartlands and joined the Imperial loyalists against Kemerskai's revolutionaries. After Grover V was restored to the throne, Graid's father decided to stay in Griffenheim, as he was promoted due to his loyalty to the Imperials. His education on the Empire's history and glory was doubled down, and now included the teaching of Herzlander language and literature, displacing his native Rumarean.\n\nAfter coming of age, Graid was enrolled in the Vinnin Military Academy, graduating four years latter in 987 as an infantry officer. The climate of social chaos and decay in the Empire following the Revolution made him feel unhappy, and he began to look at his chickhood in Rumare with a certain sense of nostalgia. As a result, he focused himself on his free time to learning of Rumare's history, culture and literature; increasing his fondness for his birthplace. He eventually resigned his officer commission from the Reichsarmee after eleven years of service and promptly moved back to Rumare. After writing a Rumarean language novel in 1001 - which wasn't very successful - he made a request to Baron Recimir to join as an officer of the small Rumare Defense Force, which was accepted.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"

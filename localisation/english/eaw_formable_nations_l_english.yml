 ### Decisions ###
 form_aquileia_category:0 "A New Era For Aquileia"
 form_aquileia_category_desc:0 "With both the Discret dynasty and the Republican revolutionaries crushed or driven into exile, the former lands of Aquileia lack a strong leading figure. [Root.GetLeader] has been the driving force in vanquishing them, and time will tell if they'll repeat the steps of Grover II or be a more benevolent overlord."
 form_aquileia:0 "Restore Aquileia"
 
 form_hindia:0 "A United Hindia"
 form_hindia_desc:0 "Finally, the dream of a united Hindia has been accomplished, as the deer of Eastern Zebrica have finally been united under a leader worthy of the title of ruler of all Hindia. Now that we have united the region under our control, it is imperative that our nation claim legitimacy over all free deer in Zebrica, so that we can be known as a true great power on the continent."
 form_hindia_decision:0 "Form Hindia"

 form_evi:0 "Unification Of The Evi Valley"
 form_evi_desc:0 "Emperor Grover I was the first griffon to unite the lands of the Evi Valley under one banner, but he was a foreigner. With the Empire's collapse the valley was divided once more, but perhaps an ambitious native ruler can change this. Let a new nation now rise from the ashes of war, and may the disparate peoples of Evi stand together at last!"
 form_evi_decision:0 "Form The Evian Nation"
 move_capital_to_kivessin:0 "Move The Capital To Kivessin"
 move_capital_to_kivessin_desc:0 "Kivessin is at the center of the newborn nation, in an ideal position for ruling the land. It also has a certain amount of prestige, being the old capital of the Kingdom of Brodfeld. Moving our capital there is therefore a good idea."

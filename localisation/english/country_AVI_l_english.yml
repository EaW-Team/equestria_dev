avian.8.a:0 "We will be on the sidelines."
avian.9.t:0 "Introducing the Linguistic Divide"
avian.9.d:0 "The territories that now comprise the holdings of our great house have for hundreds of years been on the very border between the Aquilean and Heartlander cultures. This has led to a situation where despite being part of the Aquilean cultural and even political sphere, there is simply no single culture and language that unites the populace of House Avian. The griffons within our realm speak many languages and dialects, ranging from Herzlander to Aquilean and everything in between. While before this wasn't a problem, as our nobility was capable of using Herzland to communicate and organize, such luck didn't follow us. Due to the modernization of the region and the advancement of several ideas our lack of unified language has resulted in limitations in our ability to enact political, military and economic reforms across the country. Furthermore this linguistic divide has only resulted in worsening the cultural divide that has been growing for quite some time.\n\nIf we wish our house to survive and maybe even thrive instead of stagnating, we simply cannot ignore this issue."
avian.9.a:0 "We must remedy this issue at once"
avian.10.t:0 "The Second Winterfest Ball"
avian.10.d:0 "The unification process has been going smoothly, so smoothly, in fact, that a ball at Hallhaus has been planned. Both lords and ladies from all parts of Avian, Erie, and Eyrie met together peacefully this day, under an unified banner and a promise of peace to last between the Houses' peoples. Wine flowed, words streamed like rivers, and much merrymaking was had; such is the nature of an event. Quite a few interhouse relationships were even formed. Alas, for not all was peaceful; unknown assailants fired shots into the party; many were wounded and the perpetrator escaped. The ball was swiftly put to an end as the guests were evacuated from the scene and survivors rushed to the hospitals"
avian.10.a:0 "A most unexpected event"
avian.11.t:0 "Battle for the Radio Transmitter"
avian.11.d:0 "The civil war's fires rage bright as it's latest battleground is decided; Hallhaus's radio station. While no faction has direct control of it as yet, it has been deemed by all sides an incredibly important asset; whoever holds it has the power to spread their message across all three Houses; the Loyalists, Communists, and Militarists all are shedding blood for it. But who won that night?"
avian.11.a:0 "The Communists take the radio station"
avian.11.b:0 "The Loyalists take the radio station"
avian.11.c:0 "The Militarists take the radio station"
avian.12.t:0 "Battle for the Railway Station"
avian.12.d:0 "The central railway station in the city of Lishill serves as an important strategic location, its expansive railways are vital lines of communication and many railway lines in Griffonia go through it. The railway station was built in the 950s as the industrial age came to Griffonia. The location of the station between the Heartlands, Aquileia, and Wingbardy made the region prosper as thousands of goods would go through the station everyday. However when the Griffonian Empire collapsed and the three Houses split up, trade largely stopped and the railway station fell into despair. The railway station had recently seen a revival due to the cooling of relations between the three Houses. Trade and travel were once more going through the station and large investment were poured into the railway station.\n\nNow it is one of the most intense battlefields of the civil war. The railway station was seized by the communists early in the civil war and has been used as a headquarters for them ever since. Both the loyalists and militarists knew the importance of capturing the city and the railway station. Not only is the railway station a strategically important location, but its capture would be a big set back for the communists. As the communists arm the railway workers and turn trains into temporary barricades. The loyalists and militarists gather their forces for a attack on the railway station and the city.\n\nWhile the communists are determined to hold the city and are heavily fortified, they are outnumbered by the loyalists and militarists. The communists repulse the initial assaults by their enemies but they are eventually pushed from their outer defences and retreat deeper into the city. Clashes between loyalists and militarists erupt as their units encounter each other in the city. This gives the communists the much needed breathing room to regroup and under the cover of night, they launch a massive counter attack to push their enemy out of the city. The loyalists and militarists, being focused on each other and not expecting the battered communists to make a move, are taken by surprise, and brutal claw to claw fighting takes place in the night.\n\nBy morning the bodies pile up on the streets but it is clear who controls the city and its railway station."
avian.12.a:0 "The Communists pushed back the reactionaries"
avian.12.b:0 "The Loyalists held their ground"
avian.12.c:0 "The Militarists held their ground"
avian.13.t:0 "Battle for the Hallhaus Armoury"
avian.13.d:0 "The armoury, a critical strategic point, being the main store of weaponry in House Avian, has come under assault by both loyalist and communist forces. While it is currently in the iron grip of the military, it remains to be seen whether the weapons to win the war will remain in their claws, or fall into the claws of their foes."
avian.13.a:0 "The Communists take the armoury"

avian.14.d:0 "The Loyalist's main stronghold; the Des Vouex hotel, and the temporary residence of the vast majority of the nobles who attended the Winterfest ball has come under siege and now both communists and Trubach's putchschists are seeking to make the hotel's halls run red with noble blood."

avian.17.d:0 "A victor has been named; the Communists have taken hold of Hallhaus, and with it, largely uncontested control over the three Houses, as almost all the nobility were present, and they have now been, alongside Trubach and his high command, executed. The red flag flies over Hallhaus, and the country is rebuilding itself from the ground up."
avian.17.a:0 "We are now free"
avian.18.t:0 "The Midnight After" 
avian.18.d:0 "Hallhaus has been the site of a bitter civil war, one that will decide the fate of the Three houses. While currently, no side is a clear winner, once the ashes and dust settle, the fate of the three Houses shall be determined..."

avian.19.t:0 "The Results of the Election"
avian.19.d:0 "With the Loyalist victory, they have come to realise one thing; their society must be made free and fair. As such, even though tradition survived, restructuring is necessary; the three Houses look forwards to a bright future as a true democracy. The nobility will remain largely unchanged, aside from their power being reduced, and the first elections have seen a landslide victory by the Federalist party."
avian.19.a:0 "A fantastic result!"
avian.20.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Kingdom of Verenia"
avian.20.d:0 "With Trubach's victory, the three Houses have been tied together in a military dictatorship; The largest city of the region, Verenia, and his home city, is where the new government rules from; and as such, House Avian, Erie, and Eyrie no longer exists. Long live Trubach, Long live the Kingdom of Verenia!"
avian.20.a:0 "Long live the Kingdom of Verenia!"

avian.21.t:0 "A Manticore Sighting"
avian.21.d:0 "In a village near Hallhaus, locals have reported a sighting of a large lion-like beast with a scorpion tail and wings looking like those of bats. Many of the local villagers were panicking and worrying for their lives as they saw that beast prowling through the forest near the village. Alarms were blaring, and some griffons with a telegraph were able to relay to the military that they need to end its rampage. The sound of the alarm however enraged the beast, and it soon charged towards the village. The policegriffs were not prepared though and were hastily bringing out their guns before the manticore's tail swatted them away with guns flying. The policegriffs that were guarding the village were soon injured and in terror as the Manticore came closer. The manticore's eyes filled with rage as it just wanted to hunt in peace. It was willing however to let go of its rage until one of the policegriffs charged at the beast screaming "DIE!!" which only scared and enraged the beast more. The policegriff's charge though was followed by the manticore stabbing it with its tail and killing him instantly. The other policegriffs cried in fear though and all of them were slaughtered soon after from the manticore's claws. The villagers meanwhile were fleeing, but the Manticore was soon charging and killing villager after villager until there were no more in sight. In the end, it left a bloody carnage in the small village. However the alarm remained blaring, and with that, military convoys were seen in the distance by the manticore."
avian.21.a:0 "This is bad."
avian.22.t:0 "The Military Arrives"
avian.22.d:0 "When a battalion of soldiers came through the village and from what they saw, they were shocked. Dozens of griffons were strewn on the ground with their bodies mangled. A mixture of civilians and policegriffs were among the corpses in the village; the soldiers were walking when they heard a strange grumbling noise. "Sir, what was that??" one of the privates said to the main sergeant overseeing the ruins. "I don't know but keep your heads up and keep your rifles at the ready, this ain't definitely bandits" the sergeant yelled. This battalion kept their rifles at the ready were looking around, seeing the various claw marks houses smashed. It was truly a sight to behold. But soon as another soldier was investigating a dead policegriff, there was a loud rumble. Soon after......a massive roar as the manticore sprung out agaunst the battalion. Unlike the panicked policegriffs, the soldiers were holding their rifles to their chest as a manticores tale swung and swatted at least a dozen soldiers and forced the battalion to scatter. Anger rushed in for many of the still surviving soldiers as they started to fire indiscriminately. The manticore was able to kill a few of the soldiers and as he turned, bullets were penetrating his body at a rapid rate. However the manticore was still standing as he was ready to charge until one of his kneecaps shattered by the raining bullets. Soon after, a pin was heard and a metal ball popped in front of him. What came soon after was a massive explosion that torn his body to shreds. His own flesh flying everywhere with his head completely disconnected and mangled. The firing soon went silent as the sequel to the previous carnage ended."
avian.22.a:0 "Bloody Tartarus....."
avian.23.t:0 "The Manticore is Dead"
avian.23.d:0 "The smoke settled, the stench of blood permeating the once peaceful village as soldiers came out from their various places of cover in the ruins. Some soldiers were wounded by some of the misfire by the chaotic gunfight with the manticore, while others died succumbing from the manticore's claw and tail wounds. It was an overall tragedy. The sergeant stepped out from cover and yelled to make sure who is alive. Many voices still rang, but the sergeant grimaced when he saw the dead. One of the dead happened to be the same private who had such fear. He felt the pain course through him, but he held it in and then ordered all the griffons to pick up the dead and load them up onto the vehicle. There was much cleaning to do. The sergeant soon called for Aviaire medical services and then soon after, watched and waited for emergency services to help the military clean up the disaster. One thing is for certain, that manticore is surely going to scare the government into passing much more severe hunting laws to kill these beasts."
avian.23.a:0 "Well the press sure ain't going to like this"
avian.25.t:0 "Picking up the Remains"
avian.25.d:0 "With the death of the manticore, emergency services came and assessed the damage. Dozens upon dozens of people died and many more are missing. The press came soon after and reported the death of the manticore, which assuaged the populace. However, the manticore was able to kill at least 5 soldiers as well and wound many more. It was a scary sight as manticores have not been seen in so long. The military was to remain on high alert and make sure that if they see any more manticores, they are KOS. Family members that managed to avoid the carnage were in mourning as a memorial soon set in, and with the missing still around, search parties were looking everywhere for remaining survivors. Overall, the day is bittersweet and filled with sorrow."
avian.25.a:0 "Well thank Boreas it is over"
avi_news.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Verenia Proclaimed"
avi_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The series of unexpected twists that have been occurring in the territories of shattered Varenia continue as the realm has finally been fully united. However this developed in a completely different way than most assumed it would. For it was not House Eyrie, Erie or Avian which united the state, rather it was Trubach von Zypressen, a member of a previously rather minor noble family. According to the claims of the new, so proclaimed "Kaiser" of Verenia, this isn't simply just the duchy reborn, but rather a great kingdom which won't be content being a secondary realm trapped between Heartlands and Aquilea.\n\nMany are sceptical of such rumors, especially considering that even at the peak of it's power Verenia wasn't capable of anything even close to such conquests."
avi_news.1.a:0 "Only time will truly tell"
avi_news.2.t:0 "Eyrie-Erie Feud Ends"
avi_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In the most unexpected of twists, the conflict between the Houses of Eyrie and Erie has been ended with a treaty of friendship and peace. With heavy involvement from the matriarch of House Avian- Lady Katrina, Iovinus Eyrie and Vincent Erie have agreed to give up their ambitions of unifying the Duchy of Verenia with the might of arms for now.\n\nMany are dumbfounded by such development, after all both leaders have been known for their stubbornness and unwillingness to bend the knee or even consider peace. But a bigger question still remains, what now? After all,the 3 houses existing as "independent" domains has been a development of the civil war, none of them had actually existed as separate realms before. Can they even survive like this? And furthermore, how long will this new status quo continue?"
avi_news.2.a:0 "This was the weirdest of civil wars."
avi_news.3.t:0 "The Tripartite Union"
avi_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After years and years of warfare, to the anger and happiness of many, the shattered lands of Duchy of Verenia have been united under a single leader. While this wasn't a surprising result by itself. What was unexpected, was instead of Houses Eyrie or Erie, led by the most legitimate claimants to the throne, it was House Avian under it's matriarch Lady Katrina, which would be the uniting force.\n\nHowever while the so called "Tripartite Union" did indeed unify the three houses under the leadership of House Avian, it isn't a complete unification yet, as Houses Eyrie and Erie are still somewhat independent in many ways. Is this the new status quo of the region, a somewhat reformed, yet heavily decentralized Verenia? Or will Verenia be reforged into a centralized kingdom with House Avian on top?"
avi_news.3.a:0 "Aren't Verenians obsessed with legitimacy?"

 AVI_polscinerd_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of November, 968 in Avien-Les-Bains\n\n§YBiography§!: The griff known as Théophylacte (Théo for friends) has been, much to his displeasure, overlooked for most of his lifetime. Firmly in belief that he is more attractive, intelligent or wealthier than his peers, he has often sought to prove his worth for a modicum of respect. This inferiority complex has not always played out to his advantage, nor his tendency to assume authority over the others.\n\nNonetheless, when Katrina entrusted him with a position of prominence in her House's administration, it didn't take long for Théophylacte to ponder how he would do a much better job than the out-of-touch nobility, frequently nurtured in the plentiful evening gatherings held with his co-conspirators. It seemed it would remain only so, the griping of dissatisfied griffs wearing polite expressions around their superiors.\n\nBut the collapse of the old order yielded an unexpected opportunity for the technocrats. Ordinarily, they would have never come close to seizing power, the squabbling between the revolt's leaders providing the opening to force them out. It doesn't take a degree in political science (of which Théophylacte holds immense pride despite its commonly perceived lack of value) to figure that that Verenian griffs needed something far better than what they've been suffering under for the past three decades, yet time will tell if this disparate group of experts can make something different out of Verenia.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kleowolfy"

 avian.1.t:0 "To A More Happier Outcome"
 avian.1.d:0 "This is Katrina, daughter of Lady Amelinda and head of House Avian. For years, long before I was born, our land was once united as Verenia. My uncle led us all to freedom from the failing Imperials. However, the Republican Revolution brought him to an unfortunate end, and with it created a great divide between his two sons: duke Vincent of House Erie, and duke Iovinus of House Eyrie.\n\nDuke Vincent's mother wasn't a noble, but according to Mom— err, according to Mother, that doesn't matter now that he's legitimised. He's a smart griff, but he does let his focus take precedence over other matters, even over his own citizens' lives. While he may seem a bit brash, I do know he loves Verenia and wishes to see it prosper. Duke Iovinus, on the other hand, is a full noble (if that matters now). He cares greatly for his commongriffs and understands that he has a duty to fulfill. However, he lacks the same sort of tactical genius that Vincent holds, and while he does love his country, the years of stalemate has left him aimless and tired.\n\nAnd that leaves me and my mother. Mother, the sister of the late Duke, refused to join in their petty fight and withdrew her lands from both sides. Thanks to her efforts, our own citizens are thriving and happy. However, her equal efforts in bringing the two sides together have not brought a similar result. For years, the most she has managed has been stalemates. Any sort of peace talk has been useless between both sides.\n\nAfter collapsing a couple of years ago, my mother's talon was forced, and she ceded her position to me earlier than expected. But that's okay! I know I can bring the war to an end. The two dukes are good griffs, and if I show that to one another, I'm sure they'll stop fighting. And if that doesn't happen, I know that Mother will get back to normal and take back her position, just like how the physician said."

 avian.6.d:0 "Vincent often wondered why he did not delegate this tedious chore to some other griff, but he had to admit Livio was right for once: information is just as precious as idols, and he should be careful with who sees it. That didn't make sifting through each letter that arrived on his desk any more bearable, but the last one caught his particular attention.\n\nThe fanciful lettering stated it came from 'Katrina Avian'. A moment was needed for his wine sloshed mind to recollect that it was his niece (of a sort) and wondered what she could want this time. It was always perplexed him how in spite of their revolt, the so-called House Avian had made no aggressive overtures against him since that day. Just seemed like a rather poor strategy, if they wished to seize the Verenian inheritance.\n\nA cursory glance confirmed his suspicions. Much like her deluded mother, Katrina was inviting him and Iovinus to her holdings to discuss peace and all that assorted junk. First came a snicker, then a chuckle, and finally a full blown laughter as Vincent threw the letter into the fireplace, wondering just how naive was this chick to suggest he would EVER make any sort of treaty with that idiotic, thick-skulled cretin across the Aranti? Why, if they were put together in the same room he'd choke him with his bare claws!\n\nFinishing that vengeful daydream, Vincent returned to the other correspondence that needed answering."
 avian.6.a:0 "A good distraction, at least."
 
 avian.7.t:0 "Invitation For Peace"
 avian.7.d:0 "Things were quiet. Too quiet, a paranoid mind would say, but for now Iovinus felt content. Preparations were going well, and this time, for absolutely certainly sure, he'd be sending his half-witted reprobate of a sibling to Maar's embrace where he belongs! But for now, he was trying to keep calm, enjoying a day off in the gardens. Greenery always put a sense of ease in his mind.\n\nBut just as he was about to lounge more comfortably across the bench, the rustling of paper caught his attention. Oh right, Roman passed him a letter this morning, even though he asked not to be bothered. Absentmindedly unfurling this correspondence, his thoughts were divided between simple curiosity and pondering on a suitable petty punishment for the Guard-Captain.\n\nAh. Another letter from Katrina Avian, asking for him and Vincent to attend peace talks. Iovinus wasn't sure what made him choke in sorrow more prominently, the fact that they've been fighting over Verenia for this long, or that Amelinda had implanted this persistently vacuous idea in her mind. How could he EVER agree to a treaty after everything that drooling imbecile had put him through? Why he'd sooner choke and rot!\n\nWith the letter angrily crumpled and torn, Iovinus drifted into an uneasy nap."

Even as neighbouring regions settled into a pretence of peace, the infamously stubborn heirs of the late Verenian duke refused to lay down their weapons as battles and ceasefires followed one after another. Thus, the proudly independent region has only known strife for decades.\n\nYet to the surprise of many, the cycle of familial bloodshed has ended on this day. Despite being the weakest party in the conflict, Katrina Avian has managed to cast down the squabbling pretenders by force, seizing the Verenian inheritance. Nonetheless, the commonfolk were overjoyed to see peace finally return to Verenia, after over 25 years."

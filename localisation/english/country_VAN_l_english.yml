vanhoover.1.d:0 "Dust Hoover entered through the Vanhoover city hall main doors, his loyal marines in tow. Now was the time for a revolution. Equestria was torn asunder, Baltimare had seceded from the nation of ponies, Stalliongrad had taken land that they believed to be theirs, and now it was Vanhoover's turn.\n\n"Mayor Goldwin!" the admiral boomed as his pointstallions booted open the door, two taking up positions at the entrance, and waiting as guards. "Vanhoover is breaking free from Equestria, will you join us in the revolution for the workers?"\n\n"Are you mad, Admiral Hoover?" the mare responded with her brows furrowed, eyes flicking from marine to admiral, and back again.\n\n"That's a shame, Mayor, as the revolutionary leader of Vanhoover, I have no choice but to...""

vanhoover.2.d:0 "The proletariat of Vanhoover surrounded a hastily constructed stage, 6 ponies in a line with rifles ready up on top. All who were gathered knew why they were here, and that was to watch the final moments of former Mayor Goldwin, the Mayor of Vanhoover prior to independence from Equestria being seized by Dust Hoover. Six ponies, five blanks, when the clock strikes the hour they would fire.\n\nGoldwin couldn't say she had a bad life, she'd served her city faithfully and true, they were just misguided is all, right? With time, Celestia and Equestria would bring the ponies back around to the ways of friendship, and harmony, and they'd punish the admiral and his ponies for their crimes.\n\n\"Rifles, ready!\" barked Dust Hoover, the traitor to his navy. The clocktower ticked closer, and closer, all to when Dust and his cronies would take hold in Vanhoover."

This was his office now, and he'd make full use of it."

The Unionists under Strawberry who advocated for internal development and strengthening of worker's autonomies, and the Militarists under Admiral Hoover who advocated for a worker's army with a state with prioritization towards the military to protect Vanhoover. Winter Turnip also came with her entourage but it was smaller than both of them. All sides met and then greeted each other before going to work towards an emergency coalition to stabilize Vanhoover. Hoover, Snowflake, and Turnip both signed documents agreeing to all lead for now until a leader is decided by the people of Vanhoover. The council meeting was followed by snickers and faces of disgusting against each other as all of them had knives to their eyes. There was something coming as the feeling of unease and dread set in, and the soon to be battle yet to come is on the horizon.

It soon turned into chaos as Dust immediately got his gun out and blasted Winter in the head in a drunken stupor. Immediately Winter's death sparked a massive shootout as Winter's guards caught unawares in their own drunken state brought out their guns in a gunfight that only lasted a few minutes before almost all combatants died, including Dust's guards. Dust came out alive from the chaos miraculously but Winter's death was soon pronounced and everything fell apart as the city went into a tailspin."

vanhoover.32.d:0 "My fellow ponies, Strawberry means well with her demeanor and care but she is a fool if she thinks we can develop true communism on our own soil independently from others.

vanhoover.34.d:0 "On a calm sunny morning in Salt Lick City, worshipers of Celestia were openly praying in public in a mixture of disgust and awe when troops under Winter Turnip suddenly marched and then apprehended every single sunworshipper. What happened next was gruesome as Winter ordered the worshippers all against the wall and executed them on the spot in front of civilians. Winter allowed herself a small, satisfied smile as the soldiers disposed of them all and soon told the public to remain calm as the revolution was taking care of traitors. After that, the streets in Salt Lick City became more quiet the rest of the day."

What should we do? We can completely crackdown on them and prevent any more alicorn worship to avoid any future dissidence. We can also simply isolate them and ban them from party membership as a less extreme alternative. The final option is we can possibly invite them and subvert them to us and possibly avoid dissidence altogether if they are directly associated with our party, although they could impurify our socialist values. What shall we do?"

We need to decide it if it's worth it to ally because even allying could get us entangled in wars we don't want. But if we do ally other socialist nations, we might get the protection we need versus being a desired target. What should we choose?"
vanhoover.36.a:0 "Alliances with the others should be sought out."

vanhoover.37.t:0 "Vanhoover Attacks!"
vanhoover.37.d:0 "Rebellious communist militants from the secessionist state of Vanhoover have launched a daring raid against our defences, clearly intending to seize territory. We should protect our land from this attack, but if we are preoccupied elsewhere, it might be wiser to retreat and let the enemy gain control of some of our territory. Lives are more valuable than land, after all."
vanhoover.37.a:0 "Defend the land at all costs!"

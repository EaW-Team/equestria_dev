HYE_assemble_the_qaylid:0 "Calling for all Dervishes"
HYE_assemble_the_qaylid_desc:0 "The murderous Storm King lies dead in the far north, and his lackeys have turned on each other in a frenzied scramble for power. This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our Great Teacher Fahamka gathers all warriors, for it is time to take back our homeland."
HYE_organize_the_resistance:0 "Organising our Cadres"
HYE_organize_the_resistance_desc:0 "When we strike we will not be engaging in guerilla warfare or raids, but rather we will advance on a wide front with forces in the thousands. We must be prepared for this, and make sure that our commanders are prepared to wield forces of this kind."
HYE_dedicate_our_souls:0 "Dedicate Our Souls"
HYE_dedicate_our_souls_desc:0 "Death is where the final word is written in your life's book. It is natural and good to not seek it lightly, but we must be prepared to meet it all the same. The prize will be our homeland freed, and if we must pay with our lives, then that is the price we must pay."
HYE_make_the_cause_known:0 "Make The Cause Known"
HYE_make_the_cause_known_desc:0 "Hyenia was arrogant, and she stood alone against the Storm King when he came. In defeat, she was humbled, and the Great Teacher has not hesitated to plead with our neighbors for assistance. Thankfully, we have been blessed with a neighbour both kind and just in equal measure."
HYE_liberate_our_kin:0 "Liberate Our Kin"
HYE_liberate_our_kin_desc:0 "The day has come to finally strike. From the pups that grew up refugees and remember their homeland only in childhood memories, to the hard-bitten desert dogs who have carried this fight since before even the storm king - we all know the one truth of tomorrow.\n\nGeeri ama Guul: Death or Victory"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles:0 "Request Help From The Gargoyles"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "Between the tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Gargiloya and the Storm King's rampage, the gargoyles have plenty of reasons to want to see the yetis pushed back. We just hope they will see that."
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs:0 "Request Help From The Centaurs"
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs_desc:0 "The prideful centaurs are our ancestral enemies, but they too have suffered the ravages of the Storm King. They would rather have us as neighbors than the yetis, and if they give us weapons for this struggle, they will have much to gain."
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful:0 "Call Forth The Faithful"
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful_desc:0 ""
HYE_beat_them_back:0 "Give them no Quarter"
HYE_beat_them_back_desc:0 "They can run as they please. We will be hot on their tails and rip and tear wherever they go. Hesitation today will let the strike again tomorrow, so we must move as fast as we can."
HYE_bite_to_the_bone:0 "Bite To The Bone"
HYE_bite_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The valleys and mountains of our homeland have always been a mighty shield, and it now serves the enemy. We must commit wholly wherever we strike, and push through no matter the cost."
HYE_wherever_they_are:0 "Wherever They Are"
HYE_wherever_they_are_desc:0 "The mountains and the forests of the valley are familiar to us, and if the yetis think that they can use these places against us then they will be sorely mistaken."
HYE_we_will_fight_them:0 "We Will Fight"
HYE_we_will_fight_them_desc:0 "Many of our brothers and sisters may have fallen in the struggle, but in death they have given us hope. Hope rouses the despairing, and gives them the strength to pick up where the heroes left them."
HYE_until_we_are_victorious:0 "Until We Are Victorious"
HYE_until_we_are_victorious_desc:0 "We are committed with our hearts, our blood and indeed our very lives to ensure victory. The yetis keep defying us, and we must redouble our efforts to send them packing back whence they came. No matter the losses, no matter the fighting, we cannot stop here!"
HYE_homecoming:0 "Homecoming"
HYE_homecoming_desc:0 "On the eve of our victory, a new challenge stands before us. We had thought the royal house undone, but its last scion - princess Jawharad - has returned to once again ascend the Malachite Throne. Our ranks rumble with discontent, and the Great Teacher has stated her intent to meet with the princess, rather than to risk civil war following the war of liberation."

tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out  their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete.  "
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."
tech_dervishes_a:0 "Dervish Division IV"
tech_dervishes_a_desc:0 "As a dervish grows and develops their skills, they are expected to share their knowledge with their fellow dervishes. The most veteran of them travel among the dervishes, constantly documenting and evaluating the lessons learned so that all might share in this knowledge."
tech_dervishes_b:0 "Dervish Division V"
tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."
tech_dervishes_c:0 "Dervish Division VI"
tech_dervishes_c_desc:0 "The eleventh century has already shown that it will be a bloody one, but in this grim era, the dervishes will continue to be dilligent students."


tech_hyena_misc:0 "Extractive Metallurgy"
tech_hyena_misc_desc:0 "Few species can claim to be as proficient and skilled in digging and burrowing tunnels as the Diamond Dogs. From an early age, pups are known to bore their own tunnels, searching for the mineral goods hidden beneath the ground. Although industrial mining is not done with bare paws, it remains a priority to improve our equipment and improve safety standards, so that dogs may continue to profit from the riches of the earth."
tech_hyena_misc2:0 "Underground Construction"
tech_hyena_misc2_desc:0 "Most dogs prefer living under the ground, and few venture to the surface by choice. Subterranean environment breeds a hardy species, and the need for safety and protection of our riches makes it necessary to construct vast cities and vaults beneath the surface."
tech_hyena_misc3:0 "Underground Construction II"
tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"
tech_hyena_misc_b_desc:0 "Few things make the dogs happier than a long day at the forge, creating both consumer goods and military equipment for their nation. It is vital to modernise our production centres, so that the state as a whole may benefit and progress further."
tech_hyena_misc_c:0 "Modern Mining Industry"
tech_hyena_misc_c_desc:0 "Unparalleled in both our resource output and technologies utilised in the process, the Diamond Dogs are at the forefront of any major excavation project in the world."
tech_hyena_army:0 "Mountain Home"
tech_hyena_army_desc:0 "The dog biology makes them particularly adapt in crossing rough environment, such as hills and mountains. Training our soldiers how to be better handle the terrain while carrying heavy equipment would improve the speed of our operations."

tech_hyena_army_atk3:0 "Offensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_atk3_desc:0 "Few species read the ground as well as the dogs. Trained sappers will bypass enemy fortifications with multiple tunnels from which our forces can attack, trapping the defenders from both sides."
tech_hyena_army_def3:0 "Defensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_def3_desc:0 "There is no firmer trench than one located underground. Our foes' numbers and airplanes will matter little once they are forced to attack us in our underground fortifications."
tech_hyena_army4:0 "Advanced Fortifications"
tech_hyena_army4_desc:0 "The sheer amount of resources dogs possess makes it particularly easy for them to establish defences wherever they are needed, in a short amount of time."
tech_hyena_army5:0 "Mountain Training II"
tech_hyena_army5_desc:0 "Further improvements in our mountain fighting tehniques will make dogs the unmatched force when it comes to battles on our terrain of choice."
tech_hyena_army5_tt:0 "    §YMountain§!:\n     Attack: §G+5%§!\n     Defence: §G+5%§!\n§Y    Hill§!:\n     Attack: §G+3%§!\n     Defence: §G+2%§!\n"
tech_hyena_army6:0 "Advanced Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army6_desc:0 "A Diamond Dog tunnel is perhaps the safest place one can be during an air raid. It is simply very wasteful to destroy the very ground itself, even with modern explosives."

HYE_qaylid_dervish:0 "The Qaylid"
HYE_qaylid_dervish_desc:0 "Since the exodus from her own kin, Great Teacher Fahamka has led her disciples and students to create a new way of life for the Hyenas. This more spiritual and ascetic path has created something rarely before seen in Hyenia, and now the Dervishes stand as the new order in these lands."
HYE_regency:0 "The Great Teacher's Weakness."
HYE_regency_desc:0 "After a long life, Fahamka stands at the precipice of the final journey. This has scared many among the Dervishes, but also given them even greater determination to win this war and fast, so that she may look upon the homeland before age claims her."
HYE_to_recovery:0 "Road To Recovery"
HYE_to_recovery_desc:0 "Though the war against the Storm Empire is over, recovery from it has been slow at best. Matriarch Fahamka has guided us well, but there is still more to be done."

##Tech##
HYE_hyenia_ironpaws:0 "Hyenian Ironpaws"



tech_hye_start:0 "Sustenance and Survival"
tech_hye_start_desc:0 "Our people has always held up endurance as a virtue. In the high mountains and dry deserts you fight against the elements as much as your enemies, and wastefulness will all too easily be your undoing. Living off the land, learning to thrive despite the elements and to make sure your resources last is as much part of warfare as shooting or marching is." 
tech_hye_scavenge:0 "Scavenger Traditions"
tech_hye_scavenge_desc:0 "A gun is a gun, no matter where it came from, and every weapon seized from the enemy is one less that they can make use of as well as one more on our side. We understand this fact, and instead of wastefully throwing away potential tools, we make sure to scour far and wide for any potential equipment."
tech_hye_reinforcement:0 "Repeated Offensives"
tech_hye_reinforcement_desc:0 "Blind attacks cost lives, planned attacks cost time. Being able to reorganize and prepare for another attack faster than our enemy can recover will allow us to keep delivering blow after blow, never relenting and never giving them the opportunity to truly dig in. "
tech_hye_repair:0 "Pre-planned Rebuilding"
tech_hye_repair_desc:0 "We're no strangers to war and destruction, enough that we know that it is not the end if our enemy seizes important assets, not as long as we can reclaim them and restore them quickly. If we reclaim what is ours, the faster we can put it back into working condition, the better."
tech_hye_exp:0 "Scout Teachers" 
tech_hye_exp_desc:0 "To fight your enemy, you must know your enemy, and those among us who lead the way and guide our forces know more than most. As new warpups join the fight, they can learn from our scouts and be better equipped for the fight that awaits."
tech_hye_scavenge2:0 "Waste not, want not"
tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out  their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete.  "
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."
tech_dervishes_a:0 "Dervish Division IV"
tech_dervishes_a_desc:0 "As a dervish grows and develops their skills, they are expected to share their knowledge with their fellow dervishes. The most veteran of them travel among the dervishes, constantly documenting and evaluating the lessons learned so that all might share in this knowledge."
tech_dervishes_b:0 "Dervish Division V"
tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."
tech_dervishes_c:0 "Dervish Division VI"
tech_dervishes_c_desc:0 "The eleventh century has already shown that it will be a bloody one, but in this grim era, the dervishes will continue to be dilligent students."


tech_hyena_misc:0 "Extractive Metallurgy"
tech_hyena_misc_desc:0 "Few species can claim to be as proficient and skilled in digging and burrowing tunnels as the Diamond Dogs. From an early age, pups are known to bore their own tunnels, searching for the mineral goods hidden beneath the ground. Although industrial mining is not done with bare paws, it remains a priority to improve our equipment and improve safety standards, so that dogs may continue to profit from the riches of the earth."
tech_hyena_misc2:0 "Underground Construction"
tech_hyena_misc2_desc:0 "Most dogs prefer living under the ground, and few venture to the surface by choice. Subterranean environment breeds a hardy species, and the need for safety and protection of our riches makes it necessary to construct vast cities and vaults beneath the surface."
tech_hyena_misc3:0 "Underground Construction II"
tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"
tech_hyena_misc_b_desc:0 "Few things make the dogs happier than a long day at the forge, creating both consumer goods and military equipment for their nation. It is vital to modernise our production centres, so that the state as a whole may benefit and progress further."
tech_hyena_misc_c:0 "Modern Mining Industry"
tech_hyena_misc_c_desc:0 "Unparalleled in both our resource output and technologies utilised in the process, the Diamond Dogs are at the forefront of any major excavation project in the world."
tech_hyena_army:0 "Mountain Home"
tech_hyena_army_desc:0 "The dog biology makes them particularly adapt in crossing rough environment, such as hills and mountains. Training our soldiers how to be better handle the terrain while carrying heavy equipment would improve the speed of our operations."
ME_MOUNTAIN_HOME_TOOLTIP:0 "    §YMountain§!: Movement: §G+10%§!\n    §YHill§!: Movement: §G+5%§!\n"
tech_hyena_army2:0 "Mountain Training"
tech_hyena_army2_desc:0 "Specialised tactics and strategies are required to perform optimally in the rough terrain dogs call home."
tech_hyena_army2_tt:0 "    §YMountain§!:\n     Attack: §G+15%§!\n     Defence: §G+5%§!\n§Y    Hill§!:\n     Attack: §G+7%§!\n     Defence: §G+3%§!\n"
tech_hyena_army_atk3:0 "Offensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_atk3_desc:0 "Few species read the ground as well as the dogs. Trained sappers will bypass enemy fortifications with multiple tunnels from which our forces can attack, trapping the defenders from both sides."
tech_hyena_army_def3:0 "Defensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_def3_desc:0 "There is no firmer trench than one located underground. Our foes' numbers and airplanes will matter little once they are forced to attack us in our underground fortifications."
tech_hyena_army4:0 "Advanced Fortifications"
tech_hyena_army4_desc:0 "The sheer amount of resources dogs possess makes it particularly easy for them to establish defences wherever they are needed, in a short amount of time."
tech_hyena_army5:0 "Mountain Training II"
tech_hyena_army5_desc:0 "Further improvements in our mountain fighting tehniques will make dogs the unmatched force when it comes to battles on our terrain of choice."
tech_hyena_army5_tt:0 "    §YMountain§!:\n     Attack: §G+5%§!\n     Defence: §G+5%§!\n§Y    Hill§!:\n     Attack: §G+3%§!\n     Defence: §G+2%§!\n"
tech_hyena_army6:0 "Advanced Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army6_desc:0 "A Diamond Dog tunnel is perhaps the safest place one can be during an air raid. It is simply very wasteful to destroy the very ground itself, even with modern explosives."

##Initial Tree##

HYE_assemble_the_qaylid:0 "Calling For All Dervishes"
HYE_assemble_the_qaylid_desc:0 "The murderous Storm King lies dead in the far north, and his lackeys have turned on each other in a frenzied scramble for power. This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our Great Teacher Fahamka gathers all warriors, for it is time to take back our homeland."
HYE_organize_the_resistance:0 "Organising Our Cadres"
HYE_organize_the_resistance_desc:0 "When we strike we will not be engaging in guerilla warfare or raids, but rather we will advance on a wide front with forces in the thousands. We must be prepared for this, and make sure that our commanders are prepared to wield forces of this kind."
HYE_dedicate_our_souls:0 "Dedicate Our Souls"
HYE_dedicate_our_souls_desc:0 "Death is where the final word is written in your life's book. It is natural and good to not seek it lightly, but we must be prepared to meet it all the same. The prize will be our homeland freed, and if we must pay with our lives, then that is the price we must pay."
HYE_make_the_cause_known:0 "Make The Cause Known"
HYE_make_the_cause_known_desc:0 "Hyenia was arrogant, and she stood alone against the Storm King when he came. In defeat, she was humbled, and the Great Teacher has not hesitated to plead with our neighbors for assistance. Thankfully, we have been blessed with a neighbour both kind and just in equal measure."
HYE_liberate_our_kin:0 "Liberate Our Kin"
HYE_liberate_our_kin_desc:0 "The day has come to finally strike. From the pups that grew up refugees and remember their homeland only in childhood memories, to the hard-bitten desert dogs who have carried this fight since before even the storm king - we all know the one truth of tomorrow.\n\nGeeri ama Guul: Death or Victory"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles:0 "Request Help From The Gargoyles"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "Between the tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Gargiloya and the Storm King's rampage, the gargoyles have plenty of reasons to want to see the yetis pushed back. We just hope they will see that."
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs:0 "Request Help From The Centaurs"
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs_desc:0 "The prideful centaurs are our ancestral enemies, but they too have suffered the ravages of the Storm King. They would rather have us as neighbors than the yetis, and if they give us weapons for this struggle, they will have much to gain."
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful:0 "Tunnel Raids"
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful_desc:0 "As the conflict grinds on, we must acquire weapons wherever we can. Our kin in the deep tunnels have offered to "procure" some for us. Normally, this would come with strings and caveats, not the least questions from the former owners, but right now we are not in a position to be choosy." 
HYE_beat_them_back:0 "Give Them No Quarter"
HYE_beat_them_back_desc:0 "They can run as they please. We will be hot on their tails and rip and tear wherever they go. Hesitation today will let the strike again tomorrow, so we must move as fast as we can."
HYE_bite_to_the_bone:0 "Bite To The Bone"
HYE_bite_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The valleys and mountains of our homeland have always been a mighty shield, and it now serves the enemy. We must commit wholly wherever we strike, and push through no matter the cost."
HYE_wherever_they_are:0 "Wherever They Are"
HYE_wherever_they_are_desc:0 "The mountains and the forests of the valley are familiar to us, and if the yetis think that they can use these places against us then they will be sorely mistaken."
HYE_we_will_fight_them:0 "We Will Fight"
HYE_we_will_fight_them_desc:0 "Many of our brothers and sisters may have fallen in the struggle, but in death they have given us hope. Hope rouses the despairing, and gives them the strength to pick up where the heroes left them."
HYE_until_we_are_victorious:0 "Until We Are Victorious"
HYE_until_we_are_victorious_desc:0 "We are committed with our hearts, our blood and indeed our very lives to ensure victory. The yetis keep defying us, and we must redouble our efforts to send them packing back whence they came. No matter the losses, no matter the fighting, we cannot stop here!"
HYE_homecoming:0 "Homecoming"
HYE_homecoming_desc:0 "On the eve of our victory, a new challenge stands before us. We had thought the royal house undone, but its last scion - princess Jawharad - has returned to once again ascend the Malachite Throne. Our ranks rumble with discontent, and the Great Teacher has stated her intent to meet with the princess, rather than to risk civil war following the war of liberation."

hyenia.1.t:0 "The Dawn of the Last Campaign" #assemble the qaylid
hyenia.1.d:0 ""Even the pretense of unity is long gone, and they are tearing each other apart. Outside threats can't unite them any longer." The Great Teacher sat cross-legged on the small carpet as the hundred gathered dervishes in front of her listened silently. In the cavern, there was not a single sound but her voice. "I have heard the whispers and the anger you feel. You would have struck earlier, but the beast we face is not one we can take on alone. Now that they have fallen apart, we will ready ourselves. Even if their spies among us will scream their warnings, they cannot do much." The accusations of spies made one hyena in the back startle and glance around herself. Slowly, she began backing away only to feel a knife against her back.\n\n"Stand still," a soft murmur told her as she felt a stab of terror shoot through her. She had not even noticed him! "After this meeting you will plead with her for mercy, and tell her all you know. Choose life, or your story ends here." She nodded mutely, and the knife was removed from her back before its wielder - a lithe little male almost a head shorter than her - stepped up beside her.\n\n"Dervishes!" another female spoke up now, her booming voice contrasting with the Great Teacher's. She towered high over most of them, wearing her heavy armor like it was nothing. "We have fought, and we have bled, but the war that awaits is like nothing else. We no longer retreat when facing stiff opposition, we push! We beat and we stab, we shoot and we slash. By blade and bullet and bomb we will whip these apes back whence they came! We will free our people and raise our banners over Qalbi Weyn, or we will die trying! Death or Victory, there is no other choice!""
hyenia.1.a:0 "The cave thundered with the hyenas' response."
hyenia.2.t:0 "The Task Forces" #organize the resistance
hyenia.2.d:0 ""When we move, we must commit ourselves to move for days or indeed weeks if we have to. Our greatest concern will be to not outpace our supply caravans. If we do, we may well end up trapped deep in hostile territory. Our homeland has been under control for years, and the yetis will know how to fight in it. The mountains are their walls, not ours, and we will have to be relentless whenever we find a breakthrough." Furasho ran the back of her claw over the map as she indicated the routes they'd have to take through the mountain to the gathered commanders. It was exhilarating to realize that she would soon lay eyes on her lost home again. So much had changed since she fled Guur Dhurwaa, barely more than a pup that would be reborn in Ciidacirood.\n\n"All the supplies in the world won't matter if we can't push past the yetis." Masaska's voice made Furasho grit her teeth as she watched the small male across the table. Again and again he had to speak up against her. He stalked the corner of her eyes these days, and what once had been merely the Great Teacher's shadow was now speaking and acting of his own volition, seemingly always in opposition to her. "They won't be able to protect the entire front line, and if we can slip past them, we will be the ones to trap them. We will need to move as fast as we can, outrun our supplies if we need to, because speed will be everything."\n\n"You moved with warbands of a few dozen, not with thousands. I honor your accomplishments, and I hear your counsel, but this is different." She kept her words measured, though she felt the annoyance surge in her as he kept staring on the map.\n\n"I still moved through them, and those very thousands will be caught in a mountainous deathtrap if we are not fast enough." Raising his head, Masaska looked straight back at Furasho, unperturbed even as she unintentionally bared her teeth in frustration."    
hyenia.2.a:0 "Masaska is heard, and we shall move as fast as we can."
hyenia.2.b:0 "Furasho's counsel holds, and we will be inexorable in our advance."
hyenia.3.t:0 "Pledging Oneself, Mind and Body" #dedicate our souls
hyenia.3.d:0 "Even after a lifetime of contemplation and introspection, Fahamka admitted willingly that divining the future was futile. When she had sat beneath the stars that night, many decades ago, and started down the path to enlightenment, she had thought her life would be humble. The idea that she would sit here, the heart and soul of an army of thousands, was so alien as to be laughable, yet no one was laughing now.\n\nShe watched the young pups in front of her. They sat as if trying to affect the confidence of seasoned warriors, yet their inexperience and uncertainty were both all too obvious. So much potential, so much future, and it would all be spent on the slopes of Guur Dhurwaa. Though mighty Furasho would drill them ruthlessly, and dear little Masaska would show them the hidden paths and how to keep out of sight, she knew that many of them would not live when Qalbi Weyn finally was freed. They were clay to be molded into vessels in which the future would be carried, and she was the one molding them. They looked at her in silence, waiting for her to address them. She would speak, once again serving the role of the old and mighty who sent the young and eager to fight and die.\n\n'I'm sorry for what I am about to condemn you to, little ones.'"  
hyenia.3.a:0 ""The thousandth step is as important as the first. This is the virtue of endurance..."" #Masaskas option
hyenia.3.b:0 ""A strike needs one breath, a war needs a million. This is the virtue of recovery..."" #Furashos option
hyenia.4.t:0 "Beseeching the Chainbreaker" #make the cause known
hyenia.4.d:0 "Few have been a closer friend to hyenakind in these dark times than the Chainbreaker of Hayzeb. Born into slavery, Bamina rose up after the Storm King's rampage and led her fellow slaves in a long, drawn out war of liberation. Stalking the eastern reaches of Hayzeb, her bands often came into contact with the dervishes, and a mutual understanding as well as friendship quickly established itself between them. Standing back to back, the Chainbreaker and the dervishes have carried on their respective struggles, aiding each other wherever possible.\n\nThrough her determination and the zeal of her warriors, as well as the aid given to her by Masaska's warrior bands, Bamina has now ascended the Hayzeb throne. She has not forgotten the aid we gave her, and she now returns the favour with interest."
hyenia.4.a:0 "Thousands upon thousands of warriors have been sent, armed and determined to fight." #Masaskas option
hyenia.4.b:0 "A cadre of her finest and most well equipped warriors are coming to our aid." #Furashos option
hyenia.5.t:0 "So it Begins" #Liberation war against Thundaria
hyenia.5.d:0 "All along the border regions, thousands of warriors had gathered. They hid in valleys and tunnels and behind ridges, all waiting for the dawn that would see them strike. The night lay heavy over them, and they studied their attack plans in the light of campfires and lanterns, they meditated and prayed, and they sat together around the fires, all steeling themselves for what awaited in the morning. Further away, shadows moved under the light of the moon towards the mountains as Masaska's chosen dervishes moved into position. When dawn came, they would strike not from the front, but from behind, and open up the path for their kin.\n\nAnd as the first rays of the sun became visible on the horizon, the assembled warriors began to move. Thousands upon thousands picked up their weapons and gear, found their formations and began to move towards their stolen mountain home.\n\nSoon, the horizon began to echo with the sound of battle."
hyenia.5.a:0 "As one, we will return home."
hyenia.6.t:0 "The Thundarians Yield"
hyenia.6.d:0 "The warlord that has taken up residence in Qalbi Weyn has sent us an offer of surrender. In return for the safe passage of him and his warriors out of Hyenia, he will surrender unconditionally, leaving behind the wealth he plundered and the slaves he took among us. Fighting him until the last of his warriors lay dead would only cause more suffering for our people. Let him go back whence he came and be a headache for other yetis instead of us. We are finally free, and we can finally return to our homeland!"
hyenia.6.a:0 "Ha ha ha! We won!"
hyenia.7.t:0 "The Last Princess" #Jawharad and her aides arrive
hyenia.7.d:0 "The sound of gunfire roared further up the slopes as hundreds of armed hyenas poured off the multitude of boats that had landed all along the coast. Explosions in the distance mingled with shouted orders, distant screaming and the rumbling of hundreds of paws across the rocky beach. It all came together in a terrifying cacophony of war, and princess Jawharad had to force herself to stand tall and calm as she stepped off the boat and onto her native soil.\n\n"Your majesty!" The large guard captain greeted her with a deep bow. "The yetis are in full retreat, and we are seizing control of the harbour as well as their supply caches. As it stands, our forces will be ready to start pushing for Qalbi Weyn before nightfall. I must humbly admit that your attack plan seemed audacious, but it has worked out flawlessly." Jawharad merely smiled in response and nodded to him. Yes... 'her' attack plan. The plan that had been slipped into her room a few months earlier by the little shadow that had visisted her ever since she was a child. The plan which had detailed how the Yetis would panic when the dervishes struck and how they would rush all their troops to the border, leaving their backs wide open for her forces to strike. She still did not know who the little shadow was, but she knew that if she would ever ascend the Malachite Throne, this was the time. After twelve years in exile, she was finally returning home along with thousands of hyena refugees, armed and prepared to reclaim their homeland no matter the hardships.\n\n"Let the soldiers know they are all heroes, and make sure that they eat well tonight. Feed those who were wounded from my own table, I will not dine in luxury until we have won this war." It was a small gesture, but right now it was all she could give. She listened to the more and more distant sounds of fighting. Beyond the hill in front of her, far away from here, Qalbi Weyn awaited, and after twelve years in exile, it was time to go home."  
hyenia.7.a:0 "We are going home, mother."
hyenia.8.t:0 "A Call from Hyenia" #Gargoyles are asked for aid (they get it)
hyenia.8.d:0 "The Hyenas suffered under the Storm King, even more than we did. Their government was crushed and most of their royal dynasty was slaughtered. Yet even now the dogs aren't broken yet. In the northern desert, packs of warrior mystics called "dervishes" have been fighting the yetis for years. Having gone on the offensive, they're now moving to reclaim their homeland, and they've beseeched us for aid."
hyenia.8.a:0 "Give them whatever we can."
hyenia.8.b:0 "We have nothing to spare."
hyenia.9.t:0 "Princess Jawharad Calls for Aid" #Centaurs are asked for aid (they get it)
hyenia.9.d:0 "After she returned to her homeland, Princess Jawharad of Hyenia has been engaged in a brutal war of reclamation against the yetis who conquered Hyenia. Fighting alongside the warrior mystics of the northern desert, she's pushing had to drive the yetis back from where they came. She has written to [CNT.GetLeader], expressing gratitude for the aid we've already given her, but also asking for whatever additional help we can give."
hyenia.9.a:0 "Of course we will aid her!"
hyenia.9.b:0 "We have done enough."
hyenia.10.t:0 "Forthcoming Aid"
hyenia.10.d:0 "Our please have been answered, and our neighbour has provided us with additional arms for the struggle!"
hyenia.10.a:0 "We are grateful for their aid."
hyenia.11.t:0 "Denied Aid"
hyenia.11.d:0 "Our neighbour has denied our request for aid, stating that they have nothing to spare."
hyenia.11.a:0 "We will win all the same."
hyenia.12.t:0 "The Claimant" #The Qaylidi and remains of the Hyenian nobility show up in Qalbi to talk
hyenia.12.d:0 ""And how long was I meant to be kept from the truth?!" Furasho snarled as she stared Masaska down, towering above the lithe male. Her paws were clenching and unclenching in rage, yet Masaska stood completely still, meeting her gaze impassively. "Not only is that whelp still alive, she returned with an army of her own! Help me understand what your plan was here, because all I'm seeing is that you've aided the pretender to the throne that marginalised and persecuted dervishes!"\n\n"He did so on my behalf," Fahamka's voice made Furasho snap out of her rage, and she stared at the tunnel entrance from which the Great Teacher was entering. Hobbling in, the old female sat down on a bench by the wall, leaning on her cane. "And in your rage, you find the reason for secrecy. No, be still and listen, this is important. You still see the world in terms of rulers and ruled. But we are dervishes, not queens. We teach and guide, we do not rule. Jawharad is a daughter of Hyenia, like you, and the common Hyena gave her their loyalty and followed her, like how hundreds of soldiers joined us because of you."\n\n"Great Teacher, I threw myself before you and pledged my life to your cause. This princess has grown up in insane wealth, believing it to be her birthright, like how she views all of us! I rejected what I was taught, she has not!"\n\n"One cannot blame a student for not learning when their teacher is absent. And besides," Fahamka smiled as she glanced towards Masaska. "She may well have rejected more than you think."\n\n"She has rejected the opulence of her station, she feeds the sick and wounded from her own table, and she landed with the invasion to give them hope and courage." Masaska's voice was a low murmur in contrast to Furasho's booming voice. "Humbly, I believe that she is worthy of being heard out." Fahamka smiled.\n\n"Then we will meet with her, and discuss the future of Hyenia. She has a chance to not be her mother, just like you did."\n\nSlowly, reluctantly, Furasho stepped back and bowed her head. 
hyenia.12.a:0 ""As you say, Great Teacher...""
hyenia.13.t:0 "Heading for the Meeting"
hyenia.13.d:0 ""I still have reservations." Furasho bowed her head as she spoke, doing all she could to remain calm. "Trust is one thing, naivetë is another. If we are to meet her, then we should not go alone. We should bring a thousand warriors at least. Let her bring the same if she needs, but as much as we speak of unity, at least let us not march into this unprepared."\n\n"Do you speak from genuine concern, or are you insistent to find fault or risk where there is none?" Masaska asked pointedly, Furasho glaring at him.\n\n"You keep undermining and questioning me, and I've let it pass, but not this. I am sworn heart and blood to the Qaylid, all I do has been for our people, and you do not get to question that!"\n\n"You two argue like an old married couple," Fahamka chuckled. "I hope that you will invite me when she carries you through the door into your new home." The remark left Furasho blinking and stepping back, she and Masaska both looking to Fahamka in disbelief at her comment. "Now that you both have snapped out of this bickering. I have heard Furasho. What is your view, Masaska? Should we go alone?"\n\n"We could, but I cannot guarantee that it would be safe. If we are to bring warriors along, I would bring a hundred. It will be enough to ensure our security without causing fear. Fahamka nodded slowly at his words."  
hyenia.13.a:0 "You have led our forces well, Furasho. We will do as you say"
hyenia.13.b:0 "I trust your judgement, Masaska. A hundred will be plenty."
hyenia.13.c:0 "The war is won, and we will go alone."
hyenia.14.t:0 "Queen of Hyenia by the Qaylid's Grace"
hyenia.14.d:0 "The meeting between the royalist and qaylidi forces was tense, the ascetic Fahamka and the resplendent Jawharad making for a contrast like day and night. The reports of yeti stragglers in the area had made the situation even more tense, and there was a lull at the start of the negotiations. Who approached who? By ancient custom, Jawharad would be approached, but the dervishes had only ever known the Malachite Throne as a source of persecution and violence, and had fought it for their survival. It left a lull in the negotiations, one broken by Jawharad. Breaking with centuries of ironclad custom, she left her guards behind and approached the dervishes alone, sending ripples of shock through both sides. As she began to move Fahamka followed suit, hobbling towards the princess with her cane in one paw and a rolled up rug under the other. The two meet in the middle of the field, Jawharad once again breaking with tradition and customs as she bowed before Fahamka. \n\n"Greetings, Great Teacher Fahamka. I am honored to finally meet you, and I am in your debt for all that you've done for our people. I come before you today hoping that we can find an accord for the future of our homeland."\n\n"Greetings, Princess Jawharad." Fahamka bowed her head as well. "Your words are kind, and more than I expected from Queen Dahab's daughter." She rolled out the rug on the ground, leaving enough space for the two of them, and sat down in one end. "Now please be seated and tell me how you envision our homeland's future." Jawharad sat down as well\n\n"As I've marched through Hyenia, I have seen the common hyena welcome me with tears of joy. I am their lost past and the desire for peace, but you were the ones who liberated it. That's why I have come to ask for your blessing to ascend the throne, and for the guidance of the Qaylid in rebuilding Hyenia."\n\n"Oh? So no months of jockeying for power, balancing promises and threats to get the advantage?" Fahamka asked mildly. Jawharad returned the smile.\n\n"With your blessing, I will have a homeland to rebuild, and no time for schemes.""

tech_hye_start:0 "Sustenance and Survival"
tech_hye_start_desc:0 "Our people has always held up endurance as a virtue. In the high mountains and dry deserts you fight against the elements as much as your enemies, and wastefulness will all too easily be your undoing. Living off the land, learning to thrive despite the elements and to make sure your resources last is as much part of warfare as shooting or marching is." 
tech_hye_scavenge:0 "Scavenger Traditions"
tech_hye_scavenge_desc:0 "A gun is a gun, no matter where it came from, and every weapon seized from the enemy is one less that they can make use of as well as one more on our side. We understand this fact, and instead of wastefully throwing away potential tools, we make sure to scour far and wide for any potential equipment."
tech_hye_reinforcement:0 "Repeated Offensives"
tech_hye_reinforcement_desc:0 "Blind attacks cost lives, planned attacks cost time. Being able to reorganize and prepare for another attack faster than our enemy can recover will allow us to keep delivering blow after blow, never relenting and never giving them the opportunity to truly dig in. "
tech_hye_repair:0 "Pre-planned Rebuilding"
tech_hye_repair_desc:0 "We're no strangers to war and destruction, enough that we know that it is not the end if our enemy seizes important assets, not as long as we can reclaim them and restore them quickly. If we reclaim what is ours, the faster we can put it back into working condition, the better."
tech_hye_exp:0 "Scout Teachers" 
tech_hye_exp_desc:0 "To fight your enemy, you must know your enemy, and those among us who lead the way and guide our forces know more than most. As new warpups join the fight, they can learn from our scouts and be better equipped for the fight that awaits."
tech_hye_scavenge2:0 "Waste not, want not"
tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out  their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete.  "
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."
tech_dervishes_a:0 "Dervish Division IV"
tech_dervishes_a_desc:0 "As a dervish grows and develops their skills, they are expected to share their knowledge with their fellow dervishes. The most veteran of them travel among the dervishes, constantly documenting and evaluating the lessons learned so that all might share in this knowledge."
tech_dervishes_b:0 "Dervish Division V"
tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."
tech_dervishes_c:0 "Dervish Division VI"
tech_dervishes_c_desc:0 "The eleventh century has already shown that it will be a bloody one, but in this grim era, the dervishes will continue to be dilligent students."


tech_hyena_misc:0 "Extractive Metallurgy"
tech_hyena_misc_desc:0 "Few species can claim to be as proficient and skilled in digging and burrowing tunnels as the Diamond Dogs. From an early age, pups are known to bore their own tunnels, searching for the mineral goods hidden beneath the ground. Although industrial mining is not done with bare paws, it remains a priority to improve our equipment and improve safety standards, so that dogs may continue to profit from the riches of the earth."
tech_hyena_misc2:0 "Underground Construction"
tech_hyena_misc2_desc:0 "Most dogs prefer living under the ground, and few venture to the surface by choice. Subterranean environment breeds a hardy species, and the need for safety and protection of our riches makes it necessary to construct vast cities and vaults beneath the surface."
tech_hyena_misc3:0 "Underground Construction II"
tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"
tech_hyena_misc_b_desc:0 "Few things make the dogs happier than a long day at the forge, creating both consumer goods and military equipment for their nation. It is vital to modernise our production centres, so that the state as a whole may benefit and progress further."
tech_hyena_misc_c:0 "Modern Mining Industry"
tech_hyena_misc_c_desc:0 "Unparalleled in both our resource output and technologies utilised in the process, the Diamond Dogs are at the forefront of any major excavation project in the world."
tech_hyena_army:0 "Mountain Home"
tech_hyena_army_desc:0 "The dog biology makes them particularly adapt in crossing rough environment, such as hills and mountains. Training our soldiers how to be better handle the terrain while carrying heavy equipment would improve the speed of our operations."

tech_hyena_army_atk3:0 "Offensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_atk3_desc:0 "Few species read the ground as well as the dogs. Trained sappers will bypass enemy fortifications with multiple tunnels from which our forces can attack, trapping the defenders from both sides."
tech_hyena_army_def3:0 "Defensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_def3_desc:0 "There is no firmer trench than one located underground. Our foes' numbers and airplanes will matter little once they are forced to attack us in our underground fortifications."
tech_hyena_army4:0 "Advanced Fortifications"
tech_hyena_army4_desc:0 "The sheer amount of resources dogs possess makes it particularly easy for them to establish defences wherever they are needed, in a short amount of time."
tech_hyena_army5:0 "Mountain Training II"
tech_hyena_army5_desc:0 "Further improvements in our mountain fighting tehniques will make dogs the unmatched force when it comes to battles on our terrain of choice."
tech_hyena_army5_tt:0 "    §YMountain§!:\n     Attack: §G+5%§!\n     Defence: §G+5%§!\n§Y    Hill§!:\n     Attack: §G+3%§!\n     Defence: §G+2%§!\n"
tech_hyena_army6:0 "Advanced Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army6_desc:0 "A Diamond Dog tunnel is perhaps the safest place one can be during an air raid. It is simply very wasteful to destroy the very ground itself, even with modern explosives."

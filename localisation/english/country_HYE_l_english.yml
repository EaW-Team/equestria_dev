##Initial Tree##

HYE_assemble_the_qaylid:0 "Calling For All Dervishes"
HYE_assemble_the_qaylid_desc:0 "The murderous Storm King lies dead in the far north, and his lackeys have turned on each other in a frenzied scramble for power. This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our Great Teacher Fahamka gathers all warriors, for it is time to take back our homeland."
HYE_organize_the_resistance:0 "Organising Our Cadres"
HYE_organize_the_resistance_desc:0 "When we strike we will not be engaging in guerilla warfare or raids, but rather we will advance on a wide front with forces in the thousands. We must be prepared for this, and make sure that our commanders are prepared to wield forces of this kind."
HYE_dedicate_our_souls:0 "Dedicate Our Souls"
HYE_dedicate_our_souls_desc:0 "Death is where the final word is written in your life's book. It is natural and good to not seek it lightly, but we must be prepared to meet it all the same. The prize will be our homeland freed, and if we must pay with our lives, then that is the price we must pay."
HYE_make_the_cause_known:0 "Make The Cause Known"
HYE_make_the_cause_known_desc:0 "Hyenia was arrogant, and she stood alone against the Storm King when he came. In defeat, she was humbled, and the Great Teacher has not hesitated to plead with our neighbors for assistance. Thankfully, we have been blessed with a neighbour both kind and just in equal measure."
HYE_liberate_our_kin:0 "Liberate Our Kin"
HYE_liberate_our_kin_desc:0 "The day has come to finally strike. From the pups that grew up refugees and remember their homeland only in childhood memories, to the hard-bitten desert dogs who have carried this fight since before even the storm king - we all know the one truth of tomorrow.\n\nGeeri ama Guul: Death or Victory"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles:0 "Request Help From The Gargoyles"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "Between the tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Gargiloya and the Storm King's rampage, the gargoyles have plenty of reasons to want to see the yetis pushed back. We just hope they will see that."
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs:0 "Request Help From The Centaurs"
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs_desc:0 "The prideful centaurs are our ancestral enemies, but they too have suffered the ravages of the Storm King. They would rather have us as neighbors than the yetis, and if they give us weapons for this struggle, they will have much to gain."
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful:0 "Tunnel Raids"
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful_desc:0 "As the conflict grinds on, we must acquire weapons wherever we can. Our kin in the deep tunnels have offered to "procure" some for us. Normally, this would come with strings and caveats, not the least questions from the former owners, but right now we are not in a position to be choosy." 
HYE_beat_them_back:0 "Give Them No Quarter"
HYE_beat_them_back_desc:0 "They can run as they please. We will be hot on their tails and rip and tear wherever they go. Hesitation today will let the strike again tomorrow, so we must move as fast as we can."
HYE_bite_to_the_bone:0 "Bite To The Bone"
HYE_bite_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The valleys and mountains of our homeland have always been a mighty shield, and it now serves the enemy. We must commit wholly wherever we strike, and push through no matter the cost."
HYE_wherever_they_are:0 "Wherever They Are"
HYE_wherever_they_are_desc:0 "The mountains and the forests of the valley are familiar to us, and if the yetis think that they can use these places against us then they will be sorely mistaken."
HYE_we_will_fight_them:0 "We Will Fight"
HYE_we_will_fight_them_desc:0 "Many of our brothers and sisters may have fallen in the struggle, but in death they have given us hope. Hope rouses the despairing, and gives them the strength to pick up where the heroes left them."
HYE_until_we_are_victorious:0 "Until We Are Victorious"
HYE_until_we_are_victorious_desc:0 "We are committed with our hearts, our blood and indeed our very lives to ensure victory. The yetis keep defying us, and we must redouble our efforts to send them packing back whence they came. No matter the losses, no matter the fighting, we cannot stop here!"
HYE_homecoming:0 "Homecoming"
HYE_homecoming_desc:0 "On the eve of our victory, a new challenge stands before us. We had thought the royal house undone, but its last scion - princess Jawharad - has returned to once again ascend the Malachite Throne. Our ranks rumble with discontent, and the Great Teacher has stated her intent to meet with the princess rather than to risk civil war following the war of liberation." 

##Moderate Furasho##

HYE_fahamkas_blessing:0 "Fahamka's Blessing"
HYE_fahamkas_blessing_desc:0 "Furasho knows who she is, and she knows from where she came. She would not be here if she had not been given the trust of the great teacher. She did not crave this position, and has come before Fahamka to officially ask for her blessing as she takes up the burden of guiding Hyenia."
HYE_gather_the_devout:0 "Gather The Devout"
HYE_gather_the_devout_desc:0 "The games of politics are all too familiar to Furasho, and she knows that no matter how just the cause, it will flounder if not well supported. If her reforms are to succeed, she must ensure that the people are rallied around her vision."
HYE_all_the_right_places:0 "All The Right Places"
HYE_all_the_right_places_desc:0 "A leader is only as strong as her closest. With Hyenia's apparatus of state in tatters, it must be rebuilt from scratch. Yet, a desert insurgency does not produce good ministers, and every position must be staffed with utmost care, so that neither mismanagement nor divided loyalties break it."
HYE_the_qaylid_state:0 "The Qaylid State"
HYE_the_qaylid_state_desc:0 "The Qaylid is the highest truth, revealed to Fahamka and disseminated by the dervishes. Furasho was lost herself, and as she now sees the light, she stands ready to bring this truth to all other hyenas."
HYE_what_we_face:0 "What We Face"
HYE_what_we_face_desc:0 "The yetis are united once again. A new Storm King stands ready to lead them, and they will soon come for us. The terrors of their last invasion is fresh in everyone's memories, and we must ready ourselves for the oncoming storm."
HYE_emergency_conscriptions:0 "Emergency Conscriptions"
HYE_emergency_conscriptions_desc:0 "We've seen what the end result of a yeti invasion is, and we must do everything in our power to stop it. Our people may be dismayed as the dervishes move to counter this threat with the same all-encompassing determination as everything else, but it must be done."
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable:0 "Plan For The Inevitable"
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "It is not a question of if, but when, and we must spend every waking second before then well. Time is our most valuable currency, and we must spend it as carefully and wisely as we ever can if we are to survive this."
HYE_shore_up_our_defences:0 "Shore Up Our Defences"
HYE_shore_up_our_defences_desc:0 "Konkaymaha is our weakest link, the open plains not giving us the protection that the mountains do, and we cannot let them flank us and seize Ciidacirood. Yet if stone and ice cannot shield us, concrete and rebar will."
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun:0 "Open Every Armoury"
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun_desc:0 "A sea of bodies will be nothing but water poured down the drain if they are not suitably equipped. Our old contact network from the war of liberation is still intact, and we must bring in all the resources we can through it."
HYE_dig_our_heels_in:0 "Dig Our Heels In"
HYE_dig_our_heels_in_desc:0 "Every step of the way, every valley and every field, all shall be contested. The yetis are strong, and they are many, but with enough grim determination and preparation, we can bleed them dry."
HYE_preemptive_strike:0 "Preemptive Strike"
HYE_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "The yetis are still tearing at each other, and we have an opportunity. Waiting more will only give them more time to unite and strengthen, and so we must strike now, and deal with them before that."
HYE_assess_the_realm:0 "Assess The Realm"
HYE_assess_the_realm_desc:0 "From the ruins of Qaybi Weyn to the burning fields of Konkaymaha, Hyenia lies wounded and bleeding before us. We must act decisively to heal the nation, and yet to do so we must act with knowledge."
HYE_the_yeti_problem:0 "The Yeti Problem"
HYE_the_yeti_problem_desc:0 "Thousands of yetis moved into Hyenia after the collapse of the queendom. They came to build themselves new homes in the ruins of the hyenas', and they must be dealt with. Yet they are not warriors or pillagers, but many times humble farmers and labourers. Expulsion is the first solution that comes to mind, but it is not an obvious one."
HYE_clean_up_the_surface:0 "Clean Up The Surface"
HYE_clean_up_the_surface_desc:0 "There are still hyenas living in the ruins of their homes after years of war. Before we embark on great projects of rebuilding, we must sweep away the rubble and ensure that the wounds left by the invasion are treated."
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld:0 "Reconnect With The Underworld"
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld_desc:0 "Tens of thousand of hyenas fled into the deep tunnels, and have hidden there ever since behind collapsed tunnels and entrances. Qalbi Weyn is the great entrance into the underground, and we can finally begin digging to reconnect with them and bring them home."
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated:0 "Teach The Uninitiated"
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated_desc:0 "Hyenia is still the queendom in heart and spirit, and she must be taught a new way. Dervishhood is not some high position reserved only for the few, but a spiritual struggle that all hyenas deserve to be part of. Thus, we remake the hyenas, and through them we remake Hyenia."
HYE_prayer_without_worship:0 "Prayer Without Worship"
HYE_prayer_without_worship_desc:0 "The Qaylid makes no claim to represent the voice of a divine will. Those who wish to worship their old gods can still do so, but they will do so in accordance with the values of the Qaylid."
HYE_find_a_place_for_them:0 "Find A Place For Them"
HYE_find_a_place_for_them_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a hyena who does not deserve a place in the world. All have their part to play, and all should be honored for it. In this truth, we create order, and work towards healing."
HYE_pragmatic_dogma:0 "Pragmatic Dogma"
HYE_pragmatic_dogma_desc:0 "Asceticism is virtuous, but telling a starving hyena that her suffering is good is not. There is one truth, but there are also many roads that lead there. Little concessions here and there will ensure that the transformation of our society can happen without driving the suffering to despair."
HYE_contentment_in_community:0 "Contentment In Community"
HYE_contentment_in_community_desc:0 "It takes a village to raise a pup, and no hyena thrives in isolation. The Qaylid's guidance shall be felt even in the smallest village, and no matter how far-flung, our people shall know that we're there for them."
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity:0 "Meaning From Mundanity"
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity_desc:0 "The dream of something new, something better, is so many times an illusion. When the thrill of novelty fades, you are left where you started. The wise know to find purpose in even the small things, and while there will always be those who seek the new, we honor those who can labour and thrive where they stand."
HYE_once_and_for_all:0 "Once And For All"
HYE_once_and_for_all_desc:0 "Whether by luck or by foresight, we have prepared ourselves well enough that we could consider another option: invading them first. It would be the hardest war we've ever fought, but it would spare our lands the suffering."
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt:0 "The Paw We've Been Dealt"
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt_desc:0 "We stand where the Storm King stood, and all the lands the yetis held claim over are now under our control. Yet we have not come to pillage, but to build a lasting peace, and now we embark on the greatest challenge of the dervishes; redeeming the yetis."
HYE_organize_the_armed_forces:0 "Organize The Armed Forces"

HYE_armor_on_everything_desc:0 ""

HYE_shake_off_the_rust:0 "Shake Off The Rust"
HYE_shake_off_the_rust_desc:0 "So much of our industry was left abandoned when the Yetis took over Hyenia. The Storm King's campaign and subsequent civil war meant all that interested them was the production of weapons. There is much to rebuild now thanks to this, but we are patient."
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb:0 "Learn From The Hayzeb"
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb_desc:0 "During our campaign of resistance, we learned much from the Hayzeb, and why should this end now? Our western neighbours may not have the great underground cities or mountain history of Hyenia, but they have achieved great things in other ways, and there is much to learn from them still." 
HYE_common_good:0 "For The Common Hyena"
HYE_common_good_desc:0 "Owning gold means nothing but knowing how to produce gold coins is knowledge, creating them is to shape the future and using them well is to show virtue. This principle is absolute and must be a foundational part of Hyenia's economy. Wasting money while our people could be fed and sheltered is more than waste, it is a sin."
HYE_develop_the_interior:0 "Develop The Interior"
HYE_develop_the_interior_desc:0 "The northwest was our sanctuary for a long time, and though the desert shielded us through being sparsely settled and developed, the Hyenas who live here deserve proper roads and bridges as much as anyone else."
HYE_fields_of_green:0 "Fields Of Gold"
HYE_fields_of_green_desc:0 "The river plains of Konkaymaha have always been highly fertile, but in the wake of the invasion they were largely left fallow except for small scale farming. It is time for these fields to once again be put to good use."
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles:0 "Teach The Jewelers Our Principles"
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles_desc:0 "The Qaylid preaches ascetism, and yet jewelery is one of Hyenia's oldest and most highly regarded arts. We face a conundrum here. Though some zealots would see us shut this tradition down entirely, this would be excessive. Instead, the Jewelers can be guided like all other Hyenas, and their skills and resources can be put to good use serving the people."
HYE_the_second_capital:0 "The Second Capital"
HYE_the_second_capital_desc:0 "Ciidacirood is the birthplace of the Qaylid and the heart of our resistance against the yetis. It has served Hyenia beyond well, and it would be wrong to let it fall back into obscurity. It shall instead become the spiritual capitol of Hyenia, and a mandatory place of pilgrimage for all dervishes."
HYE_word_into_scripture:0 "Word Into Scripture"
HYE_word_into_scripture_desc:0 "The illiterate mind is trapped, and through education it is freed. It learns how to grasp the abstract and the hypothetical, to question and to seek further understanding. Education therefore must be the highest priority if Hyenia is to be reshaped."
HYE_waste_not:0 "Waste Not"
HYE_waste_not_desc:0 "Every scrap of metal, every bit of coal and every drop of water serves a purpose, and making poor use of it is to misunderstand what it means to be a dervish. Everything we have must be evaluated and put to the best possible use, whether you are one or a million."
HYE_nurture_local_talent:0 "Nurture Local Talent"
HYE_nurture_local_talent_desc:0 "The Queendom was a pyramid, with Qalbi Weyn at the top and all others below. The talents and minds of hundreds of thousands were thus wasted, and we shall ensure this never happens again. Every mind, whether urban or rural, is a potential gem that we will use to pay for the future." 
HYE_strip_away_the_excess:0 "Strip Away The Excess"
HYE_strip_away_the_excess_desc:0 "The Queendom was beyond lavish at times, and obscene resources were spent on palaces, statues and other nonsense. There are things that celebrate and inspire the common hyena, and there are things that is nothing but self-gratification for the wealthy. One can stay, the other must be torn down and repurposed for those who suffered for its construction."
HYE_the_value_of_effort:0 "The Value Of Effort"
HYE_the_value_of_effort_desc:0 "To give it your all is to live up to your fullest potential, and this is something to celebrate. Knowing where the limits of one's being lies is to know oneself, and in knowing oneself, one can be in control of one's life." 
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past:0 "Absolve Us From The Past"
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past_desc:0 "Hyenia's past is broken, built on the injustice and greed, and she must be thoroughly reforged. This reforging will not take place in the workshops or the battlefield, however, but in the minds of all hyenas."
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery:0 "Repurpose Yeti Machinery"
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery_desc:0 "For all the devastation and all the suffering that the yetis caused, they did at least rebuild Hyenia somewhat. It may have been to fuel further conquests, but it will aid us all the same. It matters not whence it came, only what we make of it."
HYE_electify_the_underground:0 "Electrify The Underground"
HYE_electify_the_underground_desc:0 "The deep caverns and tunnels below have always been our home, but they have not tasted the fruits of the new era. Even though they more than anywhere else would benefit from the ceaseless illumination of electricity, they've been left in darkness. Once this was acceptable, but no longer."
HYE_develop_the_coastline:0 "Develop The Coastline"
HYE_develop_the_coastline_desc:0 "The coasts were long the most prosperous parts of Hyenia, and with prosperity can come greed. We must continue to nurture and tend to these lands as well, and yet we must do so in such a way that they do not fall prey to these vices again."
HYE_lessons_from_exile:0 "Lessons From Exile"
HYE_lessons_from_exile_desc:0 "When you have much, it is never enough. When you have little, it can become enough. We learned this in the desert, and we remember it in the mountains. We must never lose this care and respect for the resources we use, and utilising these principles will help us."
HYE_give_them_new_purpose:0 "Give Them New Purpose"
HYE_give_them_new_purpose_desc:0 "Many along the coast have weathered these last years with grim determination, hoping to see the old ways reassert themselves one day. Alas, they will never have what they desire, but in their place we will offer them something else."
HYE_blessed_transformation:0 "Blessed Transformation"
HYE_blessed_transformation_desc:0 "Qalbi Weyn has been a splendid city like few others, and we shall make it shine once again. As we face the future, it shall be here to accept any and all who would come to her."
HYE_nationalize_home_industries:0 "Nationalize Home Industries"
HYE_nationalize_home_industries_desc:0 "The landowner has ever been the ones with power in Hyenia, but in recent years they have been challenged by a new kind of elite - the industrialist. We will entertain these new masters as little as any other though, and their factories will be put to use for the good of all hyenas."
HYE_all_for_our_descendants:0 "All For Our Descendants"
HYE_all_for_our_descendants_desc:0 "After tomorrow is another day, and in ten and a hundred years' time there will be yet more days to come. All are equal in importance, and we must not be seduced by the promise of quick returns."
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize:0 "Proselytize To Industrialize"
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize_desc:0 "We are ascetics, not reactionaries, and change is not a necessary evil but the eternal truth of the world. Those who build, invent new tools, and discover new truths in the world are valued and praised in the Qaylid."
HYE_want_not:0 "Want Not"
HYE_want_not_desc:0 "For what purpose do we tread so carefully, and measure the resources we use? Is it so we can gather all the saved wealth in a huge pit and swim around in it like hyperwealthy ducks? We do it all for all hyenas, and thus we must be willing to spend it to ensure they live good and cared for lives."
HYE_unified_in_mind:0 "Unified In Mind"
HYE_unified_in_mind_desc:0 "We need not have absolute consensus, at least as long as we all understand why we do what we do. We listen in order to understand, and we trust each other to do the same. In this, we build unity, and in unity, we build the future."
HYE_here_and_now:0 "Here And Now"
HYE_here_and_now_desc:0 "While the future always beckons us, the homeless and starving need help now, not in ten years' time. The near future promises great struggles, and we must rally to meet it swiftly and with determination."
HYE_united_in_purpose:0 "United In Purpose"
HYE_united_in_purpose_desc:0 "The Great Teacher instructs us to 'lessen the suffering, the division, and the bloodshed of the world' In this, we stand together as one, and though we may disagree on the methods, we do not disagree on the end goal."
HYE_sanctification_of_society:0 "Sanctification Of Society"
HYE_sanctification_of_society_desc:0 "The world is in a constant state of flux, with the potential of the future being forged in the present to become the legacy of the past. Every day, hour and second the eternal tapestry of the world will be woven, and living beings have only one chance to make each choice right. 'What is?' is an irrelevant question in the greater perspective, for existence is a process, not a state."

HYE_princess_returned:0 "Our Princess Returned"
HYE_princess_returned_desc:0 "Let the cheers ring from the mountaintops and over the valleys, for the last scion of the royal house yet lives! Returned from her exile in Senturya, princess Jawharad now stands poised to ascend the Malachite throne.  Before she ascends however, she had pledged to prove herself, and she will only become queen when Hyenia has seen her ability clearly."
HYE_reconnect_with_the_homeland:0 "Reconnect With The Homeland"
HYE_reconnect_with_the_homeland_desc:0 "Hyenia is a stranger to the princess, who even in her childhood only ever saw Qalbi Weyn. Yet the princess is committed to breaking with tradition, and has embarked on a tour of the nation to beyond the gilded halls of the palace."
HYE_recieve_the_matriarchs_blessing:0 "Recieve The Matriarch's Blessing"
HYE_recieve_the_matriarchs_blessing_desc:0 "The tensions between the dervishes and the royalists run deep. If the nation is to heal, these two disparate forces must come together, and princess Jawharad has invited the matriarch of the dervishes, Fahamka, to request her blessing. There is no doubt that the Great Teacher will have many demands to make of the princess to give it, but Jawharad will hear her out."
HYE_our_sisters_under_the_soil:0 "Our Sisters Under The Soil"
HYE_our_sisters_under_the_soil_desc:0 "Princess Jawharad was fortunate to be able to escape to Senturya. Many others were not so luck, and of these many took shelter in the deepest tunnels of the cave complex beneath Hyenia. There, many of them have remained even today, terrified of what the surface holds. We must reconnect with them, and ready the tunnels for future use."
HYE_learn_from_our_past_mistakes:0 "Learn From Our Past Mistakes"
HYE_learn_from_our_past_mistakes_desc:0 "Hyenia's fall was not a foregone conclusion. Despite the bravery of its soldiers and the heroic way they met their opponent, they ultimately failed to counter the Storm King. The princess has ordered a thorough restructuring of the Royal Hyenian Army to ensure that we will be ready in the future, should they come again."
HYE_import_technologies_from_the_pact:0 "Import Technology From The Pact"
HYE_import_technologies_from_the_pact_desc:0 "Hyenia has spent years in ruins, and it has stagnated technologically. If we want to catch up with the rest of the world, we must bow our heads and ask our neighbors for assistance."
HYE_restart_industrial_development:0 "Restart Industrial Development"
HYE_restart_industrial_development_desc:0 "With peace finally returned, the Hyenian foundries and factories can begin to roar again. They have been left in a miserable state by these last years, however, and there will be much work needed to restore them."
HYE_our_dire_commonality:0 "Our Dire Commonality"
HYE_our_dire_commonality_desc:0 "During the occupation, many yetis settled inside the Queendom's borders. They are still there, and must be dealt with somehow. There are those who want to see blood for blood, but the question is if we have not seen enough blood already."
HYE_normalize_relations_with_the_gargoyles:0 "Normalize Relations With The East"
HYE_normalize_relations_with_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "The Ancient Pact's great gamble worked. They backed the hyenian exiles, hoping that the new monarch on the throne would be less belligerent than her predecessor. Princess Jawharad knows this, but she owes much of her success to them all the same. Whatever the reason, the Ancient Pact came to Hyenia's aid in their moment of need, and they have Hyenia's gratitude."
HYE_welcome_back_the_intellectuals:0 "Welcome Back The Intellectuals"
HYE_welcome_back_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "The Malachite Throne acted as the patron for hundreds if not thousands of scholars and scientists before the fall of Hyenia, and many of these learned hyenas are still out there. If we can convince them to return, it will help our research efforts immensely."
HYE_outlaw_private_armies:0 "Outlaw Private Armies"
HYE_outlaw_private_armies_desc:0 "The nobility's private armies were part of the reason for Hyenia's defeat, as the divided chain of command made our response to the invaders slow and ineffective. Normally, challenging the nobles' right to their private armies would risk rebellion, but when outnumbered ten to one by the dervishes, this option is not as attractive."
HYE_entrench_the_dervishes:0 "Entrench The Dervishes"
HYE_entrench_the_dervishes_desc:0 "They rose among refugees and exiles, creating a fully fledged army from nothing and carrying on a relentless war for years. The dervishes have much to teach the Royal Hyenian Army, enough that their teachings shall become the foundation of the new army training regime. They are the army's seniors and teachers, and the army will be eager students."
HYE_establish_the_RAWR:0 "Establish The RAWR"
HYE_establish_the_RAWR_desc:0 "The Gajar/Dhir Cad region, known as the 'watershed', has long been underdeveloped. As the princess landed here, she promised the commoners she met that she would not forget them to focus on Qalbi Weyn as has historically been the case. The founding of the Royal Authority of the Watershed Region is a goal to this end, and will dedicate itself to developing this region."
HYE_reconstruction_efforts:0 "Reconstruction Efforts"
HYE_reconstruction_efforts_desc:0 "Day by day, we labour to rebuild the queendom. Yet rebuilding is only the first step, and those who work to rebuild the society of before the war know that in its wake, something even greater will come."
HYE_bail_out_the_farmers:0 "Bail Out The Farmers"
HYE_bail_out_the_farmers_desc:0 "No hyena can live off scraps, and yet the farmers' fields have many times been long abandoned or turned to pure sustenance farming. Jawharad has seen their plight with her own eyes, and has ordered that they are given all the aid needed to ensure that the Hyenian countryside blooms once again."
HYE_appropriate_yeti_production:0 "Appropriate Yeti Production"
HYE_appropriate_yeti_production_desc:0 "While there are many who gladly would burn every last scrap the yetis left behind, we cannot afford to be so zealous. While they were mainly interested in machines of war, their armories can at least serve us now."
HYE_to_heal_a_nation:0 "To Heal A Nation"
HYE_to_heal_a_nation_desc:0 ""We come out of this last decade unbowed, but scarred and bruised all the same. I cannot take away the pain you have felt, nor can I bring back all that you lost. Yet for all the pain that has been, I promise you one thing; hope. Tomorrow will be better than today, and Hyenia will face the coming dawn with joy.""
HYE_rebuild_the_monarchys_image:0 "Rebuild The Monarchy's Image"
HYE_rebuild_the_monarchys_image_desc:0 "Queen Dahab was a capable queen, but a tyrant all the same, and for all the loyalty the throne held, many viewed her with fear or even hatred. Jawharad is committed to not repeat her mother's mistakes, and will give those who distrust her ample evidence of this."
HYE_out_with_the_old:0 "Out With The Old"
HYE_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "Many of the old institutions of Hyenia were rotten to the core, and despite calls to bring them back, something better must be built from them. "
HYE_knowledge_unbarred:0 "Knowledge Unbarred"
HYE_knowledge_unbarred_desc:0 "No longer shall the state hold a monopoly on science, and even those who speak of controversial topics shall have the right to pursue research without living in fear of the wrath of a capricious patron."
HYE_join_the_ancient_pact:0 "Join The Ancient Pact"
HYE_join_the_ancient_pact_desc:0 "The Gargoyles and Centaurs have been our neighbors, many times enemies, since times immemorial. Yet the storm that battered all our nations has given perspective, and for all our old grievances, we all seek security and stability. If they would have us, we will stand by them."
HYE_seize_whats_left:0 "Seize What Is Left"
HYE_seize_whats_left_desc:0 "There's still much left after the Yetis' conquest, and none of it shall be left in place if it can be seized and put into use for Hyenia's future."
HYE_more_guns_more_safety:0 "More Guns, More Safety"
HYE_more_guns_more_safety_desc:0 "As part of the restructuring of Hyenia, we must accept that this is not going to be the end of it. The clouds of war will darken our skies in the future, and when they do, we will be prepared. "
HYE_the_queendom_renewed:0 "The Queendom Renewed"
HYE_the_queendom_renewed_desc:0 "The banners fly high in the wind and the tapestries sway over the tunnel entrances, all of them emblazoned with the red diamond and the white eye. In these lie a promise to Hyenia, a promise of continuity, yet also progress. Our past remembered, but our future guided."
HYE_ascend_the_malachite_throne:0 "Ascend The Malachite Throne"
HYE_ascend_the_malachite_throne_desc:0 "Princess Jawharad has laboured hard for over a year to show her mettle, and though many might have viewed her with suspicion, she has shown her dedication to Hyena's healing and prosperity. With the approval of her people and of the dervishes, Princess Jawharad now shall be crowned Queen Jawharad."
HYE_a_meeting_with_the_king:0 "A Meeting With His Highness"
HYE_a_meeting_with_the_king_desc:0 "More than anycreature else, King Golian taught Jawharad the importance of benevolence. Those who fear their leaders will obey, but those who love them will be willing die for them."

hyenia.1.t:0 "The Dawn of the Last Campaign" #assemble the qaylid
hyenia.1.d:0 ""Even the pretense of unity is long gone, and they are tearing each other apart. Outside threats can't unite them any longer." The Great Teacher sat cross-legged on the small carpet as the hundred gathered dervishes in front of her listened silently. In the cavern, there was not a single sound but her voice. "I have heard the whispers and the anger you feel. You would have struck earlier, but the beast we face is not one we can take on alone. Now that they have fallen apart, we will ready ourselves. Even if their spies among us will scream their warnings, they cannot do much." The accusations of spies made one hyena in the back startle and glance around herself. Slowly, she began backing away only to feel a knife against her back.\n\n"Stand still," a soft murmur told her as she felt a stab of terror shoot through her. She had not even noticed him! "After this meeting you will plead with her for mercy, and tell her all you know. Choose life, or your story ends here." She nodded mutely, and the knife was removed from her back before its wielder - a lithe little male almost a head shorter than her - stepped up beside her.\n\n"Dervishes!" another female spoke up now, her booming voice contrasting with the Great Teacher's. She towered high over most of them, wearing her heavy armor like it was nothing. "We have fought, and we have bled, but the war that awaits is like nothing else. We no longer retreat when facing stiff opposition, we push! We beat and we stab, we shoot and we slash. By blade and bullet and bomb we will whip these apes back whence they came! We will free our people and raise our banners over Qalbi Weyn, or we will die trying! Death or Victory, there is no other choice!""
hyenia.1.a:0 "The cave thundered with the hyenas' response."
hyenia.2.t:0 "The Task Forces" #organize the resistance
hyenia.2.d:0 ""When we move, we must commit ourselves to move for days or indeed weeks if we have to. Our greatest concern will be to not outpace our supply caravans. If we do, we may well end up trapped deep in hostile territory. Our homeland has been under control for years, and the yetis will know how to fight in it. The mountains are their walls, not ours, and we will have to be relentless whenever we find a breakthrough." Furasho ran the back of her claw over the map as she indicated the routes they'd have to take through the mountain to the gathered commanders. It was exhilarating to realize that she would soon lay eyes on her lost home again. So much had changed since she fled Guur Dhurwaa, barely more than a pup that would be reborn in Ciidacirood.\n\n"All the supplies in the world won't matter if we can't push past the yetis." Masaska's voice made Furasho grit her teeth as she watched the small male across the table. Again and again he had to speak up against her. He stalked the corner of her eyes these days, and what once had been merely the Great Teacher's shadow was now speaking and acting of his own volition, seemingly always in opposition to her. "They won't be able to protect the entire front line, and if we can slip past them, we will be the ones to trap them. We will need to move as fast as we can, outrun our supplies if we need to, because speed will be everything."\n\n"You moved with warbands of a few dozen, not with thousands. I honor your accomplishments, and I hear your counsel, but this is different." She kept her words measured, though she felt the annoyance surge in her as he kept staring on the map.\n\n"I still moved through them, and those very thousands will be caught in a mountainous deathtrap if we are not fast enough." Raising his head, Masaska looked straight back at Furasho, unperturbed even as she unintentionally bared her teeth in frustration."    
hyenia.2.a:0 "Masaska is heard, and we shall move as fast as we can."
hyenia.2.b:0 "Furasho's counsel holds, and we will be inexorable in our advance."
hyenia.3.t:0 "Pledging Oneself, Mind and Body" #dedicate our souls
hyenia.3.d:0 "Even after a lifetime of contemplation and introspection, Fahamka admitted willingly that divining the future was futile. When she had sat beneath the stars that night, many decades ago, and started down the path to enlightenment, she had thought her life would be humble. The idea that she would sit here, the heart and soul of an army of thousands, was so alien as to be laughable, yet no one was laughing now.\n\nShe watched the young pups in front of her. They sat as if trying to affect the confidence of seasoned warriors, yet their inexperience and uncertainty were both all too obvious. So much potential, so much future, and it would all be spent on the slopes of Guur Dhurwaa. Though mighty Furasho would drill them ruthlessly, and dear little Masaska would show them the hidden paths and how to keep out of sight, she knew that many of them would not live when Qalbi Weyn finally was freed. They were clay to be molded into vessels in which the future would be carried, and she was the one molding them. They looked at her in silence, waiting for her to address them. She would speak, once again serving the role of the old and mighty who sent the young and eager to fight and die.\n\n'I'm sorry for what I am about to condemn you to, little ones.'"

hyenia.4.d:0 "Few have been a closer friend to hyenakind in these dark times than the Chainbreaker of Hayzeb. Born into slavery, Bamina rose up after the Storm King's rampage and led her fellow slaves in a long, drawn out war of liberation. Stalking the eastern reaches of Hayzeb, her bands often came into contact with the dervishes, and a mutual understanding as well as friendship quickly established itself between them. Standing back to back, the Chainbreaker and the dervishes have carried on their respective struggles, aiding each other wherever possible.\n\nThrough her determination and the zeal of her warriors, as well as the aid given to her by Masaska's warrior bands, Bamina has now ascended the Hayzeb throne. She has not forgotten the aid we gave her, and she now returns the favour with interest."

hyenia.5.d:0 "All along the border regions, thousands of warriors had gathered. They hid in valleys and tunnels and behind ridges, all waiting for the dawn that would see them strike. The night lay heavy over them, and they studied their attack plans in the light of campfires and lanterns, they meditated and prayed, and they sat together around the fires, all steeling themselves for what awaited in the morning. Further away, shadows moved under the light of the moon towards the mountains as Masaska's chosen dervishes moved into position. When dawn came, they would strike not from the front, but from behind, and open up the path for their kin.\n\nAnd as the first rays of the sun became visible on the horizon, the assembled warriors began to move. Thousands upon thousands picked up their weapons and gear, found their formations and began to move towards their stolen mountain home.\n\nSoon, the horizon began to echo with the sound of battle."

Fighting him until the last of his warriors lay dead would only cause more suffering for our people. Let him go back whence he came and be a headache for other yetis instead of us. We are finally free, and we can finally return to our homeland!"

hyenia.7.t:0 "The Last Princess" #Jawharad and her aides arrive
hyenia.7.d:0 "The sound of gunfire roared further up the slopes as hundreds of armed hyenas poured off the multitude of boats that had landed all along the coast. Explosions in the distance mingled with shouted orders, distant screaming and the rumbling of hundreds of paws across the rocky beach. It all came together in a terrifying cacophony of war, and princess Jawharad had to force herself to stand tall and calm as she stepped off the boat and onto her native soil.\n\n"Your majesty!" The large guard captain greeted her with a deep bow. "The yetis are in full retreat, and we are seizing control of the harbour as well as their supply caches. As it stands, our forces will be ready to start pushing for Qalbi Weyn before nightfall. I must humbly admit that your attack plan seemed audacious, but it has worked out flawlessly." Jawharad merely smiled in response and nodded to him. Yes... 'her' attack plan. The plan that had been slipped into her room a few months earlier by the little shadow that had visited her ever since she was a child. The plan which had detailed how the Yetis would panic when the dervishes struck and how they would rush all their troops to the border, leaving their backs wide open for her forces to strike. She still did not know who the little shadow was, but she knew that if she would ever ascend the Malachite Throne, this was the time. After twelve years in exile, she was finally returning home along with thousands of hyena refugees, armed and prepared to reclaim their homeland no matter the hardships.\n\n"Let the soldiers know they are all heroes, and make sure that they eat well tonight. Feed those who were wounded from my own table, I will not dine in luxury until we have won this war." It was a small gesture, but right now it was all she could give. She listened to the more and more distant sounds of fighting. Beyond the hill in front of her, far away from here, Qalbi Weyn awaited, and after twelve years in exile, it was time to go home."

hyenia.12.d:0 ""And how long was I meant to be kept from the truth?!" Furasho snarled as she stared Masaska down, towering above the lithe male. Her paws were clenching and unclenching in rage, yet Masaska stood completely still, meeting her gaze impassively. "Not only is that whelp still alive, she returned with an army of her own! Help me understand what your plan was here, because all I'm seeing is that you've aided the pretender to the throne that marginalised and persecuted dervishes!"\n\n"He did so on my behalf," Fahamka's voice made Furasho snap out of her rage, and she stared at the tunnel entrance from which the Great Teacher was entering. Hobbling in, the old female sat down on a bench by the wall, leaning on her cane. "And in your rage, you find the reason for secrecy. No, be still and listen, this is important. You still see the world in terms of rulers and ruled. But we are dervishes, not queens. We teach and guide, we do not rule. Jawharad is a daughter of Hyenia, like you, and the common Hyena gave her their loyalty and followed her, like how hundreds of soldiers joined us because of you."\n\n"Great Teacher, I threw myself before you and pledged my life to your cause. This princess has grown up in insane wealth, believing it to be her birthright, like how she views all of us! I rejected what I was taught, she has not!"\n\n"One cannot blame a student for not learning when their teacher is absent. And besides," Fahamka smiled as she glanced towards Masaska. "She may well have rejected more than you think."\n\n"She has rejected the opulence of her station, she feeds the sick and wounded from her own table, and she landed with the invasion to give them hope and courage." Masaska's voice was a low murmur in contrast to Furasho's booming voice. "Humbly, I believe that she is worthy of being heard out." Fahamka smiled.\n\n"Then we will meet with her, and discuss the future of Hyenia. She has a chance to not be her mother, just like you did."\n\nSlowly, reluctantly, Furasho stepped back and bowed her head. 
hyenia.12.a:0 ""As you say, Great Teacher...""
hyenia.13.t:0 "Heading for the Meeting"
hyenia.13.d:0 ""I still have reservations." Furasho bowed her head as she spoke, doing all she could to remain calm. "Trust is one thing, naivetë is another. If we are to meet her, then we should not go alone. We should bring a thousand warriors at least. Let her bring the same if she needs, but as much as we speak of unity, at least let us not march into this unprepared."\n\n"Do you speak from genuine concern, or are you insistent to find fault or risk where there is none?" Masaska asked pointedly, Furasho glaring at him.\n\n"You keep undermining and questioning me, and I've let it pass, but not this. I am sworn heart and blood to the Qaylid, all I do has been for our people, and you do not get to question that!"\n\n"You two argue like an old married couple," Fahamka chuckled. "I hope that you will invite me when she carries you through the door into your new home." The remark left Furasho blinking and stepping back, she and Masaska both looking to Fahamka in disbelief at her comment. "Now that you both have snapped out of this bickering. I have heard Furasho. What is your view, Masaska? Should we go alone?"\n\n"We could, but I cannot guarantee that it would be safe. If we are to bring warriors along, I would bring a hundred. It will be enough to ensure our security without causing fear. Fahamka nodded slowly at his words."  
hyenia.13.a:0 "You have led our forces well, Furasho. We will do as you say"
hyenia.13.b:0 "I trust your judgement, Masaska. A hundred will be plenty."
hyenia.13.c:0 "The war is won, and we will go alone."
hyenia.14.t:0 "Queen of Hyenia by the Qaylid's Grace"
hyenia.14.d:0 "The meeting between the royalist and qaylidi forces was tense, the ascetic Fahamka and the resplendent Jawharad making for a contrast like day and night. The reports of yeti stragglers in the area had made the situation even more tense, and there was a lull at the start of the negotiations. Who approached who? By ancient custom, Jawharad would be approached, but the dervishes had only ever known the Malachite Throne as a source of persecution and violence, and had fought it for their survival. It left a lull in the negotiations, one broken by Jawharad. Breaking with centuries of ironclad custom, she left her guards behind and approached the dervishes alone, sending ripples of shock through both sides. As she began to move Fahamka followed suit, hobbling towards the princess with her cane in one paw and a rolled up rug under the other. The two meet in the middle of the field, Jawharad once again breaking with tradition and customs as she bowed before Fahamka. \n\n"Greetings, Great Teacher Fahamka. I am honored to finally meet you, and I am in your debt for all that you've done for our people. I come before you today hoping that we can find an accord for the future of our homeland."\n\n"Greetings, Princess Jawharad." Fahamka bowed her head as well. "Your words are kind, and more than I expected from Queen Dahab's daughter." She rolled out the rug on the ground, leaving enough space for the two of them, and sat down in one end. "Now please be seated and tell me how you envision our homeland's future." Jawharad sat down as well\n\n"As I've marched through Hyenia, I have seen the common hyena welcome me with tears of joy. I am their lost past and the desire for peace, but you were the ones who liberated it. That's why I have come to ask for your blessing to ascend the throne, and for the guidance of the Qaylid in rebuilding Hyenia."\n\n"Oh? So no months of jockeying for power, balancing promises and threats to get the advantage?" Fahamka asked mildly. Jawharad returned the smile.\n\n"With your blessing, I will have a homeland to rebuild, and no time for schemes.""
hyenia.14.a:0 "The Qaylid will guide you, and the Dervishes will aid you, Princess Jawharad"
hyenia.15.t:0 "The Ambush"
hyenia.15.d:0 "No matter what has been, the future will always give new challenges. Complacency is to take your previous good work and use it to justify sloth, and it is one of the most insidious forms this vice can take. As the delegation reached the meeting point, facing the monarchists this became evident when one of the dervishes dropped dead, struck by a bullet. Though at first they feared treason, the truth became clear when armed yetis rose out of the terrain around them.\n\nBoth sides, having come to this place hoping for a diplomatic solution, had not brought more weapons than needed, and were forced to run for cover. Whether driven by desperate courage or sheer hateful spite, the yetis had received one chance to take revenge for their defeat and they took it. Storm creatures - the yetis' mute elite warriors - descended on them, prepared to rip the insolent dogs apart. Yet as so many had learned before, the Dervishes treated paw-to-paw combat no less seriously than any other. A loud ringing like that of a bell filled the air as the roaring Furasho smashed one of the storm creatures' faceplate in with her heavy steel gauntlets, leading the dervish counter charge.\n\nThe royalists, however, were another story. Its ranks formed from refugees and survivors, they had never studied under the Great Teacher, nor had they the same knowledge of close-quarters fighting. The ambush turned into a slaughter, and though the princess tried to flee, she was cornered before long by the creatures, who struck with the intent to kill."
hyenia.15.a:0 "Moving like the wind, Masaska's shadowdancers reached her just in time."
hyenia.15.b:0 "Too late, all they could do was take revenge."
hyenia.16.t:0 "The Dervish Protectors" 
hyenia.16.d:0 "The yetis hoped for one last act of defiance against the hyenas, but all they reaped was blood and death. When the battle finally ended, both Fahamka and the princess were both alive, even if the latter was alone among her servants. Surrounded by corpses, Jawharad sat paralysed with terror as Masaska whipped the blood off his sword in front of her. The Storm Creature who had been just about to kill Jawharad lay headless in front of her, and all around her lay a terrible scene of carnage.\n\n "Beddelaad?" Jawharad asked, looking around herself in shock, Masaska walking up to her and gently removing his cloak. He knew whom she meant, the old advisor he had spotted when visiting her before. A faithful old servant, one who had been like a father to her, now dead like all the others. She did not need to see that. "W-where is Beddelaad?!"\n\n"It's all right," Masaska whispered, placing the cloak on her shoulders and raising the hood. That way she would not see the corpse of the male she called for a few meters away. "You are safe. You know me," he told her quietly. "Little Shadow?" his eyes creased a little as he tried to smile behind the veil he wore. That this would be the first time they could meet like this... Yet, Jawharad recognized him it seemed, her eyes focused on him and she gave up a small noise of recognition. "You are safe, nobody will hurt you. We swore to protect Hyenia, and we will protect you."\n\nPrincess Jawharad, a pup when her homeland fell, forced to mature too fast to become the leader they said she had to be... all he could see was a broken soul who had lost everything, and like how Fahamka had done in the ruins of his home all those years ago, he gently urged her to stand up. He looked around the gathered dervishes, steel in his voice. "I swear we will protect you and all of Hyenia. You all are safe, we will make sure of that."\n\nFahamka, watching the scene in silence, couldn't help but smile sadly. Little Masaska... who understood the Qaylid more deeply than him, the one who had lived in her shadow for so long? Finally he was taking flight.
hyenia.16.a:0 "As the Blade of the Qaylid says, we will protect you all."
hyenia.17.t:0 "The Dervish State" 
hyenia.17.d:0 "With the fighting dying down and the Yetis' last chance to claim vengeance snuffed out, came the wailing of the wounded and dying. Taking stock of the situation, they slowly converged among the slaughtered royalists and gathered at the side of the fallen princess. Masaska kneeled by her side, his head lowered as he gently closed one eye then the other with his thumb. He couldn't find the words, none of them could. They had all known meeting with the royalists could have gone poorly, but they never could have expected this.\n\n"Poor, wretched pups." Fahamka whispered as she walked among the fallen hyenas. "To finally see your lost homeland after so many years in exile, only to end like this..."\n\n"The royalist cause is dead," Furasho said bluntly, folding her arms where she stood staring down at the dead princess. "The die is cast, and there is only one cause that can unite Hyenia now. I beg your forgiveness for my insolence, Great Teacher, but unless we want to see all we worked for washed away, we must seize this moment. The royalists are no longer a reliable ally, and will turn on us, claiming this was a scheme. We have one chance to strike and ensure they cannot bring further discord. Hyenia will see no new queen, it only has us, and I would betray your teachings if we did not take this chance. Do I have your blessing to be the leader Hyenia needs?"\n\nFahamka looked up at Furasho. So proud. So forceful. Born into a world where strength was everything, and who had the scars to prove it. What more could one have wanted in a dervish, and yet how flawed was she? Or perhaps she was what the Qaylid had to become? All things changed, and the Qaylid was no different. The threads of fate had been woven, and the pattern was clear.

tech_hye_start:0 "Sustenance and Survival"
tech_hye_start_desc:0 "Our people has always held up endurance as a virtue. In the high mountains and dry deserts you fight against the elements as much as your enemies, and wastefulness will all too easily be your undoing. Living off the land, learning to thrive despite the elements and to make sure your resources last is as much part of warfare as shooting or marching is." 
tech_hye_scavenge:0 "Scavenger Traditions"
tech_hye_scavenge_desc:0 "A gun is a gun, no matter where it came from, and every weapon seized from the enemy is one less that they can make use of as well as one more on our side. We understand this fact, and instead of wastefully throwing away potential tools, we make sure to scour far and wide for any potential equipment."
tech_hye_reinforcement:0 "Repeated Offensives"
tech_hye_reinforcement_desc:0 "Blind attacks cost lives, planned attacks cost time. Being able to reorganize and prepare for another attack faster than our enemy can recover will allow us to keep delivering blow after blow, never relenting and never giving them the opportunity to truly dig in. "
tech_hye_repair:0 "Pre-planned Rebuilding"
tech_hye_repair_desc:0 "We're no strangers to war and destruction, enough that we know that it is not the end if our enemy seizes important assets, not as long as we can reclaim them and restore them quickly. If we reclaim what is ours, the faster we can put it back into working condition, the better."
tech_hye_exp:0 "Scout Teachers" 
tech_hye_exp_desc:0 "To fight your enemy, you must know your enemy, and those among us who lead the way and guide our forces know more than most. As new warpups join the fight, they can learn from our scouts and be better equipped for the fight that awaits."
tech_hye_scavenge2:0 "Waste not, want not"
tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out  their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete.  "
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."
tech_dervishes_a:0 "Dervish Division IV"
tech_dervishes_a_desc:0 "As a dervish grows and develops their skills, they are expected to share their knowledge with their fellow dervishes. The most veteran of them travel among the dervishes, constantly documenting and evaluating the lessons learned so that all might share in this knowledge."
tech_dervishes_b:0 "Dervish Division V"
tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."
tech_dervishes_c:0 "Dervish Division VI"
tech_dervishes_c_desc:0 "The eleventh century has already shown that it will be a bloody one, but in this grim era, the dervishes will continue to be dilligent students."


tech_hyena_misc:0 "Extractive Metallurgy"
tech_hyena_misc_desc:0 "Few species can claim to be as proficient and skilled in digging and burrowing tunnels as the Diamond Dogs. From an early age, pups are known to bore their own tunnels, searching for the mineral goods hidden beneath the ground. Although industrial mining is not done with bare paws, it remains a priority to improve our equipment and improve safety standards, so that dogs may continue to profit from the riches of the earth."
tech_hyena_misc2:0 "Underground Construction"
tech_hyena_misc2_desc:0 "Most dogs prefer living under the ground, and few venture to the surface by choice. Subterranean environment breeds a hardy species, and the need for safety and protection of our riches makes it necessary to construct vast cities and vaults beneath the surface."
tech_hyena_misc3:0 "Underground Construction II"
tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"
tech_hyena_misc_b_desc:0 "Few things make the dogs happier than a long day at the forge, creating both consumer goods and military equipment for their nation. It is vital to modernise our production centres, so that the state as a whole may benefit and progress further."
tech_hyena_misc_c:0 "Modern Mining Industry"
tech_hyena_misc_c_desc:0 "Unparalleled in both our resource output and technologies utilised in the process, the Diamond Dogs are at the forefront of any major excavation project in the world."
tech_hyena_army:0 "Mountain Home"
tech_hyena_army_desc:0 "The dog biology makes them particularly adapt in crossing rough environment, such as hills and mountains. Training our soldiers how to be better handle the terrain while carrying heavy equipment would improve the speed of our operations."

tech_hyena_army_atk3:0 "Offensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_atk3_desc:0 "Few species read the ground as well as the dogs. Trained sappers will bypass enemy fortifications with multiple tunnels from which our forces can attack, trapping the defenders from both sides."
tech_hyena_army_def3:0 "Defensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_def3_desc:0 "There is no firmer trench than one located underground. Our foes' numbers and airplanes will matter little once they are forced to attack us in our underground fortifications."
tech_hyena_army4:0 "Advanced Fortifications"
tech_hyena_army4_desc:0 "The sheer amount of resources dogs possess makes it particularly easy for them to establish defences wherever they are needed, in a short amount of time."
tech_hyena_army5:0 "Mountain Training II"
tech_hyena_army5_desc:0 "Further improvements in our mountain fighting tehniques will make dogs the unmatched force when it comes to battles on our terrain of choice."

tech_hyena_army6:0 "Advanced Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army6_desc:0 "A Diamond Dog tunnel is perhaps the safest place one can be during an air raid. It is simply very wasteful to destroy the very ground itself, even with modern explosives."

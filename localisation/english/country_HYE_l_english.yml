##Initial Tree##

HYE_assemble_the_qaylid:0 "Calling For All Dervishes"
HYE_assemble_the_qaylid_desc:0 "The murderous Storm King lies dead in the far north, and his lackeys have turned on each other in a frenzied scramble for power. This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our Great Teacher Fahamka gathers all warriors, for it is time to take back our homeland."
HYE_organize_the_resistance:0 "Organising Our Cadres"
HYE_organize_the_resistance_desc:0 "When we strike we will not be engaging in guerilla warfare or raids, but rather we will advance on a wide front with forces in the thousands. We must be prepared for this, and make sure that our commanders are prepared to wield forces of this kind."
HYE_dedicate_our_souls:0 "Dedicate Our Souls"
HYE_dedicate_our_souls_desc:0 "Death is where the final word is written in your life's book. It is natural and good to not seek it lightly, but we must be prepared to meet it all the same. The prize will be our homeland freed, and if we must pay with our lives, then that is the price we must pay."
HYE_make_the_cause_known:0 "Make The Cause Known"
HYE_make_the_cause_known_desc:0 "Hyenia was arrogant, and she stood alone against the Storm King when he came. In defeat, she was humbled, and the Great Teacher has not hesitated to plead with our neighbors for assistance. Thankfully, we have been blessed with a neighbour both kind and just in equal measure."
HYE_liberate_our_kin:0 "Liberate Our Kin"
HYE_liberate_our_kin_desc:0 "The day has come to finally strike. From the pups that grew up refugees and remember their homeland only in childhood memories, to the hard-bitten desert dogs who have carried this fight since before even the storm king - we all know the one truth of tomorrow.\n\nGeeri ama Guul: Death or Victory"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles:0 "Request Help From The Gargoyles"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "Between the tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Gargiloya and the Storm King's rampage, the gargoyles have plenty of reasons to want to see the yetis pushed back. We just hope they will see that."
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs:0 "Request Help From The Centaurs"
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs_desc:0 "The prideful centaurs are our ancestral enemies, but they too have suffered the ravages of the Storm King. They would rather have us as neighbors than the yetis, and if they give us weapons for this struggle, they will have much to gain."
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful:0 "Tunnel Raids"
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful_desc:0 "As the conflict grinds on, we must acquire weapons wherever we can. Our kin in the deep tunnels have offered to "procure" some for us. Normally, this would come with strings and caveats, not the least questions from the former owners, but right now we are not in a position to be choosy." 
HYE_beat_them_back:0 "Give Them No Quarter"
HYE_beat_them_back_desc:0 "They can run as they please. We will be hot on their tails and rip and tear wherever they go. Hesitation today will let the strike again tomorrow, so we must move as fast as we can."
HYE_bite_to_the_bone:0 "Bite To The Bone"
HYE_bite_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The valleys and mountains of our homeland have always been a mighty shield, and it now serves the enemy. We must commit wholly wherever we strike, and push through no matter the cost."
HYE_wherever_they_are:0 "Wherever They Are"
HYE_wherever_they_are_desc:0 "The mountains and the forests of the valley are familiar to us, and if the yetis think that they can use these places against us then they will be sorely mistaken."
HYE_we_will_fight_them:0 "We Will Fight"
HYE_we_will_fight_them_desc:0 "Many of our brothers and sisters may have fallen in the struggle, but in death they have given us hope. Hope rouses the despairing, and gives them the strength to pick up where the heroes left them."
HYE_until_we_are_victorious:0 "Until We Are Victorious"
HYE_until_we_are_victorious_desc:0 "We are committed with our hearts, our blood and indeed our very lives to ensure victory. The yetis keep defying us, and we must redouble our efforts to send them packing back whence they came. No matter the losses, no matter the fighting, we cannot stop here!"
HYE_homecoming:0 "Homecoming"
HYE_homecoming_desc:0 "On the eve of our victory, a new challenge stands before us. We had thought the royal house undone, but its last scion - princess Jawharad - has returned to once again ascend the Malachite Throne. Our ranks rumble with discontent, and the Great Teacher has stated her intent to meet with the princess rather than to risk civil war following the war of liberation." 

##Moderate Furasho##

HYE_fahamkas_blessing:0 "Fahamka's Blessing"
HYE_fahamkas_blessing_desc:0 "Furasho knows who she is, and she knows from where she came. She would not be here if she had not been given the trust of the great teacher. She did not crave this position, and has come before Fahamka to officially ask for her blessing as she takes up the burden of guiding Hyenia."
HYE_gather_the_devout:0 "Gather The Devout"
HYE_gather_the_devout_desc:0 "The games of politics are all too familiar to Furasho, and she knows that no matter how just the cause, it will flounder if not well supported. If her reforms are to succeed, she must ensure that the people are rallied around her vision."
HYE_all_the_right_places:0 "All The Right Places"
HYE_all_the_right_places_desc:0 "A leader is only as strong as her closest. With Hyenia's apparatus of state in tatters, it must be rebuilt from scratch. Yet, a desert insurgency does not produce good ministers, and every position must be staffed with utmost care, so that neither mismanagement nor divided loyalties break it."
HYE_the_qaylid_state:0 "The Qaylid State"
HYE_the_qaylid_state_desc:0 "The Qaylid is the highest truth, revealed to Fahamka and disseminated by the dervishes. Furasho was lost herself, and as she now sees the light, she stands ready to bring this truth to all other hyenas."
HYE_what_we_face:0 "What We Face"
HYE_what_we_face_desc:0 "The yetis are united once again. A new Storm King stands ready to lead them, and they will soon come for us. The terrors of their last invasion are fresh in everyone's memories, and we must ready ourselves for the oncoming storm."
HYE_emergency_conscriptions:0 "Emergency Conscriptions"
HYE_emergency_conscriptions_desc:0 "We've seen what the end result of a yeti invasion is, and we must do everything in our power to stop it. Our people may be dismayed as the dervishes move to counter this threat with the same all-encompassing determination as everything else, but it must be done."
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable:0 "Plan For The Inevitable"
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "It is not a question of if, but when, and we must spend every waking second before then well. Time is our most valuable currency, and we must spend it as carefully and wisely as we ever can if we are to survive this."
HYE_shore_up_our_defences:0 "Shore Up Our Defences"
HYE_shore_up_our_defences_desc:0 "Konkaymaha is our weakest link, the open plains not giving us the protection that the mountains do, and we cannot let them flank us and seize Ciidacirood. Yet if stone and ice cannot shield us, concrete and rebar will."
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun:0 "Open Every Armoury"
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun_desc:0 "A sea of bodies will be nothing but water poured down the drain if they are not suitably equipped. Our old contact network from the war of liberation is still intact, and we must bring in all the resources we can through it."
HYE_dig_our_heels_in:0 "Dig Our Heels In"
HYE_dig_our_heels_in_desc:0 "Every step of the way, every valley and every field, all shall be contested. The yetis are strong, and they are many, but with enough grim determination and preparation, we can bleed them dry."
HYE_preemptive_strike:0 "Preemptive Strike"
HYE_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "The yetis are still tearing at each other, and we have an opportunity. Waiting more will only give them more time to unite and strengthen, and so we must strike now, and deal with them before that."
HYE_assess_the_realm:0 "Assess The Realm"
HYE_assess_the_realm_desc:0 "From the ruins of Qalbi Weyn to the burning fields of Konkaymaha, Hyenia lies wounded and bleeding before us. We must act decisively to heal the nation, and yet to do so we must act with knowledge."
HYE_the_yeti_problem:0 "The Yeti Problem"
HYE_the_yeti_problem_desc:0 "Thousands of yetis moved into Hyenia after the collapse of the queendom. They came to build themselves new homes in the ruins of the hyenas', and they must be dealt with. Yet they are not warriors or pillagers, but many times humble farmers and labourers. Expulsion is the first solution that comes to mind, but it is not an obvious one."
HYE_clean_up_the_surface:0 "Clean Up The Surface"
HYE_clean_up_the_surface_desc:0 "There are still hyenas living in the ruins of their homes after years of war. Before we embark on great projects of rebuilding, we must sweep away the rubble and ensure that the wounds left by the invasion are treated."
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld:0 "Reconnect With The Underworld"
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld_desc:0 "Tens of thousand of hyenas fled into the deep tunnels, and have hidden there ever since behind collapsed tunnels and entrances. Qalbi Weyn is the great entrance into the underground, and we can finally begin digging to reconnect with them and bring them home."
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated:0 "Teach The Uninitiated"
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated_desc:0 "Hyenia is still the queendom in heart and spirit, and she must be taught a new way. Dervishhood is not some high position reserved only for the few, but a spiritual struggle that all hyenas deserve to be part of. Thus, we remake the hyenas, and through them we remake Hyenia."
HYE_prayer_without_worship:0 "Prayer Without Worship"
HYE_prayer_without_worship_desc:0 "The Qaylid makes no claim to represent the voice of a divine will. Those who wish to worship their old gods can still do so, but they will do so in accordance with the values of the Qaylid."
HYE_find_a_place_for_them:0 "Find A Place For Them"
HYE_find_a_place_for_them_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a hyena who does not deserve a place in the world. All have their part to play, and all should be honored for it. In this truth, we create order, and work towards healing."
HYE_pragmatic_dogma:0 "Pragmatic Dogma"
HYE_pragmatic_dogma_desc:0 "Asceticism is virtuous, but telling a starving hyena that her suffering is good is not. There is one truth, but there are also many roads that lead there. Little concessions here and there will ensure that the transformation of our society can happen without driving the suffering to despair."
HYE_contentment_in_community:0 "Contentment In Community"
HYE_contentment_in_community_desc:0 "It takes a village to raise a pup, and no hyena thrives in isolation. The Qaylid's guidance shall be felt even in the smallest village, and no matter how far-flung, our people shall know that we're there for them."
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity:0 "Meaning From Mundanity"
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity_desc:0 "The dream of something new, something better, is so many times an illusion. When the thrill of novelty fades, you are left where you started. The wise know to find purpose in even the small things, and while there will always be those who seek the new, we honor those who can labour and thrive where they stand."
HYE_once_and_for_all:0 "Once And For All"
HYE_once_and_for_all_desc:0 "Whether by luck or by foresight, we have prepared ourselves well enough that we could consider another option: invading them first. It would be the hardest war we've ever fought, but it would spare our lands the suffering."
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt:0 "The Paw We've Been Dealt"
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt_desc:0 "We stand where the Storm King stood, and all the lands the yetis held claim over are now under our control. Yet we have not come to pillage, but to build a lasting peace, and now we embark on the greatest challenge of the dervishes; redeeming the yetis."
HYE_organize_the_armed_forces:0 "Organize The Armed Forces"
HYE_organize_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "We have done well to take back our lands as rough bands of hardened fighters, but as brave hyenas have perished in battle, and as the chaos of the campaign spread out many of our sisters and brothers of the blade, we find our might stretched thin. Before all else we must see our warriors brought back together into a cohesive order, where the veterans can properly rule the novices." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_overhaul_the_dervish_warriors:0 "Overhaul The Dervish Warriors"
HYE_overhaul_the_dervish_warriors_desc:0 "Our warriors, strong as they are, cannot remain content with old ways. As the Great Teacher has taught, the past cannot bind us, and the future always beckons. Our enemies discover new ways to be a threat to our welfare, and rather than remain idle we must seize what means we can to maintain the race. Our former occupiers have luckily left us with some pieces to start with." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_defence_of_the_homestead:0 "Defence Of The Homestead"
HYE_defence_of_the_homestead_desc:0 "Among the ways of modern war none are so fundamental as that of the soldier fighting with her squad. Grounded in the eternal teachings of the Qaylid, we take into ourselves the knowledge of weapons and armaments that this present age has brought about. The dreams and nightmares that once haunted seers and madwomen have been realized in steel and powder, and woe to us if we fail to learn their lessons." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_modernize_our_equipment:0 "Modernize Our Equipment"
HYE_modernize_our_equipment_desc:0 "The fires of the forge, the clanging of metal, the bitter scent of gunpowder as it speeds like fire through the air to burn through fur and flesh: we learn of this, and take into ourselves the wisdom of their deadly power. Particles and pieces and scraps litter our tables as we see, and understand, and build. At the end of rifle and cannon we will build the future of this land." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_reverse_engineer_their_vehicles:0 "Reverse Engineer Their Vehicles"
HYE_reverse_engineer_their_vehicles_desc:0 "Across the sands and in the valleys and fields we find the broken shells and cracked contraptions of our former occupiers, clever as they were with harnessing the forces of fuel and steel against us. We seek to direct these forces for ourselves instead, to bring the power of the axle and of the flywheel and of the motor into the service of our people." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_dual_purpose_soldiers:0 "Dual-Purpose Soldiers"
HYE_dual_purpose_soldiers_desc:0 "A warrior of the Qaylid is more than a blade, for she is a servant first of all. If she is to remain firm in her duty towards her fellow hyenas, she must attain the wisdom found in other kinds of service. Our nation is sorely in need of new mechanisms to protect the common weal, and it seems fitting that we put the strength of our warriors into building those mechanisms." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_to_rise_from_the_dirt:0 "To Rise From The Dirt"
HYE_to_rise_from_the_dirt_desc:0 "Only the mutterings of mystics and prophets could have foreseen the days when we would rise from the dirt on machines of metal. Nonetheless we see ourselves living those same days, and as the learned return from expeditions into other lands, and as our technicians piece together the shards of propeller and wing left by our enemies, we come to understand at last what it is to fight in the skies." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_at_home_or_at_the_battlefield:0 "At Home Or At The Battlefield"
HYE_at_home_or_at_the_battlefield_desc:0 "What use is the might of the Qaylid if we cannot care for our wounded warriors? The strenuous pace of modern war leaves little time for our brave fighters to return to their homes to recover, so in those times it is well that we bring something of their homes to them. Caregivers across the land can serve just behind the line of advance, giving such succor as many would need and teaching them their ways." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_further_aeronautical_support:0 "Further Aeronautical Support"
HYE_further_aeronautical_support_desc:0 "Wonders both magnificent and terrifying beguile us as we continue our study of modern war. So many more ways of causing harm and death have opened up before us, and with trembling caution we take up the work of bending these powers towards the help of our nation. With prayerful action we strive towards a fuller knowledge of ballistics and of flight, of bringing things up... and making them come down." ## NavyMongoose

HYE_shake_off_the_rust:0 "Shake Off The Rust"
HYE_shake_off_the_rust_desc:0 "So much of our industry was left abandoned when the Yetis took over Hyenia. The Storm King's campaign and subsequent civil war meant all that interested them was the production of weapons. There is much to rebuild now thanks to this, but we are patient."
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb:0 "Learn From The Hayzeb"
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb_desc:0 "During our campaign of resistance, we learned much from the Hayzeb, and why should this end now? Our western neighbours may not have the great underground cities or mountain history of Hyenia, but they have achieved great things in other ways, and there is much to learn from them still." 
HYE_common_good:0 "For The Common Hyena"
HYE_common_good_desc:0 "Owning gold means nothing but knowing how to produce gold coins is knowledge, creating them is to shape the future and using them well is to show virtue. This principle is absolute and must be a foundational part of Hyenia's economy. Wasting money while our people could be fed and sheltered is more than waste, it is a sin."
HYE_develop_the_interior:0 "Develop The Interior"
HYE_develop_the_interior_desc:0 "The northwest was our sanctuary for a long time, and though the desert shielded us through being sparsely settled and developed, the Hyenas who live here deserve proper roads and bridges as much as anyone else."
HYE_fields_of_green:0 "Fields Of Gold"
HYE_fields_of_green_desc:0 "The river plains of Konkaymaha have always been highly fertile, but in the wake of the invasion they were largely left fallow except for small scale farming. It is time for these fields to once again be put to good use."
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles:0 "Teach The Jewelers Our Principles"
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles_desc:0 "The Qaylid preaches asceticism, and yet jewelry is one of Hyenia's oldest and most highly regarded arts. We face a conundrum here. Though some zealots would see us shut this tradition down entirely, this would be excessive. Instead, the Jewelers can be guided like all other Hyenas, and their skills and resources can be put to good use serving the people."
HYE_the_second_capital:0 "The Second Capital"
HYE_the_second_capital_desc:0 "Ciidacirood is the birthplace of the Qaylid and the heart of our resistance against the yetis. It has served Hyenia beyond well, and it would be wrong to let it fall back into obscurity. It shall instead become the spiritual capitol of Hyenia, and a mandatory place of pilgrimage for all dervishes."
HYE_word_into_scripture:0 "Word Into Scripture"
HYE_word_into_scripture_desc:0 "The illiterate mind is trapped, and through education it is freed. It learns how to grasp the abstract and the hypothetical, to question and to seek further understanding. Education therefore must be the highest priority if Hyenia is to be reshaped."
HYE_waste_not:0 "Waste Not"
HYE_waste_not_desc:0 "Every scrap of metal, every bit of coal and every drop of water serves a purpose, and making poor use of it is to misunderstand what it means to be a dervish. Everything we have must be evaluated and put to the best possible use, whether you are one or a million."
HYE_nurture_local_talent:0 "Nurture Local Talent"
HYE_nurture_local_talent_desc:0 "The Queendom was a pyramid, with Qalbi Weyn at the top and all others below. The talents and minds of hundreds of thousands were thus wasted, and we shall ensure this never happens again. Every mind, whether urban or rural, is a potential gem that we will use to pay for the future." 
HYE_strip_away_the_excess:0 "Strip Away The Excess"
HYE_strip_away_the_excess_desc:0 "The Queendom was beyond lavish at times, and obscene resources were spent on palaces, statues and other nonsense. There are things that celebrate and inspire the common hyena, and there are things that is nothing but self-gratification for the wealthy. One can stay, the other must be torn down and repurposed for those who suffered for its construction."
HYE_the_value_of_effort:0 "The Value Of Effort"
HYE_the_value_of_effort_desc:0 "To give it your all is to live up to your fullest potential, and this is something to celebrate. Knowing where the limits of one's being lies is to know oneself, and in knowing oneself, one can be in control of one's life." 
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past:0 "Absolve Us From The Past"
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past_desc:0 "Hyenia's past is broken, built on the injustice and greed, and she must be thoroughly reforged. This reforging will not take place in the workshops or the battlefield, however, but in the minds of all hyenas."
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery:0 "Repurpose Yeti Machinery"
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery_desc:0 "For all the devastation and all the suffering that the yetis caused, they did at least rebuild Hyenia somewhat. It may have been to fuel further conquests, but it will aid us all the same. It matters not whence it came, only what we make of it."
HYE_electify_the_underground:0 "Electrify The Underground"
HYE_electify_the_underground_desc:0 "The deep caverns and tunnels below have always been our home, but they have not tasted the fruits of the new era. Even though they more than anywhere else would benefit from the ceaseless illumination of electricity, they've been left in darkness. Once this was acceptable, but no longer."
HYE_develop_the_coastline:0 "Develop The Coastline"
HYE_develop_the_coastline_desc:0 "The coasts were long the most prosperous parts of Hyenia, and with prosperity can come greed. We must continue to nurture and tend to these lands as well, and yet we must do so in such a way that they do not fall prey to these vices again."
HYE_lessons_from_exile:0 "Lessons From Exile"
HYE_lessons_from_exile_desc:0 "When you have much, it is never enough. When you have little, it can become enough. We learned this in the desert, and we remember it in the mountains. We must never lose this care and respect for the resources we use, and utilising these principles will help us."
HYE_give_them_new_purpose:0 "Give Them New Purpose"
HYE_give_them_new_purpose_desc:0 "Many along the coast have weathered these last years with grim determination, hoping to see the old ways reassert themselves one day. Alas, they will never have what they desire, but in their place we will offer them something else."
HYE_blessed_transformation:0 "Blessed Transformation"
HYE_blessed_transformation_desc:0 "Qalbi Weyn has been a splendid city like few others, and we shall make it shine once again. As we face the future, it shall be here to accept any and all who would come to her."
HYE_nationalize_home_industries:0 "Nationalize Home Industries"
HYE_nationalize_home_industries_desc:0 "The landowner has ever been the ones with power in Hyenia, but in recent years they have been challenged by a new kind of elite - the industrialist. We will entertain these new masters as little as any other though, and their factories will be put to use for the good of all hyenas."
HYE_all_for_our_descendants:0 "All For Our Descendants"
HYE_all_for_our_descendants_desc:0 "After tomorrow is another day, and in ten and a hundred years' time there will be yet more days to come. All are equal in importance, and we must not be seduced by the promise of quick returns."
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize:0 "Proselytize To Industrialize"
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize_desc:0 "We are ascetics, not reactionaries, and change is not a necessary evil but the eternal truth of the world. Those who build, invent new tools, and discover new truths in the world are valued and praised in the Qaylid."
HYE_want_not:0 "Want Not"
HYE_want_not_desc:0 "For what purpose do we tread so carefully, and measure the resources we use? Is it so we can gather all the saved wealth in a huge pit and swim around in it like hyperwealthy ducks? We do it all for all hyenas, and thus we must be willing to spend it to ensure they live good and cared for lives."
HYE_unified_in_mind:0 "Unified In Mind"
HYE_unified_in_mind_desc:0 "We need not have absolute consensus, at least as long as we all understand why we do what we do. We listen in order to understand, and we trust each other to do the same. In this, we build unity, and in unity, we build the future."
HYE_here_and_now:0 "Here And Now"
HYE_here_and_now_desc:0 "While the future always beckons us, the homeless and starving need help now, not in ten years' time. The near future promises great struggles, and we must rally to meet it swiftly and with determination."
HYE_united_in_purpose:0 "United In Purpose"
HYE_united_in_purpose_desc:0 "The Great Teacher instructs us to 'lessen the suffering, the division, and the bloodshed of the world' In this, we stand together as one, and though we may disagree on the methods, we do not disagree on the end goal."
HYE_sanctification_of_society:0 "Sanctification Of Society"
HYE_sanctification_of_society_desc:0 "The world is in a constant state of flux, with the potential of the future being forged in the present to become the legacy of the past. Every day, hour and second the eternal tapestry of the world will be woven, and living beings have only one chance to make each choice right. 'What is?' is an irrelevant question in the greater perspective, for existence is a process, not a state."

HYE_begin_the_occupation:0 "Begin The Occupation"
HYE_begin_the_occupation_desc:0 "By strenuous effort and our faithfulness to the Dervish Way we have prevailed against our great enemy. Yet our work is unfinished and only moves to a new phase, one of winning hearts and making deals and rebuilding what was destroyed. Quite critical is what we are to do with the yetis who have come under our power, for they bear the faces of our occupiers, and old grudges do not lie easily..." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_the_downtrodden:0 "The Downtrodden"
HYE_the_downtrodden_desc:0 "Most immediate of our tasks is assisting all those who have suffered under yeti rule, the multitude of zebras who have been enslaved and forced to labour for their yeti masters. Much has been taken from them, and much will we have to offer to restore even some of what was lost. As the Great Teacher says, the past - what was - can be a trap, and we must show them the future - what can and will be." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_under_new_leadership:0 "Under New Leadership"
HYE_under_new_leadership_desc:0 "Already we receive reports of bandits and agitators poisoning the countryside with their depredations, so it is fitting that we who devote ourselves to diligence and struggle should restore the peace. However, the land is vast, and we have but few capable administrators among the dervishes. We must put our trust in those unfamiliar to us, and hope that we who know the Way may also be good judges of the heart." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_damage_control:0 "Damage Control"
HYE_damage_control_desc:0 "Every war has casualties, and every conflict has its fair share of suffering and pain. We cannot account for every wrong - even those we may have committed - in our fight against the yeti warlords, but we can do many things to show the people that we seek above all else to rebuild rather than plunder. Before all else, though, we must first bring order." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_stuck_in_time:0 "Stuck In Time"
HYE_stuck_in_time_desc:0 "Not everycreature was lucky to have the Qaylid lift their spirits and be their sword. Many have only known the yoke of oppression and the burden of the oppressor's unjust laws. They have fallen into a vogue of victimhood, grasping for a forgotten purer past, and we who see the virtuous future must pave for them a different path." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_learn_and_teach:0 "Learn And Teach"
HYE_learn_and_teach_desc:0 "When we first emerged from the caves to take up arms against the yetis, we were but a savage and unlearned people, but in such a short time we have learned and grasped much from both friend and foe. Now it is our turn to impart the knowledge and wisdom we have gained, not as masters over servants but as elder sisters to our young wards." ## NavyMongoose
HYE_quell_the_fires:0 "Quell The Fires"

If we wish for the Stormcloud Valley to have any hint of history or unity then it is vital that we attempt to patch a hole in their utter lack of history. Linking their creation as a desire they truly held, enhanced by the bickering of the civil war, is the first step in turning them into a truly united nation."
HYE_close_the_loop:0 "Close The Loop"
HYE_close_the_loop_desc:0 "To properly orchestrate the Stormcloud Valley we need to ensure both our people and administration are able to move freely in and out of the Zone.

For we had arrived to a valley of naught but dust and left a true nation in our wake."

HYE_from_within:0 "From Within"
HYE_from_within_desc:0 "The Pact stands at our back, like a pack ready to support us to the bitter end. Our nation, as it is now, is new and inexperienced unlike our allies. Thus we must focus inwards, and develop both the state and society of the Pact members."
HYE_taking_back_the_refugees:0 "Taking Back The Refugees"
HYE_taking_back_the_refugees_desc:0 "The Storm King's occupation left many of our hyenas scattered and spread across South Zebrica, though the largest amount crossed into Gargiloya.

HYE_leave_the_descrimination_behind_desc:0 "For as long as there has been a royal hyena, there has been visible differences between those of 'noble' blood and those of more common make. Rougher features, larger appendages, and so on. Unfortunately in the past this has led to some hyenas to discriminate along both class and looks, something which has held back a great many potential successful hyenas. This issue must be dealt with."
HYE_makers_due:0 "Maker's Due"
HYE_makers_due_desc:0 "Years before the Yetis attacked, a lot of hyenas made their coin by violating what the Gargoyles call 'Intellectual Property' and selling both their ideas and creations for far cheaper than they were worth.

HYE_take_to_the_skies_desc:0 "While the memory Storm King's airships may leave a bad taste in our mouths, we are in the lucky position where we can mostly skip that form of design.

HYE_clear_the_isles_issue:0 "Clear The Isles Issue"
HYE_clear_the_isles_issue_desc:0 "Though they have no formal claim to them, the Centaurs have desired the Crimson Isles (and its oil) for a long time. Now that discussions can be far more open, it may be time to clear up the request officially to ensure it doesn't impede future relations."
HYE_raise_the_bare_minimum:0 "Raise The Bare Minimum"
HYE_raise_the_bare_minimum_desc:0 "One good thing about being a member of the Ancient Pact is having a large collection of new friends to borrow from for our development. Extending roads from Gargiloya into our towns, port connections from Senturya and factory technologies from both should help kickstart our development as a modern nation."
HYE_acquire_their_expertise:0 "Acquire Their Expertise"
HYE_acquire_their_expertise_desc:0 "Many experts in many fields within our two new allies are ready and waiting for us to collect them, should we offer them the right incentives. The rest of the Pact may call this 'headhunting' but quite frankly its a necessary sacrifice to ensure we can pull our own weight in the future. They'll be happier here anyway."
HYE_crank_them_out:0 "Crank Them Out"
HYE_crank_them_out_desc:0 "While our hyenapower may be lacking compared to some of our potential foes, we still can make use out of mass producing our aircraft. By having our mechanical engineering teams work on both Fighters and Bombers, we are able to provide experience not only with both forms of airframe but also able to cut down on our required personnel."
HYE_built_to_perfection:0 "Built To Perfection"
HYE_built_to_perfection_desc:0 "If we cannot match our foes in numbers, we can match them in quality. For every fighter they fell, we must bring down a dozen. For every bomber they drag out the sky, we must shoot down ten of their own! Our forces must be faster, tougher and more agile than any they face, lest we lose the air war."
HYE_the_lines_between_us:0 "The Lines Between Us"
HYE_the_lines_between_us_desc:0 "Due to the relative newness of the new Queendom, Hyenia currently has very few laws protecting the rights of creatures other than Hyenas. Given that we are in a multi-racial alliance with two powers that contain not only a majority species that is far different from our own but also contain substantial minorities of other races, it may be worth revisiting that."
HYE_transform_the_judicial_system:0 "Transform The Judicial System"
HYE_transform_the_judicial_system_desc:0 "The judicial system of the old Queendom is, predictably, as corrupt and wasteful as the system it came from. Now that we have two systems to compare it to, we face a crossroads as we modernise it. Do we simply place token reforms in place, copy one of the other Pact members or create one from scratch?"
HYE_formalize_the_role_of_the_dervishes:0 "Formalize The Dervishes' Role"
HYE_formalize_the_role_of_the_dervishes_desc:0 "The efforts of the Dervishes through the last few years have been incredible, and its unlikely Hyenia would have survived without their efforts.

HYE_open_minds_and_shaking_hands:0 "Open Minds And Shaking Paws"
HYE_open_minds_and_shaking_hands_desc:0 "There is a lot we can learn from our new allies. Centuries of getting around their own problems with their forms via ingenius solutions which can be replicated in part, if not in full, by hyenas of any stripe."
HYE_enshrine_the_royal_airforce:0 "Enshrine The Royal Hyenian Airforce"
HYE_enshrine_the_royal_airforce_desc:0 "To serve the Queen in the Royal Hyenian Airforce is an honour! We reach the highest heights, and fell the strongest foes for the survival of not only our queen but our nation as well. Every mechanic, every pilot, every forward air controller will fight knowing the weight upon their shoulders."
HYE_unify_institutions:0 "Institutional Unification"
HYE_unify_institutions_desc:0 "Many of the institutions created within the Pact mostly accomplish similar things but at different scales merely because all Pact members are still their own countries. This could be remedied via Pact-wide unification of some of these institutions, which can benefit all of us via expediting their work and ensuring no-state is less represented in their efforts."
HYE_the_representation_question:0 "The Representation Question"
HYE_the_representation_question_desc:0 "Though the nations throughout the Pact do carry a system of basic representation, they're incredibly weak and abusable. If we wish to truly shine as far better than the Storm Kings of the world, then it is vital to properly represent our people. It may even be required to spread this across the Pact, rather than just within Hyenia."
HYE_determine_the_pacts_capital:0 "Determine The Pact's Capital"
HYE_determine_the_pacts_capital_desc:0 "With our inclusion into, and the further centralisation of, the Pact its increasingly become obvious that an administrative capital is required to prevent bias from any one member. Though, granted, it will likely be in the capital of one member and provide them with a key advantage, its important to have the discussion sooner rather than later."
HYE_complete_modernization_efforts:0 "Complete Hyenia's Modernization"
HYE_complete_modernization_efforts_desc:0 "Though we have made great strides there are still many parts of Hyenia that can't exactly qualify as 'Modern.' Thus it is imperative that we finalise our transition into modernity, be that with the offers of help from the other Pact members or on our own two paws."
HYE_electrification_of_the_pact:0 "Electrification Of The Pact"
HYE_electrification_of_the_pact_desc:0 "So far most of what we've done has been at the expense of the pockets of our allies, its about time we give back to them. If we construct dams in various rivers across our nations then we can help power the entire Pact far more efficiently and, as a benefit for the Centaurs and Gargoyles, we'll paw the bill this time."
HYE_the_taste_of_magical_energy:0 "The Taste Of Magical Energy"
HYE_the_taste_of_magical_energy_desc:0 "Within our lands lies a trasure trove of magical crystals, perfect for energy conduction and magical amplification. If we were to place more effort into the handling and research of these materials, then the potential use cases would be innumerable..."
HYE_three_societies_in_sync:0 "Three Societies In Sync"
HYE_three_societies_in_sync_desc:0 "While thus far we have relied upon our allies for protection and development, we can now truly say that we are equals. Militarily, industrially, economically and diplomatically each Pact member is ready to stand, rise and fall side by side."

HYE_from_without:0 "From Without"
HYE_from_without_desc:0 "Zebrica stands outstretched before us, like a field of malachite waiting to be enjoyed. Our lands are rich, our people are happy, and thus it is time to begin preparing to march further and build greater things upon the sand of the Zebhara."
HYE_zebharan_logistics:0 "Zebharan Logistics"
HYE_zebharan_logistics_desc:0 "The Zebhara is brutal and unending, transporting supplies through it is an almost insurmountable task. If we wish to use the desert to our advantage, its important that our supply lines are pre-laid and prepared."
HYE_connect_the_pact:0 "Connect The Pact"
HYE_connect_the_pact_desc:0 "Eventually all of the Pact will be united via rail, however the funds for such projects have to come from somewhere. We've managed to secure the budget for one long railway line to the capital of one of our allies, the tricky part is deciding which one..."
HYE_decide_on_trade_policy:0 "Decide On Trade Policy"
HYE_decide_on_trade_policy_desc:0 "The Pact has never really needed a unified trade policy, the Centaurs trading across the seas as the Gargoyles relied on low tariffs from them for their own profits. Now that we're adding a new factor it may be time to decide on a new direction for the Pact's unified trade policy."
HYE_her_majestys_armed_forces:0 "Her Majesty's Armed Forces"
HYE_her_majestys_armed_forces_desc:0 "The Dervishes held Hyenia, but they should not be forced to do so once more. Our current forces should be united into a single army under Her Majesty's banner, to ensure proper cohesion and order amongst the troops. It will take time, but proper centralisation of our army in this way will pay off in the end."
HYE_establish_a_pawhold:0 "Establish A Pawhold"
HYE_establish_a_pawhold_desc:0 "The priority concern for our liberation of Zwadai is the lack of supplies. If we connect and stockpile what our soldiers need before we march, then we'll be able to strike further before our supply lines struggle."
HYE_from_north_to_south:0 "From North To South"
HYE_from_north_to_south_desc:0 "If we wish to ensure our supply lines can stretch further, then we need to connect our rail lines. By having the track end near the border with Zwadai, then we can ensure our buildup is far closer and easier to use."
HYE_develop_for_exports:0 "Develop For Exports"
HYE_develop_for_exports_desc:0 "Our civilian economy is currently extremely lackluster, both due to the Storm King's ransacking and the lack of time we've had to build up a true civilian industry. The quickest way to improve our economy, thanks to the wide open markets of our allies, is to focus on exporting the materials and items they desire to ensure their money flows into developing our nation."
HYE_zebrides_spice_deal:0 "Zebrides Spice Deal"
HYE_zebrides_spice_deal_desc:0 "The South Zebrides has a lot of spice to sell, and not a lot of industry to support itself. If we were to offer a deal that provided us with cheaper spice and them with industial aid then we may be able to create a mutually beneficial arrangement."
HYE_institute_of_modern_military_technologies:0 "Institute Of Modern Military Technologies"
HYE_institute_of_modern_military_technologies_desc:0 "War has changed, and we must change with it. It is no longer suitable simply to charge in lines across the mountains, or fire potshots across the desert. Instead we must learn the tactics of a new age, by establishing an independent research institute devoted entirely to military technology and development."
HYE_free_zwadai_from_the_warlord:0 "Free Zwadai From The Warlord"
HYE_free_zwadai_from_the_warlord_desc:0 "Zwadai has laid within the claws of the Mad Warlord for far too long. Few within the 'nation' support his reign and, should we intervene on behalf of the Zebras within, we will certainly find a people who will welcome our soldiers with open arms as they are brought into the fold."
HYE_expand_the_network:0 "Expand The Network"
HYE_expand_the_network_desc:0 "The burgeoning automobile industry is slowly arriving to the Pact, and the road networks made with only charging Centaurs in mind have been found extremely lacking. We have the funding to expand the road network within Hyenia, but it may be worth building more roads around the Pact instead."
HYE_benefits_to_pact_members:0 "Beneficts To Pact Members"
HYE_benefits_to_pact_members_desc:0 "With the modernisation efforts we've been achieving, we cannot allow ourselves to take from our allies without giving anything back.

HYE_found_ciidacirood_national_university_desc:0 "The past few years have not been kind to the academic community within Hyenia, as ever since the fall of the Queendom most forms of higher education have been done as apprenticeships or informal qualifications in towns. It's about time we create a national university to help educate the next generation of hyenas."
HYE_formalize_the_SZFTO:0 "Establish The SZFTO"
HYE_formalize_the_SZFTO_desc:0 "While our formal trade policy within the Pact has been decided, we now find ourselves in a position to expand our free trade agreements across all of South Zebrica. If we create an organisation for the sole purpose of expanding and maintaining these agreements, then we stand to gain immensely from the increased trade."
HYE_a_true_standing_army:0 "A True Standing Army"
HYE_a_true_standing_army_desc:0 "The principle idea of our army has been chosen, the command structure has slowly but surely been built and our military industrial and military research capacity has increased massively.

HYE_introduce_a_new_currency:0 "Introduce A New Currency"
HYE_introduce_a_new_currency_desc:0 "Given that the current Hyenian currency is in short supply, thanks to the limited remaining stockpiles and relative age of the design, we have a golden opportunity.

HYE_broaden_our_horizons_desc:0 "Our forces have nary touched the wider world ocean, unless they needed to cross the Crimson Isles, and our fleet is barely a few fishing boats. It's about time we begin to increase our naval capacity so we aren't solely reliant on our allies."

Maybe Harqaanka's vision wasn't so naive after all..." #every policy the dervishes have thought up has been a success. hyenia is doing better than ever, and without the government breathing down their necks and extracting their earnings, the people have been able to revel in their newfound wealth, enjoying the fruits of their labor in a way they never have before. looks like harqaanka's vision wasnt so naive after all.

Hopefully some good machines come from it."
HYE_catch_up_with_our_neighbours:0 "Catch Up With Our Neighbours"
HYE_catch_up_with_our_neighbours_desc:0 "Hyenia is currently outgunned by almost every nation bordering our federation. When one of them turns their eyes towards our lands then we will suffer a bloody drawn out war for our very survival. We have to be ready and modernise both our equipment and our production facilities. No sense having the best guns without having enough to get in the paws of everyeen on the front."
HYE_walls_of_stone_at_every_corner:0 "Walls Of Stone Everywhere"
HYE_walls_of_stone_at_every_corner_desc:0 "Our natural geography is extremely useful for defence. The mountainous terrain of the south is extraordinary for static and elastic defence, while the deserts of the north provide excellent opportunities for defensive guerilla operations. Capitalising on these benefits by building our fortifications to fit the terrain will serve our lines well."
HYE_from_the_earth_to_the_sky:0 "From The Earth To The Sky"
HYE_from_the_earth_to_the_sky_desc:0 "The skies have been getting louder recently. Reports of twin and quad winged aircraft making up air forces in our neighbors, which has caused quite the stir within our own forces about the potential of these craft. We need to fast track our development of these vehicles to ensure we aren't caught out by our foes."
HYE_aggreive_at_every_angle:0 "Aggrieve At Every Angle"
HYE_aggreive_at_every_angle_desc:0 "Never give your enemy the chance to breathe. They must fear that every breath could be their last, and that every sunset could be the sign of an attack. Bite at their heels and once you get a taste never let go. They can never be allowed to mount a defence, because the assault will come from another direction or before they've finished building."
HYE_militias_at_home:0 "Militias At Home"
HYE_militias_at_home_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies, those who wish to take the dream of our liberty from us and have Hyenia fall to the same fate as the old Queendom.

HYE_new_recruits:0 "New Recruits"
HYE_new_recruits_desc:0 "Our numbers plummet as we march towards liberation, brave creatures falling to the wayside as they fight the forces of reaction. Normally reserves would be drawn from the homeland, but we aren't the most populated nation and we must make use of every advantage we have. By spreading our messages we can secure recruitment within areas we've liberated to enhance our manpower reserves."
HYE_safety_of_the_masses:0 "Safety Of The Masses"
HYE_safety_of_the_masses_desc:0 "The miltiayeens have served us well in ensuring our survival thus far, and should be expanded and rewarded for this. We need to ensure every able-bodied civilian is trained in case they must be called up to defend their brothers and sisters within the federation, lest we fall and leave them at the mercy of their occupiers."
HYE_rifles_on_every_street:0 "Rifles On Every Street"
HYE_rifles_on_every_street_desc:0 "When the very survival of your people and your way of life is threatened, one cannot handle it with half measures and idle floundering. Every citizen of the federation must be willing to do their duty, and every possible place where rifles can be produced, stored and trained with must be utilised."
HYE_preventative_measures:0 "Preventative Measures"
HYE_preventative_measures_desc:0 "When the next threat comes, it will be strike with armour and aircraft the likes of which we have never seen before. While we may not be able to produce these to the same extent as our enemies, there is always a cheaper counter to these weapons of war. Be they rapid-fire cannons for the air, heavy stationary cannons for the armour or simple tactical considerations to limit their effectiveness."
HYE_defence_in_depth:0 "Defence in Depth"
HYE_defence_in_depth_desc:0 "A static line will eventually bend, as an attacker can simply hit it harder than it can handle, and then have free reign of the area behind the line. However recent tactical developments have shown the potential for a delaying tactic which yields space over a longer line to make the attacker lose momentum, before they're crushed by counter-attacks and forced back into their holes."
HYE_ciicacirood_institute_of_warfare:0 "Ciidacirood Institute Of Warfare"
HYE_ciicacirood_institute_of_warfare_desc:0 "Though our military technology may have been lacking, given the decay of and death of the old Queendom, we are now in a position to truly reverse this occurance and capitalise on our gains. By building an official military institute we can study both the weapons of war and the ways to wage it."

HYE_the_root_of_virtue:0 "The Root Of Virtue"
HYE_the_root_of_virtue_desc:0 "The sands of time fall further, and Masaska knows his part at the head of Hyenia is complete. The opportunities for the future lay in the paws of his successor, Harqaanka. The Little Shadow's part is not entirely done, but his role will remain in the background as he's always preferred it to be."
HYE_the_true_endpoint_of_qaylidic_society:0 "The True Endpoint Of Qaylidic Society"
HYE_the_true_endpoint_of_qaylidic_society_desc:0 "Perfection cannot be achieved alone, for the demands of the world are strong enough that only a united effort can truly beat back the endless tide. Hyenas, Yetis, Storm Creatures, Zebras, Centaurs, Gargoyles. Each a part of the whole that can truly embrace the teachings of the Qaylid."
HYE_patience_is_rewarded:0 "Our Patience Is Rewarded"
HYE_patience_is_rewarded_desc:0 "The verdant fields of Hyenia lay sown beneath our paws, a land of plenty from our efforts sits waiting for a chance to be reaped. Fahamka's teachings have provided the water while our blood, sweat and tears have provided the flourishing field its fertiliser."
HYE_extoll_the_six_principles_to_all:0 "Extoll The Six Principles To All"
HYE_extoll_the_six_principles_to_all_desc:0 "Though Dervishdom may be voluntary, the lessons of the Qaylid are useful enough in life that they can be applied to both many things and many creatures. They may act as principles to strive towards, to further improve the potential of our people, rather than the restrictive requirements of some religions."
HYE_swim_through_the_river_of_time:0 "Swim Through The River Of Time"
HYE_swim_through_the_river_of_time_desc:0 ""For the wonders are ours. An age of reason, built upon the art of the possible and delivered upon the threat of total annihilation. I pray only that such a bark is never tested, for its bite would shatter the world."\n- Masaska, viewing the first successful detonation of a Hyenian nuclear weapon."
HYE_within_all_of_us:0 "Within All Of Us"
HYE_within_all_of_us_desc:0 "History will not define us. The conquerors and oppressors of the past will remain therein, and shall not curse our federation. Forgiveness marks the way forward, for we are not the sole inheritors of a peaceful time. Let our soldiers fight paw in hand with our fellow creatures, lest the curse of the past creep behind them."
HYE_there_is_always_a_choice:0 "There Is Always A Choice"
HYE_there_is_always_a_choice_desc:0 "When we were in need, outnumbered and alone, the Hayzeb provided us with aid, shelter and rifles. This is a debt we still owe, though they now lay within our borders and under our management. It is time to welcome them into the collective with open paws, if they so choose to accept our aid."
HYE_the_welfare_society:0 "The Welfare Society"
HYE_the_welfare_society_desc:0 "The greatest insult to any modern society is that anycreature can be allowed to lay sick and starving on the streets of our towns and cities. We now have the opportunity with the resources of the Collective to finally, indefinitely support a welfare system for our larger population, even during wartime. Nocreature, be they Yeti, Zebra or any other, shall be excluded."
HYE_from_near_and_far:0 "From Near And Far"
HYE_from_near_and_far_desc:0 "Our borders shall not limit our principles. We need not fight bitter wars for our survival, we can spread our influence further across the world without resorting to violence.\n\nThough that is still an option."
HYE_adapt_throughout_the_ages:0 "Adapt Throughout The Ages"
HYE_adapt_throughout_the_ages_desc:0 "Stability is not a guarantee of any society, for change is as important a factor to life as bread and water. Empires have risen and fell under the banner of conserving stability forevermore without understanding this. If we wish to improve our chances of remaining as the better creatures we have become, then we must ensure the trust our society is based on remains. For the good of the future."
HYE_remember_the_matriarch:0 "Remember The Matriarch"
HYE_remember_the_matriarch_desc:0 "The Matriarch still walks among us, but she will not do so forever and the day she will leave us behind draws ever closer. We should commemorate what she's managed to do for us by constructing a monument within Ciidacirood, not dedicated to her but to what she has believed in and what she has accomplished."
HYE_one_shared_vision:0 "One Shared Vision"
HYE_one_shared_vision_desc:0 "Unity within diversity. Our united purpose surpasses physical barriers and allows us to walk towards a better tomorrow, paw in hoof in hand. Our success is something that may never be replicated again, for it has teetered on the edge of collapse more than a few times, and thus we share a duty to uphold this miraculous collective for the future."
HYE_so_it_shall_be:0 "So It Shall Be"
HYE_so_it_shall_be_desc:0 "Harqaanka stands at the federation's podium, her vision proven in the fires of progress over the last few months. Few have found issue with her plans, and already the sown fields of the Qaylidi are beginning to bear fruit. The Little Shadow could not be prouder."
HYE_what_it_all_meant:0 "What It All Means"
HYE_what_it_all_meant_desc:0 ""You would assume that achieving so much in such a relatively short time would solve all your doubts, and prevent endless circles of self-analysis. Unfortunately that is very much not the case, and I find my purpose far murkier than it was before. Perhaps I should pen a letter to the Great Teacher."\n- Masaska, Page 541 of his Private Memoir." #masaska contemplates what his own purpose is now that he has set hyenia on the right path, and begins to draft a letter to fahamka.

hyenia.1.t:0 "The Dawn of the Last Campaign" #assemble the qaylid
hyenia.1.d:0 ""Even the pretense of unity is long gone, and they are tearing each other apart. Outside threats can't unite them any longer." The Great Teacher sat cross-legged on the small carpet as the hundred gathered dervishes in front of her listened silently. In the cavern, there was not a single sound but her voice. "I have heard the whispers and the anger you feel. You would have struck earlier, but the beast we face is not one we can take on alone. Now that they have fallen apart, we will ready ourselves. Even if their spies among us will scream their warnings, they cannot do much." The accusations of spies made one hyena in the back startle and glance around herself. Slowly, she began backing away only to feel a knife against her back.\n\n"Stand still," a soft murmur told her as she felt a stab of terror shoot through her. She had not even noticed him! "After this meeting you will plead with her for mercy, and tell her all you know. Choose life, or your story ends here." She nodded mutely, and the knife was removed from her back before its wielder - a lithe little male almost a head shorter than her - stepped up beside her.\n\n"Dervishes!" another female spoke up now, her booming voice contrasting with the Great Teacher's. She towered high over most of them, wearing her heavy armor like it was nothing. "We have fought, and we have bled, but the war that awaits is like nothing else. We no longer retreat when facing stiff opposition, we push! We beat and we stab, we shoot and we slash. By blade and bullet and bomb we will whip these apes back whence they came! We will free our people and raise our banners over Qalbi Weyn, or we will die trying! Death or Victory, there is no other choice!""
hyenia.1.a:0 "The cave thundered with the hyenas' response."
hyenia.2.t:0 "The Task Forces" #organize the resistance
hyenia.2.d:0 ""When we move, we must commit ourselves to move for days or indeed weeks if we have to. Our greatest concern will be to not outpace our supply caravans. If we do, we may well end up trapped deep in hostile territory. Our homeland has been under control for years, and the yetis will know how to fight in it. The mountains are their walls, not ours, and we will have to be relentless whenever we find a breakthrough." Furasho ran the back of her claw over the map as she indicated the routes they'd have to take through the mountain to the gathered commanders. It was exhilarating to realize that she would soon lay eyes on her lost home again. So much had changed since she fled Guur Dhurwaa, barely more than a pup that would be reborn in Ciidacirood.\n\n"All the supplies in the world won't matter if we can't push past the yetis." Masaska's voice made Furasho grit her teeth as she watched the small male across the table. Again and again he had to speak up against her. He stalked the corner of her eyes these days, and what once had been merely the Great Teacher's shadow was now speaking and acting of his own volition, seemingly always in opposition to her. "They won't be able to protect the entire front line, and if we can slip past them, we will be the ones to trap them. We will need to move as fast as we can, outrun our supplies if we need to, because speed will be everything."\n\n"You moved with warbands of a few dozen, not with thousands. I honor your accomplishments, and I hear your counsel, but this is different." She kept her words measured, though she felt the annoyance surge in her as he kept staring on the map.\n\n"I still moved through them, and those very thousands will be caught in a mountainous deathtrap if we are not fast enough." Raising his head, Masaska looked straight back at Furasho, unperturbed even as she unintentionally bared her teeth in frustration."    
hyenia.2.a:0 "Masaska is heard, and we shall move as fast as we can."
hyenia.2.b:0 "Furasho's counsel holds, and we will be inexorable in our advance."
hyenia.3.t:0 "Pledging Oneself, Mind and Body" #dedicate our souls
hyenia.3.d:0 "Even after a lifetime of contemplation and introspection, Fahamka admitted willingly that divining the future was futile. When she had sat beneath the stars that night, many decades ago, and started down the path to enlightenment, she had thought her life would be humble. The idea that she would sit here, the heart and soul of an army of thousands, was so alien as to be laughable, yet no one was laughing now.\n\nShe watched the young pups in front of her. They sat as if trying to affect the confidence of seasoned warriors, yet their inexperience and uncertainty were both all too obvious. So much potential, so much future, and it would all be spent on the slopes of Guur Dhurwaa. Though mighty Furasho would drill them ruthlessly, and dear little Masaska would show them the hidden paths and how to keep out of sight, she knew that many of them would not live when Qalbi Weyn finally was freed. They were clay to be molded into vessels in which the future would be carried, and she was the one molding them. They looked at her in silence, waiting for her to address them. She would speak, once again serving the role of the old and mighty who sent the young and eager to fight and die.\n\n'I'm sorry for what I am about to condemn you to, little ones.'"

Standing back to back, the Chainbreaker and the dervishes have carried on their respective struggles, aiding each other wherever possible.\n\nThrough her determination and the zeal of her warriors, as well as the aid given to her by Masaska's warrior bands, Bamina has now ascended the Hayzeb throne.

The night lay heavy over them, and they studied their attack plans in the light of campfires and lanterns, they meditated and prayed, and they sat together around the fires, all steeling themselves for what awaited in the morning. Further away, shadows moved under the light of the moon towards the mountains as Masaska's chosen dervishes moved into position. When dawn came, they would strike not from the front, but from behind, and open up the path for their kin.\n\nAnd as the first rays of the sun became visible on the horizon, the assembled warriors began to move. Thousands upon thousands picked up their weapons and gear, found their formations and began to move towards their stolen mountain home.\n\nSoon, the horizon began to echo with the sound of battle."

It all came together in a terrifying cacophony of war, and princess Jawharad had to force herself to stand tall and calm as she stepped off the boat and onto her native soil.\n\n"Your majesty!" The large officer greeted her with a deep bow. "The yetis are in full retreat, and we are seizing control of the harbour as well as their supply caches. As it stands, our forces will be ready to start pushing for Qalbi Weyn before nightfall. I must humbly admit that your attack plan seemed audacious, but it has worked out flawlessly." Jawharad merely smiled in response and nodded to him. Yes... 'her' attack plan. The plan that had been slipped into her room a few months earlier by the little shadow that had visited her ever since she was a child. The plan which had detailed how the Yetis would panic when the dervishes struck and how they would rush all their troops to the border, leaving their backs wide open for her forces to strike. She still did not know who the little shadow was, but she knew that if she would ever ascend the Malachite Throne, this was the time. After twelve years in exile, she was finally returning home along with thousands of hyena refugees, armed and prepared to reclaim their homeland no matter the hardships.\n\n"Let the soldiers know they are all heroes, and make sure that they eat well tonight. Feed those who were wounded from my own table, I will not dine in luxury until we have won this war." It was a small gesture, but right now it was all she could give. She listened to the more and more distant sounds of fighting. Beyond the hill in front of her, far away from here, Qalbi Weyn awaited, and after twelve years in exile, it was time to go home."

Her paws were clenching and unclenching in rage, yet Masaska stood completely still, meeting her gaze impassively. "Not only is that whelp still alive, she returned with an army of her own! Help me understand what your plan was here, because all I'm seeing is that you've aided the pretender to the throne that marginalised and persecuted dervishes!"\n\n"He did so on my behalf," Fahamka's voice made Furasho snap out of her rage, and she stared at the tunnel entrance from which the Great Teacher was entering. Hobbling in, the old female sat down on a bench by the wall, leaning on her cane. "And in your rage, you find the reason for secrecy. No, be still and listen, this is important. You still see the world in terms of rulers and ruled. But we are dervishes, not queens. We teach and guide, we do not rule. Jawharad is a daughter of Hyenia, like you, and the common Hyena gave her their loyalty and followed her, like how hundreds of soldiers joined us because of you."\n\n"Great Teacher, I threw myself before you and pledged my life to your cause. This princess has grown up in insane wealth, believing it to be her birthright, like how she views all of us! I rejected what I was taught, she has not!"\n\n"One cannot blame a student for not learning when their teacher is absent. And besides," Fahamka smiled as she glanced towards Masaska. "She may well have rejected more than you think."\n\n"She has rejected the opulence of her station, she feeds the sick and wounded from her own table, and she landed with the invasion to give them hope and courage." Masaska's voice was a low murmur in contrast to Furasho's booming voice. "Humbly, I believe that she is worthy of being heard out." Fahamka smiled.\n\n"Then we will meet with her, and discuss the future of Hyenia. She has a chance to not be her mother, just like you did."\n\nSlowly, reluctantly, Furasho stepped back and bowed her head."

Let her bring the same if she needs, but as much as we speak of unity, at least let us not march into this unprepared."\n\n"Do you speak from genuine concern, or are you insistent to find fault or risk where there is none?" Masaska asked pointedly, Furasho glaring at him.\n\n"You keep undermining and questioning me, and I've let it pass, but not this. I am sworn heart and blood to the Qaylid, all I do has been for our people, and you do not get to question that!"\n\n"You two argue like an old married couple," Fahamka chuckled. "I hope that you will invite me when she carries you through the door into your new home." The remark left Furasho blinking and stepping back, she and Masaska both looking at Fahamka in disbelief at her comment. "Now that you both have snapped out of this bickering. I have heard Furasho. What is your view, Masaska? Should we go alone?"\n\n"We could, but I cannot guarantee that it would be safe. If we are to bring warriors along, I would bring a hundred.

The reports of yeti stragglers in the area had made the situation even more tense, and there was a lull at the start of the negotiations. Who approached who? By ancient custom, Jawharad would be approached, but the dervishes had only ever known the Malachite Throne as a source of persecution and violence, and had fought it for their survival. It left a lull in the negotiations, one broken by Jawharad. Breaking with centuries of ironclad custom, she left her guards behind and approached the dervishes alone, sending ripples of shock through both sides. As she began to move Fahamka followed suit, hobbling towards the princess with her cane in one paw and a rolled up rug under the other. The two meet in the middle of the field, Jawharad once again breaking with tradition and customs as she bowed before Fahamka.\n\n"Greetings, Great Teacher Fahamka. I am honored to finally meet you, and I am in your debt for all that you've done for our people. I come before you today hoping that we can find an accord for the future of our homeland."\n\n"Greetings, Princess Jawharad." Fahamka bowed her head as well. "Your words are kind, and more than I expected from Queen Dahab's daughter." She rolled out the rug on the ground, leaving enough space for the two of them, and sat down in one end. "Now please be seated and tell me how you envision our homeland's future." Jawharad sat down as well.\n\n"As I've marched through Hyenia, I have seen the common hyena welcome me with tears of joy. I am their lost past and the desire for peace, but you were the ones who liberated it. That's why I have come to ask for your blessing to ascend the throne, and for the guidance of the Qaylid in rebuilding Hyenia."\n\n"Oh? So no months of jockeying for power, balancing promises and threats to get the advantage?" Fahamka asked mildly.

Complacency is to take your previous good work and use it to justify sloth, and it is one of the most insidious forms this vice can take. As the delegation reached the meeting point, facing the monarchists this became evident when one of the dervishes dropped dead, struck by a bullet. Though at first they feared treason, the truth became clear when armed yetis rose out of the terrain around them.\n\nBoth sides, having come to this place hoping for a diplomatic solution, had not brought more weapons than needed, and were forced to run for cover. Whether driven by desperate courage or sheer hateful spite, the yetis had received one chance to take revenge for their defeat and they took it. Storm creatures - the yetis' mute elite warriors - descended on them, prepared to rip the insolent dogs apart. Yet as so many had learned before, the Dervishes treated paw-to-paw combat no less seriously than any other. A loud ringing like that of a bell filled the air as the roaring Furasho smashed one of the storm creatures' faceplate in with her heavy steel gauntlets, leading the dervish counter charge.\n\nThe royalists, however, were another story. Its ranks formed from refugees and survivors, they had never studied under the Great Teacher, nor had they the same knowledge of close-quarters fighting. The ambush turned into a slaughter, and though the princess tried to flee, she was cornered before long by the creatures, who struck with the intent to kill."

When the battle finally ended, both Fahamka and the princess were both alive, even if the latter was alone among her servants. Surrounded by corpses, Jawharad sat paralysed with terror as Masaska whipped the blood off his sword in front of her. The Storm Creature who had been just about to kill Jawharad lay headless in front of her, and all around her lay a terrible scene of carnage.\n\n "Beddelaad?" Jawharad asked, looking around herself in shock, Masaska walking up to her and gently removing his cloak. He knew whom she meant, the old advisor he had spotted when visiting her before. A faithful old servant, one who had been like a father to her, now dead like all the others. She did not need to see that. "W-where is Beddelaad?!"\n\n"It's all right," Masaska whispered, placing the cloak on her shoulders and raising the hood. That way she would not see the corpse of the male she called for a few meters away. "You are safe. You know me," he told her quietly. "Little Shadow?" His eyes creased a little as he tried to smile behind the veil he wore. That this would be the first time they could meet like this... Yet, Jawharad recognized him it seemed, her eyes focused on him and she gave up a small noise of recognition. "You are safe, nobody will hurt you. We swore to protect Hyenia, and we will protect you."\n\nPrincess Jawharad, a pup when her homeland fell, forced to mature too fast to become the leader they said she had to be... all he could see was a broken soul who had lost her loved ones, and like how Fahamka had done in the ruins of his home all those years ago, he gently urged her to stand up. He looked around the gathered dervishes, steel in his voice. "I swear we will protect you and all of Hyenia. You all are safe, we will make sure of that."\n\nFahamka, watching the scene in silence, couldn't help but smile sadly. Little Masaska... who understood the Qaylid more deeply than him, the one who had lived in her shadow for so long? Finally he was taking flight."

Masaska kneeled by her side, his head lowered as he gently closed one eye then the other with his thumb. He couldn't find the words, none of them could. They had all known meeting with the royalists could have gone poorly, but they never could have expected this.\n\n"Poor, wretched pups." Fahamka whispered as she walked among the fallen hyenas. "To finally see your lost homeland after so many years in exile, only to end like this..."\n\n"The royalist cause is dead," Furasho said bluntly, folding her arms where she stood staring down at the dead princess. "The die is cast, and there is only one cause that can unite Hyenia now. I beg your forgiveness for my insolence, Great Teacher, but unless we want to see all we worked for washed away, we must seize this moment. The royalists are no longer a reliable ally, and will turn on us, claiming this was a scheme. We have one chance to strike and ensure they cannot bring further discord. Hyenia will see no new queen, it only has us, and I would betray your teachings if we did not take this chance. Do I have your blessing to be the leader Hyenia needs?"\n\nFahamka looked up at Furasho. So proud. So forceful. Born into a world where strength was everything, and who had the scars to prove it. What more could one have wanted in a dervish, and yet how flawed was she? Or perhaps she was what the Qaylid had to become? All things changed, and the Qaylid was no different.

She panted raggedly, her limbs burned from exhaustion. All she could see was death. Gunpowder smoke had formed a dreamlike haze over the world, and she stumbled up the slope, trying to find the others. Calling out between ragged breaths, she tried to get some response, yet there was nothing but silence and death around her. When she finally found the one she was looking for, the dream turned into a nightmare.\n\nYetis littered the ground around Fahamka, one paw still locked around a bloodied sword. Wounds littered her body, one of them having taken off her leg. It took a few seconds for the horrible truth to sink in. The Great Teacher, Hyenia's savior and the one who had given Furasho purpose again after her home burned, was dead.\n\nFurasho could only stare down at the nightmare before her. It was as if something was squeezing down on her, making her unable to move. At least, until she heard a noise behind her. Spinning around, gauntlets raised, she saw Masaska stumble towards her, clutching a grievous wound in his stomach.\n\n"Where is she?" Masaska whispered - almost breathed - as his legs started giving way under him. How he even remained upright she didn't understand. Furasho could only look down at Fahamka beside her, and Masaska's eyes followed hers. When seeing the sight, his legs gave away and he collapsed to the ground. "No... no!" The calm she had known him for had vanished, and he crawled towards her, whimpering like a pup. Blood trailed after him, and when he reached Fahamka he clutched her robe with one paw as he slowly grew still.\n\n"Masaska?!" Furasho grabbed her rival, pulling him up to try to shake him away, but it was too late. Slowly letting go of him, she stared around herself. The shock slowly let go, and the horror of what had happened gradually dawned on her as a hysterical laughter began to echo through the valley."

Because of this, the Tunnel Runners here have made a good living since time immemorial. They know every nook and cranny, and they can get you where you need to be faster than any other Hyena.

When the zebra king was distracted by foreign enemies, the ground would cave in and thousands of Hyenas would flood out of the tunnels and seize the capitol before the zebra could do anything about it. Nothing ever came of the plan, and what was meant as a staging ground soon became a trading hub.\n\nWhile the hold has shrunken immensely during the last years due to being cut off, to our surprise it has grown back to its original population and then some, as local zebras ended up taking refuge among our kin after the storm king and subsequent fighting cost them their homes.

Furasho walked in the middle of the procession, her face stoic as she walked up towards the stone steps, where Fahamka awaited her.\n\nFahamka had been reluctant to engage in this ceremony, but Furasho had insisted. Hyenia only had them, and they had to establish that they were the ones in charge and do so thoroughly. And so, as the procession came up the steps, Furasho stepped up and bowed deeply before Fahamka, all dervishes following suit. Fahamka was the Great Teacher, the Voice of the Qaylid, the First Dervish, and all that the dervishes were emanated from her.\n\n"You came to the Qaylid in disgrace and defeat, Furasho, daughter of Aamin."

You are the Fist of the Qaylid, but now you must become more. Will you take up the burden of leadership not just for the dervishes, but for all Hyenia? Will you become the High Dervish of Hyenia, and lead its people to a better future?"\n\n"As I am called, I will answer," Furasho replied, raising her paws while still bowing.

Fahamka took off her sword and laid it in Furasho's paws. Furasho stepped back, retreating two steps down the stairs so that as she rose up, fastening it around her waist, Fahamka still stood above her.

The leader, meanwhile, are the remnant of Hyenia's nobility, and even today they have a lot of influence.

Lest we are forced to deal with an insurgency, they must be dealt with.\n\nFurasho has ordered Masaska to ensure that the royalist leaders are taken out of the picture, and the Blade of the Qaylid has reluctantly obeyed. The desire to avoid further bloodshed does not take away the shame of having fed the princess plans and information to make the royalists attack as well only to now do away with them. It is a stain on them all, and yet the royalists are numerous enough that they would be a genuine threat to stability if not dealt with.\n\nAs they fall, their bodies will be spirited away and buried in their ancestors' soil. Their soldiers will be disarmed where possible, and hopefully the leaderless army will disband without too much issue.

Sycophants and pawlickers were a poor foundation of a state, and thus she would need not only those whom she could trust, but also those who would be willing to stand firm on what was right and just.\n\nAppointing Bogsiiye and Eber Weyn to her inner circle was a given, both of them had served her well for many years. Eber Weyn was a master of molding young hyenas into capable fighters and dervishes, and Bogsiiye was wise when it came to matters of health, healing, and nutrition. Considering the state of the nation, the latter especially would be sorely needed. Seenyaale would serve equally well, even if the great foundries of Hyenia would be a different challenge to the workshops she had organised during the resistance.\n\nYet when it comes to the affairs of science, Furasho admitted that she could not think of a better candidate than Kelidii, even if said hyena was an avowed supporter of Masaska. And as for Masaska... what to do with her rival? Part of her, a small, shameful part that she had long since learned to tune out, wanted to marginalise him, and yet who was a better spy than him? Who could lead a warband behind enemy lines and strike where it would hurt the most? She was a fool if she thought Masaska wasn't worthy of his position, or that he would not serve Hyenia well.\n\nYes, Hyenia, not her. She was merely the first servant of the nation, and the instant she forgot that she may well become another Dahab."

Their reputation preceded them, that of fierce paws that struck from both the mountains and the underground, to do battle and to lend aid.\n\nThey could not stay that way. This, Furasho knew. Even the Great Teacher did not exist outside the rules of nature.\n\nCandles and lanterns burned, where volunteering scribes pinned down tenets in as few words as possible, clear-cut. Messengers, accompanied by many of the Great Teacher's more experienced initiates, scoured their own land in their mission to clarify the principles of their new ruler, while acolytes accompanied every conceivable meeting Furasho held with what could charitably be called a court, perhaps a government. The liberated who hadn't needed to fight, who might also be taken up to codify laws for a proper state... the Great Teacher's discoveries hadn't disseminated that far before.\n\nThat, too, would change. All under Furasho's orders.\n\nTheir neighbours were poised to return to the old days of properly defined kingdoms and republics. Far into the future, the dervishes had to stand under the scrutinizing spotlight of the world stage.

Numbers did not lie - even if there were many ways to obfuscate just what they were saying - and they had all that they needed to conclude that Hyenia was more than wounded, it was near broken.\n\nThe foundries and factories that had served as the basis of Hyenia's industrial might were by and large inactive or indeed destroyed. The subterranean tunnel network that had run across much of the region had collapsed in many place and splintered into tiny complexes. The farms of the nation were in disarray, with nobody being able to even answer how much produce Hyenia was growing, and starvation was a fact for many. Hundreds of thousands had fled Hyenia one way or another, and with them they had brought all the wealth and all the food they could carry to try to build a life elsewhere.\n\n"...and so to the question of what must be done, it seems we can answer 'yes'," a dervish joked dryly, making Furasho give her a withering glare. "Forgive me, but I am making a point. Hyenia is suffering in a multitude of ways, and almost no matter where we start, there will still be those suffering because we prioritized elsewhere."\n\n"Maybe so, but we are sitting here fed and safe as the country suffers. Let us show grace enough to not quip while others starve." The quip had been innocent enough, but Furasho recalled too many moments where the court had rung with laughter over jokes about the plight of the commoners.

When I moved to these lands, I only sought to plow the earth and grow my crops. I've never held ill will towards any of you, and I've taken pride in giving your fellow hyenas work wherever I can. I beg you to show mercy, and let us remain in these lands."\n\n"You mean that you stole land for your farm from the rightful owners, put them to work serving you, and now expect us to let you keep what you stole." Furasho stared him down with eyes as cold as the southern wind. He was not alone either, thousands of his ilk now lived in Hyenian lands to which they had moved since after the invasion.\n\n"I... if it will serve as compensation, I offer myself to you as a slave to repay our debt to your people. All I ask is that my family will not be expelled from the only home they have ever known."\n\n"You beg for clemency, and in the same breath you insult us by claiming that we hold slaves, no, silence." She raised her paw. "If we gave the mercy you gave us, you would flee back to your ancestral lands, hounded by warriors hunting you for sport. We are not the Storm King however, remember this."

Eber Weyn, I want you to draw up plans for where we will most effectively hold them and how many more hyenas we can arm. Seenyaale, how soon can we accelerate production of military equipment? Masaska, I need you to keep tabs on their every step." She stopped herself, taking a long, slow breath to calm down. She still remembered the first war, like an open wound.

hyenia_furasho.9.d:0 "One of Furasho's earliest memories was her mother demonstrating the role of the common hyena to her, a role of passivity and obedience. The nobility was the head of Hyenia, and it was the role of the head to think, not the paw. To show this, her mother had ordered the commoners to debase themselves in front of her. The commoners, terrified of what awaited if they did not obey, had meekly done as they were told. Obedience was a muzzle for their minds, her mother had said, and kindness would let them think they had the right to be without it.\n\nAfter how many centuries of this abuse, the damage to the common hyena's very understanding of the world was immense, and for that reason there could be no half-measures in elevating them. Meekly, they would follow suit and obey, but in time, the Qaylid would open their minds, as it had opened hers. She knew that there were detractors, but as someone who once had wielded this vile tyranny, she knew well what would happen when it was relaxed. When the absolute order that once had ruled all things withered away, the Qaylid had to be there to firmly embrace them like it had her. If not, there would be chaos.\n\nTo ensure this went as it must, the teachings of the Qaylid would become mandatory for all Hyenas. A cadre of chosen dervishes would be tasked with ensuring that the knowledge was spread throughout Hyenia, and that the novices of the nation understood it. Those who could learn it would be raised to full dervishhood, equal in honor and duties to those who had fought in the war of reclamation, but nothing would ever take the title of novice from even the lowest hyena. The Qaylid was always there for them, and they always would have hope. And if they would come to question it, then it was because they had been given the knowledge how."

hyenia_furasho.10.d:0 "For centuries, Ciidacirood was little more than a waystation under the sands. When Fahamka was expelled from the heartland, she came there with her closest and built a more robust settlement. It was still humble, but her foresight meant that when the refugees flooded in, the caves could offer shelter to thousands of them. To those Hyenas who had been running for days or indeed weeks, the sight of those stark tunnels finally offering them shelter had been like heaven. It had been plain, ascetic even, but they had been given food, beds and medicine. Though the dervishes' resources had been stretched to the very limit, and though mass starvation was only just kept at bay, they had survived and they had grown stronger for it.\n\nCiidacirood was the first city of the dervishes, but the war had meant it had largely remained a hollowed out pit under the desert. The original inhabitants had born the trials well, many of them joining the dervishes themselves, but with the seat of power moving to Qalbi Weyn, what would have happened to this - the place where Hyenia first was reborn? Furasho had refused to let it be abandoned and reduced to a hollow shell of what it had been. With its halls widened and its buildings expanded, it was now a proper city. The core of it remained unchanged and would remain such, but the rest of it was now such that those who had lived here before could enjoy the fruits of the nation's growth as well.\n\nYet for those novices who walked north under the sun and the stars, they would find the near hidden openings, coming down into awaiting tunnels and be welcomed with simple food, shelter and water, which to the weary wanderer was all they needed. And so, as their predecessors had, the pilgrims would learn from Ciidacirood."

Masaska asked lightly as Furasho looked at the map that hung on the wall, displaying the area they had taken over. "They are in our grasp, and anything we do to them would at worst be eye for an eye. Does that tempt you?"\n\n"What tempts me is irrelevant," even now, Furasho struggled to bear his ribbing. "What matters is that we stand where the Storm King stood, and we must not fail where he failed. If we withdraw, we will let them come again before too long. If we merely take over the heartland and try to crush rebellions in the outer regions we may well spawn another tyrant to lead them against us. We must think more long term, and make sure that the yetis cannot become a threat again. They are broken creatures with poisoned beliefs, and we must lead them to something better.

Furasho valued loyalty, or at least familiarity, yet this was far beyond what she could hope to fill up with those she could personally vouch for. And indeed, merely seeking to employ the loyal and pliable would set a troubling precedent that would rot Hyenia from within.\n\nNo, this would demand a measure of relinquishing power and putting faith in her fellow dervishes. It vexed her, and she was happy Masaska wasn't present in the room. She could not imagine how much he would needle her about it. As for the new administrators... some would have to come from recent converts, others would be picked among those she had been reluctant to empower, and yet more would rise among the lower ranking Dervishes, and indeed yet some among the Yetis.\n\nIt unsettled her, as the reins of power seemed to be held looser and looser in her paws, but it was the only option available right now. Then again maybe this was her trial here? She had said that she wished to elevate hyenakind, and now she was offered a chance to prove it."

Yet they were not completely broken yet, and still could rise to their former heights and even further.\n\nThough history had many times seen them on opposing sides, here today they were kin in suffering, and the Hyenas knew what it meant to have all that you were trampled underpaw.

She wondered if this was how Masaska saw her; a blunt tool of war, ill-suited to the nuances of peace.\n\n"It will not, yet the cycle must end somewhere. More retribution and more violence will not build a future where the struggles of the past are left there. We know the mettle of the Yetis, and if we do not take care to offer them an honorable way back then we will reap only more fighting. They are made of strong materials, and need a smith to forge them into tools of creation rather than weapons of destruction."\n\n"We are to teach the Yetis the Qaylid, and hope they can actually understand it? That is a tall order, and I wonder if it approaches hubris."\n\n"A noble's daughter could hear the Great Teacher's words and learn.

With a deep breath and a willingness to dunk his head into the deep, he braved the waters, fighting upstream just to battle each and every inch of water and, symbolically, immaturity—the one thing left holding his future down.

hyenia_furasho.24.d:0 "A strange white building had arrived, too clean for comfort in the middle of their village, and it reeked of artificiality. It was one thing to hold onto the future, another to have it become the present like... this.\n\nXirid's son needed it, though. Her little pup Orod had always been rambunctious, always getting himself into scrapes, always going to the local seer Isgaarsiin from how many kilometers away to have the wound sewn shut and chanted over. She was also a friend, a great sympathiser to all that'd turned to her for aid, and her domicile had soothed everyone with more than just medicinal herbs.\n\nNow, though, just a dozen minutes away thanks to one of these new ambulances, Xirid sat in the doctor's room, a kind fellow in white robes with much more metal things on his person than she'd expected. Yet, a few yelps of muted pain and some strips of gauze later, it was over. "It will take a while to heal, but rest assured, it will be quick. He can move around as long as he doesn't stress his arm so much... ah, and young one, have this." He pawed from a plate a slice of sweetened halwa, a rectangular delicacy. "Something for your trouble."\n\nIt would've melted Xirid's heart there and then. None of the pain, none of the hours of waiting... Orod wouldn't have to go through all that anymore. But something was amiss. "What will happen to Isgaarsiin and others like her? They won't just go away, will they?"\n\n"Who do you think helped him establish a practice?" came the frail voice of nobody but Isgaarsiin herself, cloak and all, who'd stepped inside. "I can see it in your face, miss, the old refusing to die, but for one, modern medicine hasn't come into contact with the unique plants and mixtures here. It's an expertise only we seers here have, actually...""

hyenia_furasho.25.t:0 "The Hyenas' Demand" 
hyenia_furasho.25.d:0 "We've received a missive from the south. The Hyenians, who have united under the theocratic warrior Furasho, have given us an ultimatum: hoof over to them all of Hayzeb, or they will go to war.\n\nOn one hoof, the hyenas are not to underestimated. They've gained the upper hoof over the yetis and the storm creatures so far—the same ones who, only years ago, had ravaged our lands and much more. The hyenas have only honed their warcraft since, so acceding to them might be prudent.\n\nHowever, there is no promise that this will be their only request. A few among us say that this will give the Hyenians a hoofhold in the Great Lakes, and though an empire under the reign of a thoughtful religious bruiser seems better than the terror of the Storm King, it isn't better by much. Plus, what pride will we have left if we simply give up Hayzeb? Have we not fought valiantly for the lives of our fellow zebras here? Shall we give them up to a foreign overlord just because we are scared?\n\nBut whatever else may be said, the Hayzeb's fate is in the hooves of [THIS.GetLeader] and their next move."

hyenia_furasho.26.d:0 ""They said yes?" Furasho asked an aide for clarity's sake.\n\nSaid aide had all the confusion Furasho didn't. "That's what they said." He then offered the written reply to her paws. "As per [974.owner.GetLeader]'s words, Hayzeb will be given to us effective immediately. Whatever value the region's had, it must mean less to them than a full-on war."\n\nAfter pondering, she did nod her head. "Maybe it does make sense. I did prepare for the possibility of them saying yes, after all. These new citizens will learn the Qaylid, but at least it will be without bloodshed."

They wouldn't give Hayzeb up so easily.\n\n"Our last war is still fresh in our minds," Furasho said to her aide that had given her the message from across the Great Lakes' border, "but now, we fight not for survival nor for reclamation but for a peace that should not be reserved for us alone. I will tell the leaders that will march our armies deep into Zebrican heartlands that though the faces we shall see are those of zebras, not yetis, we must not let our guard down. Let us strike while they are still unready..."

hyenia_furasho.28.d:0 "Vast and overpowering in all its arid glory lay the rocks and dunes of Zwadai, lightly stitched together by very few rivers and fewer settlements. With the defeat of these sands' self-proclaimed Emperor, every inch and mile was Hyenia's. The problem, though, was that in spite of its raw power which had made short work of many travellers, it had nothing else. Stopover country, it could reasonably be called; a hotspot or two for caravans, then there'd pop up the fruitless stretches of nothing.\n\nWhich was all Bacad could gather, assigned here to govern a slice of one of these rivers and its collection of households, armed with lists and censuses and a written record of the Qaylid. A dervish this far north, with not a single underground location to take shelter from the heat beyond the roofs over creatures' heads—cynically speaking, he'd been planted so far from the centre of anything meaningful or significant back in old Hyenia, this felt like a dead end.\n\nThat changed when a zebra reared her robed head. Dread featured prominently in her muzzle and eyes (they'd heard the Storm's devastation, seen it firsthoof, remained in chains while the Lakes ran free). Her questions ran rapid, of who-are-you's and what-are-you-here-for's and why-are-you-not-a-yeti's?\n\nAny vengeful dreams of lost pride and their fears of lost years dissipated in the face of he, her husband, and her neighbours."

hyenia_furasho.29.t:0 "A Hyenian Unity?"
hyenia_furasho.29.d:0 "We've received a curious invitation from the hyenas: to join them in this experiment they call a unity of creatures.\n\nSuch an invitation is unprecedented, but as it is, the hyenas have done much more work in sending ripples across the world than us, and it stands to reason that if they decide to force themselves on our fair nation (which we believe they will not, but just in case), we can't exactly say for sure that we would prevail in that contest.\n\nStill, it is not only conquest they seek. They've come preaching a message of changing towards the better, not just as countries but as individuals, creatures relating to one another. The costs must be weighed, but then again, how good is it for us and the rest of the region to be in this one place for such a long time? Perhaps here, something brighter can blossom with the hyenas."

hyenia_princess.1.d:0 "The throne was smaller than Jawharad remembered it. When she had been a pup it had always seemed titanic, like a mountain projecting its might onto the world. Oh it was large, to be sure, and the steps up to it added to the feeling, but it was just that; large. Not in the realm of titans, but in that of mortal creatures. As was she, she supposed.\n\n"It is my greatest joy to stand by your side today, your divine highness." Once she had only heard wisdom in the old advisor's words, but a Little Shadow had poked her with questions over and over, making her see the schemes behind them. "And before long, we shall be able to raise you to your rightful place and restore Hyenia to what it should be."\n\n"Alas..." Jawharad felt fearful and excited at once, and noticed something moving in the corner of her eye. She sat down on the throne without ceremony, violating another old taboo to a choir of gasps. "Things will not be so simple, my old friend. Little Shadow, if you would, please." Almost the instant she had finished her sentence, a swirl of movement preceded a lone little male appearing by the throne's side, his face masked and a sword by his side. She couldn't help but smile dryly as she saw their faces. Pure shock, indeed horror, across the gathered old nobles' faces.\n\n"My most loyal advisors. You've advised me to the best of your abilities, maybe even believing your words were just. Alas, this one came to me many years ago, and he has told me many things that you did not. Hyenia will rise again, but it is by the earthen blood of the regular hyena, not the golden blood of nobility, that it will do so. Now I say, without coronation and without custom, that you will share in this bounty, but that you must first humble yourselves. You are no longer the masters of Hyenia, and if you can accept that, step down and take up your place by the common Hyena's side, you will not gain as you hoped, but as you must. And if you do not... the rightful sovereign of Hyenia has the ear of the Qaylidi Dervishes, and she will not shy any means to ensure stability in her realm.""

hyenia_princess.6.d:0 ""I am old, and I am not getting younger." Fahamka held her cup of spiced coffee in both paws as she addressed the group of hyenas seated in front of her. It seemed like another of the countless classes she had held, but the presence of Jawharad, her advisor Beddelaad, Furasho, Masaska, Kelidii, Eber Weyn, Xaawa and so many others suggested otherwise. "The conflict pushed the dervishes towards the future before were were entirely ready for it, and I have become the sun around which all things rotate. In this, I have become like your mother." She spoke to Jawharad, who bowed her head. Like Dahab, the autocrat who had demanded absolute control of Hyenia, and who had doomed it when nothing could happen without her say-so. "If I continue like I do now, I will maintain absolute control, I will die, and I will leave a power vacuum that will see the dervishes tear themselves apart. Now though... as the government is fledgling and weak, so will the dervish leadership become." A stir went through the gathered Hyenas at this.\n\n"You are a fine young cub, Jawharad, and you can become a good queen, but as you grow into the role, you will grow side by side with Furasho and Masaska. Together, you can build this new Hyenia, but the choices must be yours, and so must the future be. And just so that the need for pomp is met..." Fahamka pushed herself up to stand, and walked up to Jawharad to offer her her paws. After a second's hesitation, Jawharad reached up to let the old female hold her paws. "Know, Jawharad, daughter of Dahab, that you are worthy. Know that I see this worth in you, and that you have my blessing as the leader of Hyenia. All I ask is that you heed the word of your people, and remember who put you where you are."\n\nAgain with the unceremonious bluntness. Jawharad smiled at it, still reeling from it even as she knew what to say." #Fahamka steps down as leader of the armed forces and declaring who will lead the dervishes from now on, as well as formally giving her blessing to Jawharad as the rightful ruler of Hyenia."

hyenia_princess.7.t:0 "Into the Underworld" 
hyenia_princess.7.d:0 "The old cave system under Hyenia had been utterly devastated during the Storm King's attack. Not only had fleeing Hyenas collapsed the tunnels as they fled, hoping to buy time, but the yetis had taken an obscene pleasure in finding and bombing the tunnels wherever they could find them to try to squeeze the Hyenas out of the earth. The end result had left a once massive network torn to pieces, and cleaning the network up would be a humongous project.\n\nAnd yet, how many tens of thousands of hyenas were still down there in the dark, huddling in fear of the terrors that had swept Hyenia? Many of them would still be alive, their people had always known how to live deep underground, but they were still lost to Hyenia. If they would be found again, they would have to do what Hyenas did best - dig.\n\nGiven the name of "Hyenian Excavation Corps" by Jawharad herself in a grand ceremony, these teams of hyenas have been tasked with reclaiming their lost home below ground. For as all hyenas know, 'the sun may shower a million kisses upon us, but the earth is whence we came and where we'll go'. The proverb has usually been read as saying that we all die, but considering how our oldest stories speak of how we broke through to the surface, it points to our bond with the underground as well."

He should have been offended by how she had picked him up and physically carried him out of the academy, yet if not for that, he would not stand here again. Though his eyes were dim and his back hunched, he could still see the great pillars of Qalbi Weyn before them. The city was damaged, and he couldn't help but shed a tear as he saw how many irreplaceable old buildings - legacies of their ancestors - had been destroyed. Yet, he was home again. The Academy would open again, and soon he would once more be able to teach and to do his research under the auspices of the Malachite Throne.\n\n"Let me carry your load, honored elder." Someone offered him and Aqoon - out of instinct - held out his satchel towards what he had assumed was Xoghaye. His ears weren't what they were either, yet then he realized she was standing further away and he looked at the speaker in shock. What met him was not his assistant, but black desert clothing and a scarred face - one of those horrid desert bandits!\n\n"Help! Bandits! Xoghaye, I'm being robbed!" In fright, he managed to raise his cane to start furiously and repeatedly beating the ruffian over the head. He may be almost ninety winters old, but he was not going down without a fight!\n\n"No! Professor! Professor, that's our escort! Stop hitting him!" Xoghaye yelled as she ran up to him and grabbed the cane, stopping Aqoon in his tracks as he blinked, looking between his assistant and what he had thought was a bandit and who currently was shielding his head with his paws.\n\n"Oh... uhm... yes please?""

hyenia_masaska.1.d:0 "There were but a few of them gathered in the Sun Dome of the old palace, the dusty tiles and torch-stained pillars having seen no care during the occupation. On one side was the princess, Jahwarad, and her most loyal retainers, both servants and guards. On the other side stood the dervishes: the Great Teacher, Fahamka, and an pawful of dervish warriors, and also her two closest advisors, Furasho the brave... and Masaska.\n\nThe latter stepped forward as Jawharad, still clad in her robes of exile, beckoned him forth, clutching something in her paws that gleamed in the torchlight. At once, he knew. "You are certain?" he asked of her, almost pleading.\n\n"Very," said the princess. "It's clear to me that this land needs more than the ways of old if it's to thrive again." She stretched her arm forward and presented her old friend with her keepsake: a golden key, the one that unlocked the chest containing the crown jewels, hidden deep in the treasury. "For my life, the reins of rule," she said.\n\nMasaska opened his mouth to try and say something, but he didn't have to, for the Great Teacher said: "For your right, peace in this realm." Fahamka raised up her paws and briefly looked skyward. "And the blessings of the Qaylid upon all of us."\n\nSoon the dervishes departed, with Masaska looking back one more time before he strode onward to the burdens of state, but the royal entourage remained. One of them, a guard, stepped forward to plead with his queen: "But... your rights!"\n\nJawharad shook her head. "The throne has always belonged to the people of Hyenia."" # Masaska is formally given the reins to rule by Jawharad, repaying her debt to him and the dervishes. The ceremony is small but still filled by dervishes and non-dervishes, with Fahamka also giving her blessing.

hyenia_masaska.2.d:0 "Somewhere within the royal palace, beneath the opulent chambers once reserved for royalty, was a chamber known only as the Teal Shrine, so-called because of the teal-coloured stone that adorned its walls. It had been meant as a place of worship for Hyenia's many faiths, and having no use for it the yetis left it alone. Fahamka, however, discerned that it would be of great use as a place of meditation, and thus her closest disciples, in the midst of a great debate, had gathered here to dwell in her presence.\n\n"Numbers and force would have kept us safer," growled Furasho, crossing her arms. "What if you weren't there to save your precious princess, Masaska? What then?"\n\n"No one could have foreseen that, not even the Great Teacher!" Masaska retorted, though it pained him to admit some limitation on the part of his beloved mentor. "Besides, we can't let the exception rule the common. We have to consider the future, not the past."\n\n"We have to grow our skill, and with diligence," Furasho countered; she knew the teachings as well. "Your militias will have to catch up to my braves in warfare."\n\n"At least we will have them," Masaska answered. "Where will your soldiers come from, Furasho?"\n\nSilence came upon them, the two young apprentices staring at each other, but it was Furasho who broke it first. "...As the Great Teacher wills, you must decide," she uttered, gritting her teeth. "My plan, or yours?"\n\nMasaska balked, feeling Furasho's burning, expectant gaze burning through him. The persistent silence of his Teacher, deep in meditation, did not assuage his anxiety. He swallowed, took a deep breath, and decided." # Masaska and Furasho determine the nature of their military organization going forward. Masaska proposes his preferred method, which involves mobilization of local militias accross Hyenia, while Furasho insists that a disciplined, national army is the best method.

hyenia_masaska.3.d:0 "Nowadays the course of their duties often brought Masaska and Furasho together in the Teal Shrine, and while the Great Teacher was content to remain in tranquil quiet her very presence helped the both of them to enter, in some way, into the peace she inhabited, so that they might act upon the world in wisdom and truth. Such was their mindset as they looked over an outdated map of southern Zebrica, its surface marked by many notes taken from scouting reports.\n\n"The yetis will soon have a king again, or maybe even a queen," Furasho said. "I've trained up some new dervishes from our novices; you can inspect them later if you want."\n\n"I'll do that, yes," Masaska said, sifting through tattered parchments inscribed with Furasho's round, thick letters. "And we're also planning against... the Ancient Pact. As I recall, we were for a long time their aggressors."\n\n"Exactly, which means they'll want revenge," Furasho asserted. "Our main advantages are the tunnels and the desert. I don't look forward to fighting those centaurs face on otherwise."\n\nMasaska furrowed his brow but could find no weakness in her assumptions. "Very well, and we're preparing against the Great Lakes, as well?"\n\n"Of course," she replied. "Most of their claimants aren't going to get along with us, that's for sure."\n\nMasaska nodded affirmatively. "This is... very good, Furasho. Keep me updated on your preparations and let me know if anything changes, especially regarding the yetis."\n\n"Right away... sir," Furasho answered. She was happy to see that Masaska accepted her expertise on war, and there was definitely more of it to come.\n\nFor his part, Masaska was content to rely on Furasho's experience, and he himself was happy that, despite their many differences, they both agreed that Hyenia needed to assert itself against her enemies, if she was to continue to exist." # Masaska and Furasho draw up plans for future invasions of all nations around them - those being the yetis first and foremost, with the ancient pact and great lakes coming after. While the two of them differ in many ways, they both agree that Hyenia cannot exist without asserting itself against those who would do it harm.

hyenia_masaska.4.d:0 "Both of the scouts looked skeptically at the dishevelled creature leading them onward, his lanky legs leaping across the piles of scrap and dirt littering the outskirts of this nameless village. "It's some useless bauble, I bet," said one of them, tending to a strand of her mane that had gotten loose from her scarf.\n\n "Don't be so sure," said her companion, tightening a loose strap on her scabbard. "The villagers were pretty eager to point at him as, uh, an expert in... mechanics? Is that the word?"\n\n"Over here!" shouted the male, his reedy voice unusually echoic in the dry air.\n\nThe scouts stepped closer and found him prying open some kind of gate hidden beneath sheets of thin metal. Without further thought they decided to assist the slender-armed "mechanic", the strength of both of them enough to swivel the rusted hinges.\n\nStepping inside, they both beheld a small wonder: a space just large enough for the male to step into unbowed containing a wooden table and several unidentifiable (to them) devices set upon it. "What is... this?" the first scout asked, utterly perplexed.\n\n"Just some of the projects I've been working on!" he answer enthusiastically. "I had to stash it all here because of the yetis, but now that they're gone we can finally go to full bandwidth again!"\n\n"Band... width?" But before she could say anything else the diminutive (to her) tinkerer reached forward and flicked some kind of knob on the side of one of the boxes. Immediately it sprang to life and began emitting strange buzzing noises, and to one side a tiny lightbulb shone fiercely. The mechanic smiled eagerly as he gently caressed the device.\n\nThe second scout decided to speak on behalf of her exasperated colleague. "This is all well and good, but you're just one hyena."\n\n"I am," he said, "except..." He reached under the table and produced a list of numbers and, next to each of them, names. "We're a club!" # despite the poor environment the occupation and wars have left Hyenia, there is still potential for it to grow. even now, their knowledge is growing, and soon it will blossom into a place of stability and prosperity. but, of course, we're just getting started.

hyenia_masaska.5.d:0 "Some distance from the royal palace was an old parlour house, made of cut stone and overlooking the city from its exquisite vantage atop a hill. The yetis had driven out its previous owners and converted it into a lounge for its officers, but having themselves been driven out the place was now free for new uses, such as at the present moment as a meeting place for two important hyenas.\n\n"You're a bit late," said Masaska. He was sitting at a window-side table that he found rather too opulent, gazing at his companion, a hooded female hyena with a sly spark in her amber eyes.\n\n"I have to be about my business," she answered, stepping closer until she could take up a seat across from him. "You understand."\n\n"As much as I am able to, Harqaanka," he replied, his eyes turning towards the window, and the city. "I've been thinking more about internal affairs lately. The people of our lands aren't sure what they want, beyond freedom from the yetis."\n\nHarqaanka smiled. "And you think you might know?"\n\nShe could see Masaska's grimace even through that mask he always wore. "Every hyena is done with being told what to think, but at the same time..." He sat up straight, a spark of inspiration brightening his dark eyes. "They need someone to show them what is best."\n\nHarqaanka said nothing apart from a curious "Go on..."\n\n\"I - we - can teach them, quietly, carefully," he continued, standing up and pacing deliriously. "Decentralization, collectivization, all the ideas of the Qayladi teachings... they will learn them, and make them their own, and that way we'll help them choose right!"\n\nHarqaanka's smile subtly grew. "And how do you propose we do that?"\n\nMasaska turned to face her, and the wildness in his eyes surprised even her. "I have some ideas," he said." # Masaska and Harqaanka, his informal second in command, discuss his plans for changing Hyenian society. He tells her that the hyenian people are done being told what to do... so hes going to influence them quietly - make them think its their idea. The decentralization, collectivization, spreading of qaylidi ideas will all be done because they want to do it, not because theyre forced into it.

hyenia_masaska.6.d:0 ""Is everything ready, your Hi- Jawharad?" Masaska inquired, looking up at his monarchical friend in her afternoon dress.\n\n"It is," she answered, looking through the threshold into the Great Hall, from which she could hear the shuffling and muttering of the many delegates and dignitaries they had gathered there. "Just do as we practiced and it will all be fine."\n\n"Of course," Masaska stated, taking a deep, calming breath. "I am ready."\n\n"You need to take off your mask," Jawharad affirmed, subtly pointing at the garment. "They need to see your face."\n\nMoments later, a maskless Masaska, his slender snout visible to all, stepped into the hall, with Jawharad following. At her entry the delegates all stood as one, the more aristocratic of them giving her dignified bows. She let Masaska ascend the podium first - many in the audience whispered to each other about the significance - but she was the first to speak.\n\n"Creatures of Hyenia," she stated. "We have brought you here to present our agreement for governing this land. At the first, the Crown asserts its ancient right to rule over Qalbi Weyn, and for all affairs of state we affirm the assistance of our trusted companions, the Dervishes of Ciidacirood." She turned her head and looked towards the chief of those Dervishes.\n\nMasaska's mouth stiffened, his mask no longer there to hide his weakness, but just as he had practiced, he spoke: "The Dervishes accept the responsibility of rule, for the peace and order of the land." He tilted his snout up just a little, finding more strength in himself as he continued. "The strength of the Qaylid shall lift up every creature of good will in Hyenia, and our arms shall stand ready to defend us all against all who wish us ill." He leaned forward now, gazing at the astonished delegates in the eyes. "The Qaylid shall suffer no adversary to take away the freedoms so many have bled and died for! From among those freedoms we present you this: to every city and township, we call upon you to send leaders to participate in governing Hyenia. We shall have a parliament!"" # Masaska and Jawharad announce the beginning of a civilian government, ordained by both the Dervishes and the Malachite throne. While Masaska and his dervishes maintain control over the country on a national level and the crown retains nominal control over the capital of Qalbi Weyn, every other city and township will be allowed to choose their own local leaders who may participate in the governing of the nation.

hyenia_masaska.7.d:0 "Just a few days ago a certain hillside parlour had re-opened to the public, an elegant but not ostentatious establishment named "The Pilgrim's Gaze". Through some coincidence or machination the place had quickly become a notable gathering place for what passed for Qalbi Weyn's intellectual elite, the scribes and lawyers and elders concerned with the future of the land. The scents of coffee and cakes and herbs suffused the air, and every now and then a hyena would emerge from the back with a broom to sweep away the dust and the crumbs.\n\n"It starts off simply: diligence and skill," one hyena said excitably, aroused by the topic and the half-cup of (rather pricey) coffee he had sipped. "It shouldn't be hard to grasp, right? But you ask anycreature what it really means - how it's supposed to be *done* - and you get different answers. Even those dervishes don't all have the same answer, except: Just do it! It's maddening."\n\n"The faith is new, so it's still working through the implications," said his companion, setting down his tea cup on its saucer. "The goal of the principles is union with the spiritual unfolding of history... I think. That means the real question is what this diligence is working towards. How one unfolds the cosmic order in one's own life. Admittedly, it seems a bit difficult for one hyena to achieve by himself." He settled into silence as he came to this question, rubbing his chin as he puzzled it out.\n\nThere was a third with them, a female who had insinuated her way into their presence earlier. Setting the remnants of her honey cake aside, she looked at the two males curiously. "Maybe we should look beyond what any one hyena can do, and look instead at what many can do together."\n\nThe two males looked up at her, realization dawning upon their furrowed faces." # The six principles of the Qaylid have served the dervishes well, but it is yet incomplete.

tech_hye_start:0 "Sustenance and Survival"
tech_hye_start_desc:0 "Our people has always held up endurance as a virtue. In the high mountains and dry deserts you fight against the elements as much as your enemies, and wastefulness will all too easily be your undoing. Living off the land, learning to thrive despite the elements and to make sure your resources last is as much part of warfare as shooting or marching is." 
tech_hye_scavenge:0 "Scavenger Traditions"
tech_hye_scavenge_desc:0 "A gun is a gun, no matter where it came from, and every weapon seized from the enemy is one less that they can make use of as well as one more on our side. We understand this fact, and instead of wastefully throwing away potential tools, we make sure to scour far and wide for any potential equipment."
tech_hye_reinforcement:0 "Repeated Offensives"
tech_hye_reinforcement_desc:0 "Blind attacks cost lives, planned attacks cost time. Being able to reorganize and prepare for another attack faster than our enemy can recover will allow us to keep delivering blow after blow, never relenting and never giving them the opportunity to truly dig in."
tech_hye_repair:0 "Pre-planned Rebuilding"
tech_hye_repair_desc:0 "We're no strangers to war and destruction, enough that we know that it is not the end if our enemy seizes important assets, not as long as we can reclaim them and restore them quickly. If we reclaim what is ours, the faster we can put it back into working condition, the better."
tech_hye_exp:0 "Scout Teachers" 
tech_hye_exp_desc:0 "To fight your enemy, you must know your enemy, and those among us who lead the way and guide our forces know more than most. As new warpups join the fight, they can learn from our scouts and be better equipped for the fight that awaits."
tech_hye_scavenge2:0 "Waste Not, Want Not"
tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete."
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."
tech_dervishes_a:0 "Dervish Division IV"
tech_dervishes_a_desc:0 "As a dervish grows and develops their skills, they are expected to share their knowledge with their fellow dervishes. The most veteran of them travel among the dervishes, constantly documenting and evaluating the lessons learned so that all might share in this knowledge."
tech_dervishes_b:0 "Dervish Division V"
tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."
tech_dervishes_c:0 "Dervish Division VI"
tech_dervishes_c_desc:0 "The eleventh century has already shown that it will be a bloody one, but in this grim era, the dervishes will continue to be dilligent students."


tech_hyena_misc:0 "Extractive Metallurgy"
tech_hyena_misc_desc:0 "Few species can claim to be as proficient and skilled in digging and burrowing tunnels as the Diamond Dogs. From an early age, pups are known to bore their own tunnels, searching for the mineral goods hidden beneath the ground. Although industrial mining is not done with bare paws, it remains a priority to improve our equipment and improve safety standards, so that dogs may continue to profit from the riches of the earth."
tech_hyena_misc2:0 "Underground Construction"
tech_hyena_misc2_desc:0 "Most dogs prefer living under the ground, and few venture to the surface by choice. Subterranean environment breeds a hardy species, and the need for safety and protection of our riches makes it necessary to construct vast cities and vaults beneath the surface."
tech_hyena_misc3:0 "Underground Construction II"
tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"
tech_hyena_misc_b_desc:0 "Few things make the dogs happier than a long day at the forge, creating both consumer goods and military equipment for their nation. It is vital to modernise our production centres, so that the state as a whole may benefit and progress further."
tech_hyena_misc_c:0 "Modern Mining Industry"
tech_hyena_misc_c_desc:0 "Unparalleled in both our resource output and technologies utilised in the process, the Diamond Dogs are at the forefront of any major excavation project in the world."
tech_hyena_army:0 "Mountain Home"

 #### FOCUS ####
 ## starting tree
 WAT_fallout:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 WAT_fallout_desc:0 "The sacred forest has allowed an interloper to trespass the holy land! While many voices speculate and whisper about why the great magical woods which have safeguarded our home for countless generations have decided to open, one thing is certain: change is inevitable. Our entire nation holds its breath — ready or not — we must plunge headfirst into the future."
 WAT_end_isolation:0 "A View Into The World"
 WAT_end_isolation_desc:0 "There is a world beyond the forest and holy waters, a world of terrible might and knowledge which hitherto now has left our nation undisturbed. It has become apparent from the musings of our foreign 'guest' that the isolation of our realm is no longer sustainable: we must learn the ways of technology to increase our nation's might before it is used to annihilate the holy land."
 WAT_something_new:0 "Beginning Of The End"
 WAT_something_new_desc:0 "All good things must come to an end. The oracles — enshrined in the praying-trees of the great temple — have foretold of this day, yet we have prepared not for the imminent change awaiting our homeland. We must standfast against the rushing tides of the outside world and ready our nation to enter the modern age, lest we be swept off our hooves and drown in ignorance."
 WAT_religious_woes:0 "Religious Troubles"
 WAT_religious_woes_desc:0 "Our nation is a bastion of purity in a maelstrom of sin. Our faith is our shield against wickedness and a torch leading the righteous from despair... yet we are not without divide. The two great faiths, the Traditionalists and the Wudubeorgi have for generations competed for the favour of God. Bickering cannot stand when unity is needed now more than ever: we must mend the divide."
 WAT_calm_proles:0 "Calming The Ponies"
 WAT_calm_proles_desc:0 "The faithful whisper from under the veil of the forest canopy, whispering about you. The ponies feel the coming paradigm shift as the strength of the forest weans; as the thunderous rapids of foaming water slow. The ponies grow restless as they wait for you to guide our nation through uncertainty. They await your word."
 WAT_meet_fundies:0 "Meeting With The Fundamentalists"
 WAT_meet_fundies_desc:0 "Beyond the howling winds of the east and the deafening roar of the southward rapids, the lips of the faithful praying in face of uncertainty is the most common cacophony in the Eahatland. The majority of our nation are faithful to the Lord, entrusting our capricious future with heavenly guidance from the Holy Temple. You must act as His vessel, and the support of the Fundamentalists is key."
 WAT_deliberation:0 "Deliberation"
 WAT_deliberation_desc:0 "The screeching winds have ceased; the rumbling and roaring of the rivers give out to silence. Prayers are held in silence. Our whole world, tiny and sheltered, is about to enter a new, unpredictable era: the whole world is silent.\nWe await your word."

 #### EVENTS ####
 water.1.t:0 "Dawn of the Final Age"
 water.1.d:0 "The morning dew lingers sweetly over the air of Wuldbury. The gentle eastern breeze brushes against the dew-laden trees — upon whose mighty spines the dwellings of the faithful lay, burrowed and stacked upon each other totem-like and quaint — but it is the only sound that dares speak through the holy city. The bustling ranks of a crowd is bolstered by the confused, the terrified, and the angry, all shuffling together in an impromptu procession of curiosity. Like a river the procession weaves through the narrow cobbled streets, arriving at an open temple, a forum to the heavens: an altar. All voices are hushed, if not silent with suspense. A formation of the elite Eahyrde — the woodland rangers of the realm — suspend a wiggling, struggling cloth bag held by rope upon the blades of their ornate glaives. \n\n "Release it," a masculine booming voice breaks the silence with the authority of thunder, reverberating from the hulls of the massive iron-oak trees and walls that the temple is built from. "Let the faithful see the face of the end of days." An ornately robed figure steps past the guard, tall and blind, sauntering with grace to the side of the Eahyrde formation. The crowd bows their head, the spears of the guards lower, prayer beads rattling from the hilt of their blades: the high priest has heralded the apocalypse."
 water.1.a:0 "God help us."
 
 water.2.t:0 "Face of the Apocalypse"
 water.2.d:0 "Spears of emerald and silver glisten with the faint light of the temple's burning torches, the elusive sun obscured by the impossibly thick canopy that crowns the holy world with shade and mystery. Fulfilling the oath of the high priest, and with synchronization that only a lifetime of discipline can produce, the warriors roll the shaft of their ornamental glaives and send the bag and its struggling contents to the floor. Swiftly crawling out of the bag is a short earth creature — a cloth bag fastened around their neck obscuring their face — dressed in a lackadaisical olive drab suit with a cheap red tie. The high priest, comparatively towering over the most peculiarly dressed individual, unfastens the rope around their neck with a dagger, revealing the terrified face of a stallion, complete with an awkwardly huge pair of thick circle-framed glasses that haphazardly dangle diagonally across their wide, confused and horrified eyes. "Behold, the apocalypse!" The crowd holds their breath, gasping; some fainting and causing the tightly crammed terrified mass to trip onto one another in a shiftless, frozen panic. \n\n "Hi!" the awkward, nearly asphyxiated, anachronistic stallion looks sheepishly around. There is no reply. "Do any of y-you understand what I am saying? Hello?" He stumbles around the platform, the Eahyrde readjusting their formation to continue surrounding him. Suddenly, a voice from behind the platform, coming from the dark, replies..."
 water.2.a:0 "Who could it be now?"

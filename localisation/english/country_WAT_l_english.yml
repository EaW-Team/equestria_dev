 ## starting tree
 WAT_fallout:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 WAT_fallout_desc:0 "The sacred forest has allowed an interloper to trespass the holy land! While many voices speculate and whisper about why the great magical woods which have safeguarded our home for countless generations have decided to open, one thing is certain: change is inevitable. Our entire nation holds its breath — ready or not — we must plunge headfirst into the future."
 WAT_end_isolation:0 "A View Into The World"
 WAT_end_isolation_desc:0 "There is a world beyond the forest and holy waters, a world of terrible might and knowledge which hitherto now has left our nation undisturbed. It has become apparent from the musings of our foreign 'guest' that the isolation of our realm is no longer sustainable: we must learn the ways of technology to increase our nation's might before it is used to annihilate the holy land."
 WAT_something_new:0 "Beginning Of The End"
 WAT_something_new_desc:0 "All good things must come to an end. The oracles — enshrined in the praying-trees of the great temple — have foretold of this day, yet we have prepared not for the imminent change awaiting our homeland. We must standfast against the rushing tides of the outside world and ready our nation to enter the modern age, lest we be swept off our hooves and drown in ignorance."
 WAT_religious_woes:0 "Religious Troubles"
 WAT_religious_woes_desc:0 "Our nation is a bastion of purity in a maelstrom of sin. Our faith is our shield against wickedness and a torch leading the righteous from despair... yet we are not without divide. The two great faiths, the Traditionalists and the Wudubeorgi have for generations competed for the favour of God. Bickering cannot stand when unity is needed now more than ever: we must mend the divide."
 WAT_calm_proles:0 "Calming The Ponies"
 WAT_calm_proles_desc:0 "The faithful whisper from under the veil of the forest canopy, whispering about you. The ponies feel the coming paradigm shift as the strength of the forest weans; as the thunderous rapids of foaming water slow. The ponies grow restless as they wait for you to guide our nation through uncertainty. They await your word."
 WAT_meet_fundies:0 "Meeting With The Fundamentalists"
 WAT_meet_fundies_desc:0 "Beyond the howling winds of the east and the deafening roar of the southward rapids, the lips of the faithful praying in face of uncertainty is the most common cacophony in the Eahatland. The majority of our nation are faithful to the Lord, entrusting our capricious future with heavenly guidance from the Holy Temple. You must act as His vessel, and the support of the Fundamentalists is key."
 WAT_deliberation:0 "Deliberation"
 WAT_deliberation_desc:0 "The screeching winds have ceased; the rumbling and roaring of the rivers give out to silence. Prayers are held in silence. Our whole world, tiny and sheltered, is about to enter a new, unpredictable era: the whole world is silent.\nWe await your word."

 #### EVENTS ####
 water.1.t:0 "Dawn of the Final Age"
 water.1.d:0 "The morning dew lingers sweetly over the air of Wuldbury. The gentle eastern breeze brushes against the dew-laden trees — upon whose mighty spines the dwellings of the faithful lay, burrowed and stacked upon each other totem-like and quaint — but it is the only sound that dares speak through the holy city. The bustling ranks of a crowd is bolstered by the confused, the terrified, and the angry, all shuffling together in an impromptu procession of curiosity. Like a river the procession weaves through the narrow cobbled streets, arriving at an open temple, a forum to the heavens: an altar. All voices are hushed, if not silent with suspense. A formation of the elite Eahyrde — the woodland rangers of the realm — suspend a wiggling, struggling cloth bag held by rope upon the blades of their ornate glaives. \n\n "Release it," a masculine booming voice breaks the silence with the authority of thunder, reverberating from the hulls of the massive iron-oak trees and walls that the temple is built from. "Let the faithful see the face of the end of days." An ornately robed figure steps past the guard, tall and blind, sauntering with grace to the side of the Eahyrde formation. The crowd bows their head, the spears of the guards lower, prayer beads rattling from the hilt of their blades: the High Priest has heralded the apocalypse."
 water.1.a:0 "God help us."
 
 water.2.t:0 "Face of the Apocalypse"
 water.2.d:0 "Spears of emerald and silver glisten with the faint light of the temple's burning torches, the elusive sun obscured by the impossibly thick canopy that crowns the holy world with shade and mystery. Fulfilling the oath of the High Priest, and with synchronization that only a lifetime of discipline can produce, the warriors roll the shaft of their ornamental glaives and send the bag and its struggling contents to the floor. Swiftly crawling out of the bag is a short earth creature — a cloth bag fastened around their neck obscuring their face — dressed in a lackadaisical olive drab suit with a cheap red tie. The High Priest, comparatively towering over the most peculiarly dressed individual, unfastens the rope around their neck with a dagger, revealing the terrified face of a stallion, complete with an awkwardly huge pair of thick circle-framed glasses that haphazardly dangle diagonally across their wide, confused and horrified eyes. "Behold, the apocalypse!" The crowd holds their breath, gasping; some fainting and causing the tightly crammed terrified mass to trip onto one another in a shiftless, frozen panic. \n\n"Hi!" the awkward, nearly asphyxiated, anachronistic stallion looks sheepishly around. There is no reply. "Do any of y-you understand what I am saying? Hello?" He stumbles around the platform, the Eahyrde readjusting their formation to continue surrounding him. Suddenly a voice from behind the platform, coming from the dark, replies..."
 water.2.a:0 "Who could it be now?"
 
 water.3.t:0 "'Foreigner!'"
 water.3.d:0 "The voice replies, clearly and with a spirit that acutely purges the room of sound. "The Faithful may not welcome you, but the Forest has brought you to us." The crowd lowers their heads, hushed voices give way to ear-numbing silence. The Eahyrde, flanking the High Priest, turn and bow their heads with reflexive synchronization. The High Priest turns and does the same, previously darkened eyes gazing towards the back of the room: the unlighted abyss towards the new voice. Violent winds drone and crash through the never-ending canopy above, whistling faintly through crevices and organ pipes built into the hull of the temple. It is the only sound that dares interrupt Eathelin, the High Counsellor of the Faithful. "Why are you here?" Eathelin, robed modestly in dark purple, becomes increasingly more visible under the filtered glow of the temple lanterns and mushroom chandeliers as she slowly walks towards the front of the stage from the back of the chamber, the guards peeling away from the flank of the High Priest to shelter her sauntering approach.\n\n"I, uhh..." the intruder speaks, fixing his glasses as his gaze alters frantically between the crowd behind him, with their eyes buried in prayer, and to the question he must answer. "I'm a... businesspony..?" the stallion looks for approval from Eathelin's unflinching, bordering on bored stare. "Listen, I don't know much about you and you don't know much about me," the businesspony starts rambling as he approaches Eathelin. "But let's start by telling each other's names, okay? I'm Sallus," he reaches his hoof outward, and with lightning prejudice Eahyrde blades greet him by hovering over his head and limbs, ready to maim at the tiniest whim. \n\n"You haven't answered my question," Eathelin's continued, bored glare of Sallus puts the businesspony on edge, sweat rolls off his caramel-coated face, illuminated by room's ambient warm glow. \n\n"I'm here to sell you weapons," Sallus sighs, stepping back to deflate his ego. "A ton of arms, appliances... some knick knacks I don't quite remember what I was doing with... oh yeah, that I was carrying in my wagon before your goons robbed me and threw me in a bag!" The cold, sweet steel of a razor sharp blade is pressed flatly against Sallus' nape for a brief few seconds, just enough to calm the businesspony down: to remind him whose realm he has stumbled into. Sallus meekly gazes up, the obscured eyes of the High Priest piercing the veil and Sallus' soul with anonymous but palpable despise." 
 water.3.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 
 water.4.t:0 "Machinery, Chicanery, and the Councilors of Fate"
 water.4.d:0 ""Your devilish machinery is not appreciated here," the High Priest starts, the corners of his aggressive, scowling face illuminating with offence at such a notion. "Your chicanery would bring about sin and suffering beyond which our Lord permits in the holy land, just as it has done before, you despondent infid-" Just as the High Priest was about to strike the shocked businesspony with his ornately decorated staff of prayers, one of the Eahyrde steps out of formation to stand between him and Sallus. \n\n"I've seen the world, your holiness," the Eahyrde is crowned with the same set of symbols and regalia as the High Priest: a high ranking officer of the elite. "From the shade of trees on our borders I've seen weapons and technology that faith cannot destroy. Listen to him-" \n\n"For now," Eathelin interjects, waving off her guards. The crowd, once timid at her presence begins to stare intently at the conversation... restlessly even. "There is no cause for your panic, Councilor-Captain Gearwald," she leans in closer to him. "And certainly not in front of the faithful..." She moves back into the middle of the stage, stepping in the confused and ready crossfire of gazes between the businesspony, the guards, the masses of ponies, the High Priest, and the entrance way... now more and more packed with the faithful. "Convene in the Rock of the Covenant. Guards, blindfold the foreigner, take his wagon, and above all else...""
 water.4.a:0 ""Put a gag on him will you!""
 
 water.5.t:0 "The Otherworldly Divide"
 water.5.d:0 "The multitude of tribes and peoples that compose the realm of the Watertowns are bound by one key, transcendental bond: their faith in the one God. But, just like how the plethora of tribes in the holy land differ tremendously from their neighbours, the ways God is worshipped, the bounty and glory of His woodland realm, and the manners of prayer vary from group to group, all are subject to interpretation and rigorous debate by scholars, theologians, and the prophets in between. There are two primary sects that have consolidated considerable support in the Watertowns, each holding polarizing interpretations of the word of God. It is this division that is, undoubtedly, the most divisive force plaguing the nation, and the most pertinent issue preventing us from emerging out of the hollows of time.\n\nThe Rodorgoddites, who zealously follow the word of the first prophet Kana, who — through the lens of God — led the first ponies to the holy forest several millennia ago. Centered around great temples, crowned with reliquaries of auspicious artifacts from centuries gone-by, the Rodorgoddites are the established orthodox sect of the land, and have enjoyed the legacy granted to them by the kings of yore to govern and steer the souls of the faithful away from the sea of sin that engulfs the holy land. More than three-fourths of the faithful are followers of the ancient Rodorgoddite tradition, many of whom are willing to lay down their lives in support of their faith.\n\nThe Wudubeorgi are a reformist youth movement born out of a rejection from literal interpretations of the word of God. They interpret the world, with its gods and almighty beings as aspects, or divisible fragments of God. They see the Lord as a gestalt of all entities and energies: a sum of angels and demons who are representative of the spirits and energies of the world. To the Wudubeorgi, God is an ascendant and ancient consciousness of almighty power, the sum of powerful spirits that herald propitiousness and omens: spirits that are prayed to directly, idolized, and crowned as patrons of practices and concepts. The Wudubeorgi believe in God the same way one sees an expanse of trees as a forest, and the followers of the Wudubeorgi are an ever-growing forest of monastic, stalwart souls. These two sects; these two beliefs in the same God and their conflict must meet a resolution soon, lest the pains of today's divisions turn into the terror of tomorrow."
 water.5.a:0 "Amen."
 
 water.6.t:0 "Situation Report: Exile at Camp Oasis"
 water.6.d:0 "Day 71. It's cold. I'm hungry. Alone.\nI've run out of space to mark any more tallies against the stock of my firelock, so I count my days in exile by the dim glare of the constellations. I've been picqueting on the edges of the forest in the southern frontiers, a small assemblage of boxes and tarps I must call home until the summer comes. My little oasis out here is a few days trot south of Imireton and an afternoon's stroll west of the Sinbeorh cave monasteries, where I cannot pray and confess the iniquity of my soul as punishment, as if getting chewed out by my column commander, my own spouse in front of the Eahyrde I so desperately wish to become wasn't enough... being common infantry is a humiliating fate. I spend the days writing to you — my beloved journal — under the canopy of my humble abode, wondering what I did wrong. If the temples and the love of my life won't listen to me, then I will let you be the judge if you trust that I can be impartial.\nI captured a foreigner coming through the forest, bumping into trees and brambles. He was an oaf, not quite sharp with his eyes. There was thick crystal-like glasses smothering his eyes and a crate full of firelocks... a mystic bringer of death no doubt. I thought I was going to be promoted for my act of heroism in defending the holy land from an armed invader. Maybe I misjudged. I tend to do that a lot, especially as of late. I hope this journal finds its way to the eyes of someone with better judgement abilities than myse-\n\nDay 74. Colder. Starving. Surrounded. \nBeaked savages with repeating firelocks and thick-wheeled self-propelled iron carts of smoke circle about outside the reaches of the forest. They are far, but they venture closer and closer each hour to the holy land. Through the view of my telescope I see curious faces with soulless eyes. I can't help but think they are looking for me. They are an armed band of hooping and chirping beasts that I share this oasis with now: lowlife bandits, criminals. They bring prisoners with them; their prey, to butcher out away from their homes. They celebrate murder as some sort of sanguinary game, as a divine, vile joy. I don't show myself to these filth, lest I too suffer a fate worse than death. I refuse to leave to procure food, gather water, venture out beyond the treeline, nothing. I don't exist as far as they know and I wish to stay that way. I am assigned to watch them by the virtue of my sentence. If this is the world beyond the forest: savages with bloodlust and no fear of judgement, then I wish for no stake in it. I can only pray that such evil ignores us, as to not drag us into their dreadful, immoral abyss.\nBut even the terror of it all is captivating, morbidly so. They hunt and kill viciously, but with the added finesse of the power of technology they do so on a terror too dreadful to imagine. My punishment for being here was because I see such technology as necessary for our survival, but my kind won't listen. My punishment for being here will be to witness this dread and never being able to escape it. I hear them getting close now... I hear them whisper..."

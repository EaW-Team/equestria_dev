 WAT_fallout:0 "The Would-Be Merchant"
 WAT_fallout_desc:0 "The sacred forest has allowed an interloper to trespass the holy land! While many voices speculate and whisper about why the great magical woods which have safeguarded our home for countless generations have decided to open, one thing is certain: change is inevitable. Our entire nation holds its breath — ready or not — we must plunge headfirst into the future."
 WAT_end_isolation:0 "The Watertowns Council"
 WAT_end_isolation_desc:0 "Divine things may often come inconspicuously. All who are taught holy wisdom know this, and there is none holier and wiser than the heads on the Council of Keepers. Each seat on the Council represents a recognized element of our nation. Searing tensions run like hellfire, yet they must reach a consensus... and fast."
 WAT_something_new:0 "Orthodox Perspective"
 WAT_something_new_desc:0 "Our nation is a holy one.\nOur communities are organized as the Lord told us to: with chapters of temples serving as communal guilds, subsidiary to that which the High Priest and Council of Keepers oversee on our behalf.\nThis is our orthodoxy, and in the face of an unpredictable future it is worth everything to preserve. We should see the Council guarantees it."
 WAT_religious_woes:0 "Opinions Of Young Ponies"
 WAT_religious_woes_desc:0 "Decades ago, the stability of our nation was threatened by the schism of Eorfi, a rogue high priest every bit as charismatic as he is enigmatic. He commands legions of mostly fighting-age ponies in the Halgianwold — known as the Wudubeorgi — who guard him as their final prophet. We must, temporarily at least, bring them and the Temple together."
 WAT_calm_proles:0 "Brave New Guardians"
 WAT_calm_proles_desc:0 "If we are to survive the uncertain era upon us, we must see that our borders are protected by new legions of Eahyrde. Trained rigorously from a young age, the Eahyrde are a band of elite rangers that answer only to the Keeper of the Council.\nWe must funnel more promising, young warriors into the recruiting pipeline: our people will never yield to heathens."
 WAT_meet_fundies:0 "Keeping To Our Traditions"
 WAT_meet_fundies_desc:0 "Our traditions — nearly every vestige of authority, education, and law in our nation — exist as functions of the Rodorgoddite Temple.\nSchisms notwithstanding, the oft-taciturn voice of the High Priest is every bit as decisive as it is reserved. His quiet precipitates the storm to come, for the whole Council awaits his word."
 WAT_deliberation:0 "Tending The Forest"
 WAT_deliberation_desc:0 "The Halgianwold, our holy forest, is understood by the faith to be a living gestalt organism created by our Lord to safeguard our people. It is to this end that our people know it as home, and can navigate its ever-changing labyrinthian passages. Anything of a logistical nature, however, cannot. If we are to enter the new era, we must change this."
 WAT_introspection:0 "Introspection"
 WAT_introspection_desc:0 "The Council of Keepers originally convened on how to settle the great emergency of this age: the start of an uncertain new era. Yet every decision, every article proposed, must pass through Keeper Eathelin.\nThe people, eager for guidance, look to her for the Council's collective answer..."
 WAT_better_call_saul:0 "Cast Away The Outsider"
 WAT_better_call_saul_desc:0 "The foreigner, for all he's worth, has been an unexpected gift from the Lord. His transgression into our holy land is a divine sign, yet it is still a transgression that must be properly dealt with.\nNow that the Council has made its decision, his presence is no longer required... or welcome."

 #### EVENTS ####
 water.1.t:0 "Dawn of the Final Age"
 water.1.d:0 "The morning dew lingers sweetly over the air of Wuldbury. The gentle eastern breeze brushes against the dew-laden trees — upon whose mighty spines the dwellings of the faithful lay, burrowed and stacked upon each other totem-like and quaint — but it is the only sound that dares speak through the holy city. The bustling ranks of a crowd is bolstered by the confused, the terrified, and the angry, all shuffling together in an impromptu procession of curiosity. Like a river the procession weaves through the narrow cobbled streets, arriving at an open temple, a forum to the heavens: an altar. All voices are hushed, if not silent with suspense. A formation of the elite Eahyrde — the woodland rangers of the realm — suspend a wiggling, struggling cloth bag held by rope upon the blades of their ornate glaives. \n\n "Release it," a masculine booming voice breaks the silence with the authority of thunder, reverberating from the hulls of the massive iron-oak trees and walls that the temple is built from. "Let the faithful see the face of the end of days." An ornately robed figure steps past the guard, tall and blind, sauntering with grace to the side of the Eahyrde formation. The crowd bows their head, the spears of the guards lower, prayer beads rattling from the hilt of their blades: the High Priest has heralded the apocalypse."
 water.1.a:0 "God help us."
 
 water.2.t:0 "Face of the Apocalypse"
 water.2.d:0 "Spears of emerald and silver glisten with the faint light of the temple's burning torches, the elusive sun obscured by the impossibly thick canopy that crowns the holy world with shade and mystery. Fulfilling the oath of the High Priest, and with synchronization that only a lifetime of discipline can produce, the warriors roll the shaft of their ornamental glaives and send the bag and its struggling contents to the floor. Swiftly crawling out of the bag is a short earth creature — a cloth bag fastened around their neck obscuring their face — dressed in a lackadaisical olive drab suit with a cheap red tie. The High Priest, comparatively towering over the most peculiarly dressed individual, unfastens the rope around their neck with a dagger, revealing the terrified face of a stallion, complete with an awkwardly huge pair of thick circle-framed glasses that haphazardly dangle diagonally across their wide, confused and horrified eyes. "Behold, the apocalypse!" The crowd holds their breath, gasping; some fainting and causing the tightly crammed terrified mass to trip onto one another in a shiftless, frozen panic. \n\n"Hi!" the awkward, nearly asphyxiated, anachronistic stallion looks sheepishly around. There is no reply. "Do any of y-you understand what I am saying? Hello?" He stumbles around the platform, the Eahyrde readjusting their formation to continue surrounding him. Suddenly a voice from behind the platform, coming from the dark, replies..."
 water.2.a:0 "Who could it be now?"
 
 water.3.t:0 "'Foreigner!'"
 water.3.d:0 "The voice replies, clearly and with a spirit that acutely purges the room of sound. "The Faithful may not welcome you, but the Forest has brought you to us." The crowd lowers their heads, hushed voices give way to ear-numbing silence. The Eahyrde, flanking the High Priest, turn and bow their heads with reflexive synchronization. The High Priest turns and does the same, previously darkened eyes gazing towards the back of the room: the unlighted abyss towards the new voice. Violent winds drone and crash through the never-ending canopy above, whistling faintly through crevices and organ pipes built into the hull of the temple. It is the only sound that dares interrupt Eathelin, the High Counsellor of the Faithful. "Why are you here?" Eathelin, robed modestly in dark purple, becomes increasingly more visible under the filtered glow of the temple lanterns and mushroom chandeliers as she slowly walks towards the front of the stage from the back of the chamber, the guards peeling away from the flank of the High Priest to shelter her sauntering approach.\n\n"I, uhh..." the intruder speaks, fixing his glasses as his gaze alters frantically between the crowd behind him, with their eyes buried in prayer, and to the question he must answer. "I'm a... businesspony..?" the stallion looks for approval from Eathelin's unflinching, bordering on bored stare. "Listen, I don't know much about you and you don't know much about me," the businesspony starts rambling as he approaches Eathelin. "But let's start by telling each other's names, okay? I'm Sallus," he reaches his hoof outward, and with lightning prejudice Eahyrde blades greet him by hovering over his head and limbs, ready to maim at the tiniest whim. \n\n"You haven't answered my question," Eathelin's continued, bored glare of Sallus puts the businesspony on edge, sweat rolls off his caramel-coated face, illuminated by room's ambient warm glow. \n\n"I'm here to sell you weapons," Sallus sighs, stepping back to deflate his ego. "A ton of arms, appliances... some knick knacks I don't quite remember what I was doing with... oh yeah, that I was carrying in my wagon before your goons robbed me and threw me in a bag!" The cold, sweet steel of a razor sharp blade is pressed flatly against Sallus' nape for a brief few seconds, just enough to calm the businesspony down: to remind him whose realm he has stumbled into. Sallus meekly gazes up, the obscured eyes of the High Priest piercing the veil and Sallus' soul with anonymous but palpable despise." 
 water.3.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 
 water.4.t:0 "Order And Glory"
 water.4.d:0 "The nation lives through the Temple. Holyfolk, from the humblest of field workers to the High Priest are but equal blood flowing through an institution as ancient, mysterious, and powerful as the nation itself. Adherents to the Temple find themselves organized in equitable, meritocratic collectives where they serve their community as they serve themselves. As those solely responsible for education, priests of the Temple instil at a young age the concept that service to ones community through holy labour is the pinnacle of life's joys. All labour exists to perpetuate the Temple: to vitalize the community.\n\nIt is to this end that the Temple spread from a mere vessel of religious education, law, and moral policing to the fabric of every institution and community. Guilds, hospitals, schools, barracks; nearly every important institution in the nation is organized as apart of the Temple, with elected and experienced priests instructing acolytes on mastering their craft. The Temple is a family beyond one's birth, where priests are mothers and fathers to acolytes, who in turn view one another as brothers and sisters under the Lord. It is said by holyfolk that to live in a moneyless society of great spiritual wealth is to be richer than all other lands, and the Watertowns are an affluent land indeed.\n\nHowever, as a consequence of recent schisms, the Temple has seen itself divided into two sects. The most important sect is the orthodox faction: the Rodorgoddites. They are vanguards of order and spiritual progress, firm opponents of anything which may alter the delicate utopia the Temple has given to the holyfolk. Rejecting hardline traditionalists and reformists equally, they are by far the most popular in terms of public support. They are known as bulwarks of stability, if a bit slow to act on change when it is necessary. \n\nTo say the Rodorgoddites are uncooperative to change would be an understatement. They are headed by xenophobic and conservative clergy with the mighty High Priest at their helm. Untrusting of foreigners, whom they view as sinners — or far worse in the case of griffons — they view any reform to the Temple as sacrilege tantamount to an attack against the nation. Gaining their consent on reforms may prove nearly impossible... but necessary if we are to step into the new age."
 water.4.a:0 "Amen, we must speak to the High Priest."
 
 water.5.t:0 "Progress And Proselytization"
 water.5.d:0 "No wound cuts deeper into our nation's identity than the conflict between the Roddorgoddite-led Temple and the Wudubeorgi. The bands of monastic, militant isolationists known as the Wudubeorgi only answer to the stallion they call Great Teacher, a figure equal parts perplexing, shrewd, and bewitching. Existing in spite of the Temple's orthodox dogma, they find solace in the holy forest as roving, largely unorganized bands of warriors and specialists proficient in making great hillforts and mobile war camps.\n\nHighly egalitarian, concepts of hierarchical leadership are temporary appointments derived equal parts from the consent of the governed as much as the will of God. Youngfolk make up the majority of their ranks, with many having abandoned their lives in search of greater meaning in uncertain times. Elaborate and ornamental practices of prayer are discarded in favour of what the Great Teacher dubs "a personal approach to God."\n\nIconoclastic, literalistic, and most vexing of all, tolerant to outsiders, the principles Wudubeorgi fight for are antithetical to the existence of the Rodorgoddite Temple, as it is an abominable affront to centuries of dogma. Yet history has proven any attack against the Wudubeorgi, any attempt to rid their influence over our nation, would be met with holy mutually assured destruction. Their camps are stationed around the great arteries of the nation: mines, workshops, deep-forest farms, and roads are under their constant surveillance.\n\nIt is imperative for the Council of Keepers — whose ranks include both the Great Teacher and the High Priest — to quickly find a solution in order for any chance of peace in the future, lest the nation be consumed in the blood of martyrs."
 water.5.a:0 "Amen, we must speak to the Great Teacher."
 
 water.6.t:0 "One Of The Best"
 water.6.d:0 "Commander Wassa was a ranger of unprecedented esteem, for she had slain a hundred bandits and captured hundreds more.\nCommander Wassa was a poet of unequal character and brevity, she spoke and wrote the artful language of the Eahyrde for all time to contemplate.\nCommander Wassa was clad in the pristine emerald robes of her rank, lifeless.\n\nShe rested peacefully on a bed of straw, hoisted into the air by her fellow Eahyrde rangers. Chainmail rustled in unison, winds howled, and war drums were solemnly beaten as hundreds trailed behind the rangers in awed silence. Keeper Eathelin led the procession with the Chief of the Eahyrde, Osgyth, at her side.\n\nTradition had brought them to the banks of the Rima river, west of the town of Mistbeorg, where a small rivercraft covered in hundreds of soot-painted runes awaited the afterlife. Wassa was hoisted aboard, the rising and falling murmur of prayers echoed throughout the forest. Eahyrde rangers ignited special wax-coated arrows with scarlet torchlight, sending them at the vessel in massed volleys of unerring precision, igniting the hull.\n\n"This is the fifth funeral this week." Eathelin observed the vessel as it slowly went up in flames, illuminating the river's path through the night. The glowing water below pulsed in bright shades, imbued with magic.\n\n"Aye. We train less than a hundred recruits a year. Each of them is worth twenty of the enemy. Wassa was worth fifty," Osgyth replied with the cool monotony, with a world weariness that hid behind her silver mask. The sounds of funeral prayers, a low baritone wave which ascended and rose against the howling northwind filled the air of conversation. It never ceased being beautiful, even after the fifth time.\n\n"And when the fifty-first arrives? More losses like this and we lose the borders and..." Keeper Eathelin watched as the procession slowly marched away, as if nothing had happened, like if nobody was ever there. "We need more rangers, more like her. Whatever resources you need are yours, just... we can't afford to lose the borders... especially not now. You are one of the few I can trust, Osgyth."\n\n"Aye," Osgyth watched as the fiery craft disappeared behind a bend of trees."

 water.8.t:0 "Morning Lessons"
 water.8.d:0 ""Good morning, class!"\n\n"Good morning, mother teacher!"\n\nTucked in the woods, the wide hull of an isolated mushroom-house had been fashioned into a classroom, with its headmaster and sole teacher a mare cloaked in green robes. Her pupils were fifth year students, halfway done with their mandatory Temple education. Her one eye dutifully gazed between scrolls of lesson plans and the heads of her students to count attendance.\n\n"Shh..." the teacher whispered. In a moment all rambunctious chatter disappeared and the room became silent. Dead silent. Only the ambient creaking of support beams, potions bubbling, and streams passing nearby outside defied the order of a teacher-priest of the Temple. "I have a story today, class... who here can tell us what our nation is?"\n\n"Me! Me, mother teacher, me!" A starry-eyed pupil raised her hoof into the air with such force that it seemed the Lord had pulled it towards the heavens. The teacher looked at the student and gave a simple nod. She knew what the student was going to say anyways. She always does.\n\n"Our holy nation is the product of a symbiotic trinity! Of the forest, the water, and the holyfolk!" The student's cadence was enthusiastic as it was proud.\n\n"Very good! When the Lord forged the world from fire and ash, and fashioned all races from water and clay, He formed a paradise for His chosen folk to prosper until the end of days. This paradise is our home, which our prophets had led us to from the shackles of slavery and earthly sin. This home is the holy forest and the waters that permeate through and grant it magical strength."\n"Outlander armies have tried many times to take paradise from us, but the forest has a mind of its own. Supply wagons going down ever-shifting roads, troops being crushed beneath holy floods and trees..." The teacher leaned in over her table, her eye wild with excitement. "I've even seen Eathelin use her power as the Keeper of the Council to open an ambush, funnel foreign bandits into it, and crush them between trees!"\n\nThe class cheered, making stabbing motions with quills, mocking the screams of those who had transgressed God's will. "When I was a ranger, we knew how to navigate through the forest with great speed and grace. It is instinctual to all holyfolk, but the modern world has no instincts. Outlanders need something called... logistics." With chalk, she etched the spelling of the word onto a board, the class copying it onto their codices. And you, my dearest class, have been chosen by Keeper Eathelin to master this concept." Smiles and gasps beamed from across the classroom. The teacher savoured the moment of awe. "Along with several other classes across the nation."

 water.9.d:0 "Rangers patrolled tiredlessly down the marble and jade corridors which segmented the Hall of Keepers, for the fate of the nation was being decided. The Hall of Keepers was a bastion of discussion and order, where for centuries great conclaves of faith and policy gathered to steward holy folk through the Lord's many tests. Tonight was no different. Housed deep in a room of stone as black as night sat a great instrument, and Keeper Eathelin had sought its wisdom.\n\nEathelin was basked in the sickly glow of a Luminar terminal. A legion of scribes around her tirelessly jotted down what they observed: colours and shapes were projected with unerring tangibility, yet like evanescent vapour they faded from memory, never to repeat. Keeper Eathelin searched the soul of the Luminar, seeing many things: pools of blood between twins, draining into a lake. Then a burning forest, beasts of steel spitting hellfire, and suddenly the sensation of drowning... all in the blink of an eye.\n\nShe squinted and squirmed with each second she spent staring at the Luminar. Each time she had sought its ancient wisdom it always took its toll. It seemed to her that every minute some of the scribes had left the room, hurling, laughing, or weeping outside. Often one after the other.\n\nShe stared at the terminal for hours, familiar whispers and nostalgic scents infiltrated the back of her mind, just to be forgotten with the next phase of shapes and colours. The Luminar — she trusted — could guide the nation to peace, as it always had. Yet the visions suggested something other than peace lay behind the veil of fate.\n\n A new vision. Two banners — one green and blue — were crossed together over a field of broken spears, then the hug of brothers as armies cheered. In that moment it was warm, like the summer sun. A black banner of an eye with a blank iris then flashed over it, then blackness. All in the room shuddered and froze. All but Eathelin.\n\n"End the apparition," Eathelin instructed her scribes as she continued to idly stare at the ghostly lights, which slowly sank into the tablet."

It is here where the interloper first arrived, and it is here where he will be sent back to where he came.\n\nA small crowd had gathered near the easternmost reaches of the forest-town of Greenmire, an amalgamation of locals, rangers, town militia, temple scribes, and the Council of Keepers. Capturing the attention of the entire crowd was Eathelin, who stood facing the interloper who months before had sent the nation into near chaos.\n\n"Your captivity is over now, foreigner. You have served your purpose," Eathelin beckoned for a ramshackle cart to be brought onto the road. Silently, a group of militaponies obeyed the order.\n\n"I am not sure what my purpose was. I wouldn't call being watched by guards for a month a purpose," the foreigner replied, gazing back at the silent crowd, then at Eathelin. "I was just starting to learn the language too... what if there are bandits on the road? Bandits are scary, y'know!"\n\n"The Lord manifests His will in many ways. You will be safe if you follow the roads eastward," Eathelin took a good look at two Eahyrde rangers standing by the cart."I assure you that much."\n\n"Can I learn one last phrase before I go? Something to remember this all by, something to tell my family and friends that I was here?"\n\n"Of course," Eathelin smiled, eyeing the crowd around before back at the foreigner. "God þē mid sīe."\n\n"God thee... mid... sie?" suppressed laughter emerged from the ranks of the militia and locals. Eathelin cracked a smile, threw her head back, and gave a hearty laugh. As thunderous laughter filled the dew-glistened valley, the interloper fastened himself to the cart.\n\n"But what does it mean? Ma'am?" he nervously smiled at the crowd around him, feignting his laughter with obvious discomfort shortly thereafter. The Eahyrde rangers flanked the cart, gesturing for the stallion to start his exodus from the holy land.\n\nAs squeaking wheels of the cart disappeared through the fog, Eathelin gave one last laugh before shouting..."

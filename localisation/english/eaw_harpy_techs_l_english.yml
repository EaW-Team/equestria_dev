 tech_vikingslayers:0 "Vikingslayers"
 tech_vikingslayers_desc:0 "In the decades before their collapse, our shores were under constant threat from the Deerlaw vikings based on Uusi Hirvimaa. We soon developed specialized tactics to counter theirs, surging troops to their location and bombarding their shore positions once they made landfall."
 tech_vikingslayers2a:0 "Tip Of The Spear"
 tech_vikingslayers2a_desc:0 "Macawian marines have existed for almost as long as ships themselves. While their initial specialization was boarding, it shouldn’t take much to adjust their tactics to amphibious assault. After all, what is a continent but a very large ship?"
 tech_vikingslayers2b:0 "Vertical Bayonet Charges"
 tech_vikingslayers2b_desc:0 "The bane of the bayonet charge is the heavy machine gun. However, they have a weakness; no model in the world can raise the barrel a full 90 degrees to respond to an unexpected attack from above."
 tech_vikingslayers3a:0 "Prey Hunting Tactics"
 tech_vikingslayers3a_desc:0 "In the jungle, the hunter is also often the hunted. Simply killing the enemy isn’t all there is to fighting; in order to make it count, our marines will also have to live to tell the tale."
 tech_vikingslayers3b:0 "Integrated Glider Reinforcements"
 tech_vikingslayers3b_desc:0 "Gliders are integral in modern paratrooper operations. By mastering their use and that of the airship, we can rain harpies anywhere, in any formation we desire, at any time."
 tech_vikingslayers4:0 "Pack-Up Pack Artillery"
 tech_vikingslayers4_desc:0 "A complication in both amphibious and airborne warfare is the quick deployment of field artillery to the front lines because of the need for speed and low weight limitations. But what if we take a page from the industrialist’s book, and just assemble the gun in the field?"
 tech_vikingslayers5:0 "An Example To Be Emulated"
 tech_vikingslayers5_desc:0 "From Griffenheim, Canterlot, even as far as Hjortland, do training missions come to Macawia. Our special forces are the masters of air, land and sea, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies no matter where they are or how powerful they claim to be."


 tech_charismatic_mimics:0 "Charismatic Mimics"
 tech_charismatic_mimics_desc:0 "Our rivals often claim that our negotiations are fraught with trickery, that we cloud minds with spirits and mimic voices. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The Macawian secret weapon that ensures we always have a competitive edge is...patience. We’re most likely going to outlive everyone else at the table anyway, so what’s a few more days or weeks?"
 tech_charismatic_mimics2a:0 "Knowledge Of The Inner Wilds"
 tech_charismatic_mimics2a_desc:0 "Harpies are creatures of the jungle, of searing heat and constant vigilance. It follows us wherever we go, never leaving our side even for an instant. We haven’t simply learned to endure it; we have learned to thrive in it."
 tech_charismatic_mimics2b:0 "Glider Regiments"
 tech_charismatic_mimics2b_desc:0 "Mountains, hills, jungles  — our islands are no strangers to the concept of hindered movement. While other armies might use gliders only for assisting paratroopers, we can use them for ferrying troops and material from the mountains to the jungles much more quickly and efficiently than by using roads."
 tech_charismatic_mimics3a:0 "Bird's Eyes View"
 tech_charismatic_mimics3a_desc:0 "Few creatures in the world can boast of having eyesight as keen as ours. While our troops might joke about being issued Mark Two Eyeballs, it’s true that they can conduct reconnaissance at much safer distances than a zebra, griffon or pony."
 tech_charismatic_mimics3b:0 "No Armoured Plate Left Unbroken"
 tech_charismatic_mimics3b_desc:0 "Anti-tank rifles are increasingly becoming the embodiment of patience, needing multiple hits and a concealed location to defeat armour. While they might not be as effective against modern tanks, there are plenty of other, softer targets on a battlefield whose day can be ruined by their quick, lethal strikes."
 tech_charismatic_mimics4a:0 "Plan For The Past, Prepare For The Future"
 tech_charismatic_mimics4a_desc:0 "Our long-lived strategists are always practicing, replaying long-ago battles repeatedly to find the best possible stratagems for their chosen side to achieve victory. While not historically accurate, these simulations have sometimes resulted in new tactical discoveries."
 tech_charismatic_mimics4b:0 "Outmaneuver, Outpace, Outperform"
 tech_charismatic_mimics4b_desc:0 "We don’t have the numbers or industrial capacity to go up against larger foes. Our armed forces must constantly improvise, adapt and overcome just to survive. They may not have the sharpest blades, but they certainly have the sharpest minds."
 tech_charismatic_mimics5a:0 "Speed Is Its Own Armour"
 tech_charismatic_mimics5a_desc:0 "With naval guns increasing in destructive power, the simplest armour strategy is becoming more and more relevant; just don’t get hit. It’ll take some time and effort, but being able to squeeze just a few more fractions of a knot out of the engines could mean the difference between life and death."
 tech_charismatic_mimics5b:0 "Armour Is Its Own Speed"
 tech_charismatic_mimics5b_desc:0 "Our sea is a maze of archipelagos and islands, with a thousand routes between them. While it’s true that for every dangerous route there is a safer alternative, it is often much slower. Time is of the essence, so we should do everything we can to ensure we can always take the fastest route to our destination."




 tech_windfarming:0 "Windfarming"
 tech_windfarming_desc:0 "Our position and multitude of unique ecosystems mean we have several options for power generation. First among those is the venerable windmill, just as viable today as it was centuries ago. There are very few mountains in Macawia that don’t get strong winds almost every day, so why shouldn’t we make use of that?"
 tech_windfarming2a:0 "Quantity Of Goods"
 tech_windfarming2a_desc:0 "Our resources are limited, so we should use well what we have and build for what happens most, so we can handle most of what happens."
 tech_windfarming2b:0 "Quality Of Deals"
 tech_windfarming2b_desc:0 "Our resources are limited, so we should focus on acquiring what we don’t need. We need to work with reliable partners, to find trustworthy businesses and ensure safe passage through the oceans. Not an easy task these days."
 tech_windfarming3a:0 "Colourless Festivals"
 tech_windfarming3a_desc:0 "Even in wartime, Macawian festivals don’t stop. That being said, surely some of that time and effort could be redirected to actually winning the war, so we can survive to have more festivals later?"
 tech_windfarming3b:0 "The Neverending Festivals"
 tech_windfarming3b_desc:0 "The specter of war can’t be looming over our people every waking hour of their lives. They need to relax, to do something that’s not related to the existential struggles we find ourselves locked in. Fortunately, we Macawians are very good at parties..."
 tech_windfarming4a:0 "Mountainside Flak Towers"
 tech_windfarming4a_desc:0 "By building our anti-aircraft emplacements within our mountainous home, we can bait low-flying aircraft into hidden killboxes for very little cost. The tunnels dug will also be able to act as shelters and small manufacturies... so long as they're properly ventilated."#\n
 tech_windfarming4b:0 "Suspended Production Facilities"
 tech_windfarming4b_desc:0 "The natural verticality of our lands, and the dexterous nature of our people has allowed for many businesses to profit off of products from the mountains or the ability to use heights to their own advantage. If we were to set up complex cable systems around some lower peaks, near our current cities, we may be able to support extra levels on our buildings or even have factories far above the ground."
 tech_windfarming5:0 "Airborne Tourism Innovations"
 tech_windfarming5_desc:0 "Transcontinental tourism is a relatively new industry, one that we have a great opportunity to disrupt. Airship travel has several advantages over sea travel, such as not having to navigate our many perilous archipelagos. No other nation in the world has an established airship base, so we have an amazing head start!"

 tech_opposable_thumbs_desc:0 "Macawia’s terrain is almost inhospitably rough. Even with modern technology, traversing our rough jungles or tall mountains is an enormous challenge requiring dedicated equipment...like the venerable opposable thumb. Can you climb a rock wall with hooves?\n\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2a:0 "The Study Of Centuries"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2a_desc:0 "When a novice pony, griffon, or zebra scientist wishes to learn the basic principles of knowledge that were laid out by prodigies centuries ago, they have to visit an enormous library and struggle with bureaucracy. When a Macawian scientist wishes to know the secrets of their ancestors, they simply go and ask."
 tech_opposable_thumbs2b:0 "Vertical Production Lines"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2b_desc:0 "Shipping half-finished products to the other side of the Macawian Archipelago only to ship them back later to add the finishing touches is a great way to get nothing done. Our island factories will strive to make as much progress as possible in-house, without relying on complex supply chains.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2c:0 "Reservist Medical Training"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2c_desc:0 "We do not have the largest population, as several conflicts have sorely reminded us, so we must take good care of those we have. All reservists will receive thorough medical training, benefitting our forces and the civilian sector."
 tech_opposable_thumbs2d:0 "Synthesise Spiritspeaker Sources"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2d_desc:0 "While synthetic magical crystals might never reach the quality of natural ones, for our spiritspeakers, any crystal is better than no crystal. It might offend their traditionalists, but it’ll ensure our survival.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2e:0 "The Facilities To Flood Their Forces"
 tech_opposable_thumbs2e_desc:0 "Macawia will live or die by the quality and quantity of its navy. We must make every effort possible to keep it among the best in the world.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3a:0 "Many Claws Make Much Work"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3a_desc:0 "The best part about living a long life is that you’re always learning. We have something almost everyone lacks, a substantial base educated in many fields.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3b:0 "Our Stockpiled Arsenals"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3b_desc:0 "Our great memories mean we make little use of maps. Our jungles are full of old caches we can use in the event of an invasion...provided they actually have any weapons in storage.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3c:0 "Redundent Systems Of Reservists"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3c_desc:0 "Harpies perform different tasks better at different ages. While we remain suited for combat for hundreds of years, it makes little sense to put 200- and 600-year-olds together in the same unit. We will have multiple redundant systems to ensure that we are mobilizing the right creatures in the correct way.\n"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3d:0 "The Deepest Depths Of The Jungle"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3d_desc:0 "There are secrets in the jungle that foreigners would die for - and have. It almost never seems to occur to them we might know them ourselves, and that all they have to do is ask. But where’s the adventure in that?\n"
 opposable_thumbs_mag_tt:0 "§YMagical Equipment§! Production Cost §G-20.00%§!"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3e:0 "Drown The Sea In Rusted Steel"
 tech_opposable_thumbs3e_desc:0 "Our blood runs thick with sea salt. Our minds are guided by stars, and our bodies are uniquely suited for the archipelago of Macawia. We are kings and queens of sea and sky, and we are all too eager to show challengers why.\n"

 tech_spiritspeaker_support:0 "Spiritspeaker Support Companies"#Add a tactic from one of them?
 tech_spiritspeaker_support_desc:0 "Spirits permeate the world; they’re present in the ground we walk on, the air we breathe, in animals, trees, fire. Our kind has always been in their favour, granting us access to their spectacular abilities for tribute, whether as wealth, worship...or something darker."
 tech_spiritspeaker2a:0 "Annoyed Ammo"
 tech_spiritspeaker2a_desc:0 "Spirits are quite touchy, the ones that inhabit ammunition even more so. It doesn’t take much to send them into a furious frenzy; a rude comment, a string of curses or even a bad joke can cause much more damage than mere chemical propellants and warheads."
 tech_spiritspeaker2b:0 "Contracted Spirits For Special Forces"
 tech_spiritspeaker2b_desc:0 "Not all spirits are friendly. Gruesome tales of talking weapons, wily mountain winds and murderous snakes have served as warnings for novice spiritspeakers for hundreds of year. While their price might be high, we’d much rather have them terrorize the enemy than us."
 tech_spiritspeaker3a:0 "Military Use Of Prestidigitation"
 tech_spiritspeaker3a_desc:0 "The creation of simple, harmless lights and noises is among the first abilities spiritspeakers master, given the relative friendliness of the respective spirits, but it might be one of the most vital. Communication is key in modern warfare; a single flare could make the difference between victory and defeat."
 tech_spiritspeaker3b:0 "Manifested Mine Training"
 tech_spiritspeaker3b_desc:0 "Spirits can talk to each other, and nowhere else can we make better use of this than in the construction of minefields. By motivating them to work together instead of simply burying them and forgetting them, we can ensure that they cause maximum possible devastation."
 tech_spiritspeaker4a:0 "Wind Control For Fire Support"
 tech_spiritspeaker4a_desc:0 "Every foreign artillerist in the world has cursed the wind at least once, usually while yelling at the sky and menacingly holding a ruler and protractor. This has made the wind spirits very angry and all too willing to help our own artillerists to teach them a lesson, provided they watch their language."
 tech_spiritspeaker4b:0 "Dig Deep And Greedily"
 tech_spiritspeaker4b_desc:0 "While earth and rock spirits might be grumpy and lazy, they’re easily convinced. Their ubiquity makes contracts with them easy, for every one that refuses to help there are three willing to move mountains for us."

TIM_city_of_scholars:0 "The City Of Scholars"
TIM_city_of_scholars_desc:0 "The University of Timbucktu is the first and so far only such educational facility in the Great Lakes region, and has been open for many centuries now. It attracts scholars from all around western Zebrica and has an expansive library filled with bound books and scrolls.\n\nDue to its age, it is not organized like a modern university, but is a more decentralized affair, divided into separate schools. Taught subjects consist of theology, medicine and surgery, botany, evolution, physiology and zoology, astronomy, hippology, cartography, geodesy, geology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, language and linguistics, geography, history, magicology as well as art. Each school focuses on a different selection of subjects with some degree of overlap."
TIM_trade_nexus:0 "Nexus Of Trans-Zebrican Trade"
TIM_trade_nexus_desc:0 "Timbucktu is located at an intersection of several vital trade routes that intersect the Zebrican continent. The most important one follows the Neighle river while the second most important one crosses the vast Zebhara desert. While Storm King's rampage disrupted trade for a while, now that he is dead the caravans and river barges are returning in great numbers, all of them carrying valuable luxury goods and large amounts of other commodities. Most importantly, every merchant passing by pays a toll, filling Timbucktu's coffers."

 TIM_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 TIM_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 TIM_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 TIM_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 TIM_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 TIM_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 TIM_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 TIM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initally used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 TIM_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 TIM_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 TIM_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

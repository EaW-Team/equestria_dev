TIM_city_of_scholars:0 "The City Of Scholars"
TIM_city_of_scholars_desc:0 "The University of Timbucktu is the first and so far only such educational facility in the Great Lakes region, and has been open for many centuries now. It attracts scholars from all around western Zebrica and has an expansive library filled with bound books and scrolls.\n\nDue to its age, it is not organized like a modern university, but is a more decentralized affair, divided into separate schools. Taught subjects consist of theology, medicine and surgery, botany, evolution, physiology and zoology, astronomy, hippology, cartography, geodesy, geology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, language and linguistics, geography, history, magicology as well as art. Each school focuses on a different selection of subjects with some degree of overlap."
TIM_trade_nexus:0 "Nexus Of Trans-Zebrican Trade"
TIM_trade_nexus_desc:0 "Timbucktu is located at an intersection of several vital trade routes that intersect the Zebrican continent. The most important one follows the Neighle river while the second most important one crosses the vast Zebhara desert. While Storm King's rampage disrupted trade for a while, now that he is dead the caravans and river barges are returning in great numbers, all of them carrying valuable luxury goods and large amounts of other commodities. Most importantly, every merchant passing by pays a toll, filling Timbucktu's coffers."

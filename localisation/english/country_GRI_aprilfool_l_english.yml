 ### Empire Events ###
 imperium.1.title:0 "A Shining Beacon"
 imperium.1.desc:0 "There have been multiple reports of power outages at a city in Yale. As yet, the cause of the outage has been claimed to be Yale University but the university itself refuses to publicly comment on the cause of the situation, and will field no questions levied at them. Moderate concern has been growing amongst citizenry in the local area, as ordinary griffs wonder what further disruption may arise from this odd instance. For the time being, however, the majority are continuing on with their daily lives and merely keeping a keen eye out for any weird happenings." #Mara
 imperium.1.a:0 "Peculiar, but science can be strange."

 imperium.2.title:0 "Projekt Kristallthron"
 imperium.2.desc:0 "A call from Yale just reached the imperial palace, and it has sent the court into a frantic scramble. The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the Emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
 imperium.2.a:0 "If there is even a sliver of a chance, we must do it!"

 imperium.3.title:0 "Hope is the First Step on the Road to Disappointment."
 imperium.3.desc:0 "When the explosion had rocked the palace and the scream had echoed across the entire city, every eye in Griffenheim had turned to stare towards the centre of imperial might. Confusion and shock had been the first response as the thick, billowing fog spewed forth from it to slowly begin to engulf the entire city. Air raid sirens had begun to wail accompanied by the clanging of metal on metal as the sight of the wheezing, blood-choking griffs that stumbled out of it delivered the next response: panic.\n\nChaos followed, and griffs fled in panic away from the deathly mist that had swallowed the palace and threatened to engulf the entire city. Hundreds of thousands ran, tens of thousands died, and as the evening began to fall the entire city was blanketed in gas and death. To make it even worse, attempts to fly over the city has ended in failure as the imperial palace radiates with ominous light - like a great terrible eye in the darkness covering the imperial city.\n\nNocreature knows what is going on, but the imperial guard are donning protective gear and are desperately trying to re-enter the city. Their gas masks offer only meagre protection, but though they choke and die one after one, any attempts to call them off has been ignored or indeed greeted with active hostility from the Diamond Dogs of the guard. Yet for the rest of the empire, there is only chaos as the heart of Griffonia has been torn out, leaving the body to slowly die."
 imperium.3.a:0 "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

 imperium.4.title:0 "The Damnation of Griffenheim."
 imperium.4.desc:0 "The Emperor is dead, choked to death in the deadly fog that now blankets Griffenheim. With him, most of the apparatus of state has scattered or died, and there is chaos across the Herzland. Neither the Emperor nor the Crown Prince appear to have escaped, and there is complete silence from the Imperial government. While it is taking some time for the fact to sink in, the truth is already clear. The empire is effectively dead..."
 imperium.4.a:0 "And we are left to take charge of our own fate."

 imperium.5.title:0 "The Fracturing"
 imperium.5.desc:0 "With the near complete loss of the imperial government, the empire's constituent parts are breaking away one after another. There is barely even enough of a state left to put up the pretence of a government, and when the imperial claw no longer provides guidance, the nations of the Herzland have to find it themselves. All that is left is the region of Griffenheim itself; a city covered in gas and a countryside flooded with refugees."
 imperium.5.a:0 "Is this the end of the empire?"

 imperium.6.title:0 "Only in Death Does Duty End" #Sweet Chrysalis
 imperium.6.desc:0 ""Keep moving dogs, we're almost there!" The sergeant yelled, even as he was left coughing hard enough that a metallic taste filled his mouth. The griffons had long since fallen behind, choking to death on the poison, and yet the surviving diamond dogs had kept moving. A trail of death had been left in their wake, soldier after soldier dropping dead, but they didn't care. Every bone in their body, every breath in their burning lungs and every trembling step they took all drove them towards a singular purpose: to find the emperor!\n\nThe great doors of the throne room towered in front of them, the twenty still living dogs pushing against them in desperation. Their muscles heaved, adrenaline surged through their bodies and blood seeped from their lips as the doors slowly were forced open with a groan like the very doors of Tartarus.\n\nAnd suddenly, all was quiet. The poisonous fog receded, and the dogs stepped slowly into the chamber and towards the light. Before them sat the emperor, wreathed in a gloria of golden light. All was quiet, and the dogs stumbled towards him in dazed reverence. Removing his gas mask, the sergeant fell to his knees as tears began to stream down his face. They had done it, they had reached him. Then, the emperor's eyes opened, the light turning blinding as he looked straight at the sergeant.\n\n"LOYALTY IS INDEED THE PURVIEW OF YOUR KIND, DOGS OF BRONZEHILL." The booming voice reverberated through the chamber, loudly enough that the sergeant would have recoiled had he not been frozen in the spot along with his soldiers. A wave of strength filled him, and the golden light reached out to touch him.\n\n"YOU WILL BE VIGILANCE UNENDING. YOU WILL BE DUTY UNSTINTING. YOU WILL BE PUNISHMENT INESCAPABLE. TODAY, YOU BECOME THE BRONZE CUSTODIANS, AND ALL SHALL FEAR YOUR WRATH." The emperor's voice rang in their ears as the glow encased them, stripping away their tattered uniforms and worn gas masks, leaving behind bronzed armour, thicker than any Ironpaw's. When the force holding him in place vanished, the sergeant gasped, looking down at his paws before he looked up at the emperor again."
 imperium.6.a:0 "BRING MY MINISTERS BEFORE ME, CUSTODIANS, FOR THERE IS MUCH TO DO."

 imperium.61.title:0 "By the Emperor's Will"
 imperium.61.desc:0 "The teeming mass of ministers, generals and nobles stood in silence, watching their emperor where he sat upon the throne. They were in the hundreds, but the twenty massively armoured dogs that surrounded them kept them all silent. Where they had gained these armors or the heavy glaives they held nogriff knew, but the looks in their eyes had prevented any expressions of curiosity. Doubly so for the emperor, who though he seemed like a corpse on the throne, was all too clearly alive and present by the bright glow in his eyes and the harsh words coming from him.\n\n"IT TOOK WEEKS, AND IN THE END IT WAS THESE, MY MOST LOYAL SUBJECTS, WHO REACHED ME." The bronze-clad diamond dogs did not react to the praise given, only continuing their silent vigil. "OUT OF AN ENTIRE EMPIRE, THESE WERE THE ONES WHO CAME TO MY SIDE. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND WORTHY WHEREAS YOU ARE YET TO BE JUDGED. NOW SPEAK TO ME ON THE STATUS OF MY IMPERIUM."\n\n"Y-your imperial majesty," it was general Ferdinand Dawnclaw who stepped forth. As confused as everygriff else, he could tell that the political chessboard had been flipped over, and those who wished to place their pieces upon it again would need to move swiftly. "The empire is in disarray. We thought you lost to this fog, and your vassals have started to break away. We have attempted to keep order, but all too many have seized their chance to abandon their oaths."\n\n"HAVE MESSAGES DELIVERED TO EACH OF MY ERRANT VASSALS, REMIND THEM OF THEIR OATHS, AND OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR TREASON." The words came so easily, the implication obvious. Through all his reign, Grover V had never spoken this harshly, and yet nogriff found it in themselves to doubt him. "BRING THE SCIENTIST WHO CREATED THIS DEVICE BEFORE ME, AND MARSHAL ALL LOYAL FORCES. NEITHER I NOR THIS EMPIRE IS DEAD YET, AND THOSE WHO WOULD HASTEN ITS DEMISE SHALL PAY FOR THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS.""
 imperium.61.a:0 "The Emperor speaks and we obey."

 imperium.7.title:0 "The Mad Savant of Gamia"
 imperium.7.desc:0 ""BELISAR BOLZEN... YOU WERE AWARE OF WHAT WOULD COME TO PASS WHEN I WAS PUT INTO THIS DEVICE, WERE YOU NOT?" The emperor asked the old scientist that kneeled before him. The wild-eyed old griff had been tracked down to the basement in Gamia where he had been hiding and dragged before the emperor, and yet unlike all others who had come before him he was not struck mute, instead only cackling like a madgriff.\n\n"It came to me in a dream! I spent years upon years, stumbling in the dark, and yet insight came to me! The gods granted me insight into the machine, and I saw how to make you what you are today." He stared up at the emperor in manic glee, raising his claws in pleading towards him. "But my emperor, I offer you more than this! Give me only a chance to serve, and I shall make your forces the greatest in Griffonia, nay the world! I will sheathe your warriors in armour unlike any other, and I will arm them with weapons to break all that stand before them! You, the sun of the empire, will have a thousand brightly shining stars surrounding you! Just give me the tools, and I shall conjure everything you can imagine, and make every machine in the Herzland sing your praises!"\n\n"SO BE IT. I NAME YOU ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS, AND IN YOUR CLAWS THE IMPERIUM'S TECHNOLOGY OF WAR SHALL BE REBORN. RISE, ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS BELISAR BOLZEN, AND TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.""  
 imperium.7.a:0 "The machines sing the emperor's praise."

 imperium.8.title:0 "The Principal Project"
 imperium.8.desc:0 "To most, Belisar Bolzen was a madgriff, he had spent years hidden away in his laboratory after his experiments had proved too much for even Gamia. It had been as an act of grace towards what most had thought was a dying old madgriff that had allowed him to carry out the Kristallthron project. When it had proven successful, however, it had changed everything. Now his deranged inventions were actually proving themselves, and his title of Archrector Dominus has overridden even the Rector Magnificus.\n\nShuffling back and forth in front of the table, the Archrector watched as his chemicals worked on the griff upon it. The narrow-minded fools behind him had whined and complained, but the emperor's word was with him, and he had gotten his way at last! The results could not be more obvious, he thought as he saw the test subject slowly wake up, blinking as he sat up. His body had transformed, being much greater in size than before. Slabs of muscles covered him, and as he rose up he towered almost half a metre above even the tallest of the scientists.\n\n"Arm him," Belisar ordered. His assistants came up, carrying the armour that had been prepared exactly according to his specifications, and began to arm the knight. It all passed in almost reverent silence, like a sacred ritual. When they were done, the knight in front of them stood in armour unlike any seen before of thick ceramics and steel plates, wholly sealed and resistant to anything any regular soldier could unleash upon them. Lastly, he was given his weapon, a short machine gun, designed to fire rounds that no regular griff could handle and yet be wielded with speed and agility.\n\n"As the emperor is our sun, you are the countless stars sharing the sky with him," Belisar told his magnificent creation. He looked out through the chamber, watching the hundreds of knights that lay in row upon row throughout the chamber, all of them waking up."
 imperium.8.a:0 "Welcome to your destiny, first of the Star Knights."

 imperium.9.title:0 "Nothing as Wretched or as Hated as a Traitor"
 imperium.9.desc:0 ""What is your purpose here, general?" The Archrector asked as Ferdinand Dawnclaw came striding into the great laboratory. Preoccupied with his experiments, he nevertheless noticed the general in the corner of his eye.\n\n"You're proving yourself day by day, Archrector," Ferdinand told him. "From a dingy basement in Gamia where they were hiding you away because you had tenure, but had managed to alienate everyone else, to this. The Gods really favours the bold, do they not?"\n\n"There is only one god, and he sits upon the crystal throne. I did my part. You should be out there doing yours. Why are you here?"\n\n"Only one god, is there?" Dawnclaw asked as he approached, dragging his claws along the table. "A brave statement. His power is not that absolute yet, is it? And he only is it because of your technology. Have you made a god? And who gave you the right too choose?!"\n\n"What are you-ack!" Belisar was stopped from replying when Dawnclaw's knife bit deep into his chest. The frail old griff grabbed his assailant's claw, trying to pry the knife out of himself to no avail.\n\n"I spent decades of my life serving that wretch, only to have him reanimated by your sorcery!" Dawnclaw hissed. "And now he has the gall to deny me your enhancements!" He shoved the old Archrector back, making him crash into one of the tables and drop limply to the ground. \n\n"I'm done dancing to that corpse's tune. If there is to be only one god, it'll be one of my choosing!" Dawnclaw turned to the table to begin rummaging around it. It all lay scattered in piles around the lab, and yet the Archrector had been fastidious about his notes. Lifting the documents from the table, Dawnclaw chuckled darkly to himself. Turning around, he walked past the now still Belisar and passed by the Star Knights that had been waiting outside, nodding for them to follow him."
 imperium.9.a:0 "We're heading to Cloudbury."

 imperium.10.title:0 "Let Griffonia Burn"
 imperium.10.desc:0 "The halls of power ran red with blood. In one fell strike, the revolution was undone and its leaders massacred. A single figure stood in the middle of the carnage, looking down at his blood-drenched gauntlets as he slowly laughed.\n\n"So this is what you were hiding from me, you old corpse?" Ferdinand Dawnclaw cackled as he slowly flexed his talons. The slow, gurgling sound caught his attention and he, without even looking, stomped hard down on the griff next to him, crushing his skull like nothing before walking out of the room. Outside, the hallway as well ran red with blood, and those who had not already been killed by his renegade Star Knights were being rounded up and brought out into the courtyard before him.\n\n"Do not fear, my fellow revolutionaries," Dawnclaw towered high above then as he addressed the crowd, feeling the violent changes he had gone through still aching in his body... It was a good pain! "Those fools you called leaders would only have led you to the grave. You have heard what has awakened in the Herzland, how that corpse of the dead emperor has refused to stay dead! What could your leaders possibly have offered against that?\n\nBy right of force, the force you wielded to try to unseat the emperor, I claim the revolution! Not against merely an empire or an emperor, but against he who claims to be a god! If he seeks to supplant the Three, and his lackeys champion this new 'god' then we shall become the Champions of Maar! We shall greet his claims to lordship with hatred, we shall defile his vaunted purity and turn the order he tries to bring to chaos! You have seen what this technology can do, and unlike him, I will share it willingly with whomever swears fealty. A false god nests in Griffenheim, and his eyes will soon turn on you. When it does, blood is your destiny, but my gifts can make it his instead of yours. Do not cower, my fellow revolutionaries, for the continent will burn before us.""
 imperium.10.a:0 "Death to the Corpse Emperor!"

 imperium.11.title:0 "The Dawnclaw Heresy"
 imperium.11.desc:0 "The Imperium has proven itself rotten to the core. Not enough that the supposedly loyal nobles of the Herzland took the first chance to declare independence, not enough that the temples proved themselves committed to only their own power and that all their oaths count for nothing!\n\nTreason has crept into the very heart of the resurgent Imperium and the great Archrector Dominus Belisar Bolzen was nearly killed. He was assaulted in his laboratory and stabbed almost to death by General Ferdinand Dawnclaw, who absconded with not only the formulas for the Star Knight enhancements and the blueprints for their weapons, but several hundred Star Knights as well!\n\nThese vile traitors have fled north to the republicans, and have seized control of the region. As if to spit in the emperor's face, they are proudly referring to themselves as the Dawnclaw Heresy, and proclaim to be the Maar to the Emperor's divinity. The republicans, terrified of the reawakened Emperor, has fallen in line behind Ferdinand Dawnclaw alongside countless Herzlander traitors who would rather throw in their lot with this heretic than face the emperor's justice. Of all the sacrilege we have seen, nothing comes even close to this treasonous general and his blatant heresies!"

 imperium.12.title:0 "Meanwhile, In Another Timeline..."
 imperium.12.desc:0 "The door to the throne room in the Castle of Friendship burst open, revealing a disheveled-looking purple unicorn covered in loose scrolls and dust. "Sorry! I was just trying to find more information about, well..."\n\nRarity waved a hoof to alleviate Twilight's panicked demeanor. "Oh don't fret, my dear. I'm sure you'll find out where the Friendship Map wants us to go."\n\n"Consarn it, don't that map know that this is a lousy time for a friendship problem?" grumbled Applejack as she observed all six of the gathered ponies' cutie marks hovering over what was clearly not a map of Equus, but rather an unfamiliar golden-brown world.\n\n"It looks... scary..." murmured Fluttershy.\n\nPinkie Pie on the other hoof could not take her eyes off of the slowly spinning globe. "Hey Twilight, is this gonna be like that place where the things happened-"\n\n"Pinkie, you're a genius!" interrupted Twilight, causing Pinkie to grin wildly, "If I can readjust the spell matrix for the mirror portal, I think I can get us to the place where this friendship problem is." Twilight removed the scrolls from herself and ignited her horn, humming as her magical aura encompassed the enchanted map. Then her eyes suddenly lit up, "Hey, I think I figured out where the map wants us to go!"\n\n"Oh yeah?" said Rainbow Dash as she squinted her eyes, trying to make out any details of the odd-looking planet hovering over the map.\n\nTwilight nodded, then addressed all of her friends:"
 imperium.12.a:0 ""We need to solve a friendship problem in a world called 'Holy Terra.'""

 imperium.3000.title:0 "Knowledge Is Power"
 imperium.3000.desc:0 "The throne room in the palace was filled with the resonating boom of a proclaiming, bassy voice as the Emperor finished his latest demands for information. A small troop of functionaries scuttled away in quite the hurry, eager to facilitate the request for knowledge. Albrecht Deftplume was one of these low level bureaucrats and information-mongers. The griffon darted this way and that, practically diving his way through the palace to find the administration records that were needed to placate his liege lord.\n\n"It must be here, I'm sure of it. Maybe here, or over there?" Albrecht muttered, almost seeming possessed with a near-divine thirst to find the knowledge he knew was somewhere in the pile of records in this particular annex. A number of scrolls were nearly thrown out of the way as Albrecht scrabbled, driven with a zeal to find that which had been requested. What irked him more was that he knew where the scrolls were, but could he lay a claw on them right at this moment, right at the time when they were needed? Of course not, and that was the infuriating part! Why was it always the case that the things one wanted to find or read were the most out of the way place?\n\nFinally, after what felt like a lesser eternity, Albrecht saw the coded scroll markers that indicated he'd found the document series he needed. With a small caw of exultation, he snatched at the small bundle of scrolls and peered through one or two in order to confirm these were correct.\n\nYes, yes. Infrastructure reports, familial histories of the Imperium in the recent decades, technical records for standard equipment and even diplomatic records from meetings with the other Reichspakt states. Intriguing. Still, there were all the things the Emperor had demanded. Hurriedly, the griff burst back out of the archives and to the throne room.\n\nPausing for just a moment outside the doors, he patted his head and tried to make himself look a little presentable, and after wiping off a little sweat he bowed his head in a supplicatory manner to enter and approach his liege." #Mara
 imperium.3000.a:0 "Guard it well."

imperium.3001.title:0 "There is only the Emperor"
imperium.3001.desc:0 "In the wake of the emperor's return, nobody had been more relieved than prince Grover VI. Though he had been evacuated as the fog struck the capitol and taken to the Strawberry Duchy, the events had left its mark on the young boy. Night after night, he had tossed and turned in his dreams, haunted by visions of a blinding light. As the fog faded and the emperor's survival was confirmed, the nightmares faded, but the toll they had extracted from the boy didn't.\n\nRetrieved from the Duchy by the Bronze Custodians, he was escorted into the throne room towards his father. The little chick looked in worry and fear up at the sight, shying away from the bright light of the emperor's eyes.\n\n"YOU HAVE SEEN IT TOO, MY CHILD," the emperor's voice was as powerful as before, yet soothing in way none else had experienced. "BLOOD SPOKE TO BLOOD, AND YOU KNOW YOUR ROLE. COME." He beckoned to his son, who hesitantly came up towards him and with some effort clamoured up into the seat with him. Embracing his father, who reciprocated, the little prince closed his eyes tightly as the emperor looked down at him.\n\nA single, golden teardrop fell from the emperor's eye, landing on his son before the light spread from it across the child's entire frame. For a few seconds, the child glowed like a sun in his father's claws, and the next he was gone. Slowly lowering his claws back to their rests, the emperor slowly sat up straight, unmoving and unflinching."

 imperium.3002.desc:0 "To Gabriela Eagleclaw, playing the political game was the art of adapting no matter what happened, and to turn the events that came to pass to your advantage. Every deal, every agreement and every whispered word was a potential card in your claw, and it was a game that never ended, even if the board was reshuffled occasionally. Her cousin's death was meant to have been one of those reshufflings. Gabriela's dear, frail cousin had struggled all his life, and as he lay on his deathbed, Gabriela had known that there would be a desperate scramble for power centred around his son. The game that had been set up would have been between her and that damned archon... and yet now the board had been thrown from the table, and the pieces were scattered all over the floor.\n\nMadness was being piled atop madness. Not only had her cousin supposedly not died, that device he was plugged into had reanimated him into something abominable. It was like an evil spirit from the depths of nightmare, a bloodthirsty tyrant who demanded absolute subjugation, even of her! The careful political weave she had woven for decades lay in tatters, and that... thing inside her cousin had even done gods knew what to his son!\n\nStaring towards the south from her balcony, she knew that it would soon come. When it did, she was the sole remaining member of the Grover lineage. That demon had make sure of that, and she would not let him have the rest of it, no matter the cost." #Sweet

In one sudden swoop, the religious leadership of the empire has been annihilated.\n\nThough prelates are rushing back and forth to try to reinstate the temples' leadership, the chaos that the Herzland was left in has made their efforts hollow. Worse than that, as the Emperor is restoring order, many of these prelates have reasserted their independence from imperial authority. \n\nIn response, the Emperor has ordered all prelates of the Herzland to be brought before him. Behind locked doors, and with the Bronze Custodians standing guard, he has spoken with them, telling them of what he saw in the mist. The exact words that passed between them are unknown, yet in its wake several prelates have bowed their heads, and the three temples are now steadily being merged under him into one greater organisation.

In the wake of the experiments, the new weapons and the emperor's blessing stood something more than what had been before.\n\nThey would be the emperor's finest warriors, these griffs who gave of themselves to him. Like clay they had been moulded and in the furnace of war they would be forged. They were iron will and steely sinew. In great armour they were clad and with the mightiest weapons they were armed. They would be untouched by plague or disease; no sickness would blight them. They had such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe would best them in battle.

His hatred was too strong, and a choking darkness burst out around him to devour the light. With almost ecstatic glee, he lashed out to strike down another bolt of light as the darkness spread more and more through the chamber, and as he strode up the steps to the throne, the emperor had become like a single light in a sea of darkness.\n\n"You should have remained dead, you old corpse." Grasping the emperor by the throat, he tore him off the throne and raised him high into the air.

Clenching his claw, he savoured the sound of breaking cartilage and bone as the corpse finally went limp in his grasp.\n\nThrowing the corpse down the stairs, Warmaster Dawnclaw turned around as the Void Knights came into the throne room behind him.

The towering dog slowly approached him, his face twisted in contempt as he raised the glaive again. Dawnclaw shrieked in wild rage, a guttural, animal sound, and hate gave him strength where his body failed. He charged, moving like a speeding truck, and crashed against the custodian with a wild two-clawed swing. The dog grunted, being pushed back over a metre, but Dawnclaw's sword only met the plated shaft of the Custodian's glaive.\n\nScreaming in frustration as he was pushed back, Dawnclaw charged again, swinging his sword wildly only to have every blow picked out of the air by his opponent's whirling glaive, and out of nowhere the butt of the staff flew out, striking into his chest with enough force to make his entire body jerk. Gasping, he slowly sank down to the ground as the air was knocked out of him and he found himself unable to move.\n\n"Now die as you deserve, traitor." The guard captain said as he walked to the side, raising his glaive up to the sky. Dawnclaw's talons bit into the blasted earth beneath him as he tried to make himself move! It was all in vain however, and the blade fell to cleanly decapitate him. Reaching down, the Custodian picked up the severed head and returned back into the smoke from whence he had come."

 imperium.69.desc:0 "One morning, our northern garrisons reported something unusual: they had begun to hear drums in the distance. Drums that beat with a madness-inducing tempo which seemed to strike fear into all but our most valiant Star Knights.\n\nThen the unholy creatures of nightmares descended upon them. Blindingly fast, it became immediately apparent that the creatures responsible were no usual undead, which itself would already be a great heresy. These things seemed to accelerate with every leap, bound, and rhythmic chant that came with their arrival.\n\nIf we do not respond quickly, then it is doubtful that even the full might of the Imperium of Griffonkind might be able to stop them. We must shift our priorities and eliminate this new, unnatural threat at all costs, lest we suffer the same fate as all heretics."

 imperium.420.desc:0 "Far across the ocean lies the once-peaceful land of Equestria, home to most of ponykind. Now it is a travesty eating away at itself due to its missing monarchs. While we do not know what happened to Celestia and Luna, this much is certain: The self-appointed "Regent" who rules in their absence has warped the definition of harmony into the worst kind of heresy.\n\nWhile we care little for the struggles of the Equestrians, one thing has become readily apparent: The Regent will tear apart Equus-No, the entire world in her maniacal quest to find the princesses.\n\nShe must be stopped before she consolidates her hold over Equus and comes for us next."

Some of his errant generals have tried to prop themselves up as the new masters of the Heresy, but each and every one of them have fallen. Reinhart Suntail fled to the far north, gathering nearly a thousand soldiers and tried to reestablish himself in the ruins of Skynavia, but Field Marshal Lightwing's forces pursued them, and all the twice-traitor found was a shallow grave covered in snow. In the Sunstriker mountains, Festus Bilebeak was hiding with his cult as he tried to create new poisons to release into the Griffking. The caves he hid in were seized and the entire mountain obliterated with explosives.\n\nNo matter what hole these vermin are crawling into, they are being found, and they are being purged.

The weakling Star Knights especially have refused to yield, and are fighting us from the shadows where they are not strong enough to face us directly. Their defiance would be admirable, were their cause not so pathetic, but we will teach them.\n\nGeneral Barghest has provided us with tools for these errant knights. As we defeat them, those who were not granted the mercy of death are dragged back to Cloudbury, where the Sarcophagi of Despair await them. They scream and they struggle as we seal them up in there, but their futile resistance matters not. Soon they will be properly broken, and inducted into our ranks.\n\nThose other griffs who try to resist are of less concern, and at best they provide amusement as we hunt them down and see what new methods we can find of breaking them. Nothing will remain of those who thought to throw their allegiance before the corpse when we are done, nothing but piles of skulls and rivers of blood!"

Thousands of heretics fled far and wide after the fall of the north, and they now lurk in the shadows, ready to spread their abominable teachings. If this taint is allowed to fester, we will see its twisted seeds sprout again and again, and we may well find ourselves with another Dawnclaw. This threat is greater than mere politics, as the malignant defiance of the Arch-Traitor has set an unforgivable precedent, and given the rest of the continent the idea that they have the right or the means to resist us.\n\nThis continent is the divine right of griffonkind under our divine Emperor, and there can be no tolerance towards those who would deny us this right, nor can we afford the naivety to believe that our ranks are free of this heretical defiance. Yet the enemies of our Emperor are countless, within and without, and as we look for a new Arch-Traitor, we may allow other, less subtle, forms of treason to slip us by. There is only one true way to address this; to accept that there is no such thing as innocence, only degrees of guilt.\n\nBy the Emperor's decree, the Holy Imperial Inquisition has been declared. Its authority is second only to the God-Emperor's, and its mandate is to root out the traitor and the heretic wherever they are found. Under their unflinching gaze, the continent shall be brought to heel, and all shall be united under its rightful ruler!"

Though those who stood against us have tasted defeat and humiliation, they may well come to succumb to false hope once again. It is the nature of all creatures to search for a light in the darkness, and as long as they can find hope, they will rise up again.\n\nWe shall teach them that this darkness is endless, and they will learn of it the hard way. We will track down their sources of joy and defiance, and we will make the most horrifying example of them there can be. Their elders and leaders, their village priests and voices of reason, all will be dragged screaming and pleading for their lives to the altars, where they will be made proper examples of. Yet what more, as it is their children and parents, their spouses and their friends holding the knives, they will both know true despair.\n\nThere is no emperor, there is only the Warmaster.

The Archrector Dominus has thusly been asked to decide on where his researchers shall focus their efforts.\n\nOne suggestion has been to focus all the efforts of the Cult of the Machine on ensuring that the sacred weapons of the Star Knights can be produced in sufficient numbers. These champions of the Emperor will number in the thousands, and their carefully crafted weaponry and armour need to be produced at a pace that will live up to the demands placed on them. At the same time, the thousands upon thousands of soldiers of the Imperial Army will need armament as well, and that their weapons if anything will be what demands mass production.\n\nYet the Archrector Dominus is reluctant to compromise anywhere, as the arms and armour of the Imperium's loyal soldiers are more than just gear, they are sacred weapons through which they fulfil Griffonkind's destiny. It may well be that the demands for quality stays."

AS ILL AS YOU ARE, I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THIS. SPEAK TRULY, FROM THE DEPTHS OF YOUR HEART. WHAT DO YOU WISH FOR?" His light grew in intensity, washing over the broken princess, and the tears welled up in her eyes. Lowering her head, she cradled her only source of comfort as sobs racked her body.\n\n"I don't know..." she whimpered. "I don't know... I'm scared, I don't want to be scared. I don't want to be here. I don't want to hurt any more..."\n\n"THEN CLOSE YOUR EYES, DIELLZA VON KATERINBURG. LET ME GRANT YOU THE MERCY I COULD NOT BEFORE."

What more though, he was wearing what looked like a gas mask, with oxygen tubes hanging on his back. What was visible of his body was largely covered in metal, even one of his eyes now was covered by a strange loupe-like device.\n\n"You vultures... thought I was done for..." He wheezed as he shuffled into the room. As he walked, the sound of fabric mixed with the grating of metal against metal. The stiff, jerking movements made their skins crawl, as it felt unclear what exactly was walking in front of them. "My body might have been wounded, but I replaced it as was needed. Our emperor was dying, yet I brought him back... again and again you have faltered, and I have delivered you.

 imperium_4002_region_0_d_GRI:0 "The north has been a nest of witchcraft and heresy since time immemorial. From the savages in the high mountains and frozen wastes to the republicans and errant nations, not to mention Dawnclaw's treasonous uprising. All these false ideals have been allowed to grow out of control, and the result has shown itself all too clearly. The Holy Inquisition has deployed to purge this region, and all the forces at its disposal are called to serve at their utmost.. The last republican leaders are being hunted down one after another, the tribal leaders who thought themselves beyond the God-Emperor are humbled and the shamans and witches of the far edges of the north are having their primitive tricks exposed.\n\nThe pyres of the Holy Inquisition burn bright, illuminating the dark nights, and those worthy of redemption under the Inquisition are marched to their awaiting penitence. The heretical literature and teachings spread throughout the land is put to the torch, with only select copies being escorted back to holy Griffenheim to be placed under lock and key in the Basilica of Secrets."

They take pride in their history and in their legends, and have deluded themselves into believing that they stand apart from the imperium. This delusion cannot stand, and the Aquileians shall be humbled. Their history is one of defiance, and defiance is treason. All those who would lead their kin against us must be put to the sword - not the least the Discrets - and the very memory of their existence must be erased from all documents.\n\nThe Holy Inquisition is cracking down across the region, burning or removing the Aquileians' sources of pride. Some are being surrendered without issue, others demand the assistance of the God-Emperor's Star Knights, more specifically the Order of the Hammer. It is a long, drawn out process that will take years and indeed decades, yet in due time, all that will remains will be little more than fairy tales dismissed as fanciful myths only."

Not only has these lands been home to some of the oldest and most deep-seated defiances against the God-Emperor, but the anarchy of the Blackrock mountains runs deep. If these lands are to be purged of heretical defiance, they must be cowed thoroughly.\n\nFortunately, the Holy Inquisition has found an unlikely ally. The minotaurs of Asterion have stood defiant against all for centuries, but before the wrath of the God-Emperor, these bovines have wisely decided to bow their heads. After an agreement reached between their leaders and Inquisitor Eisenklaue, they have sworn to become the fist of the Inquisition, and their best soldiers have been pledged to strike wherever is needed.

Traitorous knightly orders believing themselves endowed with the right to abandon their oaths and lands riven by heretical socialism and petty tyranny, when they have not fallen to simple disunion and division like the cossacks or the so-called "free states". The freedom these lands praised are nothing but attempts to escape their rightful place at the emperor's side, and the Holy Inquisition will educate them.\n\nBy fire and steel, the authority of the god-emperor is established. Some are choosing to fight to the death, but they are being taught that there was no glory in these acts, only suffering. Meanwhile, those who have been wise enough to bow before their rightful ruler and remember the oaths that once held sway over their land are granted clemency.

This conflict has no place in the Imperium, and the Holy Inquisition's work here is not to ensure their loyalty, but their compliance. Their lands are not griffon lands, and if they are wise enough to bow, the God-Emperor will consider the matter settled.\n\nSeizing their key leaders and spiriting them away to secret interrogation chambers, we are breaking them one after one. Faced with the full fury of Griffonkind, the Riverponies and their ilk have already seen the hopelessness of resistance. Now they will be educated in the price of defiance. Understanding wholly what will happen if they dare to rise up again and the hopelessness of their struggle, they will return to their peoples as broken creatures, but they will ensure peace in the east."

Indulging their local leaders and letting them think they are in control, we will let them go about playing at self-determination only to slowly make them rot from within.\n\nWe will gladly share our Void Knight technology with their leaders, and yet as they accept our dark gifts they will start to hear what we hear, and understand what we understand.

Their deepest, darkest desires, their thirst for forbidden knowledge and their dreams beyond their station, all will be possible in this new world.

When diseases and poisons fill the waters, and that which brought them life now brings death, what will the poor little griffs of these forgotten lands do?\n\nIn the end, they will come to our embrace, and they will gladly surrender their obstinate kin to us as we feed and shelter them when nocreature else can. We will teach them to not fear and hate the diseased, but to embrace them. They will live, they will prosper, and they will do so through our gifts, and those ingrates who would reject the bounties we offer them will be torn apart by those our new children who know better."

Some have festered there for centuries, others retreat there with the hopes that we will pass by. We will not. The flames of purity will scour this continent clear from this darkness, and the inquisition's role is central in this.\n\nBy Imperial decree, the Holy Inquisition is to be expanded, and its agents are to be given even broader authority. As an agent of the inquisition enters an area, all other authorities bar the God-Emperor will be subordinated to it, and it will bring with it its own fighting force. The very best of the Star Knights and all branches of the imperial military will be skimmed to produce the best of the best, and no expense will be spared to ensure that these defenders of the Imperium's purity will never be found wanting."

  ### Military tree for GRI ###
 GRI_AF_militarum_GRI:0 "A New Militarum"
 GRI_AF_militarum_desc_GRI:0 "The armed forces of the Empire have been insufficient thus far; a new tact must be taken. Herein, on this date, it is decreed that a new Militarum will be formed. The enemy of griffonkind will never be safe from our air, land or seaborne assaults."
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights_GRI:0 "The Next Generation of Knights"
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights_desc_GRI:0 "Noble Griffon knights have served the Empire thus far, but now it is time for a new age, a new generation of heavily armed and armoured knights. They shall be a beacon of inspiration to the other troops, a force to be reckoned with in their own right. A new elite for a new Imperium."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization_GRI:0 "Star Knight Specialization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization_desc_GRI:0 "The new knight force will be best utilised as an offensive juggernaut, a powered fist which might pierce even the most resolute barrier. Their appearance on the battlefield will be enough to cause the enemy to waver and crumble, if their withering fire and power was not already sufficient."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization_GRI:0 "Star Knight Generalization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization_desc_GRI:0 "This new generation of knights will serve as a mighty bulwark, a proud force able to shore up the tightest line and afford inspiration and determination in the Militarum. They will be best suited to holding the line when all others have fled in their duty."
 GRI_AF_extreme_training_GRI:0 "Extreme Training"
 GRI_AF_extreme_training_desc_GRI:0 "With a solid grounding for our new knights, there must also be a refinement of the training methods used in their creation. They shall be the finest tip of the spear, the great hammer of the Imperium. Whilst this may mean that they take longer to deploy, their effectiveness on the battlefield will leave no doubt as to their superiority."
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest_GRI:0 "Imperium's Finest"
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest_desc_GRI:0 "As our troops and knights have been inducted into a new purpose in the Imperium, so too must their leaders and commanders be given purpose. They shall be a beacon of inspiration, a standard to rally around, the centre of morale for every squad, platoon and company in the Militarum; And They Shall Know No Fear."
 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name_GRI:0 "Seize Industry in His Name"
 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name_desc_GRI:0 "There is no nobler purpose than to serve the Imperium, thus all manufacturing works should be diverted towards His cause. Whatever may have come before, no enterprise will remain private. All shall become used for the state, for the manufacturing of goods and arms to serve The Imperium. Those who do not relinquish their ironmongers and metalworks will be replaced with those who will."
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar_GRI:0 "Fire From Afar"
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar_desc_GRI:0 "Flattening an entrenched enemy position prior to our troops making an assault isn't just smart, it's good planning. Inspiration has struck in the Munitorum and designs are being drawn for new lethal artillery pieces that may accomplish this. They shall be a bane upon our foe, a blade pierced straight to the heart."
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival_GRI:0 "The Great Archival"
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival_desc_GRI:0 "Despite the changes applied to the Imperial armed forces, the noble griff at the centre is still the same, brave and stalwart. The road to perfection exists within each Imperial citizen and the natural affinity of our kind must be brought to use."
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_GRI:0 "An Unrelenting Force"
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_desc_GRI:0 "The Star Knights have become a force of devastation, a whirling dervish of doom upon their foes. The tip of the spear has been honed, but it must be thrust swiftly to catch the enemy off guard. Tactical assault squads should focus on high speed engagement and 'Shock and Awe' strategic aims. Even if surrounded, this means our Star Knights have plenty of directions to attack in!"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall_GRI:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall_desc_GRI:0 "Any enemy that engages our Star Knights is bold, but foolish. Their bravery has been shown to wither and crumble upon the great tide of our elite troops, and this should be reflected in their usage. No squad will break under enemy fire, for to break is abandon your duty to the Emperor and this is a crime which can never be forgiven."
 GRI_AF_a_wave_of_fire_and_metal_GRI:0 "A Wave of Fire and Metal"
 GRI_AF_a_wave_of_fire_and_metal_desc_GRI:0 "Our troops will now dominate both the air and land, our great military might shall never be denied from this moment forth. Any and all who oppose us will feel the true might of the Imperium. Woe betide any who dare."
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky_GRI:0 "To Cover The Sky"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky_desc_GRI:0 "It is decreed that there be a rapid development of aerial assets, by which this mighty Imperium might be protected from the sky. Firstly, this requires aerial craft and the means with which to produce them."
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_GRI:0 "Supremacy Of The Skies"
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_desc_GRI:0 "Our aviators must gain experience and develop their aerial pursuits more - great thought has been put into doctrinal advantages that might increase the edge of our noble, brave griffs. Yet we must decide where to focus efforts - relentless firepower to smash the groundward enemy, or dogged aerial persistence to prevent intrusion in our skies."
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_GRI:0 "Reinforce The Wings"
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_desc_GRI:0 "Sending our new aerial units into battle without sufficient equipment and technology would be a waste of the Munitorum's effort, and waste is tantamount to treason. Ergo, a raft of engineered components will be produced to ensure our technological marvels outshine anything any enemy can produce. Our superiority must be maintained."
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_GRI:0 "Flying Fortresses"
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_desc_GRI:0 "As the noble griff is a powerful yet deftly agile creature, so too must our aircraft be fashioned in such a way as to be keen in the air, yet lethal to foes. Advancements in airframe development will allow us to shatter the spirit of any foe with timely explosive intervention."
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds_GRI:0 "The Biggest Birds"
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds_desc_GRI:0 "An enterprising designer has theorised that even larger airframes may carry vastly superior payloads. Creating these new heavy, large aerial units will allow us to absolutely flatten the enemy before our ground troops roll in. Whilst they might not be the most agile for air to air combat, their resilience should not be underestimated."
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire_GRI:0 "Unleash Hellfire!"
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire_desc_GRI:0 "And so, did the great guns and weapons of griffonkind lose their mighty onslaught upon their foes, and they who denied the Imperium were struck down. The instruments of His Will flew forth, and unleashed many barrels of hellfire."
 GRI_AF_designs_from_the_technocrats_GRI:0 "Designs From The Technocrats"
 GRI_AF_designs_from_the_technocrats_desc_GRI:0 "Many enlightened minds have surfaced and will now be used by the Munitorum for creating and developing great engines and weapons of war. Those who may have been turned aside in the past shall be welcomed for their ingenuity."
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized_GRI:0 "Streamlined and Subsidised"
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized_desc_GRI:0 "With the advancements that have been made, refinement and increased iteration has been possible and thus, we can now see how to improve the aerial strategy to bring the Emperor's truth to the rest of the world. Domination of the skies will instantly shift any engagement towards our favour, before the first ground troop fires a rifle."
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth_GRI:0 "To Blanket The Realm"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth_desc_GRI:0 "The new Militarum requires new weapons, as the old equipment laying around is grossly unsuited to the task. Master smiths and artisans have been levied to lend their strength in designing and manufacturing a new wave of equipment that will suit The Imperium's needs."
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams_GRI:0 "Mobile Battering Rams"
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams_desc_GRI:0 "Speed without strength is a foolish endeavour, and so the armoured works shall begin construction of new, mobile yet armoured chassis. These will be able to both punch holes in enemy formations, yet remain effective when faced with return fire."
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath_GRI:0 "Crush Them Underneath"
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath_desc_GRI:0 "Armoured units have been working well in conjunction with the greater Militarum efforts, however an iteration of the more mobile tanks has been suggested. This has been dubbed 'Project Baneblade' and will see rapid development of a heavier, upgunned tank unit to support our armoured fist. Where this tank rumbles, the enemy shall flee."
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war_GRI:0 "Vehicles of War"
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war_desc_GRI:0 "Some legacies from the Empire may be useful; the Changeling attaches were instrumental in demonstrating that. Now, we must develop a new Imperial warbeast, a fast and rapid threat on the battlefield. Something capable of encircling the slow, daundering infantry and cutting their supply lines."
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories_GRI:0 "Steer The Armories"
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories_desc_GRI:0 "With a great focus now being placed upon arms and armament, we must ensure that every able-bodied griff lends their claws in the manufactorums. Labour is not optional, and a great deal of space can be cleared to make room for new machining mills and smithies."
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave_GRI:0 "Strengthen The Mechanised Wave"
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave_desc_GRI:0 "The usage of trucks for logistics purposes is sensible, and good planning. There exists, however, a niche for an ultra mobile yet still armoured unit somewhere between a lighter tank and a truck. Something which may exist alongside the infantry. These may make fine troop transports for getting infantry into battle and supporting them in engagements."
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate_GRI:0 "Experiment to Exterminate"
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate_desc_GRI:0 "Strategists have taken a great deal of time to plan and improve the Imperial force. However, unorthodox methodology may be called for. It is necessary that the Militarum adapt to these new ways of waging war, so as to solidify battlefield control. A number of new ideas have been submitted for integration, including new companies to support the troops and tactics for massacring the enemy."
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation_GRI:0 "Cement The Transformation"
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation_desc_GRI:0 "Creation of all these new technologies and methodologies is one thing, but cementing their usage on the battlefield is another. However, the Militarum has been nothing if not quick to adapt - a good thing, given that to fail in one's duty is to betray the Emperor."

 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest_FAT:0 "Warmaster's Finest"

 GRI_AF_the_great_archival_desc_FAT:0 "Underneath it all, we are griffons, we must be strong. Stronger than the enemy, stronger than the twice-damned Corpse-Emperor. Warmaster and Maar willing, we will grind them beneath our talons."
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_FAT:0 "Unrelenting Destruction"
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_desc_FAT:0 "The servants of the Corpse-Emperor will fall like chaff and wheat in the field before our blades and bullets. Our Void Knights, our loyal Legions will smash any enemy."

 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_FAT:0 "Supremacy in the Skies"
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_desc_FAT:0 "Our numbers swell with each passing day. Whilst we can commit numbers to the aerial battle, the Warmaster is cunning. He has decreed we must train our aviators first, and strike carefully, just as planned."
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_FAT:0 "Winged Reinforcements"
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_desc_FAT:0 "Guns, cannons, rockets. All of these glorious weapons of destruction and devastation, but no ability to mount them to our aircraft. We must adapt and overcome this issue."
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_FAT:0 "Aerial Devastation"
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_desc_FAT:0 "We must strike from the skies. Aerial combat is key for keeping our troops engaged in battle, but directly blowing bits off the enemy is more..satisfying."
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds_FAT:0 "Death, Destruction and Carnage."

 GRI_AF_sc_shared_conquest_GRI:0 "The Imperium of Griffonkind"
 GRI_AF_sc_shared_conquest_desc_GRI:0 "The Arch-Traitor lies dead, and there is now nothing left to stop the victorious march of the Imperium. The time has finally come to realise our destiny."
 GRI_AF_sc_cleanup_the_north_GRI:0 "Seizing the North"
 GRI_AF_sc_cleanup_the_north_desc_GRI:0 "The Arch-Traitor sought to use the north of the continent against us, and why wouldn't he? Countless strange and heretical cults and ideas can be found in these savage lands. It is time to finally - for the first time, truly establish Imperial supremacy here."
 GRI_AF_sc_unite_the_heartzland_GRI:0 "The Last Stragglers"
 GRI_AF_sc_unite_the_heartzland_desc_GRI:0 "To think that some of our old vassals still hold out, trying to maintain their distance from their rightful masters. They survived this long only out of luck. Their luck has run out."
 GRI_AF_sc_assert_our_control_GRI:0 "The Imperial Reclamation Services"
 GRI_AF_sc_assert_our_control_desc_GRI:0 "Each new territory seized by our forces needs to be tamed, and the Imperium must dedicate a large part of its bureaucracy to this task. It is a great task, one that would crush lesser bureaucracies, but the Imperial Administrators are no less zealous in their duties than the Imperial Army, and no less ruthless."
 GRI_AF_sc_biotechnical_division_GRI:0 "The Refinement of the Biological"
 GRI_AF_sc_biotechnical_division_desc_GRI:0 "No scientist can claim to be the Archrector Dominus' equal. Yet a thousand lesser minds working together may still, bit by bit, find ways to refine his great accomplishments."
 GRI_AF_sc_form_imperial_guard_GRI:0 "Form the Imperial Guard"
 GRI_AF_sc_form_imperial_guard_desc_GRI:0 "The Imperial Army has served well, yet it too is a tool that can be improved. The Imperial Guard will be a wholly new entity, only built from its very foundations to be an integral part of the entirety of society, and to supplement the Star Knights in a way that the prideful Imperial Army at times found itself reluctant to do."
 GRI_AF_sc_knight_chapters_GRI:0 "The Star Knight Chapters"
 GRI_AF_sc_knight_chapters_desc_GRI:0 "Many Star Knights have proven themselves to stand tall even among their kin. The God-Emperor has use for them, and they will be granted the honour of creating their own Star Knight chapters, which may specialise themselves for certain tasks."
 GRI_AF_sc_territory_integration_GRI:0 "The Holy Inquisition"
 GRI_AF_sc_territory_integration_desc_GRI:0 "Our cause is more than just, it is sacred, and all who stand against us represent a darkness that would throw Griffonkind into an eternal dark age if they were allowed to triumph. We must meet these threats, within and without, with not only resolve, but with all the tools available in our holy struggle."
 GRI_AF_sc_send_commissars_GRI:0 "The Imperial Commissariat"
 GRI_AF_sc_send_commissars_desc_GRI:0 "Dissention and treason can spawn from anywhere. The Arch-Traitor showed that clearly, and in order to ensure that the God-Emperor's grip on his warriors remain firm, we must ensure that everygriff, down to the common soldier, remains loyal. If they don't, these Commissars will be the ones to act decisively."

 GRI_AF_sc_expand_imperial_guard_desc_GRI:0 "Though the Star Knights are the tip of the spear, the Imperial Guard is the shaft, the claw and the body holding it.

 GRI_AF_sc_plan_east_GRI:0 "The Eastern Crusade"
 GRI_AF_sc_plan_east_desc_GRI:0 "The Ponies of the east have the blood of an emperor on their hooves. They have always stood defiant, and it would be admirable, was it not in flagrant opposition to Griffonkind's divine destiny. They must be made to kneel before the God-Emperor as well."

 GRI_AF_sc_skyfall_GRI:0 "The Skyfall Coast"

 GRI_AF_sc_griffonstone_desc_GRI:0 "Griffonstone's pathetic state is an indictment of all those who would claim to be Griffonkind's champions. It shall be rebuilt, greater than ever, and it shall stand as a great shrine to the glory of Griffonkind's past, like how the God-Emperor shows our future."
 GRI_AF_sc_the_frontier_GRI:0 "Into the Evi Valley"
 GRI_AF_sc_the_frontier_desc_GRI:0 "These errant states have grown wild in their isolation, and the word of the Emperor is strange to them. We must therefore not waver as we deal - harshly and resolutely - with all the heretical cults and petty lords that have ruled here."
 GRI_AF_sc_river_federation_GRI:0 "The Federation Undone"
 GRI_AF_sc_river_federation_desc_GRI:0 "The Riverponies' defensive alliance avails them as little as their defiance. They believe they can repeat what their ancestors did at Marethon even now, but we will teach them the errors of their ways."

 GRI_AF_sc_knights_and_dead_desc_GRI:0 "To our north lies a realm of hillponies guarded by a long-lost detachment of Arcturian Knights.

 GRI_AF_sc_the_south_east_desc_GRI:0 "Foreign invaders on Griffonian shores would be bad enough, but the insanity of the Barrad mages truly goes beyond all but the most extreme heresies. These lands must be purged, thoroughly, in fire and death. Not a single leaf of this tainted tree may escape."
 GRI_AF_sc_cleansing_magehold_GRI:0 "Burn The Library of Magehold"
 GRI_AF_sc_cleansing_magehold_desc_GRI:0 "A most unholy thing, heresy is. Something that Magehold appears to be chock-full of.

 GRI_AF_sc_griffonia_unified_GRI:0 "The Imperium of all Griffonia"
 GRI_AF_sc_griffonia_unified_desc_GRI:0 "The God-Emperor called, and we we obeyed.

 ### Characters ###
 GRI_the_emperor:0 "The Emperor of Griffonkind"
 GRI_the_emperor_desc:0 "When the dying Grover V was placed on the Crystal Throne, the hope was that he would be stabilised. Instead, he was reborn. The techno-arcane energies of the device did not revitalize him, but it made him transcend. What once was a meek and indecisive ruler has now become something more. To those who knew him, Grover V seems all but gone, and the Emperor that now occupies the Crystal Throne is singular in vision, implacable in will and divine in power. From his place upon the Crystal Throne, he is the guiding light for a formerly dying Imperium, one that will finally reach out and claim its rightful destiny; lordship over all of Griffonia."

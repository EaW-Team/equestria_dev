 ### INF ###

 SLC_melee_equipment_0:0 "Blizzardstone Polearms" # They are actually made out of that crystal (blizzardstone is a crystal despite the name) since it seems like the sort of traditional weapon making that the storm creatures would actually be very familiar with kind of an aztec obsidian or indo-euoprean flint situation almost but because they go out of their way to preserve shit it's lasted for ages
 SLC_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Traditional Polearms"
 SLC_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The design of traditional polearms did not change much over the centuries, although the materials they were made out of often varied wildly. Most recently they were carved delicately out of Blizzardstone crystal by talented storm creatures who had passed down the traditions of craftscreatureship over incredible periods of time in a ritualistic fashion. Though they were still used during the Deluge, such weapons were being phased out even then amongst the rest of soldiery and now they are considered to be mere artefacts of cultural significance." ### aim for this length or slightly less
 SLC_melee_equipment_1:0 "Experimental Slugthrower Model 'Coalshot'"
 SLC_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "ESM 'Coalshot'"
 SLC_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The ‘Coalshot’ was our kind’s first attempt at creating a functional firearm that could be mass produced on the scale necessary for large armies. Though its construction was of adequate quality, the functionality of the weapon was questionable at times and it was cast aside by storm creatures in favour of melee combat quite frequently. Before the Storm King’s unification wars it was exceedingly rare to see entire tribal hosts equipped with this weapon, though its variants and the technological developments that it inspired were far more popular."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Model 5 'Ilmenite' Slugthrower"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "M5Ilm Slugthrower"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The much-loved 'Ilmenite' slugthrower became an instant hit the moment it was put in the hands of troops. It did not have the opportunity to see much combat before the collapse, largely a result of the time it took to develop during the Storm King's chaotic reign. Luckily for the rifle and its designers though, it was replicated by all four successors and since then it has become a staple of the yeti military. Of course, it certainly isn’t without issues; but many yetis will always have a soft spot for the first bolt-action rifle they ever held."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Model 18 'Ilvaite' Slugthrower"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "M18Ilv Slugthrower"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 'Ilvaite' slugthrower is a partial revision and partial redesign of the 'Ilmenite', improving the trigger mechanism and the reliability of the weapon in general. It has proven a worthy successor and a small selection of additional attachments have already been developed for it that allow for its use in long distance engagements with essentially full effectiveness. Additionally, the introduction of: a floating barrel, ladder sights and more robust charger clips have all improved the effectiveness of this rifle in the hands of our soldiers."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Model 26 'Magnetite' Subslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "M26Mag Subslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The introduction of small automatic weapons has proven revolutionary with the introduction of the 'Magnetite' subslugger. Although this design lacks effectiveness at longer ranges, the military has never been so excited to experiment with a new tool of war. Non-yeti observers have expressed concern over the issue of calibre, as our kind uses far larger calibres in infantry weapons than most. It is hoped that said ammunition does not result in the partial vaporization of those with smaller limbs when they are used in automatic fire."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Model 41 'Morion' Autoslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "M41Mor Autoslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The 'Morion' autoslugger is something between a squad weapon and an infantry weapon, almost an amalgamation of the two. It has the same automatic fire capabilities as its predecessor the 'Magnetite', but is heavier and is more appropriately used when mounted; almost like a superslugger. Its reception has been middling with those in command positions as it offers neither the suppressive fire of the LM26Mag or the versatility of its younger sibling the 'Magnetite', but many on the ground appreciate the fact that one weapon can perform both roles."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Model 50 'Nuummite' Assaultslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "M50N Assaultslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "Much like the 'Magnetite', the 'Nuummite' assaultslugger represents a true leap forward in infantry weapons technology. The fundamental premise of the assaultslugger was to adapt the idea of a convenient and creature-portable automatic weapon that could also be used at range with the accuracy of a slugthrower, or more sparingly in automatic mode for covering fire. All of this whilst retaining its ability to be fired in full auto from the hip or shoulder whilst in use at close quarters was no easy challenge."
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "Model 65 'Shungite' Assaultslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "M65S Assaultslugger"
 SLC_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "What the 'Ilvaite' was to the 'Ilmenite', the 'Shungite' is to the ‘Nuummite'. Small tweaks and improvements including but not limited to: The introduction of various magazine types with different round capacities, scope and bipod attachments, improved second shot stability and all-around superior furniture to reduce the felt recoil have been made. Aside from the improvements to weapon handling, it should also be noted that jams with this rifle are substantially less common despite a very similar design of the firing and ejection mechanisms."
 SLC_magical_equipment_1:0 "Model 7 'Feberite' Boltcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_1_short:0 "M7F Boltcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "The newly designed 'Feberite' boltcaster is a true testament to the innovativeness of our kind. We have succeeded in the creation of a magically attuned weapon despite no natural affinity for this bizarre pseudoscience that comes to other races so naturally. With this in mind, It should come as no surprise that the ‘Feberite’ is unreliable in comparison to the 'Ilvaite' slugthrower on which its furniture is based. Nevertheless, the first mass-producible magical weapon we have created is a true technological leap and one that can be iterated upon."
 SLC_magical_equipment_2:0 "Model 11 'Feberite' Boltcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "M11F Boltcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M11 'Feberite' has not varied in design enough since the M7 to be considered a wholly unique model of thrower, but the soldiers that use it would say otherwise. The reliability has been vastly improved to the point of adjacency with the late production runs of the much-loved 'Ilmenite' slugthrower. On top of that, we have managed to redesign the crystal-centric ammunition which has resulted in drastic performance benefits and less barrel wear over time. Though the M11 may look familiar, in spirit it is an entirely new boltcaster."
 SLC_magical_equipment_3:0 "Model 35 'Galena' Autocaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_3_short:0 "M35G Autocaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "As automatic infantry weapons were already in the middle of development by the time engineers put forward the design for the 'Galena' autocaster, they decided to skip a step. Instead of electing to create a simple subslugger-esque design, they jumped straight to a mixed-role infantry weapon not unlike the 'Morion' autoslugger in premise. Unfortunately, this jump may have been a little premature as the damage inflicted by the projectiles seems to fall off rapidly at range; leaving its secondary purpose heavily muted."
 SLC_magical_equipment_4:0 "Model 43 'Galena' Subcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_4_short:0 "M43G Subcaster"
 SLC_magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "The redesign of the 'Galena' from an autocaster into a subcaster has removed its primary functional drawback. It transpired that the way in which the production process imbued the weapon and its ammunition with magic prompted the latter to discharge said magical energies over time when fired. Although this phenomenon was barely noticeable at short ranges, at long ranges it became quite detrimental and thus the modification of the M35 into the M43 was deemed necessary. Fortunately, the 'Galena' is still unmatched in close quarters."

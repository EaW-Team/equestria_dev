#NAMES
EQS_princess_celestia:0 "Princess Celestia"
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Long ago, in the lands known as Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for the realm and all their subjects. The tales of these sisters stretch back far beyond recorded history, and their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Celestia is the elder of the two sisters, and the Princess of the Sun along with her traditional role as a diarch of Equestria. Charged with raising the sun and until recently the moon, it was she who was responsible for banishing her own sister Princess Luna to the moon following her fall into darkness, as well as the thousand years of relative peace and prosperity that followed. Through it all she has ruled with a light hoof, only stepping in when necessary to preserve harmony throughout the realm. And though all of Equestria had forgotten Luna, it was Celestia who remembered her sister and welcomed her back following the defeat of Nightmare Moon by Twilight Sparkle.\n\nSince that fateful day, much has transpired in Equestria. The changelings led by Queen Chrysalis came close to capturing Canterlot in 1002, and attacks by both a resurgent King Sombra and Lord Tirek have only been barely repulsed by Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Still, Celestia is not blind to the threats that lay both within and without Equestria's borders. The enemies of harmony can no longer be defeated by friendship and magic, and only time will tell if Equestria's greatest proponent of peace, kindness and cooperation can keep up with the modern era of technology and progress.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_CELESTIA_LUNA_DESC:0 "The Princesses of Equestria, Celestia and Luna wield power over the Sun and Moon respectively. Despite the Diarchial power structure, Equestria has always been ruled by Celestia, leaving Luna to assume a supporting role. The recent campaign to welcome the Fourth Tribe into Equestria has changed this, and Princess Luna has now assumed a complementary role alongside her sister, working to realise the dreams of her subjects."
CHANCELLOR_NEIGHSAY_DESC:0 "Neighsay is strict and conservative, preferring to do things by the EEA guidelines. He is also very prejudiced against anyone who is not a pony, openly referring to non-ponies as "creatures" in a dismissive manner."
POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "A well educated and accomplished general from the Equestrian military, Prince Blueblood rode his popularity as a hero of Equestria and his traditionally inherited power as a prince through the elections and into his new role as the executive of the nation. His tactics as a general were strict, disciplined, and conservative, not to mention highly effective, and he carries those methodologies into his administration. Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently. Finally, his knowledge as a general gives his pragmatic administration great insight into the military and the defensive needs of the nation, essential in the torn and chaotic modern world."
POLITICS_PANTS_DESC:0 "Fancy Pants is a renowned member of the old Canterlot elite aristocracy, a shrewd businesspony and a clever diplomat. Though uptight as many Canterlotians are, he has occasionally shown a softer side such as his favorable business dealings with Rarity and forgiveness to the aid of Princess Twilight Sparkle after a notable debacle while she was attending other business. With these qualities, he is a natural choice for a leader that the traditional elite are content with, though some ponies may not agree with his strongly orthodox methods and policy."

#NEW FOCUS LOCALIZATION
EQS_pony_summit:0 "The Grand Equestria Pony Summit"
EQS_pony_summit_desc:0 "An event long rooted in Equestrian tradition, the Grand Equestria Pony Summit is a gathering of local leaders from all across Equestria to Canterlot to discuss matters with the Princesses and enjoy the local cultures that each delegate brings to the capital. With the start of the new year, it is now long overdue for another summit, especially considering the state of the world as of late."
EQS_our_friends_abroad:0 "Our Friends Abroad"
EQS_our_friends_abroad_desc:0 "Equestria has quite a few friends internationally, some through historical ties, others more recent through the actions of our own Element Bearers. Despite that, we have been quite lax in keeping up our friendships, despite our values. It's time for us to take a more proactive place in the world, to tighten the bonds of friendship we have crafted with others."
EQS_look_northward:0 "Look Northward"
EQS_look_northward_desc:0 "Far to the north, the nation of Yakyakistan lies, one of our newfound friends after finally breaking their long period of isolation. But the acceptance of Harmony has come at a cost, with the Jaks breaking off in the name of traditionalism, and anti-harmonic ideas taking root. Not only that, but we can not forget the topic of our former province, more commonly known now as Stalliongrad..."
EQS_united_ponies_alliance:0 "The Harmonic Accord"
EQS_united_ponies_alliance_desc:0 "The Harmonic Accord is the official name for the series of treaties, agreements and friendships that bind Equestria to its allies in the Crystal Empire, New Mareland and Puerto Caballo. While they have generally been successful under our protection in recent years, signs still point to potential troubles on the horizon for them as well. They deserve our attention just as much as any other friend would."
EQS_support_crystal_empire:0 "The Crystal Empire"
EQS_support_crystal_empire_desc:0 "Ever since the return of the Crystal Empire, the land to our north has been our closest ally in harmony ruled by Princess Celestia's adopted niece, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Though they have already made great strides in adapting to the modern world, they still remain under threat from many influences seeking to destroy them from within. It is only right that we offer whatever aid we can to our northern friends."

While we were lucky enough to have the Element Bearers solve the Appleloosa issue, and now have a Dragon Lord generally friendly to Equestria, it would still be prudent to solve the remaining issues before they grow into something much larger."

However, even after Luna's return it was never truly revived past a few ceremonial duties. That will change today, as Luna has shown interest in bringing back her old personal military detail, complete with appointing a new Captain of the Lunar Guard."

EQS_civil_war_start:0 "The Equestrian Civil War"
EQS_civil_war_start_desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened - Luna has once more fallen to Nightmare Moon, and her forces have split Equestria apart in a mad attempt to take over the nation. Though it saddens us all greatly to have to fight our own ponies, we are left with no choice. Onwards, for Harmony!"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul:0 "Rapid Economic Overhaul"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul_desc:0 "Our economy, already brought to the brink by over half of the country breaking away, is also nowhere near ready for supporting a full-scale war. And yet, that is what is required of it. The stagnation that has befallen Equestria must end, and every effort taken so that we may have a chance at survival. It may be painful, but it is necessary."
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization:0 "Emergency Military Reorganization"
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization_desc:0 "The Equestrian Army is undertrained, understaffed, and in complete disarray. To defend Equestria, we must rectify all of this immediately. Conscription, as distasteful as it is must be implemented, and talented new ponies to help shoulder the burden of leadership found. Princess Twilight Sparkle believes she knows a pony who may prove useful as well..."
EQS_question_of_strategy:0 "A Question Of Strategy"
EQS_question_of_strategy_desc:0 "With Equestria no longer on the brink of collapse, we can finally look forward and decide on how we can end this war against the Nightmare. Some advocate for a withdrawal to the western heartlands for a long campaign of exhausting the Lunarists; others believe a strategy of aggressive defense following by a heavy counterattack will secure victory with minimal loss of life."
EQS_war_industry:0 "War Industry"
EQS_war_industry_desc:0 "Reforming the system is not enough. Even if we were to run all the industry we currently have at peak efficiency, it would still not be enough to guarantee victory. More factories must be requisitioned and built, producing the weapons and equipment that ponies need to fight back. War on both fronts; the army and the factories will work in tandem, understanding that one without the other is nothing."
EQS_defense_of_equestria:0 "The Defense Of Equestria"
EQS_defense_of_equestria_desc:0 "The Nightmareists remain extremely aggressive in their efforts to take Equestria, as we would expect. Before we can effectively push forward to end this war, we must first end their assault. We dig in, hold the line, and let the enemy go no further. They will soon find that fighting disorganized soldiers is far different from a united and prepared defense."
EQS_end_the_stagnation:0 "End The Stagnation"
EQS_end_the_stagnation_desc:0 "Our efforts to force Equestria into the modern era have been extremely successful, but we are still not finished. Remnants of Equestria society still cling to the past, to outdated traditions that are quite frankly unsuited for the modern era. Equestria is a modern nation, and it is time to prove that in reality."
EQS_equestrian_warplan:0 "Equestrian War Plan"
EQS_equestrian_warplan_desc:0 "Our defenses are in place, and Equestria modernized. Now it is time to bring all our work together, and craft a dedicated war plan for the nation so that everything can be brought to bear against the Nightmare. Some debate exactly how harsh this plan should be on the ponies of Equestria; while victory must be achieved, what are we willing to sacrifice for it?"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare:0 "Guns Against The Nightmare"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare_desc:0 "The war continues. And as it drags on, ponies will continue to die, whether we like it or not. But if we are to ask them to die for Equestria, then the bare minimum we must do is ensure they are fully equipped to fight on the front. The brave soldiers will have their weapons, no matter the cost."
EQS_chaos_and_order:0 "Chaos And Order"
EQS_chaos_and_order_desc:0 "The rise of the Nightmare has made many ponies scared and desperate. Ponies are beginning to take certain matters into their own hooves, threatening to throw everything into chaos. With the right words, however, the Princess should be able to calm things down.\n\nOr there is always the alternative."
EQS_help_the_refugees:0 "Help The Refugees"
EQS_help_the_refugees_desc:0 "Thousands of ponies have been displaced due to the war, whether they be fleeing across the border from the tyranny of the Nightmare or from their homes due to proximity to the frontline. Many simply wish for a new place to call home until the war is over, but such circumstances breeds resentment. And while we are a nation of friendship... we also always need more ponies on the front."
EQS_wartime_administration:0 "Wartime Administration"
EQS_wartime_administration_desc:0 "The bureaucracy of Equestria is full of talented, loyal ponies who have all proven themselves to the Princess. It is unsuited for war, as many within its ranks are unwilling or uneducated in wartime measures. Though we are grateful for their service, it may be time to find replacements more suitable for what will be asked of them in this difficult time."
EQS_wartime_laws:0 "Wartime Laws"
EQS_wartime_laws_desc:0 "The legal code of Equestria is something that has adapted and shifted with the times, though it has always officially protected the many freedoms that ponies enjoy. But now, the leniency and spirit of forgiveness that has held Equestria together takes valuable resources, a dangerous thing given our situation. Perhaps it is time to overhaul the laws to suit the times, even if only temporarily?"
EQS_together_against_nightmare:0 "Together Against The Nightmare"
EQS_together_against_nightmare_desc:0 "War is not the end of friendship, nor is it something that breaks the bonds that keep us together. Rather it creates new ones, friendships tested through the most difficult trials and shared burdens. We may fight our former friends on the battlefield, but the bonds forged in battle are unbreakable, where any soldier of Equestria is willing to put their life in the hooves of the ponies that stand by them."
EQS_new_general_staff:0 "A New General Staff"
EQS_new_general_staff_desc:0 "Full-scale war may be a struggle Equestria has never seen before, but there are still plenty of ponies willing to step up to the task of leadership. Their unique skills are what we need, especially in these desperate times. Only with effective leaders at every level of Equestria can we succeed, even if some will have to sacrifice their lifestyles in the defense of Harmony."
EQS_matter_of_thestrals:0 "Matter Of The Thestrals"
EQS_matter_of_thestrals_desc:0 "The thestrals have become a complicated subject in Equestria, even moreso than before the war began. There are still many loyal to harmony who want to fight for the Princess and Equestria. But nopony can deny that the majority of thestrals are loyal to the Nightmare now, and acts of sabotage are certain. Arguments have raged for months on what to do with them; we must close this issue."
EQS_deal_with_radicals:0 "Deal With The Radicals"
EQS_deal_with_radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism breeds radicalism. With the Nightmare willing to go to such lengths to ensure her rule over Equestria, ponies are beginning to believe we need to follow suit. A small group, comprised of religious devotees to the Princess and militaristic fanatics, have proven terrifyingly effective in their service to Equestria. But is such a precedent one we want to establish?"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists:0 "Aid The Loyalists"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Deep in southeastern Equestria, within the jungles once loyal to the Nightmare, a brave resistance led by the heroine Daring Do fight mercenaries, communists and the remaining Nightmareists to restore Harmony much as we do. Our struggle north means we do not have the resources to intervene, but we will not abandon them either. Spare volunteers and guns can be sent so that they may be victorious."

Infantry_weapons_desc:0 "Investing into the famous Macintosh Factory will attract more engineers. That way, our soldiers can be provided with new, better guns. It is simply the army's largest need, and we can't let our ponies go without a decent weapon."
Appeal_to_STG:0 "Request Stalliongrad's Help"
Appeal_to_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has never had a reason to hold any love for Equestria or the Princess, but they must see reason in the current situation. If [CHN.GetLeader] and their monstrous army is allowed free reign over Equestria, they will quickly finish off Stalliongrad as well. Everypony knows Stalliongrad has been massing troops and materiel for a while, their help could be a turning point in this conflict."
faction_research:0 "All Ponies Joint Research"
faction_research_desc:0 "While their societal structure seems odd to an average pony, there's no doubt Stalliongrad has been pushing new boundaries in the area of science ever since they've secured independence. It shouldn't be much of a problem to expand our military cooperation to include researchers, as well."
military_coordination:0 "Military Coordination"
military_coordination_desc:0 "The assistance we've received thus far has been more than welcome, but Stalliongradian commanders do not readily seek to coordinate with their Equestrian counterparts. It would be logical to assume they fear some kind of foul play coming from our hooves, thus [EQS.GetLeader] must secure a more closely working relationship with the General Secretary to ward off any such suspicions."
STG_tank_projects:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Projects"
STG_tank_projects_desc:0 "Although we already have an extensive armour programme ourselves, the Stalliongradian military has come up with ingenious models themselves. They've been perfecting their tank doctrine, as well, which will undoubtedly prove crucial to counter the changeling Panzers. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from their designs."
Extreme_measures:0 "Extreme Measures"

War_Plan:0 "War Plan"
War_Plan_desc:0 "We need to conscript more ponies, build more factories, and produce more equipment in order to fuel our ever growing war machine. Let us finally address these concerns: several plans have been drafted to best resolve this situation, but we only need to implement one."
Forget_magic_of_friendship:0 "Put Down the Magic of Friendship"
Forget_magic_of_friendship_desc:0 "For the longest time, peaceful and friendly cooperation with each other has solved almost any problem ponies have come across.

EQS_WMD:0 "Equestrian Weapon of Mass Destruction"

EQS_airfields:0 "Airfields of Central Equestria"

EQS_airfields2:0 "Airfields of Southern Equestria"
EQS_airfields2_desc:0 "We ought to connect the regions of Equestria with air bridges. In case of war, we will have to protect our skies, not to mention it will allow increased coverage and tactical options for our planes."
reinforce_border:0 "Border Fortification Plan"
reinforce_border_desc:0 "The changelings have become increasingly aggressive towards their neighbours, Equestria included. In light of this, we must commence fortification efforts along our common border. While our military experts do not think it will ensure victory on its own, it will be a delayer until we can rouse the rest of Equestria."

Remove_Harmonic_Stagnation_desc:0 "For the longest time, the practice of Harmony within our land has brought us peace and prosperity. It has, however, failed us and has allowed for war to come to our very doorstep. If we wish to survive this struggle, we must restructure our decentralized and democratic political system into something more... pragmatic."
Suppress_bureaucracy:0 "Eradicate Bureaucracy"
Suppress_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our bloated bureaucratic system is simply not suited for war. We must streamline it, and make it much easier and quicker for us to implement changes and decisions. It is regrettable, but the war won't be won on triplicate paperwork."

industry_las_pegasus:0 "Las Pegasus Toaster Factories"
industry_las_pegasus_desc:0 "While certainly not famed for military production, the city of Las Pegasus is very much an oasis for civilian industry. We should encourage further growth by investing in factories that already produce many consumer goods for the civilian populace."
mil_industry_fillydelphia:0 "Fillydelphia Automobile Factories"
mil_industry_fillydelphia_desc:0 "The car is a still relatively new and costly product for Equestrians to explore. It is best for us to attempt to spread it further through Equestria, to both rich and poor alike. Such production facilities could also be repurposed for military use during times of crisis."
Spitfire_research:0 "Spitfire Research"
Spitfire_research_desc:0 "Equestria is filled with flying ponies and even floating cities. It would be silly not to invest in strong, resilient airplanes to allow others to fly as well. A well maintained airforce can become crucial should a conflict arise, as well..."
industry_crystal_emp:0 "Industrialise Crystal Empire"
industry_crystal_emp_desc:0 "While the crystal ponies to our north are faithful allies of ours, their nation is not yet very developed. We must support them in industrialising their nation. This could become a very wise decision for the days to come."
eqs_buffalo2:0 "Resolve the Issues with Buffalo"
eqs_buffalo2_desc:0 "Friends are stronger together, and this goes for us and the buffalo as well. They would prosper greatly under the mantle of harmony, but the relatively sparse land would need significant investment to avoid becoming a drain on the national budget. Furthermore, the rights of buffalo would have to be guaranteed to avoid further issues."
EQS_buffalo_relations:0 "Buffalo Relations"
EQS_buffalo_relations_desc:0 "Even after the Applelosan settlement, the bonds between local ponies and buffalo remain tenuous, at best. While the native creatures only seek to preserve and maintain their way of life, undisturbed and static for centuries, greedy developers see the buffalo land and dream of riches both on the ground and under it. Surely, there must be a compromise that satisfies the teachings of harmony?"
eqs_southern_roads:0 "Southern Roads"
eqs_southern_roads_desc:0 "With the integration of the Buffalo tribes into Equestria, it is time that we made good on our promises and develop the local infrastructure in the area.

southern_industry:0 "Southern Resources"
southern_industry_desc:0 "Owing to the normalisation of relations between pony and buffalo, the southwest of Equestria is open towards further modernisation and exploitation of natural resources. In accordance with the drawn up agreement, areas considered of traditional importance to the buffalo will be avoided, while the "safe zones" are open for development and settlement."
EQS_industry_of_the_south:0 "Industry of the South"
EQS_industry_of_the_south_desc:0 "Stableside and Baltimare are industrial centres of the southern region. However, for a long time investors turned away from these places. There's no reason to believe that the south is not profitable. We no longer need to be blinded by these illusions. Factories for the south! And while you're at it, begin aluminium production in Tenochtitlan."
EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles:0 "Jungle Railway"
EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles_desc:0 "The jungles of southeastern Equestria have been all but impassable for a long time. Most of the development has been focused on coastal cities, due to the fear of native pony tribes in the jungles. In order the exploit the vast potential in resource the jungles hold, we shall invest in building new roads and railways through the jungle, while respecting the known habitats of hostile tribals."
dragon_question:0 "The Dragon Question"
dragon_question_desc:0 "The mighty dragon has always been a feared creature, but their claws and flames do not seem so terrifying anymore when firearms and warships exist. There is no need to employ threats on them; such prideful beings only laugh at them. A more shrewd approach would make an end to dragon attacks, and acquire the Badlands for Equestria."
badlands_are_ours:0 "Take Back the Badlands"
badlands_are_ours_desc:0 "Initial talks have yielded little progress, the dragons are renowned for their stubborn, almost insolent approach to anything they deem to be beneath their notice. Should other options fail, they'll learn that ponies have grown out of the prey role. For now, let us continue in the spirit of friendship and harmony."
tenochtitlan_state_university:0 "Stableside State University"
tenochtitlan_state_university_desc:0 "Equestria has many facilities for higher education, one of them being Baltimare University, but issue is that Baltimare is the sole location in the southeast containing such faculties. Many talented ponies miss out on learning further, because they simply cannot afford to travel and live in northern cities. The formation of a state sponsored university in Stableside should alleviate the problem."
southern_naval_bases:0 "Southern Naval Bases"
southern_naval_bases_desc:0 "Equestria boasts the longest coastline in the world, but the development and construction of new dockyards, wharves and piers has not kept up with the growth. Given the obvious lack of such facilities on the southeast shores, it would be prudent to fill the gap, thus giving our navy a new base to repair and fuel from."
EQS_portland_fishing_port:0 "Portland Seaweed Farms"
EQS_portland_fishing_port_desc:0 "If we support the coastal farms in Portland, they can supply the entire region with nutritiuous seaweed. With the influx of food, prices will fall and allow for local towns to grow at a steady pace, which will attract the industrial concerns to set up local businesses. Hopefully, this will solve the issue of unequal region wealth."

##NEW DECISIONS##

EQS_prewar_diplomacy_category:0 "Harmonic Diplomacy"
EQS_prewar_diplomacy_category_desc:0 "Friendship does not usually thrive with those who wait. All across the world, our friends fight on in an everchanging world, one that may prove to not be so kind to the ideals of Harmony. While we always strive to uphold peace and reconciliation, that does not mean we will watch as our friends are in danger. We have a responsibility to act, and act we must, for the good of all creatures."

EQS_aid_velvet:0 "Support Queen Velvet"
EQS_aid_velvet_desc:0 "Queen Velvet, rightful monarch of Olenia has come under attack by the Changeling Lands and Queen Chrysalis, who no doubt will look to Equestria next after she is finished with the deer. The Equestrian ponies do not support a direct intervention, at least not yet, but that does not mean we will leave our fellow harmonic monarch out to face this grave threat alone. We will send all we can to them so that they can fight back against the changelings, and defend their homeland from the invaders who would seek to subjugate all of Equus."
EQS_support_the_yaks:0 "Support the Yaks"
EQS_support_the_yaks_desc:0 "Every day, it looks more and more likely that the only possible conclusion to the Yak-Jak feud will be through war. This is deeply regrettable, though it does not mean we will not support our friend Prince Rutherford in his struggle. He trusted us with his Kingdom in his acceptance of Harmony, and now it is time for us to return the favor."
EQS_yak_pony_friendship_treaty:0 "Yak-Pony Friendship Treaty"
EQS_yak_pony_friendship_treaty_desc:0 "Now that the Yak-Jak war is over and the Yaks have remained true to Harmony, we can officially sign a treaty of friendship between our two races, promising to forever come to each other's aid should we need it. While we can hope that it will never have to be put to use, the Yaks too believe it is only a matter of time before Equestria is threatened; when that day comes, we will be glad to have them by our side."
EQS_shelter_prince_rutherford:0 "Shelter Prince Rutherford"
EQS_shelter_prince_rutherford_desc:0 "Yakyakistan has fallen to dark influences, ones against Harmony and the rightful rule of Prince Rutherford. However, the remaining harmonists led by the Prince and a former student of the School of Friendship, Yona, have made the long trek south to Canterlot where they have sought refuge until they can return to free Yakyakistan. Though their country is lost, we still stand, and will provide them with whatever they need until they can someday return home."

EQS_reapproach_stalliongrad:0 "Reapproach Stalliongrad"
EQS_reapproach_stalliongrad_desc:0 "While the new General Secretary of Stalliongrad, Vasiliy Pantsushenko is still certainly a revolutionary and communist at heart, he has notably been less hostile towards us than past leaders. Perhaps now, an official reapproachment is finally possible; a thawing of relations could only benefit both of us, should they choose to accept it."
EQS_issue_stalliongradian_embargo:0 "Officialize the Embargo"
EQS_issue_stalliongradian_embargo_desc:0 "We and Stalliongrad have never had the best relations when it came to trade, especially as businessponies were not exactly excited as the prospects within a revolutionary state. However, things have changed; it is clear now that they are actively seeking our downfall with their harsh rhetoric. While a repeat of the Winter Revolution is the last thing anypony wants, we can at least officialize the embargo placed upon them, and ask our friends to follow suit in isolating this threat."
EQS_buffalo_integration:0 "Talks with the Buffalo"
EQS_buffalo_integration_desc:0 "The buffalo have long been pushed back from their ancestral homelands, retreating from pony settlers who made their way south long ago. The Appleloosa incident only marked the natural consequence of letting the issue run unresolved; we can only do so much for the buffalo in and out of our lands while they remain nominally independent. Hopefully they will see reason in becoming a part of Equestria, so that we can fix the mistakes we've made together."
EQS_save_the_buffalo:0 "Save the Buffalo"
EQS_save_the_buffalo_desc:0 "The buffalo have fallen to dark words, revanchist promises that have turned them against us. While their rhetoric has a center of truth to it, their reaction does not bode well for Equestria, or the ponies that now live in the south. There is only one option left available to us; war, to save our friends like Chieftess Strongheart and to protect our ponies before they attack us first."
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states:0 "Integrate the Buffalo"
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states_desc:0 "With the Buffalo now fully a part of Equestria, we can integrate them as an official new part of the nation, with all the benefits and protections it confers. Chieftess Strongheart has also shown a particular desire to work with us in the future, and has gathered like-minded buffalo to help us for the future."

EQS_dragon_diplomacy:0 "Draconic Diplomacy"
EQS_dragon_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles to our south, long uncomfortable neighbors who have been less than courteous to us ponies, are now under a new Dragon Lord Ember who is much more receptive to official overtures than past leaders. Spike, Princess Twilight Sparkle's faithful assistant, has offered to visit the Dragon Lord on our behalf, and hopefully seek a more amenable relationship between our two nations. Who knows, perhaps some fruit may bear from these efforts at friendship as well?"

EQS_shelter_olenians_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Velvet has failed in her attempts to reclaim her throne in Olenia. However, this does not mean she is without hope. While ponies are against actively staging foreign coups or going into a war with a nation like Olenia to overthrow its government, we can still provide official shelter to Queen Velvet and her supporters as well as acknowledge her as the rightful monarch. And perhaps someday, circumstances will change and she will retake Olenia in the name of Harmony."

EQS_shelter_dragon_lord:0 "Shelter the Dragon Lord"
EQS_shelter_dragon_lord_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles have fallen, and with it the very homeland of the Dragon race. While many dragons are content to serve their new overlords for sufficient payment, some, including the harmonists such as Dragon Lord Ember, have instead sought refuge in Equestria. We can offer that refuge, and give them a place here so that they might one day liberate their home."
EQS_griffonstone_refugees:0 "Griffonstone Refugees"
EQS_griffonstone_refugees_desc:0 "Griffonstone, one of the hearts of Griffonia, has come under the control of forces enemy to that of Harmony. While this would not normally concern many ponies, we had friends in Griffonstone, including a former student of the School of Friendship. As they can no longer stay in their old homeland, we can offer them a place here. It may not replace their home, but we can at least ensure that they remain safe."

EQS_shelter_hippogriffian_royal_family:0 "Shelter the Hippogriff Royal Family"
EQS_shelter_hippogriffian_royal_family_desc:0 "Hippogriffia has fallen; the light on Aris has gone out. But the royalty remains, safe and out of the reach of their oppressors. As their closest friends, they have come to us, and we will gladly welcome them in Canterlot for as long as they wish to stay and help us."
EQS_aid_hippogriffia:0 "Aid Hippogriffia"
EQS_aid_hippogriffia_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is one of our oldest allies, with their monarchy being friends with ours for countless years now. They have now come under threat in the lands of Zebrica, pulled into a war they clearly did not want. It would not do to let our friends fall even as far away as there; we will send what we can spare to help."

EQS_mend_arabian_ties:0 "Mend Arabian Ties"
EQS_mend_arabian_ties_desc:0 "Equestria and Saddle Arabia had enjoyed cordial relations for some time before their civil war, including multiple diplomatic visits which had to be suspended following the outbreak of conflict. Now that peace has returned with a government that may remain amenable to us, though, we can send an offer of resuming relations between our two states. After all, Saddle Arabia is a very powerful nation, and it would do well for us to remain on good terms."

EQS_aid_thorax:0 "Aid Thorax"
EQS_aid_thorax_desc:0 "To our surprise, it turns out there was a substantial number of changelings who support Harmony just as we do. They are now risking their lives in open revolt under their leader, a changeling named Thorax, and ask for help in their fight against Queen Chrysalis. It would be inconceivable to simply ignore their plight; sending aid to our surprising new friends is the least we can do."
EQS_invite_changeling_students:0 "Invite Changeling Students"
EQS_invite_changeling_students_desc:0 "Now that Thorax has proven victorious, we can embrace our new friends and allies with open hooves. However, an issue remains; we don't exactly know much about changeling culture and life, as we doubt they know much about pony life past the lies Queen Chrysalis fed them. An exchange program, led by Twilight's School of Friendship should help sort out our differences."

EQS_central_equestria_railroads:0 "Finish the Central Railroads"
EQS_central_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The central rail lines, stretching across the heart of Equestria, were some of the first built after the invention of the train and have been well-maintained for centuries due to substantial oversight from the Crown. However, several important planned connection lines and expansions were never finished due to geographical difficulties, magical beast attacks, national crisises, or even just some ponies not exactly wanting a train going by in their backyard. A small increase in funding could see these projects finally completed."

EQS_harmonic_stagnation_desc:0 "While the thousand years reign of Celestia has brought untold prosperity to Equestria, so too has it brought complacency and stagnation to its society. Ponies are reluctant to adopt new ideas or technologies, preferring their old traditions instead, and the political system is slow and inefficient despite recent efforts by the Princesses. Life in Equestria may have never been better, but it is no question that the nation is unsuited for the realities of today."

EQS_friendship_magic:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
EQS_friendship_magic_desc:0 "Friendship between ponies has been the defining feature of Equestria for countless generations.

Unfortunately, our enemies may not have such qualms about the use of violence... or war."
EQS_outdated_military:0 "Outdated Military"
EQS_outdated_military_desc:0 "Equestria's military is, putting it extremely mildly, woefully underequipped and unprepared for any sort of modern large-scale conflict. Military theory is a field practically unheard of until recently, and the few volunteers in the armed forces are disorganized and lack any real experience. The events of the last decade in addition to pushes by Celestia have begun to fix the many issues of the Equestrian military, but much remains to be done."

Having recently returned from her thousand-year banishment thanks to the help of Twilight Sparkle, she has spent the last few years acclimatizing to the modern era and settling into her old role. Despite this, she has maintained a passive role in modern Equestrian politics, preferring to let her sister take the lead on most decisions and instead focusing on her duties in the realm of dreams."
EQS_thestral_divide:0 "The Thestral Divide"
EQS_thestral_divide_desc:0 "Thestrals, more commonly known as batponies, are the fourth tribe of ponies with a long history separate from that of the other three tribes. This has resulted in a population separate from mainstream Equestrian society, a problem which only worsened following the banishment of Princess Luna due to the thestrals regarding her as a divine entity of their sacred moon.

 #equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearth's Warming and Happy New Year!"
 #equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago ponies across the country celebrated Hearth's Warming, an annual holiday commemorating the founding of Equestria. As is tradition, on Hearth Warming Eve ponies gathered to spectate theatre plays that re-enact the legendary establishment of the country, with the pageant in Canterlot being the largest. In the story, the three pony tribes, Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth ponies, live an uneasy existence together until a fearsome blizzard forces them to seek for a new homeland. However, the leaders of the tribes all claim the same land and argue with one another, causing the blizzard to appear again. According to the legend, the cold was caused by magical Windigos that feed on hatred. The tribal leaders are frozen in ice, but their assistants befriend one another and create the Fire of Friendship, a heart-shaped flame that expels the Windigos forever and melts the bodies and hearts of the tribal leaders. The three tribes then agree to share the new land, calling it Equestria. After the pageants, on Hearth's Warming Day, pony families enjoy delicious meals, exchange gifts and raise the flag of Equestria.\n\nAnd now, the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria. The Princesses have given their traditional speech to the public as well, rejuvenating the spirit of Harmony and Unity throughout all of Equestria. No matter what will happen, the ponies know that as long as they work together, they can overcome any challenge."
 #equestria.1.a:0 "The future looks bright."
 equestria.1.t:0 "The Unity of Equestria"
 equestria.1.d:0 ""My little ponies." The crowd, gathered in front of the stage and consisting of ponies of all types became silent. "Thank you all, for joining us once again in the Grand Equestria Pony Summit and representing your cities across all of Equestria. Many of you have traveled far, and we hope that here, we can all come together and enjoy the bonds of friendship that brought us together so long ago."\n\nThe Equestrians, made of nobles, mayors and businessponies alike all clapped their hooves politely for Princess Celestia. She waited politely for them to finish before motioning for both Luna and Twilight to step forward with her. "We understand that some of you may have worries or concerns to bring up with us. And as Princesses of Equestria, we promise you that we will be here to listen and help in any way we can. All of us may have troubles, but if we work together, I am sure that we can all move past them together."\n\nAnother round of applause. Princess Twilight took center stage, lightly coughing this time to get the ponies to settle down. "But most of all, we all hope you can enjoy your time here in Canterlot. With more ponies here than any other summit in the history of Equestria, we're sure that the three days here will be more productive, interesting and exciting than ever before! And remember, everypony...""

 equestria.2.t:0 "Realities of the Future"
 equestria.2.d:0 "Three days later, it was over. The delegates, having spent days and nights talking, eating, drinking and enjoying their time in Canterlot were all gone, having left back to their home cities. Most had gone home happy; a few were merely satisfied, but nopony left particularly nervous or worried.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said of the Princesses who had remained.\n\n"I hope you two have better news than I do," Twilight said, her formalities dissipating as she sat down, clearly exhausted. "Mayor Rokenhar of Las Pegasus is worried about food imports, Mayor Goldwin of Vanhoover believes that Stalliongrad is agitating the dock workers in the city, and some buffalo almost got into a fight with the southern ponies."\n\n"I fear that what I have been told is not any less concerning, Princess Twilight. Mayor Ash Moustache of Baltimare expressed his concerns to me about a group called "CANTER", I believe. And then there is the matter of the thestrals, too..." Luna looked away from her fellow royals. "It seems that there are many still reluctant to rejoin Equestrian society again, even after my return." The Night Princess looked back up at Celestia, who seemed to be distant from the conversation. "What about you, sister? What have you learned from our subjects?"\n\nThe Princess did not speak for a few moments. "The mayor of Acornage voiced his concerns with me earlier today," she said finally, looking at neither of them. "The changeling presence on the border grows more worrying by the month. She assured me of her efforts to keep relations between ponies and the remaining changelings in the city friendly, but... many believe that Equestria will soon be facing a new threat." Celestia looked at Luna, then at Twilight.\n\n"One unlike any we have seen before.""
 equestria.2.a:0 "We will have to take all of this into consideration..."
 #equestria.3.t:0 "The Dotted Line Report"
 #equestria.3.d:0 "A disturbing report has recently landed on the desk of Princess Celestia. Commissioned by the small bureaucracy, it has painted a grim picture of what would happen, were Equestria to find herself attacked by any enemies from beyond her borders.\n\nThe first part of the report focuses on Stalliongrad. While they have not been particularly keen on jumping across the border, whatever the rhetoric coming out of the Palace of Soviets says, were it to happen, the Royal Guard, with its less than 10,000 soldiers in the area would find itself swept away by the Red Army which, the report reckons would get as far as Albion and Trotsylvania before moving to threaten Manehatten.\n\nSpeaking of the Royal Guard, the report condemns the large cuts made to the Royal Guard over the recent years, blaming them for the near-defeat at Canterlot, using very unparliamentary language to describe the state of the Guard, recommending an immediate five-fold increase in budget.\n\nLastly, there's the biggest, and grimmest part of the report. The Changelings. Information is of course rare about them, and as such, the report makes it clear it's working off hearsay. But, this is the most damning part of it all. The report states that if a full Changeling invasion was to occur, Equestria would surely fall within two years of such an invasion, unless 'radical and controversial' measures were taken, including overhauling the whole state to mobilize all resources.\n\nIn addition to military matters, the report warns about the lack of innovation and economic development in recent years which has allowed other nations (such as the Changeling Lands) to catch up. It proposes large-scale industrial projects and education reforms to maintain Equestria's position as the most developed country in the world.\n\nDespite the dire warnings made in the report regarding the risk of invasion, only the industrial and scientific parts of the report have been publicly stated to be put into effect. In private, however, Princess Celestia knows something must be done..."
 #equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.3.t:0 "Help from the Ponies"
 equestria.3.d:0 "Frosty Gust watched as ponies unloaded the crates of guns, medical supplies and other necessities off the carriages, hoofing them over to a few Yaks waiting impatiently nearby. It had been a difficult trip, traveling through the Crystal Empire and across the Yak Range using underdeveloped roads and trails to finally make it to Yakistown. Had she known the time and danger involved in the trip, she probably wouldn't have volunteered to lead the expedition in the first place. She was pretty sure at least five years of her lifespan were gone from those avalanches.\n\nPrince Rutherford looked from the military equipment to Frosty; he had arrived to personally oversee the transfer. "Yaks appreciate pony help!" he said loudly, as was the norm for all yaks. "Yaks and ponies live in dangerous times! Become harder to SMASH enemies, need work together!"\n\n"Yes, of course," she replied, trying to remember the basics she learned in Yak diplomacy. "Equestria will always stand by our friends, and we know how important it is to help you as much as we can."\n\nThere was a crash. A few ponies had dropped one of the crates, letting rifles spill out from the top. The Prince picked one of them up and studied it closely. "This pony weapon, not yak made," he said, anger slowly rising. "Pony weapons not for yaks, not perfect. When things not perfect, make yaks mad! Makes yaks want to destroy!"\n\nThe pony winced. This was exactly what she had been told not to let happen when it came to diplomacy with yaks. "Well, um, you see," she said, trying to do damage control. "We can't really, uh, I meant we tried to-"\n\nThe yak prince nodded before giving the rifle to another yak, who started helping the ponies gather the fallen weapons. "Yaks mad, but yaks also understand not everything perfect anymore," Rutherford said. "Yaks need weapons, can't afford to SMASH. Pony help important, yaks not forget!"\n\nFrosty breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed not everything the ponies back in Canterlot told her was true after all. "If you need anything else from Equestria, all you have to do is ask. We will always be ready to help a friend in need.""
 equestria.3.a:0 "Pony and yak friendship last forever!"
 #equestria.4.t:0 "The Expansion of the School for Gifted Unicorns"
 #equestria.4.d:0 "It tended to be in the past that only those who could pull favours, had a lot of connection or were just plain lucky could attend the School for Gifted Unicorns. But no more is that the case. The cash injection that has been performed by the Crown has been immensely helpful in broadening the appeal and fields of the School for Gifted Unicorn. Having moved most of the facilities from the older, historical, if cramped quarters in the core of Canterlot to a more modernized place in the outskirts of Canterlot, the new sprawling campus will be able to more adequately handle the many breakthroughs and inventions that are being pumped out of Equestria's scientific community. Many of the new students and faculty have been some of Griffonia's brightest that have fled the political turmoil in Wingbardy and some parts of the Empire for more fertile lands. They have certainly found them here in Equestria."
 #equestria.4.d_sol:0 "In the past, it was all too often of an occurrence, that those of rich families simply used their family wealth to buy their foal a place in the school. Often this lead to students not valuing the opportunity to study there and as such lowered quality of the graduates. Furthermore, it has let moral rot seep into our society ever so slightly. This sets an undesirable precedent that our Empress can no longer tolerate. Today Her Imperial Majesty agreed to a proposal to fund the School for Gifted Unicorns from Imperial Treasury directly in form of annual cash injections. These new funds will be used to refurbish classrooms and other school facilities, as well as better equipment and supplies. This also gives the Crown more power and control over the curriculum of the school. Starting this semester, the school will besides be focusing on magic also teach religious and moral values. This will ensure that the next generation will grow into upstanding model citizens of society."
 #equestria.4.a:0 "Wonderful."
 equestria.4.t:0 "The Equestrian-Yak Treaty of Friendship"
 equestria.4.d:0 "Equestria was not a nation known for war. Rather, it was known for its peace, friendship and diplomacy, all things they took very seriously. Nothing symbolized that seriousness more than the long scroll that had been brought to Prince Rutherford, expertly written in elegant ponish on the finest Equestrian parchment, and already signed by both diarchs of Equestria. There was just one small problem with it.\n\nAlmost no yak could read the exceedingly formal script. Fortunately, an official diplomat had been sent from Canterlot with the entire document already memorized to read aloud to the yaks of Rutherford's court. Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie had also decided to give commentary on the exceedingly formal language of the document, which was a blessing or a curse depending on who you asked in the room.\n\n"...which hereby solidifies cordial relations between the Principality of Equestria and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan in perpetuity, agreed upon by the sovereigns of each nation." The diplomat, an old earth pony stallion with a long grey beard, finally finished his reading of the treaty and bowed to the Prince and his entourage, who all looked to Pinkie Pie standing off to the side.\n\n"What he means is that we all Pinkie Promise to always be super duper friends and help each other out whenever we need it! It also means that I can throw the biggest party in Yakyakistan EVER!" Pinkie was already bouncing up and down at the mere thought of it, while the Prince and the other yaks nodded before looking at each other. Rutherford stomped once - the elders stomped back. They nodded at him - he nodded back.\n\n"Yakyakistan still in difficult time!" he finally proclaimed, causing even Pinkie to stop bouncing and listen attentively. "Many disagreements between yaks, still needs fixing! Yaks believe we need focus on yak issues, not pony issues!"\n\nPinkie frowned, and her mane threatened to deflate like it did during the yovidaphone incident. "PINK PONY NO CRY YET!" Rutherford yelled loud enough to shake the pony's eyeballs around. "Yak never forget friendship. Friendship of pink pony, and all ponyland! When pony call, yak will always answer!" Another yak brought forth an almost comedically large quill, which the Prince used to sign the document before adding his royal seal with a loud slam.\n\nThe excitement in Pinkie's eyes returned faster than the snap of a hoof. "Yay!" she said bouncing all across the room. "Ooh, I'll need to get my super-duper party cannon for this one! Come on, we have a party to throw!" The Equestrian diplomat, who had only nodded politely and had turned to leave found himself dragged faster than the speed of sound out the door by the party pony, the yaks all laughing uproariously at the antics of their old new friend."

 #equestria.5.t:0 "Luna Nova Academy"
 #equestria.5.d:0 "Today, what was once a pipe dream in the minds of the researchers of the Luna Nova Academy has been made reality. Made possible with the massive injection of funds from the Crown, the Luna Nova Academy has moved from its older campus to the newer, more modern magically-powered campus. Housed in the old clocktower outside of Ponyville, the laboratories and study halls stretch deep underground, with several testing areas housed both above and below ground. With the new facilities, several old inventions which had been put in mothballs by lack of funds, facilities or both have been pulled out and begun field testing, and depending on what is chosen at the highest level, may see full-scale deployment within the year.\n\nIt is expected that the institution's patron, HM Princess Luna will make a visit to the place in the very near future."
 #equestria.5.t_sol:0 "Sol Invicta Academy"
 #equestria.5.d_sol:0 "Our most prestigious school, now renamed to a name more fitting of its status, has received the subsidies from Her Imperial Majesty. With these, they will be able to refurbish labs with new state-of-the-art equipment, increase the number of professors and their salaries as well as opening more places for talented ponies in [Root.GetName], who might have been dismissed due to capacity issues otherwise. Academy dormitories will also get its due expansions and renovations to make sure these students have a place to live and improve living standards. Lastly, Her Imperial Majesty did not make any demands per se. However, during her meeting with the Dean, she expressed her 'strong' desire to see more focus on magical theory and practice to raise better mages, not to forget the emphasis she made regarding technology, chemistry, physics and other natural sciences as well as focus on religious and ethical upbringing."
 #equestria.5.a:0 "Here's to many successful inventions."
 equestria.5.t:0 "Arrival of the Exiles"
 equestria.5.d:0 "The last time Prince Rutherford had visited Equestria in a manner like this, it had nearly ended with the Kingdom of Yakyakistan declaring war upon Equestria. One could perhaps, if looking for it, find irony in the fact then that he had returned not as a Prince, or as an enemy, but as an exile. Him and thousands of other yaks, all following their former monarch to the first friends they found outside of Yakyakistan. Pinkie Pie had personally requested (or demanded according to some) to accompany the yaks from Whinnyapolis to their destination of Canterlot. Now she stood with an oddly contemplative expression to one side as the Prince stood before Princess Celestia, alone on her throne.\n\n"We are deeply troubled by the news coming out of Yakyakistan," the alicorn said to Rutherford and his entourage consisting of a few elders who had chosen to come with him in exile and the former student of the School of Friendship, Yona. "I wish we only could have done more to help before it was too late. Should you wish to stay, Equestria will welcome you with open hooves for as long as you need."\n\nThe yak nodded in agreement. "Home of yaks fall to evil forces. Ponyland also in danger by same forces! Yaks fight with ponies, make sure not suffer same fate as Yakyakistan!"\n\nYona stepped forward as well, the Prince giving a nod in agreement to allow her to speak. "Maybe yaks return home to Yakyakistan someday, maybe not," she said, her voice laced with just a twinge of bitterness which quickly disappeared. "But yaks never let down pony friends no matter what! Yaks protect Equestria, just like ponies do!"\n\nPinkie looked at Yona and Rutherford for a second before her head turned to see Celestia's response, a single light nod. "Equestria would never refuse help from its friends," she said softly, at least compared to the yaks.\n\n"Good!" Rutherford practically yelled back. "Pony princess have no choice in matter anyway. Exile makes yaks mad, want to SMASH something!" All the yaks barring Yona started stomping the ground as hard as they could, which was thankfully magically reinforced. All the commotion caused the Royal Guards to storm in to see what the noise was, then staring confused at the display of violence against the palace floor.\n\nAnd despite everything, the slightest twinge of a smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle."
 equestria.5.a:0 "We will repay them for this someday."
 #equestria.6.t:0 "Public Schools Funding"
 #equestria.6.d:0 "Even with the strengthening of higher learning, we must all remember that the ABC's and 123's come first. The overhaul of the public school system in Equestria has been long overdue, still teaching subjects and topics that have been mentioned as being outdated 'when Coltlumbus made landfall in New Mareland'. Hyperbole, to be sure, but a damning indictment of the state of education nonetheless before our reforms. The recent reform package that we have just rolled out into the school system has provided for a good and modern education for the fillies and colts of Equestria. When they go forth and receive new education, they will carry with them a new world in their hearts."

She'd delivered with her a hefty proposal: On the grounds that both Severyana and Equestria would recognise each other as neutral parties hoping for reconciliation, both nations would detente with one another, with provisions to limit the build-up of military forces along each other's borders.\n\nOn the one hoof, such a proposal would ensure Equestria's non-intervention against Severyana's future plans, providing the SCP the unspoken guarantee that they could wholly focus on more fruitful pro-revolutionary activities in the north. However, to cosy up with the very imperialist paradise that they had rebelled from not two decades ago did not have good optics nor implications. Such a deal could set a dangerous precedent, a contradiction of its own in a post-state society catering to socially backwards and oppressive Equestria.\n\nAn hour would pass in calm discussion and debate.

With Queen Chrysalis on a hate-fuelled crusade to dominate and carve up all of Equus, all of ponykind is on the line. We must either hang together, or we will deservedly hang separately. Even if it will cost us, and will pain us to do so, we must go to Stalliongrad and ask them for help in this fight for life or death that we are embroiled in.\n\nHowever, there is a vocal wing in the War Council that advocate not selling out thousands of ponies to live under Stalliongrad when it is very well possible that we can defeat the changelings ourselves. The choice of action has thusly ultimately fallen to the Crown. We can choose to ask, knowing that there will be a price, or we can bet on us being able to defeat the changelings by ourselves."

 #equestria.11.d:0 "The rightful Queen of Olenia, Queen Velvet, for many years in exile in various countries around the world today arrived in Equestria on the ship HMS Canterlot. She was given a heroine's welcome in the city of Vanhoover, the largest Olenian community outside of the Kingdom proper. The city had long been a hotbed for resistance against Johan, both Legitimists favouring the restoration of Queen Velvet and communists favouring a restructuring along the lines of Stalliongrad. Common for both, however, is that she has long been a focal point for resistance against Johan, whatever their creed may be. Of course that is where the similarities end, but that's a matter for another time.\n\nQueen Velvet has settled nicely into Vanhoover, having already begun advocating that Equestria should intervene in Olenia to restore 'rightful rule' to Olenia."

"The Equestrians had gone too far with Appleloosa, and we swore no more of our ancient lands would be given to the ponies. But now, they want to take everything that is left? This is an insult to all buffalo!"\n\n"It's not like that at all!" Little Strongheart argued back, shouting above the cries of many buffalo who voiced their dissent. "The ponies are our friends, and they just want to help us! But they can't do that if we keep to ourselves and fight against everything different! Joining Equestria doesn't make us any less of who we are!"\n\nMany more buffalo started talking amongst themselves, seeming to agree with Strongheart's words. "It gets rid of everything we are!" the Elder shot back, outraged. "We would consign ourselves to a future chosen by ponies, not buffalo! They will never have our interests in mind, nor do they care for our traditions. The fact we are even considering this is an affront to all our ancestors!"\n\nThunderhooves grunted in deep contemplation. "The Equestrians have taken much from us already," he said slowly and authoritatively. Many buffalo nearby nodded. "The buffalo have lasted for centuries on our own. We do not need the ponies to solve our issues."\n\n"But we don't need to do everything on our own either," Strongheart pleaded. "Please, understand that this isn't the end for anything we care about. It's just accepting the friendship that Equestria is offering us."\n\nThe Chief Council lasted long into the night, but by morning a decision was finally made..."

In exchange, however, funding and other securities for the Buffalo will flood into their region. Some of this includes the oil fields and iron mines below the Buffalo region which Equestrian prospectors have been very eager to open up. With the strong guarantees by the Crown, this treaty is sure to give dividends for all."

Spike said, half-busy eating a bowl of turquoise. "Seems like you did a good job convincing all those buffalo."\n\n"Yeah..." Rainbow Dash agreed hesitantly. "Little Strongheart, are you sure that you want to do this? I know that your traditions mean a lot to you, and to all the buffalo. It feels weird to give up all of that now, after everything you did to protect it."\n\nThe buffalo jumped over to Dash, giving a reassuring smile. "Dash, whether we call ourselves Equestrians or not doesn't change who we are. We keep our traditions alive by how we act and what we do, not through keeping ourselves separate from others. Besides, I believe we can learn a lot from pony traditions, just like how you can learn from us!"\n\n"Yeah, but still..." The frown remained plastered on the pegasi's muzzle.\n\n"Dash, friends trust each other, right?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"And we're friends, right?"\n\n"Obviously."\n\n"Then let us trust you to treat our traditions with respect," Strongheart said resolutely.

Based upon the theories of magical annihilation and the failed megaspells, the magi-nuclear principle would be able to harness all of the raw magical power inherent in the crystals used and unleash it by having it undergo an explosive, nuclear fission.

"I always have time for any creature, especially one so important as yourself, Little Strongheart." Celestia did not mind the use of her archaic title; it was one the buffalo had retained for her, even as the centuries passed and it was lost in the minds of others.\n\n"Thank you." The buffalo took a few steps forward, seemingly a bit reluctant to speak at first. "I came here today because I was talking with some of the other buffalo, and we decided that we should do something to defend Equestria too!"\n\nThe princess tilted her head slightly at the sudden outburst. "What do you mean by that?" she asked, more curious than confused.\n\nStrongheart wasted no time in continuing, regaining her confidence as she did so. "We learned years ago that you have to be ready to fight to protect your traditions. Buffalo and ponies may have had differences, but all of us need to work together now to protect them! So please, let us stay here and do our part!"\n\n"But what about your home?" Celestia asked. "Aren't you needed there to lead?"\n\n"Equestria is my home, Day Bringer. And Chief Thunderhooves agreed that I could do more for the buffalo here in Canterlot while he remains chief of the tribes. This is what I want to do."\n\nCelestia gently nodded. "Then of course you can stay here, Little Strongheart." Standing up from her throne, the alicorn walked down to stand in front of the buffalo, her face full of gratitude and kindness. "And thank you, for your courage and compassion. I am sure all of us will have much to learn from you.""

 equestria.45.d:0 "It was a very rare thing for Princess Celestia, immortal diarch and sovereign of Equestria, to feel pressed for time. The passage of such worked differently for her after all, at least compared to most. But with the turning of the new millennium, ever since her sister had finally returned, there was just so much to do. Overseeing the military reforms with her nephew, keeping up with international diplomacy... Celestia would be forever grateful to her subjects in Canterlot like Raven who even made it possible, but they could only do so much as well. She could only hope it would be enough.\n\nThe door across the royal hall opened. "You're up early, sister," Celestia noted as the younger diarch walked in to take a seat across the table. "Is there something the matter?"\n\nLuna nodded silently. She instinctively pulled a pineapple from the nearby fruit bowl with magic before hesitating and grabbing the plate of pancakes in front of her instead. "Sister, about the thestrals... we both know it isn't right."\n\nOf course it was the thestrals. Luna had been uneasy about the subject ever since she had toured Equestria again years ago to see how the land had changed in her absence. "I agree that things are not... perfect between them and the rest of Equestria," Celestia responded, trying to be delicate, "but don't you think we should wait until things are safer to try and fix that? Your return has already done much for them, and with everything else going on-"\n\n"My return?" The words were faint, so much so that Celestia could barely hear them, but they were there. Luna's magic dissipated around her utensils as she stood up to slam a hoof on the table. "Their situation is my fault! If I only could have seen a world where you and I ruled together, where they and the rest of ponykind lived in Harmony... sister, you must let me fix this! I cannot bear to see my loyal subjects like this any longer!"\n\nCelestia's ears pinned back as she flinched from Luna's outburst. She could still remember that time long ago, after she was forced to use the Elements of Harmony against her. How the thestrals retreated from Equestrian society, shunned by their fellow ponies. Celestia had tried to fix things, to repair the damage caused by the loss of their princess, but with Luna gone and neither side willing to integrate... she never had the strength to see it through. The alicorn got up and slowly approached her younger sister, who had already wilted and was looking up desperately at her from her chair. "You are right," she said, "and I have waited far too long to address it. But now...""

 equestria.52.t:0 "The Princess' Speech" #DO NOT TRANSLATE THIS SECTION (52-64) OF LOC KEYS YET
 equestria.52.d:0 "The royal hall was filled with ponies as Princess Luna watched from behind the stage, her nerves fraying. When she had instructed the palace servants to spread the word throughout Equestria that she would be giving an announcement concerning the thestrals, she never expected this many to show up in Canterlot to listen. Back in the old times, there would be ten, perhaps fifteen ponies in her court to spread news of her decrees. Now there were well over a hundred, from the Canterlot elite and rich businessponies to normal citizens and journalists, all waiting for their Diarch to come up and speak. Luna tried to remember the advice her sister had given her before leaving Canterlot to attend to business in Fillydelphia; speak slowly but with authority, remain honest without alarming ponies, and always keep control of the situation.\n\nAs she stepped forward onto the stage, the crowd of ponies went silent. Luna could see a few thestrals dispersed throughout the crowd as well, which was good. This was something they needed to hear as much as anypony else. "Ponies!" the Princess of the Night began, keeping her voice steady. "Equestria has long been a place of friendship, harmony, and unity among the three tribes. We have shared traditions and ceremonies for countless moons, bringing us closer together. But for too long have we left out our own fellow ponies, the thestrals. It is time to rectify that."\n\n"To my thestrals, who remained loyal to me even when I did not deserve it, I ask for your trust in this. Your place is together with Equestria, not separated and alone from the rest of ponykind. You must choose to make the first step and offer a hoof to unicorns, earth ponies and pegasi so that all thestralkind can stand as a true fourth tribe."\n\n"And to the rest of Equestria, I ask you to put aside your worries, and instead greet your fellow ponies with open hooves. We grow stronger by understanding and accepting the differences between us, and I am certain that with time, thestrals will be just as much a part of Equestrian life as the three tribes are, with a shared history and place to call home."\n\nLuna paused to see the reactions of the ponies listening. A few of them were nodding along, with a few others rapidly jotting down notes with paper and pen. Most, however, including the thestrals just stared at her. Looking back into her as if waiting for something else. The alicorn grew nervous, her breath tightening a bit. "Ahem. Any questions?""
 equestria.52.a:0 "The room erupted into chaos."
 equestria.53.t:0 "The Response"
 equestria.53.d:0 "Shouting. Questions. Flashes from cameras went off in the room, blinding Princess Luna as she took a step back. The voices began hurling words at her faster than she could respond to them.\n\n"Equestria Daily, these reforms will surely be controversial, is this really the time to pursue thestral integration while the issues of Stalliongrad and the changelings are still in many ponies' minds?"\n\n"Horse News, with the thestrals having shown no intentions to desire integration, is this the best move for Equestria?"\n\n"Canterlot Chronicles, news from the Southeast continues to report attacks from radical thestrals in the jungle, will ponies be safe with these new changes?"\n\nMore and more questions were thrown. Some inquiring, some accusatory, all of them unanswerable over the wave of sound and light that assaulted Luna. Finally, she fell back on old habits. "SILENCE!" she yelled in the Royal Canterlot Voice, causing everypony else to step back, ears wilted. "I, um, understand that there may be some concerns over this, so there will be a, ah, referendum! Yes, a referendum for all four tribes, so Equestria can decide on this together. No more questions."\n\nLuna fled the stage and the hall as the reporters started shouting again, flashes going off behind her."
 equestria.53.a:0 "That... could have gone better."
 equestria.54.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 equestria.54.d:0 "Princess Luna dashed into her room in one of the tallest towers of Canterlot, slamming the door behind her with not a single reaction from her Lunar Guard outside.\n\nA referendum? That was the last thing the thestrals needed! She could pass decrees and push reforms with the help of her sister as long as opposition from the common pony was minimal, but not when she promised a popular vote on the matter! And it was not just about winning it; any close vote would only show how deep Equestrian divisions on the matter went, and would be just as likely to convince the thestrals to retreat back into isolation. She would need Equestria to overwhelmingly vote in favor of integration, to silence any neighsayers and prove the good intentions of both sides.\n\nBut to try and convince all of Equestria... it was next to impossible. She had not even been in this time for a decade, and there was still so much she didn't know! And very few ponies knew her, except for Princess Twilight and her friends, and of course the few ponies she had befriended while doing her duties in the dream realm. This new world of popular consensus, of politics and ideology, she knew nothing of how to navigate it. If only things worked like she remembered, when will of force was what dictated what would be...\n\nLuna shut her eyes. No, she could not let herself slip back there. This was a better time, a world her sister had created. She needed to find her place in it, on her own terms. She wouldn't let herself fall back into her old ways, back into... her. But when the alternative was failing her thestrals yet again, letting them fall back into the forgotten corners of history from yet another of her mistakes...\n\nIt was too much. She couldn't do it on her own. Maybe... she could just let this sit for a bit. Wait until her sister returned, and decide on the best course of action from there. Luna hated being so dependent on her fellow diarch like this, but what else was there to do? Twilight and her friends were surely too busy with their own lives to help. Celestia would know what to do.\n\nShe always did."

 equestria.55.t:0 "A Friend in Need"
 equestria.55.d:0 "Rarity always enjoyed an opportunity to visit Canterlot. She already had plenty of reasons, of course; Sassy Saddles and Canterlot Boutique could always use extra help in new designs, and at this point of course the Canterlot elite enjoyed the notoriety and flair she brought to any event. But her place would always be in Ponyville with her friends, not in the high society of the capital.\n\nThis, however was an exception. When the Cutie Map called, she had answered, and when it told her that Canterlot was her destination, both she and Twilight already knew why she was needed. The Princess had already gone into quite the tizzy following Luna's announcement; Rarity would have to talk with her about that the next time she saw Twilight.\n\nThe Royal Guard let her in wordlessly, doors opening to reveal the two diarchs of Equestria in deep discussion. Both fell silent when the noticed the unicorn enter, Celestia being the first to speak. "What brings you to Cantrlot, Rarity?" she said, her voice revealing a hint of nervousness. "Is there something we can help you with?"\n\n"Actually, it was the Cutie Map that sent me," Rarity replied with a tone already making clear there would be no beating around the bush. "And I believe we all know why it would send me here."\n\nLuna sighed, a clear admission of guilt. "My sister and I were just discussing that. It seems that there is a limit for what even she can do in this regard."\n\n"Sister..." The signs of Celestia's discomfort only grew. "You know I would do anything I could to help. But with how public this is now, I fear my involvement would only deepen any suspicions the thestrals have towards this whole debacle. They have been reluctant to even speak with me on matters ever since..." The alicorn trailed off, every pony in the room already aware of what she was referring to.\n\n"Well, we all have things in the past we'd rather forget," Rarity replied trying to change the subject, "but what matters is what we do now, darling. Now that Princess Luna has opened the door, there's so much we can accomplish if we just put our best into it!"\n\nThe Princess of the Night looked up at the unicorn. "You believe we can still do this?" she asked.\n\n"I believe you can do this, darling. Ponies look up to you, Princess Luna, far more than you may realize. All you need to do is show them this is something worth fighting for. And besides," Rarity added, winking, "I'll be there with you every step of the way.""

 equestria.56.d:0 "Hollow Shades. A secluded city on the outskirts of eastern Equestria, deep within an isolated forest and one of the largest thestral communities far from their homelands of the southeast. It was here that Luna had chosen to start her campaign, with the help of Rarity of course. Both the mayor and the local Moonspeaker had given permission for her to speak to the large crowd of thestrals gathered in the center of town. Now she was behind the stage, legs slightly wobbling as she remembered the fiasco back in Canterlot.\n\n"Darling, there's no need to be so worried!" Rarity said trying to calm Luna's fraying nerves. "You're not just a Princess, you're their Princess. You are the one in control here, no matter what the papers or ponies in Canterlot might say. As long as you believe in this, they will too. Just speak from your heart."\n\nThe alicorn took a deep breath and focused herself for a moment, before steadily walking up to the makeshift podium the city had made for her. She saw the scores of thestrals, some looking at her with hope or dull boredom, but the majority having curiosity plasted on their faces. Luna watched a filly excitedly point at her to her parents before sitting to stare with rapt attention.\n\n"Ponies!" Luna began, finding her verbal footing. "Thestrals! First, I can not begin to thank you for the loyalty you've shown me since I returned. Even when the rest of Equestria forgot me, you did not, and I can never express my gratitude enough for that. But the time has come for all of us to come out of the dark, and embrace who we all are as ponies, I understand the fear, the desire to stay back and away from others that misunderstand who you are, but that isn't the Equestrian way. It shouldn't be our way. We don't have to be different from them, because in the end we're more like each other than we know."\n\nEvery thestral was now listening to Princess Luna, hanging on to ever word she said. All of them, except for one. A stallion towards the back of the crowd tipped his hat down and walked away, disappearing into the shadows of the alleyways. He had heard enough, and he was already running late to a meeting with the others. After checking his watch once with the light of the moon, he flew off directly towards..."

Of course, not all of them were his tribal kin; a pegasi and an earth pony were the ones to greet him in salute before he waved them off to approach one of the weapon containers. "I assume everything went according to plan?" he asked, to which he received everything from curt nods to cries of success.\n\n"Those supplies you provided really did the job, sir," a thestral replied, handing him a Lavender-model rifle for him to examine. "Blew the train straight off the rails, and there was barely any opposition just like you said. How was Hollow Shades?"\n\nSharp rolled his eyes. "More platitudes made by the false goddess to attempt to sway ponies into supporting that ridiculous referendum of hers. Even worse, they were falling for her lies no doubt put in her muzzle by the sun tyrant."\n\nA few thestrals gave stomps of disapproval at that; there was nothing that riled them up more than even a mere mention of the elder Diarch. One of the ponies raised her hoof; Sharp waved one of his own to grant permission to speak. "With all due respect, sir... isn't this a bit risky? We disposed of the bodies according to your instructions and I know it'll be filed as an accident, but won't the Equestrians start digging into this eventually? This is much more than our usual operations."\n\nHe nodded. "It is, because we need to be bold now more than ever. Her return is fast approaching now, and we must be as well prepared as possible to strike when the hour is right. By the time the Equestrians realize our plans, it will be too late for them. The sun tyrant will fall and the night will reign as it should forevermore.\n\nThere were more cheers of approval.

Nopony knew that fact better than Midnight Star, who had chosen only the most secluded part of the city to hold the meeting she had summoned the others to. She was one of the few thestrals there; most were pegasi or unicorns, natural candidates to blend into the Manehattan bustle.\n\n"I assume all of you have kept up to date on things?" she asked, to which a score of nods was the response she got. "Good. Then I'm sure you know that Luna has chosen Manehattan as where to end her campaign on the eve of the referendum. Command has decided that that will be the night to strike, while the Equestrians are distracted.

Are they send us more aid to accomplish something like that?"\n\n"No," Midnight responded flatly, silencing the rest of the ponies attempting to speak up. "But they do not expect us to do this alone either. This city is fertile ground for turning the unfaithful to our cause, so long as we do not reveal our true intentions. So long as we can plant suspicions of the sun tyrant in their minds, they will accept any narrative we tell them later."\n\nThe whispers rose to murmurings, then questions and rebuttals between ponies. "There are many here leading efforts to promote thestral integration in Manehattan and beyond," one spoke up above the rest to Midnight. "If we approach them, they will filter down that distrust to the entire city by the time the Lunar Princess arrives."\n\n"The campaign organizers?" another responded. "That would attract far too much attention. It would be best to stick to the ground, speak to individuals so as to not reveal ourselves before the time is right."\n\n"And convince ten or twenty ponies in the entire city!" a third shouted out from the back.\n\n"Silence!"

But hearing the Princess of Night speak from her heart in Canterlot inspired him, lit a fire he didn't know he had. He and a few friends he knew had started the campaign here, attracting thousands to the cause of supporting Luna's efforts and bringing attention to the thestrals who had long since been forgotten.\n\nYesterday, though... it had been interesting. He had been approached by a few new ponies, ones he had never met before despite being generally knowledgable about the locals of Manehattan. They had congratulated him on the success of his efforts, and spoke of their own efforts in the southeastern jungles of Equestria as well as westwards in Canterlot and beyond. They had got along well, but there was something that still troubled Bright Light. They had also mentioned Celestia, and of her absence in all of this. Of those in Canterlot and elsewhere that would want to see the referendum fail, by any means necessary. And worst of all, that they might even be able to sway Celestia herself into aiding them, whether she wanted to or not.\n\nBright Light had always believed in Celestia and harmony. But the though that she might be against Luna's campaign... it troubled him. He would likely have to bring up the concern at the next meeting with the other organizers, see how they felt abou it as well.

That city was the exception, not the rule, and whatever other villages and towns that dotted the mountain range were usually left on their own.\n\nToday though, something had changed. There was a group of newcomers, a few thestrals who had seemed tired and in a hurry. Crescent Star had been the first to meet them at the outskirts of his village, and the first to learn why they were there. Now, he was back at home, sitting with his wife and daughter as he stared out the window in deep thought.\n\n"I don't like them one bit," the mare next to him said, clearly upset.

It was true that she had been much cheerier since Luna had begun her efforts across Equestria. She had already asked if all of them could go to see Princess Luna on the eve of the referendum in person in Manehattan.

Do whatever you want, but keep us out of it." She shut the door behind her, leaving Crescent alone with his thoughts.\n\nMaybe she was right. Maybe he was blinded by the past, by paranoia and anger and whatever else those newcomers had awoken within him. But he couldn't just sit around and do nothing, either.

"If we're quick we can still engage with the element of surprise, and press an advantage while we have it."\n\nPurple Heart blinked, then elbowed the other guard and shook his head rapidly. "Sir, with all due respect, are you insane?" he asked, motioning to the cultists below them with his head. "Even if we did get everypony back in time, they'd still heavily outnumber us. There's no way we can beat them in an engagement."\n\n"Well, do you have a better idea?"\n\n"We retreat and hurry back to Canterlot as fast as possible," he responded flatly. "The Princess will know what to do, but we won't get any help if she doesn't even know what's going on here! If there's anything like this going on anywhere else, Equestria is in serious danger."\n\n"Sir?" Both guards looked at the scout, who sank down further into the earth. "We should probably make a decision soon. We're running out of time.""

 equestria.64.d1:0 ""The Equestrians are retreating," the thestral reported in as she came back from her counter-scouting mission hidden in the trees. "From the looks of it, it seems that they're trying to get back to Canterlot, mostly likely to warn the Sun Tyrant of our plans. Should we move to intercept them?"\n\n"Obviously!" one voice cried out from the middle of the crowd of ponies. "With our numbers we could easily overrun them before they even get close to the capital! Come on, let's get moving!" More cries and shouts of agreement echoed out through the night sky before they were silence by the sound of gunfire. Everypony turned to look at the cause, a sole unicorn mare and their leader who had a growing look of frustration on her muzzle.\n\n"We are not going on a wild goose chase for a few stray guards," she shot back, silencing any remaining cheers and noise. "Our mission is to surround Fillydelphia in preparation for the signal, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We can not allow petty distractions to get in the way of that."\n\nThere were a few whispers, some groans, a few angry shouts of dissent. "But what if they reach Canterlot in time?" one shouted. "If they discover our plans, everything is in danger!"\n\nThey will never make it," she responded with a hard voice like iron. "And even if they do, Celestia will never act in time for it to matter. And besides, this matter is not up for discussion. Get back to packing your things, we move out in five."\n\nThere were a few more complaints, but they were quickly silenced by their peers as the group dispersed to attend to their duties again. The unicorn grinned to herself; soon everything would be in place."

 equestria.71.d:0 ""Tell me, have you been paying attention to my sister's efforts?"\n\nRaven Inkwell paused as she stood attentively in Celestia's personal office, making sure to choose her words carefully as she always did. "Things seem to be going well," she responded, her voice perfectly level from her years of experience as Celestia's aide. "From what the Equestrian newspapers are reporting, ponies are growing highly sympathetic to the cause of thestral integration, and many are looking forward to her final speech in Manehattan. I can have a full summary for you by tomorrow if you wish to read them yourself."\n\n"That won't be necessary." The quill on Celestia's desk levitated upward and wrote one last sentence on a letter in front of her before being set down in an inkwell, the letter disappearing in a cloud of smoke trailing out the window. "Can you please inform the rest of the palace to expect Princess Luna's return shortly?"\n\nRaven did not even blink. "Of course, Princess, though her returning to Canterlot is likely to interfere with the schedule of her efforts involving the referendum. Is there something wrong?"\n\nThe alicorn sighed, using her magic to sort the remaining papers on her desk into a neat stack and putting them off to the side. "As a matter of fact, Raven, there is," she said, allowing her voice to betray her weariness. "There have been many concerning reports from all over Equestria coming in ever since my sister announced her campaign. Weapons shipments going missing, ponies becoming unusually hostile, and isolated thestral communities becoming increasingly reclusive. Flash Magnus even notified me that the Royal Guard had found groups of cultists loyal to Nightmare Moon."\n\n"Do you believe that-"\n\n"No," Celestia answered firmly, already finishing Raven's unspoken question. "My sister would never. But I do believe there are dark forces at play here that neither of us can be blind against. I had hoped that Luna would be able to do this alone, but it is too dangerous now. We must rethink things before Equestria falls apart completely."\n\nRaven Inkwell bowed her head silently. "I will notify the staff at once, Princess," she stated, turning to leave Celestia alone in her office.\n\nOnly when the door closed did the Princess lower her head, another sigh coming from her tired muzzle."

 equestria.72.t:0 "Confrontation"
 equestria.72.d:0 "Celestia watched as Luna silently absorbed everything she had just told her in the last ten minutes, her eyes a conflicted mix of anger and sadness. "I see you are right, sister," she finally said, her voice a steady melancholy. "This is too serious to ignore. I only wish you had brought this to my attention sooner."\n\n"I didn't want to believe that this was all true myself, or that it was not as serious as this," the diarch replied, tone just as sober as her sibling's. "I didn't want to intervene in your campaign, especially so close to the referendum. But this... we both see how dangerous it is to continue. Tomorrow, we will announce together that the referendum will be delayed until we can ensure Equestria's safety."\n\n"Sister..." Luna looked away from the elder alicorn, her eyes starting to water. "These past few weeks... I have not been attending to my duties in the dream realm as I should have. And if everything we fear turns to be true, then that would explain much about my recent sleep." She took a step forward, looking back upwards into Celestia's eyes with thinly-veiled desperation. "Sister, I know the Nightmare is at work here. I can sense the darkness pulling while I am too busy to fight it. Is this my fault? Am I once again to blame for Equestria's ills?"\n\nEquestria's diarch quickly pulled her sister into an embrace, hooves wrapped tightly around the Lunar Princess. "I swore the night you returned that I would never lose you again, Luna," she said, her own tears starting to flow down her face. "This is not your fault. And together, we will fix this."\n\n"...Together, sister."\n\n\n\nA single guard quietly excused himself from the room, his pace quickening as soon as he was out of sight. The cover had been blown. It was time to enact the plan."

Or maybe it was all hearsay, spawning from mere speculation and fantasy by resentful old stallions. Either way, words spread like wildfire on dry timber in the span of only a few short hours, until it seemed that almost everypony in the city knew at least some variation of what was said to be happening within the palace.\n\nCelestia had lashed out at her sister for her integration campaign.\n\nThe referendum was being canceled, and the entire notion of thestrals being a true fourth tribe was shelved.\n\nPrincess Luna was being locked away in her castle, held captive by her own sister.\n\nMany ponies disregarded what they heard as mere falsehoods. Lies in a feeble attempt to slander the Princess and get a reaction. But for just as many citizens of Canterlot, it only confirmed their worst fears. This was what their nightmares had warned them of, their uncaring and distant monarch taking away everything they had worked for in the name of stability. If their dreams were to live, they had to free Luna from her chains by any means necessary.\n\nAnd so together they gathered, fire in their hearts, with all four tribes standing together to march upon the Royal Palace in protest. And they would not give in, not until their Princess was free once more."

 equestria.74.t:0 "Flashpoint"
 equestria.74.d:0 ""News from inside, captain." Flash Magnus turned to face the private, who gave him a salute before continuing. "Both Princesses are busy with important business within the palace. It's likely they won't be available to defuse the situation for at least another half hour."\n\n"I doubt the crowd will take that for an answer," Flash responded, venting his frustration out on the floor with a stomp of his hoof before pointing to the mob outside the palace gates. "Those ponies aren't going away until they see Princess Luna, and they're getting more restless by the minute. Things could get ugly if we can't get the situation under control!"\n\nJust two positions away from the captain, a lone guard stood at his post passively watching the protesters at the gates. He had already gotten his orders hours ago, well before any of this had began. This would be his last assignment in Canterlot. He readied his rifle, waiting for the signal.\n\nThe gates opened.\n\nThe crowd, after a moment of hesitation, surged forward upon the castle ignoring all orders from the guards to stop. One watched a thestral emerge from the gate control, offering a distant salute before flying off into the darkness of night. The guard nodded and raised his rifle, aiming into the crowd of ponies approaching the palace proper. He heard vaguely the sound of Flash Magnus yelling to stand down, of other Royal Guards asking what he was doing, all irrelevant to the task at hand.\n\nHe fired, raised the service revolver from within his uniform up to his own head, and within seconds the traitor was dead.\n\nFlash Magnus could barely hear the screams of the ponies below, nor did he look at the injured thestral bleeding out on the street surrounded by their kin. Instead he focused at the night sky, which grew cold and distant. The thestrals seemed to sense it too, looking up with expressions of dread and fear. The very moon and stars themselves seemed to grow malevolent as a magical shockwave emanated from within the palace, causing all to fall silent.\n\nFlash's eyes widened. There was only one thing that could have happened."
 equestria.74.a:0 "Oh no..."
 equestria.75.t:0 "The Return of the Nightmare"
 equestria.75.d:0 "The palace was in total chaos. With all the day shift staff already gone, the much more limited night staff were scrambling to deal with the chaos outside. Aides and bureaucrats rushed through the halls as Celestia followed her sister towards the front gates, an expression of concern firmly on her face. "Are you sure you want to do this, Luna?" she asked delicately. "Tonight has already been very difficult for the both of us, and I'm sure Captain Flash Magnus has the situation under control."\n\n"Sister, the ponies call out for me," the Princess of the Night responded, continuing her trot onward. "I still have a chance to fix things. I can still play my part, I can still-"\n\nBoth alicorns froze as two gunshots rang out from in front of them. Then, the screams. They echoed through the halls, the sounds of ponies in shock, anger, sadness. Luna's legs trembled as shadows and darkness pulled at her, faint wisps of magic twirling around the alicorn. Celestia realized instantly what it meant; she rushed forward, embracing her fellow diarch even as she grew taller and her coat darkened. "Please... don't go," the princess whispered, tears already falling. "I'm sorry you had to pay for my mistakes. I love you, Luna."\n\nLuna - Nightmare Moon hesitated for a moment. Stiffly yet gently, she returned the hug with a single foreleg. "We love you too, sister," came the archaic response in a far deeper tone, "but it is far too late for both of us."\n\nThe resulting magical shockwave blew Celestia backwards, forcing her tumbling to the ground down the hallway as her tiara clattered next to her hooves. By the time she looked up her sister was already gone, the ringing shots of more gunfire echoing outside as thestrals and their Princess made their escape from Canterlot. Guards surrounded their fallen diarch, asking what had happened or if she was harmed. Celestia remained silent, tearfully staring out a window where the full moon was in sight.\n\nShe remembered the Castle of the Two Sisters over a thousand years ago, when that same moon has eclipsed the sun. Celestia had told her sister that she would not fight her. That it was her duty to lower it.\n\nShe had lied twice that night.\n\n"It was never your fault," Celestia sobbed."

 equestria.76.d:0 "The sun was slowly rising over Manehattan as the Nightmare and her entourage finally reached the outskirts of the city, columns of smoke still drifting upwards from deep within the metropolis. Ponies bowed as she flew by, but the Nightmare paid them no heed as they pressed onward for the city hall. "Empress, if I may..." the thestral closest to her started, "why did we not finish the Sun Tyrant off in Canterlot? Surely you could have defeated her easily with the palace being caught so off-guard-"\n\n"My motives and methods are none of your concern," Nightmare Moon snapped back. "And unless you wish to join my sister's lackies, you will remain silent." The thestral quickly nodded and fell back, away from the Empress and her ire.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the center of Manehattan, thing had started to settle down. The gunfire had gone from a constant ring to a rare crack echoing through the city. As Nightmare Moon landed in the square in front of city hall, she saw a small group of ponies approach, all in Chiropterran uniforms. "My Empress, what a glorious night it is to see you in the mortal realm," a unicorn said, stepping forward in front of the rest. "Eastern Equestria is yours, and we are ready to march upon Canterlot and the west upon your command. We have also captured the Element Bearer of Generosity, as per orders."\n\nNightmare Moon regarded the unconscious white mare that was dragged before her. Her coat was stained with soot and blood, though it did not seem to be her own. "Keep her someplace secure but ensure she is taken care of," the alicorn said, her voice giving no emotion. "The bearers are just as dangerous as the Elements themselves, but killing them serves no purpose. Assemble in the hall for my orders." The ponies bowed their heads and hurried away, the two holding Rarity dragging her back into the streets of Manehattan.\n\nThe Nightmare turned to watch the sun as it continued its ascent over the harbor in the distance. It had been a moment of weakness, nothing more. A false display of sympathy brought on by a weaker form. She had no place for love when only one princess could rule Equestria. But Nightmare Moon still remembered her sister's wings wrapped around her, her desperate pleas to stay with her. And for a brief moment, perhaps she did wish that there was another way.\n\n"There is no going back," she said quietly to herself. Nightmare Moon turned away from the rising sun. There would be no more weakness.\n\nShe had a war to win."

 equestria.77.d1:0 "Equestria has fallen.\n\nIn the west, Equestria stands in chaos as Canterlot reels from Luna's fall. As the truth is slowly revealed about the true motives behind the thestral integration movement and its troubles, many ponies now question what place the fourth tribe has in Equestrian society, even as Equestria itself is under attack. In the palace itself, whatever staff have remained loyal scramble to muster a response and mobilize Equestria against the new threat, even while the Princess locks herself away behind closed doors.\n\nIn the east, harmony has been replaced with the rule of the Nightmare, who has arrived in Manehattan to lead her armies against her sister. With the help of the Chiropterrans, who have finally come out of the shadows to wage their war over a thousand years in the making, thousands of ponies have armed themselves to overthrow the Sun Princess and the west, marching on Canterlot, Bales, Whinnyapolis and beyond. Despite the early springing of their plot keeping them at a disadvantage, many expect that Equestria will fall quickly against the might of the newly-proclaimed Lunar Empire.\n\nAs the lines are drawn in the dirt, brother goes against brother and Equestria, once the land of friendship and harmony, finds itself split in twain. Nopony knows who will be left standing when the dust settles, but only one thing is for certain; Equestria will never be the same."

"And because they're our best customers."\n\nShe rubbed a hoof against her forehead. "Well, I believe that part," she muttered. "Fine, if the Princesses trust you, then I guess I'll trust you too. But if I hear a single thing come from you two," she continued, pointing a hoof right up in each of their faces, "anything like your old tricks, and I'll make sure the both of you are sent right back to Las Pegasus."\n\nFlim and Flam gave mock bows. "My esteemed colleague, we can assure you that you will not hear a single word of criticism towards us or our work here. For that, you have the Flim-Flam Brothers Guarantee!" Flam turned around to rummage through one of the many drawers behind his desk before pulling out a bottle and offering it to Applejack. "Care for a cider?

Prince Blueblood (my coworker, don't ask) and I are working day and night now to get things under control after Princess Luna became Nightmare Moon again (and don't ask Vice Principal Luna anything about this, I don't think she would appreciate it). Twilight (not you, the Princess Twilight over here) is just trying to keep Equestria from falling apart even more, and whenever I see her she looks even more exhausted then you do whenever you spend an all-nighter making something for the school science fair!\n\nBy the way, how are things going over there? Time works differently across the portal so I'm not entirely sure how long its been for all of you, but I think you girls are all still on break, right? I hope all of you can still enjoy the rest of your time off without me. I'll try to be back as soon as I can, once Equestria is safe and Princess Twilight doesn't need me here anymore. I also made sure to bring the picture Photo Finish took of us at the cornucopia, though I keep it hidden away from everypony else. It would be a bit weird explaining why I have a picture of all of Princess Twilight's friends here.\n\nWell, that's all I've got for now. Make sure to write back to me soon! I want to hear everything going on, especially if any more Equestrian magic gets loose again. (And no, Rainbow Dash, I will not help you cheat on your homework by just giving you the answers.

Everything had happened so fast; Luna's thestral integration campaign had seemed to be going so well, and then the Nightmare struck, half of Equestria went dark, and the first reports of violence began trickling in from the new frontlines. War had been unthinkable for centuries, and the mere thought of pony killing pony... well, Twilight didn't want to think about it at all.\n\nLooking around, she was able to recognize quite a few ponies at the table. Prince Blueblood and Fancy Pants, both looking completely exhausted. Raven Inkwell, fiercely scribbling down notes on a sheet of paper as if it could be the difference between life and death. And all of her friends, all her fellow Element Bearers... with the exception of one. "Where's Rarity?" Twilight asked. "She's coming, right?"\n\n"I was just getting to that, Princess Twilight," Blueblood said, his voice as ragged as his appearence. "The Nightmare has caught us at a severe disadvantage, as it is clear they have been preparing for this for much longer than we have. It will take time to get Equestria in a state where we can push back, time we do not have. And as for the Element of Harmony, Miss Rarity..." The Prince trailed off for a moment. "...she has been captured by the Nightmare in Manehattan."\n\nTwilight and her friends all gasped in shock and horror, but Blueblood quickly put his hooves up to quiet them. "Rarity is fine," he continued, instantly calming the room down. "We know she is being safely held prisoner, and that does not seem like it will change soon. However, it does mean that you all will be unable to use your Elements of Harmony. The only way to end this war will be by force of arms, regrettable as it may be."\n\n"Wait, where's Princess Celestia?" Everypony looked towards Fluttershy, who seemed to sink a bit further into her chair. "Shouldn't she, um, be here to hear all this?"\n\nTwilight and Blueblood shared an uncomfortable glance. They both knew where she was; it was hard not to every time they walked past her chambers and heard the broken sobs coming from inside it. But all they ever saw was the locked door and the two guards always standing at attention, though neither would ever look Princess Twilight in the eyes.

This has finally boiled over, as harmonists loyal to Celestia have regrouped in Stableside under the leadership of Daring Do, the previously assumed fictional character of A.K. Yearling's books.

 equestria_civwar.12.d:0 "Dead silence.\n\nThat was the only thing ever heard in this wing of the castle. The crying had stopped long ago, the closed door now betraying nothing. The Princess still ate; the palace staff continue to deliver and take her meals even during war. She still slept as well; the Night Guard would whisper of the Princess crying out again during the darkest hours, begging for her sister to come back. But nopony still saw anything of her. The sun still shone with light, but it provided no warmth.\n\nThe guards stationed at the door looked at each other nervously. They were both new transfers to the castle, since all the Royal Guard with any real experience were sent off to the frontlines. At one point, they would have considering being the personal guard to Celestia a dream come true; instead, their nightmares had become manifest. Nopony knew what to expect anymore.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nBoth guards flinched, watching as Princess Celestia strode out into the hallway. She looked at one pony, then the other. "Where is Princess Twilight?" she asked, her voice still warm and empathetic. The Princess was impeccably dressed in her regalia, looking exactly like she had before she had locked herself away. If one saw her from a distance, they could not be blamed for seeing nothing wrong.\n\nBut her eyes betrayed her.\n\nThey were cold and empty. The warmth and comfort they provided were long gone, replaced by void. "S-she's in the War Room with Prince Blueblood and Sunset Shimmer, Princess," one guard was able to respond, stuttering.\n\nCelestia nodded her head. "Thank you." Then, without a word, she trotted off down the hallway after closing the door behind her. The two guards looked at each other, both unsure of what had just transpired.\n\n"Well, at least the Princess is finally back," one finally said, trying to ease the mood.\n\nThe other guard shook his head."

Give up our biggest cities without a fight?"\n\n"We do not have a choice," Blueblood responded coolly, a sharp contrast to his colleague's aggression. "It is obvious that we will be unable to hold central Equestria, and what you are suggesting is lying to the ponies that live there. A quick victory against the Nightmare is impossible, so we must pull back and wear her down before striking back."\n\n"Blueblood has a point, Sunset," Princess Twilight said, attempting to defuse the argument. "Both of us ran the numbers together, and it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to hold back Nightmare Moon forever-"\n\n"Forget about the numbers! There's more to this than just words in a book, Twilight! I can stop the Nightmare if you give me time, but instead you want us to run away with our tails between our legs like-"\n\n"Enough!" All three ponies flinched and looked towards the open doorway. Princess Celestia stood there, observing all of them with her cold eyes.

"If they want to fight, we should let them just like we would anyone else. Weren't you the one saying we needed more ponies to push the Nightmare back?"\n\n"Not at the expense of the effectiveness of our soldiers," Blueblood responded, a bit too dismissively for Celestia's liking. "As regrettable as it is, ponies do not trust the thestrals. We can not have soldiers busy having to look over their own soldiers, or civilians doubting in the ponies protecting them. We can let them fight, but in groups specific to their unique skillset."\n\n"There is a third option."\n\nBoth Blueblood and Sunset looked towards Princess Celestia in confusion. "Princess?" the former responded carefully. "What would you propose?"\n\nThe alicorn levitated a folder onto the table, letting it fall between the three of them. "Somepony brought this to my attention a few days ago. It calls for the total separation of the remaining thestrals in Equestria from ponykind until the end of the war, to ensure the safety of the war effort and the country."\n\nSilence.

You're going to ruin everything for what, just to feel safe?

Sunset flinched and cowered behind the table, ears pinned behind her head. "That is enough," the Princess said, her voice hard. "Both of you are dismissed."\n\nBlueblood bowed and quickly left, not looking her aunt in the eye. Sunset quickly followed, looking more like a scolded dog than a field marshal. As soon as the door closed behind them, Celestia took a deep breath and looked back down at the folder on the table.

It had already felt like an eternity since the battle; her sister, out of desperation personally leading the last group of Lunar remnants against her. And with Rarity nowhere to be found, she had been forced to...\n\nTwilight and her friends had found her after it was done, sobbing on a floor still stained with blood and magical flame. She still remembered what had happened over a thousand years ago, when Luna had fallen the first time at her hoof. The millennium that had followed was hard and painful, but she had endured in the hope she would see her sister again. And when she had finally returned, Celestia had promised herself to cherish every moment she had with her sister, and to never again lose her to darkness. To never fail her in her time of need.\n\nLess than a decade later, and she had broken that promise.\n\nThe despair, the void of knowing the thousand year wait that lay ahead her tore at her, threatened to consume her. But there was also a spark. A flame, born not of hope or fear, but hate. Hatred of the ponies who had taken her sister. Hatred of those who had fought and killed for her, knowing what she had become. And hatred of any enemy of Equestria, who saw nothing but opportunity in her loss.\n\nThe hatred burned brightly, threatening to overtake her mind..."

The only other ponies present were her ever-faithful royal guard, standing at attention unmoving. Her sister's throne remained empty next to her, cold and lifeless. Celestia had refused any requests to have it removed; it was a painful reminder, but one she was determined to endure. One she had to.\n\nIt was similar to ruling Equestria in many ways. A heavy burden, one with hardship and struggle that many ponies couldn't understand. To smile, wave and lead, to build Equestria anew waiting for a sister forgotten, the mistakes of the past eternally weighing heavy on every choice she made. How had things gone so wrong again? How did she lose Luna so soon?\n\nThe blame rested solely on her. She had grown too complacent, too trusting, too lax. Memories rushed through Celestia's mind again. Watching Sunset Shimmer leave the castle for the last time as her student, unable to save her from her own ambition. The Severyanian ponies, forced to rebel after years of oppression. Her laying powerless at the hooves of Chrysalis as she threatened Canterlot itself. And finally Luna, looking at her with hope and determination as she spoke of the thestrals, falling victim to a failing Celestia had never fixed. How could she have been so blind?\n\nCelestia had always believed that she had time. She was immortal, after all. She could wait for change, for heroes to rise, for ponies to become better and see the error of their own ways. But how many had suffered from waiting? How many ponies had died in a war of her own making? It could not go on any longer.\n\nFire burned in the alicorn's eyes. So much still needed to be done. Nightmare Moon had broken Equestria in far more than two, and Equestria was far from out of danger. But she would see it all done. She would have a perfect Equestria, atone for her mistakes, no matter the cost. She would earn the forgiveness of her sister. And if anypony, or anycreature dared to stand in her way...\n\n...they would step aside, or be broken before her."

Celestia regarded them with a cold expression; she never did have an affection for much of the Canterlot elite. The fact that she recognized very few of them would make what was to come all the more easier for her.\n\n"It has been brought to my attention," she began, demanding the eyes of everypony present, "that there are some within Canterlot who secretly aided my sister during the civil war. Treason is one of the highest crimes within Equestria, and I am certain at least one of you is guilty of it. I will provide one chance for any of you to come forward and confess of your own accord."\n\nNot a single pony moved a muscle. They all stared up at the Princess, who's face betrayed no emotion. Finally a single unicorn stepped forward, head low as he refused to meet the alicorn's gaze. Celestia waited.\n\n"I aided the Nightmare," he began, eyes never leaving the ground and his head positioned in a permanent bow. "I offered shelter, food and supplies to her soldiers throughout the war. My family lives in Manehattan, I thought if I could prove my loyalty to her, I could keep them safe-"\n\n"Enough." The stallion cowered further as Celestia motioned for one of her guards to escort him out of the room. His head hung and his tail remained between his hind legs as the doors closed again behind him, the remaining ponies quietly whispering to each other. "Anypony else?"\n\nNothing. "Very well. Your properties and wealth in Canterlot is to be immediately seized by the Crown, and all of you are henceforth permanently forbidden from taking any official office of Equestria." Ponies gasped, opened their mouths to argue, but were silenced by the withering glare their monarch gave them. "I am already aware that every single one of you is guilty of treason. Only one of you had the courage and honesty to admit so, qualities the rest of you sorely lack. As such, you all no longer deserve any privileges that your wealth and names have granted to you."\n\n"Equestria has no need for ponies who can not live up to the ideals of Harmony.""

Yes, of course, she thought, chiding her internal hesitation. "That sounds wonderful, Luna. We were meant to rule together. Did you have something in mind?"\n\nLuna nodded, her throat catching "The Thestrals... it isn't right, 'Tia! Equestria doesn't just have three tribes. Thestrals shouldn't be shunned, but welcomed as the fourth tribe!" Celestia raised her hoof to object but Luna continued: "I know they don't even want to be 'Equestrian', especially with all the unpleasantness after, well...you know. But... they were my little ponies, and I failed them." Her voice dropped to a whisper "I failed them, Celestia. I need to make it right. Equestria should be a friendly home to everypony."\n\nOf course it would be this, Celestia thought. The bat ponies had hardly been willing to join the Three Tribes after their Princess was banished to the moon, and even after Luna's return they were suspicious.\n\nBut the bat ponies weren't the real problem. It was the Equestrians. A small horse is easy prey at night, and something about the night loving bats seemed to instil fear and mistrust even amongst many. When Nightmare Moon rose, terrified ponies attacked bat ponies and drove them into the mountains. Ancient prejudices still lingered."

Why don't the other ponies want to be our friends? Why is Luna helping us?"\n\nDusk Horizons sighed. "Over 1000 years ago, Luna was our Princess. She lived at night as we do and made the night wonderful. She loved us, and we loved her. But we didn't tell her. We complained about the other ponies instead, about how mean they were. They didn't like our night, or our bat wings. And Luna grew lonely and sad. Because we failed her, she transformed into Nightmare Moon for a long time, becoming angry and evil. The ponies got very scared of the night after that and chased us into the mountains, where we have stayed ever since."\n\nNight Blossom's face scrunched up, considering this. "We should help Luna then! I wanna go see the Princess!" She continued to bounce and squeak at the notion, making short, gliding hops. Soon, Dusk thought, she would be able to properly fly at night.\n\nThe door opened, and a sombre looking bat pony entered.

She winked conspiratorially. "I, on the other hoof, have always been a terrible actor."\n\nLuna laughed. In 1000 years, Celestia hadn't changed a bit. As befitted the eternal Sun, Luna thought. Luna thanked Celestia and left - the world of dreams called once more.\n\nMeanwhile, in a tiny apartment on Manehattan's outskirts, Misty Night sat, glumly cradling her rifle. Princess Luna had triumphed. Her help was not needed. But, she was prepared to wait. One day, Luna would need her once again.\n\nOne day, Nightmare Moon would return. And the Disciples of Nightmare Moon would be ready."
 equestria.220.d_2:0 "Silent and Dusk sat enjoying the evening air in Manehattan Central Park. Their daughter Night Blossom squeaked as she flew, eagerly seeking her foal pegasi friends in their aerial game of hide and seek. Eventually they would realise that her hypersensitive hearing gave away their locations even as she covered her eyes and counted to thirty, but until then she was enjoying her reign as Princess of Hide and Seek.\n\nThe real Princess stood at the other end of the park, addressing a crowd. Impeccably dressed and standing tall, she was no longer the mare who stammered her way through a press conference. "...and as we stand here today to celebrate a dream realised, we also mourn the injuries from the attack." The park quieted, and Luna bowed, ceding the stage to Flowing Current, leader of the newly formed Thestral Reintegration Initiative. Luna headed backstage.\n\nThere a white mare protested: "A little dramatic, don't you think? I may look like a roasted marshmallow, but it's not a funeral!" Luna felt a pang of guilt at Rarity's permanent scars and patchy mane, and let it pass, neither wallowing in it nor supressing it. Rarity sensed Luna's mood. "There's nothing you could have done darling, and they always say that limitations bring out the best in an artist!" she leaned and whispered conspiratorially "Besides, I'm quite enjoying all this attention as 'the heroes of Equestria'."\n\nLuna smiled, not believing a word. Rarity was generous as always.

It broke open, rifles and ammunition clattering across the floor. "These are stolen weapons, found with Nightmare Moon cultists. Even now, they prepare for her return!" she shouted. "And they used royal codes to get them! OUR codes!"\n\nLuna gasped in shock. "Sister, I would never...!" Luna trailed off. Or would she? She recalled her recent restful sleep.\n\nCelestia's face hardened, even as it shone with tears. "Maybe not, but we cannot risk the return of Nightmare Moon. You will be detained until we can discover what has happened here."\n\nUnnoticed, a guard slipped away. Luna's dreams had prepared him for this possibility.

They would not fail her again.\n\nFrom coast to coast, major cities swelled with crowds never before witnessed in Equestrian history, as bat ponies marched in protest, chanting, blocking government offices, and screeching in anger. A year ago, ponies would have looked on, fearfully. And some still did. But many stepped out, marching in solidarity.\n\nIn Canterlot, large crowds grew at the Canterlot Palace gates, as guards nervously looked on."

He just wanted the protest to end. The noise, the crowd, the yelling. It reminded him of a past he wished he could forget. Changelings streaming into the Palace. Luna and Celestia captured. Grinning faces wrapping him, cacooning him, as he writhed, unable to escape. Yet the nightmares would not end.\n\nHe started as the gates unexpectedly groaned open. The crowd, surprised but enthused, flooded into the Royal Palace, towards the throne room.\n\nNo! It was happening again. The Royal Palace was under attack! He hastily fired a panicked warning shot towards the crowd with his rifle, which then retreated, screaming in fear.\n\nA bat pony lied on the ground, bleeding.\n\nWithin hours, the news had spread like wildfire on the radio. An innocent protester had been shot in cold blood by a Royal Guard, who were meant to protect Equestria. Even with their ancient prejudices, many ponies knew. They knew this was not Harmony. This was not Friendship. And across Equestria, they poured onto the streets, marching united against barbarity."

I can't bear to cause any more suffering."\n\nTwilight nodded "It's not your fault. We will assemble the Elements, draw Nightmare Moon out, and drive her from your mind once and for all. Everything can go back to normal."\n\nThen the sound of a gunshot followed by screaming carried from the outside.\n\nTwilight and Celestia froze in horror, as Luna began to tremble "What have I done? WHAT HAVE I DONE?!" She lunged towards Celestia, pleading. "PLEASE! HELP ME! HELP MEEE!"\n\nCelestia backed away, overwhelmed. She had failed Luna. Again.\n\nLuna's sobs became wracking coughs, and then she began to laugh. And laugh. She grew, swirling with energy as her pupils narrowed and coat blackened.\n\nNightmare Moon. With a blast of her horn she blew open the back wall, and took flight, fleeing the castle.\n\nOutside, the crowd cheered. Luna was free!

A millennium ago, I committed a great wrong, and was banished to the Moon by Celestia, who worked to return and restore my old self. In doing so, she saved me, and I owe her a great debt.\n\n"It is with great sadness, that I must now repay this debt. Celestia, frightened of bat ponies and imagined threats, has gone mad. She imprisoned me and ordered a Royal Guard to shoot into the protesting crowd at the Palace. No longer the kindly sister I once knew, she has become Daybreaker, a cruel monster of flame and rage.\n\n"From Manehattan, I work to defeat my sister and end her madness, just as she did for me so long ago.

Transforming into Nightmare Moon, a distraught Luna escaped the palace and fled to Manehattan. Competing narratives fight across the airwaves.\n\n'Luna' claims Celestia has gone mad, transforming into a mare of flame and massacring bat ponies.\n\nCelestia claims that Nightmare Moon has returned, and claims the death of a protester was a terrible accident.\n\nBoth sides call loyal ponies to fight for the good of Equestria.

A week ago, an anonymous letter had instructing him that a terrible tragedy would occur and he would be needed at the power station, but he hadn't believed it.\n\nHe, the great organiser, was now in the wrong place at the wrong time. He launched into the air, racing across the city for the power station. In the streets below, gunfire rang out. Now they were making a grab for Manehattan! He pushed, his wings aching as he pulled in to land at the station entrance.\n\nFlashing his ID to a bewildered security guard, he sprinted for the boiler room. The Princess of the Night needed every advantage she could get.\n\n In front of him stood an emergency trip. With a station this large, it would take hours to properly restart. With luck, power fluctuations would trip other stations too.\n\nFlowing Current took a deep breath. Some would call this treason. But true justice required doing what was right, no matter what others thought.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and whispered a silent prayer "Please, let the Night rule.

And indeed, suddenly the moon seemed to ripple, and deep within her soul, she felt its call. Nightmare Moon had awakened. It was time.\n\nShe frowned... but the lights still blazed. She chided herself. She must be patient. She begin to pray. "Nightmare Moon, Princess of Night, Princess of Dreams, please bless me, your faithful Disciple, in what I am about to do". A minute passed. The crack of gunfire rang outside. Still Misty waited.\n\nThen the lights winked out, and the city was plunged into darkness.\n\nShe grinned, looking around the room.

The crowd scattered, bat ponies taking to the skies in panic, screeching. The moon's light faded.\n\nSilent collapsed in shock. If Luna had died, the bat ponies would be sure to follow.\n\nBut then then moon began to glow. Not a calm white, but a deep, blood, red of rage and sadness. It shimmered, and Silent felt the call deep within. Luna was alive. And she needed their help. He rallied his volunteers. Many cried even as they obeyed, their dreams of peace shattered. One asked "But what if it's... Nightmare Moon?".\n\nThe others nodded, hesitating.\n\nSilent himself barely held back tears. He needed to stop this kind of talk immediately. He grabbed the pony by the collar, shouting "It doesn't matter! If it's Luna, we help our Princess! If it's... Nightmare Moon, Equestria will try to imprison or expel every single bat pony! Do you think they would just forgive us?"\n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper, trembling "Do you understand? It doesn't matter." He looked at each of them in turn.

 #CELESTIA+LUNA Reform Adventures - No Civil War events here
 equestria.214.t:0 "The Shadow Market"
 equestria.214.d:0 "During their centuries largely outside outside Equestrian Society, the bat ponies developed their own, parallel society and even economy. Being in many areas unburdened by taxes or Equestrian laws, this economy has established itself in many places across Equestria, allowing them to make sure that any bits they earn remains within bat pony society. Even the wages paid by those thestrals who worked as unregistered labourers in Equestrian industries or farms go into this shadow economy and stay there, and over time entire industries, though small scale, have grown up here. This has become a drain on the Equestrian economy as many of the three tribes have taken to spending their money there instead as well.\n\nMany thestrals take pride in their self-sufficiency, and resent the notion of having to bow to the obligations of the society they never were part of. This sentiment is echoed by several industrialists, who have tied themselves in knots trying argue for the preservation the system without saying outright that they want to be able to get away with not paying proper wages to their workers.\n\nIf the thestrals are to be integrated, this shadow market must be addressed, but the question is how."
 equestria.214.a:0 "Reintegrate them fully, but make sure to help them on the way."

 equestria.215.t:0 "Anti-Thestral Sentiments"
 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst bat ponies have traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they live apart from the citizens of other races in their own communities.\n\nBut many citizens want it to remain this way. They think that bat ponies do not need to be integrated into society and brought out of isolation. Some are afraid of possible side effects such as a disruption of societal Harmony, others fear the rumoured Nightmare Moon cultists among the ranks of the bat ponies, and a few think they have no place among the other three races of Equestria, seeing them as complete outsiders. To them, it's as if Celestia was suggesting griffons to be welcomed as a Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared an initiative to promote the integration. Groups of bat ponies would be invited to tour across Equestria, so the common citizens could see them with their own eyes. EEA syllabi would be rewritten to teach about bat ponies and their history. False rumours about cultists would be dispelled by official media. Pamphlets and posters would be distributed, showing photographs of smiling thestrals with the words "THESE BAT PONIES ARE OUR FRIENDS".\n\nHowever, if taken too far, pushing this pro-bat pony information can easily be considered propaganda or an attempt at forcibly changing ponies' minds about the matter."

 equestria.216.d:0 "Ponies may be skeptical, but the same is true for the thestrals themselves. Many of them don't trust the other Equestrians and only support the integration because Princess Luna is advocating for it. They simply want to be left alone, instead of trying to befriend other ponies.\n\nFortunately, nowhere is more equipped to handle this problem than the land of Friendship. As Princess of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle has drawn up a campaign plan that stretches down the hallway.\n\nThe plan is as inspired and diverse as it is complex and expensive - the Elements of Harmony visiting isolated thestral communities in jungles and mountains; Friendship clubs; inviting thestral students to the School of Friendship; Dusk Festivals where both bat ponies and other ponies would celebrate together; Celestia and Luna meeting with bat pony leaders; and the list goes on..."

She passed offices where bat pony bureaucrats worked through the night, continuing the shifts from their daytime counterparts. Manehattan was often called "The city that never sleeps". Well it had become true here in Canterlot, too.\n\nAcross the nation, thestrals ventured into cities in greater numbers, attracted by employment opportunities and a new attitude of tolerance. The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but the Equestrian public was now ready to accept bat ponies as the Fourth Tribe, standing ready to protect their new friends from harm.\n\n"It's wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real. A thousand years in exile, all because she'd been too proud to ask for help!\n\nCelestia hugged Luna as the blue mare sobbed, cradling Luna in her wings. She would never let Luna down again."
 equestria.218.d_2:0 "Luna stood on a balcony, staring sadly into the night sky. She thought she saw a movement in the darkness - the flap of thestral wings perhaps? It was not uncommon to see them these days. Luna's reverie was interrupted as Celestia joined her, apparently content to stand silently.\n\nLuna spoke first "Celestia. Did we do enough? Many still have not accepted this change. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for over a millenium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even. But change will come, and one day, we will heal the scars of history."\n\nLuna nodded, holding back her disappointment. As always, her sister bore the hard-won wisdom of centuries. The foolish dreams and fancies of the night must always melt away before the illumination of the sun."

These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor's call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters' heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

equestria.173.d:0 "The small train station in Ponyville rarely had many ponies standing on the platform, but today it was more crowded than ever. Almost a hundred ponies had gathered there, half of them with heavy bags filled with food, tools and other supplies. Those would be necessary, for they were heading on a long journey, from which they may not return. The colourful Friendship Express whistled, signalling that it would soon depart. The mood was solemn and mournful; ponies were embracing each other, bidding farewell and crying.\n\nThey were going to war.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, was there as well, as were her friends, the Elements of Harmony: Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. The last three had saddlebags and were preparing to depart.\n"Well, I guess it's time to say good bye," Rainbow Dash said, breaking the silence. "The train's about to go."\nTwilight sighed deeply. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I respect your bravery and your choice to face Chrysalis' army. But I'm worried. This is not like the other threats we've faced. This time, a small band of heroes can't save Equestria. And I want you to remember that. Don't try to be heroes. Stay safe, and don't take unnecessary risks. We all want you to return in one piece."\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yes Twilight, you've said that a dozen times. Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll buck the changelings back across the border and be back home before Hearth's Warming Eve."\n"But she's right, Rainbow," Fluttershy meekly said. "You need to be careful. War is... terrifying and dangerous."\n"I'll make sure Rainbow doesn't get herself killed," Applejack said and grinned. "Dont'cha fear."\n"And I don't even plan on fighting," Pinkie said cheerily. "I will provide moral support! Cakes and parties will make even the most grim soldier happy. And maybe I can convince the changelings that war isn't as fun as partying!"\nTwilight smiled. "Alright. I trust you will be okay. We'll miss you."\nThe train whistled again.\n"Oh, wait!" Rarity exclaimed. "I still have gifts to give!" She levitated clothing and blankets from her bags and gave them to the three departing friends. "I made fabulous uniforms and cozy blankets to keep you warm."\nThey thanked her and put the gifts in their bags. "Well, we really gotta go now," Rainbow said. "Hugs?" Pinkie asked.\nThe six ponies smiled and embraced each other with their wings and forelegs. "We'll be waiting for you," Twilight whispered, and a tear flowed down her cheek."

Now he was back in Ponyville once more, worried about the burden the Great War had placed on the Princess. He entered the Castle of Friendship, whose hallways were empty. He headed to the library and his guess was proven correct: Twilight was there, absorbed in work. She was surrounded by books and notes and was frantically writing.\n"Twilight?" He said, trying to get her attention. "I'm back from the Crystal Empire."\nShe snapped out of it and lifted her gaze from the papers. "Oh, Spike! Glad to see you. You came at a perfect time!" She levitated a scroll from her table into his claws. "Send this to Celestia. It's important."\nSpike lifted a scaly brow. "Uh, sure." He breathed shining green flame which consumed the scroll, making it magically appear in Canterlot. "What was the scroll about?"\n"A report on the research programs I've prepared for the magical experimentation departments in Bales, Stableside and Albion. They need her approval before the research can begin."\n"What are they studying?"\n"Weapons," she said casually and continued to work on her notes. "Crystal armaments, combat mage training, use of magic in industrial production. Anything that can help us win the war."\n"I see." Spike walked closer to Twilight and looked at all the paperwork. "You know, you seem to be doing a good job managing all this. You're not too stressed out."\n"Abyssinian coffee does wonders. But thanks, Spike."\n"You know, maybe you could use your organization skills and leadership for managing the frontline? With your clever head, I'm sure we'd win in a month."\nTwilight's quill stopped moving. She sighed. "I would rather not."\n"Why? Would be more effective than trying to invent some miracle weapon. It's always been thanks to your leadership that we've kicked the butts of all those villains before."\n"I-I don't want to have that responsibility now. It's not just six friends, it's millions of soldiers. A single mistake results in thousands of dead and wounded." She shut her eyes. "I don't want to bear that burden."\n"Twi, you know... one day you won't have a choice. Celestia and Luna won't be princesses forever."\n"I'm not ready yet. Just... not yet. Okay, Spike?"\nSpike sighed. "Alright, fine. Do you need any more help?"\nTwilight smiled. "Yes, actually. I'm happy you're here."

The soldier saluted her and she walked down the muddy trenches, navigating to the rear of the network. Near the underground barracks were a row of trucks, pony soldiers with clean uniforms jumping out of them. A thestral officer saw Applejack and greeted her. "Greetings, ma'am. We've come to patch up your ranks."\n"Good, sir. They've been gettin' more and more sparse. The changelin' night raids are hard as Tartarus to repel." The bat pony turned to his soldiers. "Atten-tion! Miss Applejack is here." They immediately went rigid, standing in a neat line. Applejack approached them and inspected them. "Youngins, I see. I hope they've gotten at least some trainin'," she mumbled. She stopped in front of a red earth pony stallion, her eyes widening. He was wearing Granny Smith's old helmet. "Big Mac? The heck are you doin' here?" she exclaimed. He remained characteristically silent for a moment. "I came here to make sure you're okay, ma'am." Applejack rolled her eyes. "So who's lookin' after the farm now?"\n"Sugar Belle. Don't worry, ma'am." She snorted. "Alrighty then. But don't expect me to treat you differently just because you're my brother."\n"Nope, ma'am."\nLater that evening, the changelings launched a probing raid against the trenches, which they thought were depleted in defenders. Applejack quickly rallied the reinforcements, Big Macintosh among them, to prevent a breakthrough. There was brutal close-quarters combat and she had to crack the exoskeletons of several changelings with her strong hind legs. Big Mac tried to help, which didn't please her much. "Guard our rear, soldier. It's too dangerous here."\n"Yup. Dangerous for you, too."\n"I'll be fine! Now go, it was an order!" As she was shouting, Big Mac looked behind her and saw a changeling lying in the mud raise her head, her pistol glinting in the crimson light of a setting sun. "What're you lookin' at? Get goin'!" Applejack barked. Big Mac pushed her aside into the trench wall, and there was a loud bang. He collapsed onto the ground.\n"Big Mac!" Applejack screamed, and saw the changeling with her smoking pistol. She let out a roar and leaped on her as she was trying to fly away with her broken wings, and began stomping her to death with her hooves. When the insectoid pony had stopped breathing, she rushed back to his brother who was already being treated by a medic. "I-Is he fine?" she asked.\n"Y-yup," Big Mac weakly responded. "Sorry for savin' your life."\nApplejack embraced him. "No, it's me who should be sayin' sorry."\n"Ma'am, his chest is bleeding. I'd appreciate if you'd leave the hugging for later," the medic said."

Now she was glad to finally be back in action, commanding an air wing and training new pilots when she had time. One day, when refueling at an air base and chatting with ponies of the local garrison, she learned that Pinkie Pie was stationed nearby. She decided to go for a visit, even if it was technically unauthorized absence. So what, she thought, she was an element of harmony.\nAfter asking various soldiers, she finally found the barracks where Pinkie was stationed. She imagined it was a real party house at this point, where Pinkie cheered up the soldiers after tough fights against the changelings. She was wrong. It seemed like an ordinary barracks, with all the bunk beds arrayed in neat order. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place, but then she saw a pink pony lying on a bed. She barely recognized her.\n"Pinkie?" she cautiously asked. The mare with a straight mane slowly turned to look at her, then her eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Rainbow Dash. Why are you here?" Rainbow was struck by how dour she sounded. The colours of her coat seemed muted as well. "Uh, I thought I'd come by for a visit, to see how you're doing. We haven't talked in a long time."\n"Oh yes. You lost your wing, didn't you?" Rainbow extended her prosthetic metal wing. "Yep. But this new one is pretty rad, so I don't mind. Hurt like Tartarus at first but I'm getting used to it."\n"That's good."\n"Pinkie, is everything alright? Why aren't you... acting like yourself?" Pinkie breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. "I'm fine."\n"I might've lost my wing, but I still have my eyes and I can see something is wrong. What happened?" Pinkie grimaced. "I guess I should tell you, even though I don't want to. A couple months ago I was holding a party for Maud's Rock Troopers. However, there were changeling infiltrators in the group, and they revealed themselves and started shooting." A concerned frown formed on Rainbow's face. "Oh no. And then what?"\nShe shrugged. "I did what I had to, out of fear and desperation. In the end, the changelings were dead, and the party was thoroughly pooped."\nIt was a typical Pinkie joke, but the delivery was so dry that even Rainbow wasn't amused. "That... sucks. I wish I could've been there to protect you."\n"I don't need that anymore. I fight with Maud on the front. I haven't been in the mood for happy things after the incident."\nRainbow was speechless. "Pinkie, I—"\n"I'm fine, like I said. Don't you worry. War isn't the place for laughter. But after it's over, everything will be fine again."\n"Promise? I wanna to see you smile and hear you laugh. We can do our old pranks, maybe that will make you feel better." A faint smile appeared on Pinkie's lips. "Sure, Dashie.""

But after months of designing dull military uniforms with drab colours and directing their production en masse, she was growing tired of it. Occasionally, when she had precious free time, she'd try to design a beautiful dress for her own enjoyment, but oftentimes even that wasn't as satisfying as it had been before the war. So now, when she had a day off, she needed another distraction from the stress of war-time production. She decided to visit her friend Fluttershy, who had recently come to Canterlot, and headed to her apartment near the underground magi-nuclear research facility, her mind full of questions.\n\nAs soon as the door of her home was opened, the stench of animals filled Rarity's nostrils. Fluttershy greeted her warmly, not minding the odour as usual. "Oh, hi Rarity, good to see you! I hope you don't mind that I brought some friends along from Ponyville." A bear was sitting on the living room sofa.\n"Uhm, no, not at all darling! Now, prepare some hot water. I'd like to drink tea and have a pleasant chat. We haven't seen in so long, goodness gracious!"\nA toucan and a ferret prepared two cups of steaming tea. Fluttershy thanked the animals and they replied with cheery sounds.\n"So, Fluttershy, first of all: What in Celestia's name are you doing in a magi-nuclear research facility?"\n"Oh, erm, I know it seems strange, but as the Element of Kindness, I was asked to give ethical oversight to the development of magi-nuclear weapons. I accepted, because I think it's important they're developed, and are then used right."\nRarity raised an eyebrow. "You think it's important that they're developed? Aren't they... extremely potent, from what I've heard?"\n"Oh, yes. That is the point. You see, their intent is to act as a deterrent and a threat. Once we have a working magi-nuclear bomb, Queen Chrysalis will be so scared that she will sue for peace for sure! And then no one else will ever threaten Equestria again."\n"I cannot help but regard that as quite optimistic. Chrysalis seems very determined in her cause. Also, what if someone else develops such a weapon?"\nFluttershy smiled. "The day when two countries can annihilate each other in one second, all of the world, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops. We will have world peace forever."\nRarity couldn't help but feel uneasy, and that this was going to end poorly. But she did not want to ruin the mood or insult Fluttershy. This seemed important to her. It was best to change the topic. "Well, I hope everything works out. So, who looks after your animal sanctuary?""

The old Friendship Express had been destroyed by a changeling bombing raid, so they returned home on a repurposed cargo train. It wasn't a comfortable ride, but they were still happy because they were finally together again.\nRainbow broke the silence between them. "So, we won. How many changelings did you kill? I got 241, mostly from air combat."\n"The heck? You kept count? Is everything a competition for you?" Applejack asked, appalled. "Anyhow, 242, mostly from close quarters combat, as my scars show."\nRainbow Dash chuckled. "Welp, better luck next time for me, I guess." She turned to Pinkie Pie, who still hadn't said anything. "Yo Pinkie, you alright? Remember what you promised to me. I miss your laugther."\nShe sighed. "Not now, Dashie. But maybe later."\n\nThe train whistled and arrived at Ponyville's station, or what remained of it after wartime bombing. The three mares left the carriage and were embraced by Twilight, Rarity and Fluttershy, who were there to meet them. "I'm so happy to see you!" Twilight said and struggled to hold back tears. "You all made it back home in one piece."\n"Rainbow didn't," Applejack said, grinned and poked her prosthetic metal wing.\n"Oh, you three look so weary and battered, and your clothes are beginning to fall apart!" Rarity exclaimed.\n"Well, you don't win wars by looking fancy," Rainbow said with a grin.\n"What's wrong, Pinkie?" Fluttershy asked with concern in her voice. All five turned to look at her. Pinkie averted eye contact.\n"Nothing. I'm glad to be back home. Even though it may not seem like it."\n"You know, Pinkie," Twilight said, "Ponyville is preparing to hold a party to celebrate the end of the war. But I think they need someone to organize it."\n"Aha."\n"Wouldn't you like to do that, darling?" Rarity asked. "Maybe that would make you feel better."\nPinkie sighed. "Alright, fine. But I think I will need you guys to help. I've gotten a bit rusty. And... well, I'm not the same as I was."\nRainbow wrapped her metal wing around her. "Pinkie, we'll be with you, always. And we will do anything to make you happy again. Of course we'll help you with the party. No need to even ask such silly things."\nHesitantly, Pinkie hugged her back, then embraced her tight and began to cry. The rest joined the hug as well, reassuring Pinkie and reminding her that she was not alone, and that everything was going to be fine."

equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as pony soldiers on the front prepared to celebrate Hearth's Warming Eve, something strange happened. There have been reports that at one fortified position near the changeling frontline, some ponies climbed over the trench waving a white flag. Changelings honourably did not open fire and allowed the enemy soldiers to get near. The ponies then invited the changelings soldiers to celebrate Hearth's Warming with them in No Creature's Land. Surprisingly, some of the changelings, even a few officers, accepted the offer.\n\nAs the moon rose, the ponies and changelings drank cider and hot chocolate milk, sang carols and even played some hoofball. Soldiers casually chatted with each other, talking of their families and civilian lives, and telling traditional stories. Changelings of course do not celebrate pony holidays, but were very curious and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAfter reports of the incident spread, the high command on both sides reacted. The Equestrian army used this as a chance to show the value of friendship and that changelings were fighting against their will, using the opportunity to portray Chrysalis and her posse as warmongering tyrants. On the other side, the Queen was outraged by this and forbid any knowledge of it to spread, putting the nation's censorship bureaus to work. She then ordered capital punishment on every single soldier and officer who had taken part in the "treachery". However, some of the changelings managed to desert and escape, being welcomed warmly by Equestrian soldiers. They are now prisoners of war but are treated well."

equestria.183.d:0 "Her Majesty Princess Celestia has once more decided to convene the Grand Equestria Pony Summit, summoning delegates from every city of the country to Canterlot. She was encouraged to hold the event by Princess Luna so various disputes could be resolved before they reached a boiling point. Princess Twilight Sparkle was once again responsible for organizing the event. The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of issues with integrating the local thestral minority and the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies while representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. At the end of the event, Princess Celestia held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

equestria.184.t:0 "The Replacement"
equestria.184.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle looked over the reports she had laid out on the desk before her, a look of heavy concern plastered on her face. After Nightmare Moon has risen once again and plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to help in some of the more administrative tasks involving the military. That meant filing through all the reports that the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them didn't paint a good picture of what was going on, especially in the high command.\n\nPutting it straight, Luna's fall had torn a hole in the general staff. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was still clear that he couldn't lead the entire Equestrian Army. They needed somepony to fill the place that the Princess of the Night had left, at least until a more permanent replacement could be found. But who could possibly do that? It was clear the generals didn't know, since all the reports were just blaming Blueblood when he just couldn't do everything at once. Twilight needed to figure it out, and soon.\n\nAnd then it came to her. There was one pony she knew who could help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and frankly Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But even with all that, Twilight was sure that she would still answer her call, and hopefully agree to help Equestria in its darkest hour. She was the best fit for the pony that they needed.\n\nBut first... Twilight levitated a large book from a drawer and opened it to the newest blank page. It was time to write a letter."

"It's so nice to see you again, Sunset," Twilight said, taking a seat in one of the open chairs. "I mean, the last time I saw you..."\n\n"Yeah, I know. Not one of my best moments." Sunset took a seat across from Twilight, noticing a glass already in front of her. "Tea? Should have known you'd already have it ready for me."\n\nTwilight nodded with a slight smile before taking a sip. "So, how things been going for you?"\n\nShe gave a small laugh. "Fine, I guess. Though we both know you wouldn't send a message calling me here if you didn't need me for something." Sunset put down her teacup and sighed. "Guess I better tell my friends that I'll be gone for a while, since I'm guessing it's related to how Equestria is... in a bit of trouble right now."\n\nTwilight nodded. "You're right, and that's exactly why I'm here. You're the only one I know who could help."\n\n"Alright, just tell me. Do you need me to help Equestria win?"\n\n"Yes. Princess Luna turning into Nightmare Moon has left the Equestrian high command in disarray, and Prince Blueblood can't lead the army by himself. Somepony else needs to help lead, and I know you learned a lot from your long time in the mirror world-"\n\n"Whoa, slow down," Sunset said, putting her hooves out. "I'm honored, Twilight, but are you sure that you want me leading an army? It's not like I've been doing that back with my friends, and it still hasn't even been that long since I stole your Element of Magic-"\n\nThe alicorn reached across the table and held one of Sunset's hooves. "Sunset. I know this is sudden, but I need you. Equestria needs you! Nightmare Moon and her followers are killing ponies as we speak, and the longer this civil war goes on..." Twilight trailed off for a moment. "I don't know how much more Equestria, or Princess Celestia can take."\n\nSilence held in the air for a few moments while the two ponies stared at each other. Then, letting go of Twilight, Sunset got off her chair and stood up. "Alright, Twilight," she said, a familiar gleam in her eyes. "I'm in. Just tell me what you need me to do.""

equestria.186.d:0 "In a cafe within Canterlot, two mares sat at a table across from each other, each with a cup of coffee. Much like the other patrons there, they talked while slowly enjoying their drinks, most ponies not even noticing them. The few that did, however, couldn't help but stare or at least occasionally glance at the pair enjoying their day.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't often that a pony got to see a Princess of Equestria and one of the highest ranking officers of the Equestrian Army.\n\n"I'm so glad we could both find time out of our schedule to meet here," Twilight said to Sunset, who nodded wordlessly. "I wanted to see you more often after we met in the castle, but with the war I was just too busy to even get a chance!"\n\n"Same," Sunset agreed, putting down her coffee. "Nightmare Moon and her forces never took breaks, and neither could we. Prince Blueblood and I had contests on who could pull longer all-nighters." She leaned in conspiratorially. "I think he might be jealous on how I won all the time."\n\nThey both shared a laugh. "Sunset, you know you don't have to keep doing this if you don't want to, right?" Twilight suddenly asked, her face more serious. "I know I put a lot on you, asking you to fill Luna's old role, but now that we've defeated Nightmare Moon you can always go back to your old friends. I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to do this for me or anything-"\n\n"Twilight." The Princess paused to look at her friend, who was staring at her. "Don't worry about it. Telling the truth, I was getting a little bored back there. I've already sent them a note letting them know I'll be staying here for a while longer, and they're doing fine without me." Suddenly, Sunset smirked. "Besides, it's nice knowing I've probably saved Equestria more times than you have by now."\n\nTwilight reached over to punch Sunset's shoulder before the two laughed again. "Well, as long as you want to stay here," Twilight said, her spirit much lighter again.\n\nSunset nodded, right before she got a devious look, one that Twilight was almost afraid of. "Hey, since you said I'm taking Luna's place, do you think I'll get to become an alicorn too?" Sunset asked in a clearly teasing tone. "I know I don't exactly have the most moon-related cutie mark, but I think I could do a pretty good job with this whole "protecting ponies' dreams" thing."\n\nNow it was Twilight's turn to smirk, barely keeping a full smile off her face."

equestria.188.t:0 "The Former Student"
equestria.188.d:0 ""Princess, somepony is requesting an audience with you. She says she knows you."\n\nCelestia broke out of the distracted trance she was in, turning her attention back to the present. The war was not going well for Equestria, or for her ponies. The enemy was being relentless in their assaults, overrunning any defense Equestria could muster. Luna and Blueblood were doing their best, but it still wasn't enough to stop the advance. And all Celestia could do was watch from Canterlot, and lead her ponies from her throne while they fought and died for her and Equestria on the front lines...\n\nBut that wasn't what she needed to focus on at the moment. "Let her in," Celestia said, wondering who it could be. She knew many ponies in Canterlot, but the guards knew most of their names. So who was left that they would not know but she would?\n\nThat answer soon came when the doors across the room opened, and a yellow unicorn mare entered. Celestia's breath still caught in her throat for a moment when she recognized who it was, despite having seen her before not too long ago; her former student.\n\n"Princess Celestia, I know it must be a bit of a surprise to see me here," Sunset Shimmer said as she walked forward, determined but still respectful. "But I found out what's happened. How Equestria is in danger, and not just from some magical creature this time."\n\nCelestia remained silent as Sunset continued. "When Twilight first chased after me into the other world, I didn't come back with her because I was too scared to face you. I had hated you for so long, I didn't know what else to do. And I knew I should have come back to apologize then, to ask for your forgiveness, but I couldn't bring myself to come back to Canterlot." Sunset took a deep breath. "So I stayed instead. I made new friends, went on new adventures, learned new lessons I never would have if I hadn't jumped through the portal all those years ago. Even after I came back, I had hoped that I could find a new life there and be a hero just like Twilight."\n\nSuddenly, her voice became much clearer and steady. "Now though, I realize that it isn't there that I'm needed anymore, but here. Equestria is in trouble, and everypony needs to do their part. So that's why I'm here, to ask for you to allow me to help in any way I can."\n\nCelestia did not say anything. Instead, she got up from her throne and walked down towards Sunset, never breaking eye contact. With every step the unicorn's confidence faltered, but she remained resolute when the Princess finally reached her. Sunset blinked as Celestia laid a hoof on her, before she pulled her former student into an embrace.\n\n"Thank you, Sunset Shimmer," she said. And almost immediately, the unicorn returned the hug in kind."

LUNA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history. Their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Luna, recently returned from banishment, remains somewhat of a mystery to the ponies of Equestria. While she is earnest in reintegrating towards modern society, and earning the adoration of her subjects, Luna rarely enjoys the attention her elder sister, Princess Celestia, receives. Her efforts in guarding the dreams of ponies are greatly appreciated, but what is Luna's greatest contribution today is leading ponies in the field, much like in the glory days of old before Equestria's unification. Her knowledge of strategies and military knowledge is unmatched, by the virtue of her age, and she might have been the one to originally place these concepts in a theoretical form.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_swift_milf_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of June, 967 in Zayatsk\n\n§YBiography§!: §gBorn in Severyana, Swift Wing was raised among her three older brothers. They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private schools, and once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions (who were suitably intimidated). After Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. During the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. Undaunted by a major injury, she simply cobbled a makeshift eyepatch and cantered back to her duty. Afterwards, she would continue to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps in a supporting role, albeit many question how her unit tends to be more generously supplied than the others. Her tenacity in the face of injuries and setbacks inspires the soldiers under her command.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"

He was present during the first Changeling attack on Canterlot, which clearly showed that the Royal Guard was unprepared for the greater threat. Afterward, he applied for officer courses, in which he excelled. His fondness of defensive strategies and digging trenches was favoured by the Equestrian command staff, and he eventually rose up to a part of the military high command.

A community pony with southern mannerisms, many who have met her find her to be an fair, empathetic and dilligent friend, even if her stubbornness gets the best of her sometimes.

Inspired to venture through the seas in this new age, Cynosura sought to look beyond the horizon; her parents were inclusive about her career, and had her enrolled to the naval academy she wished for.\n\nCynosura joined the navy once she graduated, and soon her talents began to show. She was capable of navigating large fleets with exceptional efficiency during war games, likewise knowing how to deliver heavier strikes while taking less damage during simulations. Combining her passion with profession, she rose through the ranks, attaining the rank of Admiral, a position only few were able to achieve at her age. She never gave up on her belief, and insisted that a fleet in being was essential even at times of peace. However with only pirates as targets, a navy was hardly Equestria's concern. Only recently, with the storm of war rapidly approaching her horizon, Cynosura might perhaps finally see the opportunity to put her talents and creed at work."

LEADER_OLI_DESC:0 "Like many of the thestrals who were shunned and forgotten, Oli Equites lived with his fellow bat ponies in the caves, ignored by all. It was not the ideal kind of life, lacking comforts and acceptance, but as long as they had each other, the thestrals were content. This isolation was broken when Princess Luna led her campaign to bring the issue to the forefront of the Equestrian public. Her words captured Oli's thoughts and he went off, despite his parents' protests, into the world beyond the cave.\nHis first and foremost desire was to protect the harmony Luna preached, especially after the incident occurred. Although nopony was hurt, and the event may have actually contributed to achieving rights for thestrals, Oli wanted to ensure that such would never occur again, and he made his way to the nearest recruitment centre. After proving his worth through an arduous training regimen, Oli became one of the first non-commissioned bat pony officers in the Equestrian army, proudly serving for the diarchy."

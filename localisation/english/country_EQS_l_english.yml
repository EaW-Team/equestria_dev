#NAMES
EQS_princess_celestia:0 "Princess Celestia"
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Long ago, in the lands known as Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for the realm and all their subjects. The tales of these sisters stretch back far beyond recorded history, and their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Celestia is the elder of the two sisters, and the Princess of the Sun along with her traditional role as a diarch of Equestria. Charged with raising the sun and until recently the moon, it was she who was responsible for banishing her own sister Princess Luna to the moon following her fall into darkness, as well as the thousand years of relative peace and prosperity that followed. Through it all she has ruled with a light hoof, only stepping in when necessary to preserve harmony throughout the realm. And though all of Equestria had forgotten Luna, it was Celestia who remembered her sister and welcomed her back following the defeat of Nightmare Moon by Twilight Sparkle.\n\nSince that fateful day, much has transpired in Equestria. The changelings led by Queen Chrysalis came close to capturing Canterlot in 1002, and attacks by both a resurgent King Sombra and Lord Tirek have only been barely repulsed by Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Still, Celestia is not blind to the threats that lay both within and without Equestria's borders. The enemies of harmony can no longer be defeated by friendship and magic, and only time will tell if Equestria's greatest proponent of peace, kindness and cooperation can keep up with the modern era of technology and progress.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_nopony:0 "Nopony"
POLITICS_CELESTIA_LUNA_DESC:0 "The Princesses of Equestria, Celestia and Luna wield power over the Sun and Moon respectively. Despite the Diarchial power structure, Equestria has always been ruled by Celestia, leaving Luna to assume a supporting role. The recent campaign to welcome the Fourth Tribe into Equestria has changed this, and Princess Luna has now assumed a complementary role alongside her sister, working to realise the dreams of her subjects."
CHANCELLOR_NEIGHSAY_DESC:0 "Neighsay is strict and conservative, preferring to do things by the EEA guidelines. He is also very prejudiced against anyone who is not a pony, openly referring to non-ponies as "creatures" in a dismissive manner."
POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "A well educated and accomplished general from the Equestrian military, Prince Blueblood rode his popularity as a hero of Equestria and his traditionally inherited power as a prince through the elections and into his new role as the executive of the nation. His tactics as a general were strict, disciplined, and conservative, not to mention highly effective, and he carries those methodologies into his administration. Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently. Finally, his knowledge as a general gives his pragmatic administration great insight into the military and the defensive needs of the nation, essential in the torn and chaotic modern world."
POLITICS_PANTS_DESC:0 "Fancy Pants is a renowned member of the old Canterlot elite aristocracy, a shrewd businesspony and a clever diplomat. Though uptight as many Canterlotians are, he has occasionally shown a softer side such as his favorable business dealings with Rarity and forgiveness to the aid of Princess Twilight Sparkle after a notable debacle while she was attending other business. With these qualities, he is a natural choice for a leader that the traditional elite are content with, though some ponies may not agree with his strongly orthodox methods and policy."

EQS_around_the_clock_equestria_desc:0 "With two Princesses both ready, able, and willing to actively rule Equestria, there is no threat and no problems that can stand in their way. With new staffing allowing for round the clock administrative decisions to be undertaken and responses to be delivered, Equestria will be rapidly reshaped before the will of the Princesses."
EQS_track_down_nightmarists:0 "Track Down The Nightmarists"
EQS_track_down_nightmarists_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, some deranged cultists seeking to bring back the Nightmare have managed to evade our grasp.

EQS_integrate_lunar_guard:0 "Integrate The Lunar Guard"
EQS_integrate_lunar_guard_desc:0 "Long ago before the banishment of the Nightmare, the Lunar Guard was an equal to the Royal Guard sworn to protect the Princess of the Night. However, even after Luna's return it was never truly revived past a few ceremonial duties. That will change today, as Luna has shown interest in bringing back her old personal military detail, complete with appointing a new Captain of the Lunar Guard."
EQS_calming_the_crowds:0 "Calming The Crowds"
EQS_calming_the_crowds_desc:0 "Our precious ponies are, unfortunately, rather skittish and easily startled. The recent events have led to a wave of panic beginning to spread amongst segments of the populations. Both Night and Day will sooth the ponies of Equestria, so that calmer minds may prevail."
EQS_social_equality:0 "Fight Discrimination"
EQS_social_equality_desc:0 "Despite the recent attempts to ensure the proper integration of the thestrals with wider Equestrian society, some hold outs and fears still remain. A new campaign aimed to educate the population and provide social and legal aid to those being unfairly targeted should help to resolve this, so we may all live together in peace."
EQS_freedom_rights:0 "Freedom Of Religion" 
EQS_freedom_rights_desc:0 "Unlike the Griffons or Kirin, Equestria has never had a formal state religion, despite the popular practise of worship of the two Sisters. As we work to ensure our legal codes are more inclusive, we must formalise the right of any creature to worship as they please within Equestria, as long as they aren’t hurting anypony."
EQS_everycreaturerights:0 "Rights For All"
EQS_everycreaturerights_desc:0 "While updating our legal statutes to include our thestral citizens, it was discovered that most of the Equestrian legal framework defines a person as a pony. While we are a pony dominated nation, we cannot mistreat our non-pony populations in such a matter any longer!"
EQS_a_true_equal_diarchy:0 "A True, Equal Diarchy"
EQS_a_true_equal_diarchy_desc:0 "After over 1,000 years, the princesses are finally co-rules once more. Equal in respect and responsibility. While the Day nourishes and guides the ponies, The Night shall watch over them and keep harm away from the innocent."
EQS_welfare:0 "Expanding the Welfare State"

EQS_civil_war_start_desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened - Luna has once more fallen to Nightmare Moon, and her forces have split Equestria apart in a mad attempt to take over the nation. Though it saddens us all greatly to have to fight our own ponies, we are left with no choice. Onwards, for Harmony!"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul:0 "Rapid Economic Overhaul"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul_desc:0 "Our economy, already brought to the brink by over half of the country breaking away, is also nowhere near ready for supporting a full-scale war.

EQS_emergency_military_reorganization:0 "Emergency Military Reorganization"
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization_desc:0 "The Equestrian Army is undertrained, understaffed, and in complete disarray. To defend Equestria, we must rectify all of this immediately.

EQS_question_of_strategy:0 "A Question Of Strategy"
EQS_question_of_strategy_desc:0 "With Equestria no longer on the brink of collapse, we can finally look forward and decide on how we can end this war against the Nightmare. Some advocate for a withdrawal to the western heartlands for a long campaign of exhausting the Lunarists; others believe a strategy of aggressive defense following by a heavy counterattack will secure victory with minimal loss of life."
EQS_war_industry:0 "War Industry"
EQS_war_industry_desc:0 "Reforming the system is not enough. Even if we were to run all the industry we currently have at peak efficiency, it would still not be enough to guarantee victory. More factories must be requisitioned and built, producing the weapons and equipment that ponies need to fight back. War on both fronts; the army and the factories will work in tandem, understanding that one without the other is nothing."
EQS_defense_of_equestria:0 "The Defense Of Equestria"
EQS_defense_of_equestria_desc:0 "The Nightmareists remain extremely aggressive in their efforts to take Equestria, as we would expect. Before we can effectively push forward to end this war, we must first end their assault. We dig in, hold the line, and let the enemy go no further. They will soon find that fighting disorganized soldiers is far different from a united and prepared defense."
EQS_end_the_stagnation:0 "End The Stagnation"
EQS_end_the_stagnation_desc:0 "Our efforts to force Equestria into the modern era have been extremely successful, but we are still not finished. Remnants of Equestria society still cling to the past, to outdated traditions that are quite frankly unsuited for the modern era. Equestria is a modern nation, and it is time to prove that in reality."
EQS_equestrian_warplan:0 "Equestrian War Plan"
EQS_equestrian_warplan_desc:0 "Our defenses are in place, and Equestria modernized. Now it is time to bring all our work together, and craft a dedicated war plan for the nation so that everything can be brought to bear against the Nightmare. Some debate exactly how harsh this plan should be on the ponies of Equestria; while victory must be achieved, what are we willing to sacrifice for it?"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare:0 "Guns Against The Nightmare"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare_desc:0 "The war continues. And as it drags on, ponies will continue to die, whether we like it or not. But if we are to ask them to die for Equestria, then the bare minimum we must do is ensure they are fully equipped to fight on the front. The brave soldiers will have their weapons, no matter the cost."
EQS_chaos_and_order:0 "Chaos And Order"
EQS_chaos_and_order_desc:0 "The rise of the Nightmare has made many ponies scared and desperate. Ponies are beginning to take certain matters into their own hooves, threatening to throw everything into chaos. With the right words, however, the Princess should be able to calm things down.\n\nOr there is always the alternative."
EQS_help_the_refugees:0 "Help The Refugees"
EQS_help_the_refugees_desc:0 "Thousands of ponies have been displaced due to the war, whether they be fleeing across the border from the tyranny of the Nightmare or from their homes due to proximity to the frontline. Many simply wish for a new place to call home until the war is over, but such circumstances breeds resentment. And while we are a nation of friendship... we also always need more ponies on the front."
EQS_wartime_administration:0 "Wartime Administration"
EQS_wartime_administration_desc:0 "The bureaucracy of Equestria is full of talented, loyal ponies who have all proven themselves to the Princess. It is unsuited for war, as many within its ranks are unwilling or uneducated in wartime measures. Though we are grateful for their service, it may be time to find replacements more suitable for what will be asked of them in this difficult time."
EQS_wartime_laws:0 "Wartime Laws"
EQS_wartime_laws_desc:0 "The legal code of Equestria is something that has adapted and shifted with the times, though it has always officially protected the many freedoms that ponies enjoy. But now, the leniency and spirit of forgiveness that has held Equestria together takes valuable resources, a dangerous thing given our situation. Perhaps it is time to overhaul the laws to suit the times, even if only temporarily?"
EQS_together_against_nightmare:0 "Together Against The Nightmare"
EQS_together_against_nightmare_desc:0 "War is not the end of friendship, nor is it something that breaks the bonds that keep us together. Rather it creates new ones, friendships tested through the most difficult trials and shared burdens. We may fight our former friends on the battlefield, but the bonds forged in battle are unbreakable, where any soldier of Equestria is willing to put their life in the hooves of the ponies that stand by them."
EQS_new_general_staff:0 "A New General Staff"
EQS_new_general_staff_desc:0 "Full-scale war may be a struggle Equestria has never seen before, but there are still plenty of ponies willing to step up to the task of leadership. Their unique skills are what we need, especially in these desperate times. Only with effective leaders at every level of Equestria can we succeed, even if some will have to sacrifice their livelihoods in the defense of Harmony."
EQS_matter_of_thestrals:0 "Matter Of The Thestrals"
EQS_matter_of_thestrals_desc:0 "The thestrals have become a complicated subject in Equestria, even moreso than before the war began. There are still many loyal to harmony who want to fight for the Princess and Equestria. But nopony can deny that the majority of thestrals are loyal to the Nightmare now, and acts of sabotage are certain. Arguments have raged for months on what to do with them; we must close this issue."
EQS_deal_with_radicals:0 "Deal With The Radicals"
EQS_deal_with_radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism breeds radicalism. With the Nightmare willing to go to such lengths to ensure her rule over Equestria, ponies are beginning to believe we need to follow suit. A small group, comprised of religious devotees to the Princess and militaristic fanatics, have proven terrifyingly effective in their service to Equestria. But is such a precedent one we want to establish?"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists:0 "Aid The Loyalists"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Deep in southeastern Equestria, within the jungles once loyal to the Nightmare, a brave resistance led by the heroine Daring Do fight mercenaries, communists and the remaining Nightmareists to restore Harmony much as we do. Our struggle north means we do not have the resources to intervene, but we will not abandon them either. Spare volunteers and guns can be sent so that they may be victorious."

mil_industry_fillydelphia_desc:0 "The car is a still relatively new and costly product for Equestrians to explore.

eqs_buffalo2:0 "Resolve the Issues with Buffalo"
eqs_buffalo2_desc:0 "Friends are stronger together, and this goes for us and the buffalo as well. They would prosper greatly under the mantle of harmony, but the relatively sparse land would need significant investment to avoid becoming a drain on the national budget. Furthermore, the rights of buffalo would have to be guaranteed to avoid further issues."
EQS_buffalo_relations:0 "Buffalo Relations"
EQS_buffalo_relations_desc:0 "Even after the Applelosan settlement, the bonds between local ponies and buffalo remain tenuous, at best. While the native creatures only seek to preserve and maintain their way of life, undisturbed and static for centuries, greedy developers see the buffalo land and dream of riches both on the ground and under it. Surely, there must be a compromise that satisfies the teachings of harmony?"
eqs_southern_roads:0 "Southern Roads"
eqs_southern_roads_desc:0 "With the integration of the Buffalo tribes into Equestria, it is time that we made good on our promises and develop the local infrastructure in the area.

EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles:0 "Jungle Railway"
EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles_desc:0 "The jungles of southeastern Equestria have been all but impassable for a long time.

dragon_question:0 "The Dragon Question"
dragon_question_desc:0 "The mighty dragon has always been a feared creature, but their claws and flames do not seem so terrifying anymore when firearms and warships exist.

tenochtitlan_state_university:0 "Stableside State University"
tenochtitlan_state_university_desc:0 "Equestria has many facilities for higher education, one of them being Baltimare University, but issue is that Baltimare is the sole location in the southeast containing such faculties. Many talented ponies miss out on learning further, because they simply cannot afford to travel and live in northern cities. The formation of a state sponsored university in Stableside should alleviate the problem."
southern_naval_bases:0 "Southern Naval Bases"
southern_naval_bases_desc:0 "Equestria boasts the longest coastline in the world, but the development and construction of new dockyards, wharves and piers has not kept up with the growth. Given the obvious lack of such facilities on the southeast shores, it would be prudent to fill the gap, thus giving our navy a new base to repair and fuel from."
EQS_portland_fishing_port:0 "Portland Seaweed Farms"
EQS_portland_fishing_port_desc:0 "If we support the coastal farms in Portland, they can supply the entire region with nutritiuous seaweed. With the influx of food, prices will fall and allow for local towns to grow at a steady pace, which will attract the industrial concerns to set up local businesses. Hopefully, this will solve the issue of unequal region wealth."

EQS_CHN_bitterloss_desc:0 "Defeated twice in as many decades, the changeling ego has been battered, bruised and smashed to pieces. For all their dreams of glory and supremacy, the promises of Chrysalis and her followers have turned to ash in their mouths. The changeling spirit lays battered and bruised and may not recover."
EQS_CHN_collapsed_economy:0 "A Nation In Ruins"
EQS_CHN_collapsed_economy_desc:0 "Strategic bombing raids, scorched earth tactics and desperate last stands have all combined to leave the nation a burnt out husk. The great hives lay in ruins, the factories rest all mangled up, and the infrastructure is nothing but ablaze, leaving the great industrial engine of the north one whole derailed mess."
EQS_CHN_partisans:0 "Hidden Fanatics"

EQS_CHN_queens:0 "Squabbling Queens"
EQS_CHN_queens_desc:0 "For centuries the changeling hives were divided amongst their hives, each with their own queen. The coming of Chrysalis unified the people and united the queens under her banner but did not destroy them completely. Now that the arch-tyrant has vanished, the remaining Queens have stepped forward, offering their services to help restore ‘order’ to their fiefdoms, all the while struggling with each other for power and glory."

EQS_CHN_no_love:0 "Depleted Love Reserves"
EQS_CHN_no_love_desc:0 "The war was meant to banish want from changeling society, to give them a continent to harvest from, to ensure all changelings could indulge in as much love as they desired. Instead it has brought ruin to the land, destroying venerable stockpiles of both food and love, greatly lowering the standard of living for the average changeling citizen."

While the cowards in the party leadership surrendered to the forces of reaction, the Red Army’s leadership refused to bend the knee to foreign tyrants. Lacking air or armoured support, the remnants of the Red Army have blended in with the local population to keep up the fight against the invader. Every village, every city, every swamp, every forest, they all contain a true warrior of the revolution! The foe will be defeated, even if they must be choked on the bodies of their own dead."

The Equestrian ponies do not support a direct intervention, at least not yet, but that does not mean we will leave our fellow harmonic monarch out to face this grave threat alone. We will send all we can to them so that they can fight back against the changelings, and defend their homeland from the invaders who would seek to subjugate all of Equus."
EQS_support_the_yaks:0 "Support the Yaks"
EQS_support_the_yaks_desc:0 "Every day, it looks more and more likely that the only possible conclusion to the Yak-Jak feud will be through war.

However, the remaining harmonists led by the Prince and a former student of the School of Friendship, Yona, have made the long trek south to Canterlot where they have sought refuge until they can return to free Yakyakistan. Though their country is lost, we still stand, and will provide them with whatever they need until they can someday return home."

However, things have changed; it is clear now that they are actively seeking our downfall with their harsh rhetoric. While a repeat of the Winter Revolution is the last thing anypony wants, we can at least officialize the embargo placed upon them, and ask our friends to follow suit in isolating this threat."
EQS_buffalo_integration:0 "Talks with the Buffalo"
EQS_buffalo_integration_desc:0 "The buffalo have long been pushed back from their ancestral homelands, retreating from pony settlers who made their way south long ago. The Appleloosa incident only marked the natural consequence of letting the issue run unresolved; we can only do so much for the buffalo in and out of our lands while they remain nominally independent. Hopefully they will see reason in becoming a part of Equestria, so that we can fix the mistakes we've made together."
EQS_save_the_buffalo:0 "Save the Buffalo"
EQS_save_the_buffalo_desc:0 "The buffalo have fallen to dark words, revanchist promises that have turned them against us. While their rhetoric has a center of truth to it, their reaction does not bode well for Equestria, or the ponies that now live in the south. There is only one option left available to us; war, to save our friends like Chieftess Strongheart and to protect our ponies before they attack us first."
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states:0 "Integrate the Buffalo"
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states_desc:0 "With the Buffalo now fully a part of Equestria, we can integrate them as an official new part of the nation, with all the benefits and protections it confers.

EQS_develop_PCB_cotton:0 "Invest in Puerto Caballo Cotton Plantations"
EQS_develop_PCB_cotton_desc:0 "The island of Puerto Caballo is dotted with countless plantations, especially the cotton plantations dominated by Baltimare business interests. If the Crown were to buy up and renovate some of the more struggling enterprises it would help to maintain the growing economic boom amongst the island."
EQS_develop_PCB_tobacco:0 "Invest in Puerto Caballo's Tobacco Plantations"
EQS_develop_PCB_tobacco_desc:0 "The vast tobacco plantations spread across Puerto Caballo are owned by Matrotanza’s Manufacturing Limited, a joint stock company operating out of Manehattan. Ever since the collapse of the Griffon Empire and the decline in transoceanic trade, the company’s shares have been in free fall, and their holdings along the island have been greatly neglected. By offering a one time cash injection to shore up the firm, the islands economy can be stabilised, and we can prevent any knock on effects from disturbing the greater Equestrian economy."
EQS_develop_PCB_sugar:0 "Invest in Puerto Caballo Sugar Plantations"
EQS_develop_PCB_sugar_desc:0 "While sugar production is relatively new to Puerto Caballo, the results so far appear very promising. By issuing several tax breaks for Equestrian companies willing to invest in this new opportunity, the Crown can encourage even further economic growth upon the island."
EQS_develop_apple:0 "Invest in Sweet Apple Acres"

That means that it is in the Crown's interest to ensure that Sweet Apple Acres, her family farm in Ponyville continues to operate smoothly and efficiently.

While ponies are against actively staging foreign coups or going into a war with a nation like Olenia to overthrow its government, we can still provide official shelter to Queen Velvet and her supporters as well as acknowledge her as the rightful monarch. And perhaps someday, circumstances will change and she will retake Olenia in the name of Harmony."

After all, Saddle Arabia is a very powerful nation, and it would do well for us to remain on good terms."

It would be inconceivable to simply ignore their plight; sending aid to our surprising new friends is the least we can do."

However, an issue remains; we don't exactly know much about changeling culture and life, as we doubt they know much about pony life past the lies Queen Chrysalis fed them. An exchange program, led by Twilight's School of Friendship should help sort out our differences."

##NEW IDEAS##

EQS_harmonic_stagnation:0 "Harmonic Stagnation"
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_desc:0 "While the thousand years reign of Celestia has brought untold prosperity to Equestria, so too has it brought complacency and stagnation to its society. Ponies are reluctant to adopt new ideas or technologies, preferring their old traditions instead, and the political system is slow and inefficient despite recent efforts by the Princesses. Life in Equestria may have never been better, but it is no question that the nation is unsuited for the realities of today."
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_4:0 "Harmonic Stagnation"
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_4_desc:0 "Much has been done to rapidly overhaul the bureaucracy and political system, and Equestrian society is rapidly waking to the necessity of modern technology and concepts to survive in today's era. With time and a little more effort, Equestria will finally have shaken off its stagnation and be ready to bring its full capacity to bear."
EQS_friendship_magic:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
EQS_friendship_magic_desc:0 "Friendship between ponies has been the defining feature of Equestria for countless generations. Conflict is resolved using words, not violence, and the mere thought of causing somepony else intentional harm is enough to give many shudders. Unfortunately, our enemies may not have such qualms about the use of violence... or war."
EQS_outdated_military:0 "Outdated Military"
EQS_outdated_military_desc:0 "Equestria's military is, putting it extremely mildly, woefully underequipped and unprepared for any sort of modern large-scale conflict. Military theory is a field practically unheard of until recently, and the few volunteers in the armed forces are disorganized and lack any real experience. The events of the last decade in addition to pushes by Celestia have begun to fix the many issues of the Equestrian military, but much remains to be done."
EQS_outdated_military_2:0 "Outdated Military"
EQS_princess_luna_idea:0 "Princess Luna"
EQS_princess_luna_idea_desc:0 "Princess Luna is the younger sister of Celestia, the Princess of the Moon and a diarch of Equestria. Having recently returned from her thousand-year banishment thanks to the help of Twilight Sparkle, she has spent the last few years acclimatizing to the modern era and settling into her old role. Despite this, she has maintained a passive role in modern Equestrian politics, preferring to let her sister take the lead on most decisions and instead focusing on her duties in the realm of dreams."
EQS_thestral_divide:0 "The Thestral Divide"
EQS_thestral_divide_desc:0 "Thestrals, more commonly known as batponies, are the fourth tribe of ponies with a long history separate from that of the other three tribes. This has resulted in a population separate from mainstream Equestrian society, a problem which only worsened following the banishment of Princess Luna due to the thestrals regarding her as a divine entity of their sacred moon. Even now many thestral communities remain isolated and are reluctant to join their fellow ponies, while the other tribes remain wary of their nocturnal siblings."

EQS_bad_tanks:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks_desc:0 "While elsewhere, arms races between rival nations forced constant development and refinement of warfare, in Equestria the military remained stagnant from decades of disuse. Even as new innovations were made in the world Equestria was slow to adopt them, seeing things such as trench warfare and tanks as appalling and strange. Without Princess Celestia's constant efforts to avoid falling behind too much, the Equestrian Royal Guard would've continued to use spears as their primary weapon, and despite the recent push for modernizing the military many ponies still prefer the old and reliable ways of combat, if any."
EQS_bad_tanks2:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks2_desc:0 "While elsewhere, arms races between rival nations forced constant development and refinement of warfare, in Equestria the military remained stagnant from decades of disuse. Even as new innovations were made in the world Equestria was slow to adopt them, seeing things such as trench warfare and tanks as appalling and strange. Without Princess Celestia's constant efforts to avoid falling behind too much, the Equestrian Royal Guard would've continued to use spears as their primary weapon, and despite recent efforts to adopt tank and motorized doctrine among commanders many ponies still prefer the old and reliable ways of combat, if any."
EQS_bad_tanks3:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks3_desc:0 "While elsewhere, arms races between rival nations forced constant development and refinement of warfare, in Equestria the military remained stagnant from decades of disuse. Even as new innovations were made in the world Equestria was slow to adopt them, seeing things such as trench warfare and tanks as appalling and strange. Without Princess Celestia's constant efforts to avoid falling behind too much, the Equestrian Royal Guard would've continued to use spears as their primary weapon, and despite recent efforts to acclimate to armored warfare ponies still look down upon trench warfare. Further reform is needed to finally have a truly modern army."

EQS_innovating_industry_desc:0 "Equestria is currently undergoing an industrialisation drive undertaken by the Crown, further advancing the field of research in industry as well as helping fund further industrial projects across Equestria.

 #equestria.1.t:0 "Loyalty"
 #questria.1.d:0 "Nothing. Rainbow Dash set the body back down to move on to the next one. When she had first started raiding Solarist patrols out in the mountains, they had been well-stocked with just about anything a soldier could ask for. These days, though, the only things she was finding on their corpses were ammunition. More bullets were always nice of course, but her medical supplies were starting to dwindle. She was already rationing the remaining food too...\n\nRainbow snapped back to attention and whipped her rifle around as one of the bodies shifted. Of course. The mare rolled her eyes; two nonlethal shots in one raid meant she was getting sloppy. Trotting over, a blood-coated metal wing extended outward as she flipped the stallion onto his back with a hoof. Quick and painless, a single slash across the neck-\n\nThe solarist coughed. "Figured you wouldn't get me in one shot, Rainbow Crash."\n\nShe froze, steel mere inches away from finishing the job. Rainbow hadn't heard that nickname since... She focused in on the stallion's face, his parted mane, the familiar light-brown coat, and stepped back as her eyes flashed in recognition. "H-Hoops? What are you doing here?"\n\nHoops rolled his head over to look at the other soldiers laying close by. "We were supposed to be scouting for you," he said, his voice much weaker than how Dash remembered it. "They told us to report back if we saw you, and not to fight since you were too dangerous. Guess you found us first." He slowly turned back to look at her. "Just finish it."\n\nNo... no, this wasn't how it was supposed to be. This was all wrong. Rainbow Dash focused on the bullet wound in his side; it didn't look like it hit anything vital. "Don't move," she ordered as she shifted his body to get her hooves under to lift him up. Hoops was a large stallion, almost twice as tall as Rainbow, and as she strained to get airborne she was glad one of her wings was metal for once. "My hideout isn't too far from here."\n\nThe solarist laughed, though it sounded pained. "Why me?" he asked. "You didn't seem to care about them."\n\nDash looked back at the dead bodies of the other soldiers, trying to ignore the mare in the corner with blood pooling from the slash across their neck. "Be quiet," she answered, keeping her voice hard. "You're just going to make it worse."\n\nHoops grunted, but remained silent."
 #equestria.1.a:0 "What... what did I do?"
 #equestria.2.t:0 "Cowardice"
 #equestria.2.d:0 "Rainbow Dash placed another log onto the fire and sat back down on the floor, watching Hoops stare into the flames. She had managed to patch him up with the last of her medical supplies, but there was still an unspoken question left. It had been nagging her ever since she had recognized him, and it kept eating away at her now. And given how there was no way they could leave safely until nightfall, Rainbow figured she might as well get it out of the way now. "Why did you do it, Hoops?" she asked softly. "Why did you leave the weather factory to join them? I mean, I know you were pretty bad to me and Fluttershy in the past, but-"\n\n"Do you really think that had anything to do with it?" The spite that came with Hoops' words was so harsh Rainbow looked away in shame. "I'm not that petty, Crash. And I'm not that stupid either. But what else was I supposed to do?"\n\nThe mare shot up, her vague discomfort instantly replaced with anger. "Fight back?" she shot at the injured stallion. "Join the resistance? There's still a bunch of ponies out there fighting for harmony, and you're asking what you could have done? Maybe start with not wearing their uniform!"\n\nHoops looked away from the fire to spare a glance at Rainbow's prosthetic wing. "That worked out well for you, didn't it? You always were the brave one at Flight Camp. But the rest of us..." Staring back at the fire, his ears twitched with the crackling of the logs. "...we aren't heroes, Crash. When you left us behind for the Bolts, we didn't go anywhere. And when the Princess went mad, all of us lost our jobs at the factory. We all joined the army because it was the only way we thought we could survive."\n\nRainbow thought back to the dead littered around where she found Hoops. "Your friends... Were they..."\n\n"Who, Dumb-Bell and Score? Nah, I haven't seen them since the we got split into different squads. Everypony back there was just strangers. Didn't mean they deserved to die, though. A bunch of them were just like me."\n\nDash looked at her metal wing. There were countless divots notched on the surface of it, more than she could count. At one point she had even bragged about it to the other members of the resistance. "I was just doing what I had to," she responded quietly.\n\nHoops shifted, turning to look at Rainbow again. "I don't blame you for it. If anything, I'm the lucky one. You have to be the hero of Equestria. But not everyone who wears this uniform is looking to kill for the Empress."\n\n"Some of us... we just want to go home.""

 #equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearth's Warming and Happy New Year!"
 #equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago ponies across the country celebrated Hearth's Warming, an annual holiday commemorating the founding of Equestria. As is tradition, on Hearth Warming Eve ponies gathered to spectate theatre plays that re-enact the legendary establishment of the country, with the pageant in Canterlot being the largest. In the story, the three pony tribes, Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth ponies, live an uneasy existence together until a fearsome blizzard forces them to seek for a new homeland. However, the leaders of the tribes all claim the same land and argue with one another, causing the blizzard to appear again. According to the legend, the cold was caused by magical Windigos that feed on hatred. The tribal leaders are frozen in ice, but their assistants befriend one another and create the Fire of Friendship, a heart-shaped flame that expels the Windigos forever and melts the bodies and hearts of the tribal leaders. The three tribes then agree to share the new land, calling it Equestria. After the pageants, on Hearth's Warming Day, pony families enjoy delicious meals, exchange gifts and raise the flag of Equestria.\n\nAnd now, the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria. The Princesses have given their traditional speech to the public as well, rejuvenating the spirit of Harmony and Unity throughout all of Equestria. No matter what will happen, the ponies know that as long as they work together, they can overcome any challenge."

 equestria.1.d:0 ""My little ponies." The crowd, gathered in front of the stage and consisting of ponies of all types became silent. "Thank you all, for joining us once again in the Grand Equestria Pony Summit and representing your cities across all of Equestria. Many of you have traveled far, and we hope that here, we can all come together and enjoy the bonds of friendship that brought us together so long ago."\n\nThe Equestrians, made of mayors and businessponies alike all clapped their hooves politely for Princess Celestia. She waited politely for them to finish before motioning for both Luna and Twilight to step forward with her. "We understand that some of you may have worries or concerns to bring up with us. And as Princesses of Equestria, we promise you that we will be here to listen and help in any way we can. All of us may have troubles, but if we work together, I am sure that we can all move past them together."\n\nAnother round of applause. Princess Twilight took center stage, lightly coughing this time to get the ponies to settle down. "But most of all, we all hope you can enjoy your time here in Canterlot. With more ponies here than any other summit in the history of Equestria, we're sure that the three days here will be more productive, interesting and exciting than ever before! And remember, everypony...""

 equestria.2.d:0 "Three days later, it was over. The delegates, having spent days and nights talking, eating, drinking and enjoying their time in Canterlot were all gone, having left back to their home cities. Most had gone home happy; a few were merely satisfied, but nopony left particularly nervous or worried.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said of the Princesses who had remained.\n\n"I hope you two have better news than I do," Twilight said, her formalities dissipating as she sat down, clearly exhausted. "Mayor Rokenhar of Las Pegasus is worried about food imports, Mayor Goldwin of Vanhoover believes that Stalliongrad is agitating the dock workers in the city, and some buffalo almost got into a fight with the southern ponies."\n\n"I fear that what I have been told is not any less concerning, Princess Twilight. Mayor Ash Moustache of Baltimare expressed his concerns to me about a group called "CANTER", I believe. And then there is the matter of the thestrals, too..." Luna looked away from her fellow royals. "It seems that there are many still reluctant to rejoin Equestrian society again, even after my return." The Night Princess looked back up at Celestia, who seemed to be distant from the conversation. "What about you, sister? What have you learned from our subjects?"\n\nThe Princess did not speak for a few moments. "The mayor of Acornage voiced his concerns with me earlier today," she said finally, looking at neither of them. "The changeling presence on the border grows more worrying by the month. She assured me of her efforts to keep relations between ponies and the remaining changelings in the city friendly, but... many believe that Equestria will soon be facing a new threat." Celestia looked at Luna, then at Twilight.\n\n"One unlike any we have seen before.""
 equestria.2.a:0 "We will have to take all of this into consideration..."
 #equestria.3.t:0 "The Dotted Line Report"
 #equestria.3.d:0 "A disturbing report has recently landed on the desk of Princess Celestia. Commissioned by the small bureaucracy, it has painted a grim picture of what would happen, were Equestria to find herself attacked by any enemies from beyond her borders.\n\nThe first part of the report focuses on Stalliongrad. While they have not been particularly keen on jumping across the border, whatever the rhetoric coming out of the Palace of Soviets says, were it to happen, the Royal Guard, with its less than 10,000 soldiers in the area would find itself swept away by the Red Army which, the report reckons would get as far as Albion and Trotsylvania before moving to threaten Manehatten.\n\nSpeaking of the Royal Guard, the report condemns the large cuts made to the Royal Guard over the recent years, blaming them for the near-defeat at Canterlot, using very unparliamentary language to describe the state of the Guard, recommending an immediate five-fold increase in budget.\n\nLastly, there's the biggest, and grimmest part of the report. The Changelings. Information is of course rare about them, and as such, the report makes it clear it's working off hearsay. But, this is the most damning part of it all. The report states that if a full Changeling invasion was to occur, Equestria would surely fall within two years of such an invasion, unless 'radical and controversial' measures were taken, including overhauling the whole state to mobilize all resources.\n\nIn addition to military matters, the report warns about the lack of innovation and economic development in recent years which has allowed other nations (such as the Changeling Lands) to catch up. It proposes large-scale industrial projects and education reforms to maintain Equestria's position as the most developed country in the world.\n\nDespite the dire warnings made in the report regarding the risk of invasion, only the industrial and scientific parts of the report have been publicly stated to be put into effect. In private, however, Princess Celestia knows something must be done..."
 #equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.3.t:0 "Help from the Ponies"
 equestria.3.d:0 "Frosty Gust watched as ponies unloaded the crates of guns, medical supplies and other necessities off the carriages, hoofing them over to a few Yaks waiting impatiently nearby. It had been a difficult trip, traveling through the Crystal Empire and across the Yak Range using underdeveloped roads and trails to finally make it to Yakistown. Had she known the time and danger involved in the trip, she probably wouldn't have volunteered to lead the expedition in the first place. She was pretty sure at least five years of her lifespan were gone from those avalanches.\n\nPrince Rutherford looked from the military equipment to Frosty; he had arrived to personally oversee the transfer. "Yaks appreciate pony help!" he said loudly, as was the norm for all yaks. "Yaks and ponies live in dangerous times! Become harder to SMASH enemies, need work together!"\n\n"Yes, of course," she replied, trying to remember the basics she learned in Yak diplomacy. "Equestria will always stand by our friends, and we know how important it is to help you as much as we can."\n\nThere was a crash. A few ponies had dropped one of the crates, letting rifles spill out from the top. The Prince picked one of them up and studied it closely. "This pony weapon, not yak made," he said, anger slowly rising. "Pony weapons not for yaks, not perfect. When things not perfect, make yaks mad! Makes yaks want to destroy!"\n\nThe pony winced. This was exactly what she had been told not to let happen when it came to diplomacy with yaks. "Well, um, you see," she said, trying to do damage control. "We can't really, uh, I meant we tried to-"\n\nThe yak prince nodded before giving the rifle to another yak, who started helping the ponies gather the fallen weapons. "Yaks mad, but yaks also understand not everything perfect anymore," Rutherford said. "Yaks need weapons, can't afford to SMASH. Pony help important, yaks not forget!"\n\nFrosty breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed not everything the ponies back in Canterlot told her was true after all. "If you need anything else from Equestria, all you have to do is ask. We will always be ready to help a friend in need.""

 #equestria.4.t:0 "The Expansion of the School for Gifted Unicorns"
 #equestria.4.d:0 "It tended to be in the past that only those who could pull favours, had a lot of connection or were just plain lucky could attend the School for Gifted Unicorns. But no more is that the case. The cash injection that has been performed by the Crown has been immensely helpful in broadening the appeal and fields of the School for Gifted Unicorn. Having moved most of the facilities from the older, historical, if cramped quarters in the core of Canterlot to a more modernized place in the outskirts of Canterlot, the new sprawling campus will be able to more adequately handle the many breakthroughs and inventions that are being pumped out of Equestria's scientific community. Many of the new students and faculty have been some of Griffonia's brightest that have fled the political turmoil in Wingbardy and some parts of the Empire for more fertile lands. They have certainly found them here in Equestria."
 #equestria.4.d_sol:0 "In the past, it was all too often of an occurrence, that those of rich families simply used their family wealth to buy their foal a place in the school. Often this lead to students not valuing the opportunity to study there and as such lowered quality of the graduates. Furthermore, it has let moral rot seep into our society ever so slightly. This sets an undesirable precedent that our Empress can no longer tolerate. Today Her Imperial Majesty agreed to a proposal to fund the School for Gifted Unicorns from Imperial Treasury directly in form of annual cash injections. These new funds will be used to refurbish classrooms and other school facilities, as well as better equipment and supplies. This also gives the Crown more power and control over the curriculum of the school. Starting this semester, the school will besides be focusing on magic also teach religious and moral values. This will ensure that the next generation will grow into upstanding model citizens of society."

Nothing symbolized that seriousness more than the long scroll that had been brought to Prince Rutherford, expertly written in elegant ponish on the finest Equestrian parchment, and already signed by both diarchs of Equestria. There was just one small problem with it.\n\nAlmost no yak could read the exceedingly formal script. Fortunately, an official diplomat had been sent from Canterlot with the entire document already memorized to read aloud to the yaks of Rutherford's court. Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie had also decided to give commentary on the exceedingly formal language of the document, which was a blessing or a curse depending on who you asked in the room.\n\n"...which hereby solidifies cordial relations between the Principality of Equestria and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan in perpetuity, agreed upon by the sovereigns of each nation." The diplomat, an old earth pony stallion with a long grey beard, finally finished his reading of the treaty and bowed to the Prince and his entourage, who all looked to Pinkie Pie standing off to the side.\n\n"What he means is that we all Pinkie Promise to always be super duper friends and help each other out whenever we need it! It also means that I can throw the biggest party in Yakyakistan EVER!" Pinkie was already bouncing up and down at the mere thought of it, while the Prince and the other yaks nodded before looking at each other. Rutherford stomped once - the elders stomped back. They nodded at him - he nodded back.\n\n"Yakyakistan still in difficult time!" he finally proclaimed, causing even Pinkie to stop bouncing and listen attentively. "Many disagreements between yaks, still needs fixing! Yaks believe we need focus on yak issues, not pony issues!"\n\nPinkie frowned, and her mane threatened to deflate like it did during the yovidaphone incident. "PINK PONY NO CRY YET!" Rutherford yelled loud enough to shake the pony's eyeballs around. "Yak never forget friendship. Friendship of pink pony, and all ponyland! When pony call, yak will always answer!" Another yak brought forth an almost comedically large quill, which the Prince used to sign the document before adding his royal seal with a loud slam.\n\nThe excitement in Pinkie's eyes returned faster than the snap of a hoof. "Yay!" she said bouncing all across the room. "Ooh, I'll need to get my super-duper party cannon for this one! Come on, we have a party to throw!" The Equestrian diplomat, who had only nodded politely and had turned to leave found himself dragged faster than the speed of sound out the door by the party pony, the yaks all laughing uproariously at the antics of their old new friend."

 #equestria.5.d:0 "Today, what was once a pipe dream in the minds of the researchers of the Luna Nova Academy has been made reality. Made possible with the massive injection of funds from the Crown, the Luna Nova Academy has moved from its older campus to the newer, more modern magically-powered campus. Housed in the old clocktower outside of Ponyville, the laboratories and study halls stretch deep underground, with several testing areas housed both above and below ground. With the new facilities, several old inventions which had been put in mothballs by lack of funds, facilities or both have been pulled out and begun field testing, and depending on what is chosen at the highest level, may see full-scale deployment within the year.\n\nIt is expected that the institution's patron, HM Princess Luna will make a visit to the place in the very near future."

Academy dormitories will also get its due expansions and renovations to make sure these students have a place to live and improve living standards. Lastly, Her Imperial Majesty did not make any demands per se. However, during her meeting with the Dean, she expressed her 'strong' desire to see more focus on magical theory and practice to raise better mages, not to forget the emphasis she made regarding technology, chemistry, physics and other natural sciences as well as focus on religious and ethical upbringing."

 equestria.5.t:0 "Arrival of the Exiles"
 equestria.5.d:0 "The last time Prince Rutherford had visited Equestria in a manner like this, it had nearly ended with the Kingdom of Yakyakistan declaring war upon Equestria. One could perhaps, if looking for it, find irony in the fact then that he had returned not as a Prince, or as an enemy, but as an exile. Him and thousands of other yaks, all following their former monarch to the first friends they found outside of Yakyakistan. Pinkie Pie had personally requested (or demanded according to some) to accompany the yaks from Whinnyapolis to their destination of Canterlot. Now she stood with an oddly contemplative expression to one side as the Prince stood before Princess Celestia, alone on her throne.\n\n"We are deeply troubled by the news coming out of Yakyakistan," the alicorn said to Rutherford and his entourage consisting of a few elders who had chosen to come with him in exile and the former student of the School of Friendship, Yona. "I wish we only could have done more to help before it was too late. Should you wish to stay, Equestria will welcome you with open hooves for as long as you need."\n\nThe yak nodded in agreement. "Home of yaks fall to evil forces. Ponyland also in danger by same forces! Yaks fight with ponies, make sure not suffer same fate as Yakyakistan!"\n\nYona stepped forward as well, the Prince giving a nod in agreement to allow her to speak. "Maybe yaks return home to Yakyakistan someday, maybe not," she said, her voice laced with just a twinge of bitterness which quickly disappeared. "But yaks never let down pony friends no matter what! Yaks protect Equestria, just like ponies do!"\n\nPinkie looked at Yona and Rutherford for a second before her head turned to see Celestia's response, a single light nod. "Equestria would never refuse help from its friends," she said softly, at least compared to the yaks.\n\n"Good!" Rutherford practically yelled back. "Pony princess have no choice in matter anyway. Exile makes yaks mad, want to SMASH something!" All the yaks barring Yona started stomping the ground as hard as they could, which was thankfully magically reinforced. All the commotion caused the Royal Guards to storm in to see what the noise was, then staring confused at the display of violence against the palace floor.\n\nAnd despite everything, the slightest twinge of a smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle."

 #equestria.6.t:0 "Public Schools Funding"
 #equestria.6.d:0 "Even with the strengthening of higher learning, we must all remember that the ABC's and 123's come first. The overhaul of the public school system in Equestria has been long overdue, still teaching subjects and topics that have been mentioned as being outdated 'when Coltlumbus made landfall in New Mareland'. Hyperbole, to be sure, but a damning indictment of the state of education nonetheless before our reforms. The recent reform package that we have just rolled out into the school system has provided for a good and modern education for the fillies and colts of Equestria. When they go forth and receive new education, they will carry with them a new world in their hearts."

 equestria.6.d:0 ""You know," the Equestrian representative said in Chairpony Vasily's office, "this is momentous. We've always hoped we can finally pave a way for understanding between our countries."\n\n"You say that as if you can get away with both-sidesism," Vasily said, "and it is true that Equestria is in dire need of an awakening, make no mistake, but I do not want a conflict that will surely kill as many of the Equestrian proletariat as will ours."\n\n"It would be unharmonic to go straight to war, after all," she said. She'd delivered with her a hefty proposal: On the grounds that both Severyana and Equestria would recognise each other as neutral parties hoping for reconciliation, both nations would detente with one another, with provisions to limit the build-up of military forces along each other's borders.\n\nOn the one hoof, such a proposal would ensure Equestria's non-intervention against Severyana's future plans, providing the SCP the unspoken guarantee that they could wholly focus on more fruitful pro-revolutionary activities in the north. However, to cosy up with the very imperialist paradise that they had rebelled from not two decades ago did not have good optics nor implications. Such a deal could set a dangerous precedent, a contradiction of its own in a post-state society catering to socially backwards and oppressive Equestria.\n\nAn hour would pass in calm discussion and debate. Vasily then turned the document back to her. "Thank you for your time, miss...""

While it is by no means certain that something will ever come of it, the Cabinet and several other prominent ponies with roles to play in an hypothetical war have secretly been recalled to Canterlot in order to draw up plans. Time of the essence, as a war has been judged to be near-forthcoming and if the predictions in the Dotted Line Report are to be avoided, then Equestria must truly take radical and controversial measures to survive the storm ahead.\n\nThree separate lines of development are to be taken. To reform the bureaucracy and political system, to renovate the military and to reach out to form a broad coalition of ponies and creatures, whatever creed they may subscribe to."

But storm clouds have been gathering over the last five years and we can no longer afford to ignore the defence of the realm. The War Council has been expanded with several new ponies with relevant experience which shall serve as some of the top advisors to Princess Celestia for the time being. While some protests have been recorded amongst the established hierarchy as 'usurping the traditional levers of power', in public, all agree that it has been a necessary step if Equestria is to survive the storm ahead.\n\nSeveral high-ranking military officers have been slated to join the Council in the near future, should the Crown call upon them."

Even if it will cost us, and will pain us to do so, we must go to Stalliongrad and ask them for help in this fight for life or death that we are embroiled in.\n\nHowever, there is a vocal wing in the War Council that advocate not selling out thousands of ponies to live under Stalliongrad when it is very well possible that we can defeat the changelings ourselves. The choice of action has thusly ultimately fallen to the Crown. We can choose to ask, knowing that there will be a price, or we can bet on us being able to defeat the changelings by ourselves."

She was given a heroine's welcome in the city of Vanhoover, the largest Olenian community outside of the Kingdom proper. The city had long been a hotbed for resistance against Johan, both Legitimists favouring the restoration of Queen Velvet and communists favouring a restructuring along the lines of Stalliongrad. Common for both, however, is that she has long been a focal point for resistance against Johan, whatever their creed may be. Of course that is where the similarities end, but that's a matter for another time.\n\nQueen Velvet has settled nicely into Vanhoover, having already begun advocating that Equestria should intervene in Olenia to restore 'rightful rule' to Olenia."

This is an insult to all buffalo!"\n\n"It's not like that at all!" Little Strongheart argued back, shouting above the cries of many buffalo who voiced their dissent. "The ponies are our friends, and they just want to help us! But they can't do that if we keep to ourselves and fight against everything different! Joining Equestria doesn't make us any less of who we are!"\n\nMany more buffalo started talking amongst themselves, seeming to agree with Strongheart's words. "It gets rid of everything we are!" the Elder shot back, outraged. "We would consign ourselves to a future chosen by ponies, not buffalo! They will never have our interests in mind, nor do they care for our traditions. The fact we are even considering this is an affront to all our ancestors!"\n\nThunderhooves grunted in deep contemplation. "The Equestrians have taken much from us already," he said slowly and authoritatively. Many buffalo nearby nodded. "The buffalo have lasted for centuries on our own. We do not need the ponies to solve our issues."\n\n"But we don't need to do everything on our own either," Strongheart pleaded. "Please, understand that this isn't the end for anything we care about.

"Dash, whether we call ourselves Equestrians or not doesn't change who we are. We keep our traditions alive by how we act and what we do, not through keeping ourselves separate from others. Besides, I believe we can learn a lot from pony traditions, just like how you can learn from us!"\n\n"Yeah, but still..."

Celestia did not mind the use of her archaic title; it was one the buffalo had retained for her, even as the centuries passed and it was lost in the minds of others.\n\n"Thank you." The buffalo took a few steps forward, seemingly a bit reluctant to speak at first. "I came here today because I was talking with some of the other buffalo, and we decided that we should do something to defend Equestria too!"\n\nThe princess tilted her head slightly at the sudden outburst. "What do you mean by that?" she asked, more curious than confused.\n\nStrongheart wasted no time in continuing, regaining her confidence as she did so. "We learned years ago that you have to be ready to fight to protect your traditions. Buffalo and ponies may have had differences, but all of us need to work together now to protect them! So please, let us stay here and do our part!"\n\n"But what about your home?" Celestia asked. "Aren't you needed there to lead?"\n\n"Equestria is my home, Day Bringer. And Chief Thunderhooves agreed that I could do more for the buffalo here in Canterlot while he remains chief of the tribes. This is what I want to do."\n\nCelestia gently nodded. "Then of course you can stay here, Little Strongheart." Standing up from her throne, the alicorn walked down to stand in front of the buffalo, her face full of gratitude and kindness.

 equestria.38.d:0 "The Raven Inkwell report, barring its name, was relatively unremarkable in comparison to the other files that would make their way to Princess Celestia throughout the entire past decade. The prose was exceedingly formal and full of legalese, which partially explained the sheer scale of the stack of papers which made up the report. Of course, few would expect anything else from Celestia's personal assistant; the mare was notoriously meticulous, and had been working on the task of compiling Equestria's domestic situation for years now in her spare time.\n\nMuch of the contents of the report were all issues Princess Celestia expected to see being raised. Equestria's industrialisation was slowing to a crawl outside of the major cities, the curriculum at many schools was becoming outdated and needed revising, and more funding would need to be allocated to critical state institutions. Nothing too notable or controversial.\n\nHowever, the second half of the report painted a much more cynical picture. The thestrals remained an issue which would need to be addressed sooner or later. The Equestrian bureaucracy, the very thing which had helped compile all this information, was far too large for its own good. In particular, scathing criticism was leveled at the open court and the wealthy ponies which both made up the upper class of Canterlot and served in many cases as unofficial royal advisors, much to the detriment of the nation. And worst of all, the problems presented at the most recent Grand Equestrian Pony Summit were very real, and could only require a spark to ignite into full blown chaos in the autonomous regions.\n\n"These suggested reforms are... quite extensive, Raven," Celestia commented as she set the massive file off to one side. "Are you certain all of this is truly necessary?"\n\n"Princess, with all due respect, not every problem in Equestria can be solved by you or Princess Twilight and her friends traveling to fix it themselves. Even Fancy Pants has recognized that his peers need to be reined in for the good of Equestria. And if we want to make real change in places like Baltimare and Las Pegasus, it needs to start here."\n\nThe alicorn nodded in agreement.

How is a pegasus or unicorn supposed to carry them home?"\n\n"Pound told me that he and Pumpkin share so that they each only have to bring half of them home.

But with the turning of the new millennium, ever since her sister had finally returned, there was just so much to do. Overseeing the military reforms with her nephew, keeping up with international diplomacy... Celestia would be forever grateful to her subjects in Canterlot like Raven who even made it possible, but they could only do so much as well. She could only hope it would be enough.\n\nThe door across the royal hall opened. "You're up early, sister," Celestia noted as the younger diarch walked in to take a seat across the table. "Is there something the matter?"\n\nLuna nodded silently. She instinctively pulled a pineapple from the nearby fruit bowl with magic before hesitating and grabbing the plate of pancakes in front of her instead. "Sister, about the thestrals... we both know it isn't right."\n\nOf course it was the thestrals. Luna had been uneasy about the subject ever since she had toured Equestria again years ago to see how the land had changed in her absence. "I agree that things are not... perfect between them and the rest of Equestria," Celestia responded, trying to be delicate, "but don't you think we should wait until things are safer to try and fix that? Your return has already done much for them, and with everything else going on-"\n\n"My return?" The words were faint, so much so that Celestia could barely hear them, but they were there. Luna's magic dissipated around her utensils as she stood up to slam a hoof on the table. "Their situation is my fault! If I only could have seen a world where you and I ruled together, where they and the rest of ponykind lived in Harmony... sister, you must let me fix this! I cannot bear to see my loyal subjects like this any longer!"\n\nCelestia's ears pinned back as she flinched from Luna's outburst. She could still remember that time long ago, after she was forced to use the Elements of Harmony against her. How the thestrals retreated from Equestrian society, shunned by their fellow ponies. Celestia had tried to fix things, to repair the damage caused by the loss of their princess, but with Luna gone and neither side willing to integrate... she never had the strength to see it through.

 equestria.52.d:0 "The royal hall was filled with ponies as Princess Luna watched from behind the stage, her nerves fraying. When she had instructed the palace servants to spread the word throughout Equestria that she would be giving an announcement concerning the thestrals, she never expected this many to show up in Canterlot to listen. Back in the old times, there would be ten, perhaps fifteen ponies in her court to spread news of her decrees. Now there were well over a hundred, from the Canterlot elite and rich businessponies to normal citizens and journalists, all waiting for their Diarch to come up and speak. Luna tried to remember the advice her sister had given her before leaving Canterlot to attend to business in Fillydelphia; speak slowly but with authority, remain honest without alarming ponies, and always keep control of the situation.\n\nAs she stepped forward onto the stage, the crowd of ponies went silent. Luna could see a few thestrals dispersed throughout the crowd as well, which was good. This was something they needed to hear as much as anypony else. "Ponies!" the Princess of the Night began, keeping her voice steady. "Equestria has long been a place of friendship, harmony, and unity among the three tribes. We have shared traditions and ceremonies for countless moons, bringing us closer together. But for too long have we left out our own fellow ponies, the thestrals. It is time to rectify that."\n\n"To my thestrals, who remained loyal to me even when I did not deserve it, I ask for your trust in this. Your place is together with Equestria, not separated and alone from the rest of ponykind. You must choose to make the first step and offer a hoof to unicorns, earth ponies and pegasi so that all thestralkind can stand as a true fourth tribe."\n\n"And to the rest of Equestria, I ask you to put aside your worries, and instead greet your fellow ponies with open hooves. We grow stronger by understanding and accepting the differences between us, and I am certain that with time, thestrals will be just as much a part of Equestrian life as the three tribes are, with a shared history and place to call home."\n\nLuna paused to see the reactions of the ponies listening. A few of them were nodding along, with a few others rapidly jotting down notes with paper and pen. Most, however, including the thestrals just stared at her.

Some inquiring, some accusatory, all of them unanswerable over the wave of sound and light that assaulted Luna. Finally, she fell back on old habits. "SILENCE!" she yelled in the Royal Canterlot Voice, causing everypony else to step back, ears wilted. "I, um, understand that there may be some concerns over this, so there will be a, ah, referendum! Yes, a referendum for all four tribes, so Equestria can decide on this together.

That was the last thing the thestrals needed! She could pass decrees and push reforms with the help of her sister as long as opposition from the common pony was minimal, but not when she promised a popular vote on the matter! And it was not just about winning it; any close vote would only show how deep Equestrian divisions on the matter went, and would be just as likely to convince the thestrals to retreat back into isolation. She would need Equestria to overwhelmingly vote in favor of integration, to silence any neighsayers and prove the good intentions of both sides.\n\nBut to try and convince all of Equestria... it was next to impossible. She had not even been in this time for a decade, and there was still so much she didn't know! And very few ponies knew her, except for Princess Twilight and her friends, and of course the few ponies she had befriended while doing her duties in the dream realm. This new world of popular consensus, of politics and ideology, she knew nothing of how to navigate it. If only things worked like she remembered, when will of force was what dictated what would be...\n\nLuna shut her eyes. No, she could not let herself slip back there. This was a better time, a world her sister had created. She needed to find her place in it, on her own terms. She wouldn't let herself fall back into her old ways, back into... her. But when the alternative was failing her thestrals yet again, letting them fall back into the forgotten corners of history from yet another of her mistakes...\n\nIt was too much. She couldn't do it on her own. Maybe... she could just let this sit for a bit. Wait until her sister returned, and decide on the best course of action from there. Luna hated being so dependent on her fellow diarch like this, but what else was there to do? Twilight and her friends were surely too busy with their own lives to help.

But her place would always be in Ponyville with her friends, not in the high society of the capital.\n\nThis, however was an exception. When the Cutie Map called, she had answered, and when it told her that Canterlot was her destination, both she and Twilight already knew why she was needed. The Princess had already gone into quite the tizzy following Luna's announcement; Rarity would have to talk with her about that the next time she saw Twilight.\n\nThe Royal Guard let her in wordlessly, doors opening to reveal the two diarchs of Equestria in deep discussion. Both fell silent when the noticed the unicorn enter, Celestia being the first to speak. "What brings you to Cantrlot, Rarity?" she said, her voice revealing a hint of nervousness. "Is there something we can help you with?"\n\n"Actually, it was the Cutie Map that sent me," Rarity replied with a tone already making clear there would be no beating around the bush. "And I believe we all know why it would send me here."\n\nLuna sighed, a clear admission of guilt. "My sister and I were just discussing that. It seems that there is a limit for what even she can do in this regard."\n\n"Sister..." The signs of Celestia's discomfort only grew. "You know I would do anything I could to help. But with how public this is now, I fear my involvement would only deepen any suspicions the thestrals have towards this whole debacle. They have been reluctant to even speak with me on matters ever since..." The alicorn trailed off, every pony in the room already aware of what she was referring to.\n\n"Well, we all have things in the past we'd rather forget," Rarity replied trying to change the subject, "but what matters is what we do now, darling. Now that Princess Luna has opened the door, there's so much we can accomplish if we just put our best into it!"\n\nThe Princess of the Night looked up at the unicorn. "You believe we can still do this?" she asked.\n\n"I believe you can do this, darling. Ponies look up to you, Princess Luna, far more than you may realize.

Both the mayor and the local Moonspeaker had given permission for her to speak to the large crowd of thestrals gathered in the center of town. Now she was behind the stage, legs slightly wobbling as she remembered the fiasco back in Canterlot.\n\n"Darling, there's no need to be so worried!" Rarity said trying to calm Luna's fraying nerves. "You're not just a Princess, you're their Princess. You are the one in control here, no matter what the papers or ponies in Canterlot might say. As long as you believe in this, they will too. Just speak from your heart."\n\nThe alicorn took a deep breath and focused herself for a moment, before steadily walking up to the makeshift podium the city had made for her.

Luna watched a filly excitedly point at her to her parents before sitting to stare with rapt attention.\n\n"Ponies!" Luna began, finding her verbal footing. "Thestrals! First, I can not begin to thank you for the loyalty you've shown me since I returned. Even when the rest of Equestria forgot me, you did not, and I can never express my gratitude enough for that. But the time has come for all of us to come out of the dark, and embrace who we all are as ponies, I understand the fear, the desire to stay back and away from others that misunderstand who you are, but that isn't the Equestrian way. It shouldn't be our way. We don't have to be different from them, because in the end we're more like each other than we know."\n\nEvery thestral was now listening to Princess Luna, hanging on to ever word she said.

Of course, not all of them were his tribal kin; a pegasi and an earth pony were the ones to greet him in salute before he waved them off to approach one of the weapon containers. "I assume everything went according to plan?" he asked, to which he received everything from curt nods to cries of success.\n\n"Those supplies you provided really did the job, sir," a thestral replied, handing him a Lavender-model rifle for him to examine. "Blew the train straight off the rails, and there was barely any opposition just like you said. How was Hollow Shades?"\n\nSharp rolled his eyes. "More platitudes made by the false goddess to attempt to sway ponies into supporting that ridiculous referendum of hers. Even worse, they were falling for her lies no doubt put in her muzzle by the sun tyrant."\n\nA few thestrals gave stomps of disapproval at that; there was nothing that riled them up more than even a mere mention of the elder Diarch. One of the ponies raised her hoof; Sharp waved one of his own to grant permission to speak. "With all due respect, sir... isn't this a bit risky? We disposed of the bodies according to your instructions and I know it'll be filed as an accident, but won't the Equestrians start digging into this eventually? This is much more than our usual operations."\n\nHe nodded. "It is, because we need to be bold now more than ever. Her return is fast approaching now, and we must be as well prepared as possible to strike when the hour is right. By the time the Equestrians realize our plans, it will be too late for them. The sun tyrant will fall and the night will reign as it should forevermore.\n\nThere were more cheers of approval. "Now get back to loading those crates!" he snapped, the ponies hurrying back to their tasks of unloading the train. "We don't have all night, after all!""

The tight urban sprawl meant that even the most traveled of visitors could easily get lost in the maze of streets and alleyways were they not paying attention. Nopony knew that fact better than Midnight Star, who had chosen only the most secluded part of the city to hold the meeting she had summoned the others to. She was one of the few thestrals there; most were pegasi or unicorns, natural candidates to blend into the Manehattan bustle.\n\n"I assume all of you have kept up to date on things?" she asked, to which a score of nods was the response she got. "Good. Then I'm sure you know that Luna has chosen Manehattan as where to end her campaign on the eve of the referendum. Command has decided that that will be the night to strike, while the Equestrians are distracted. Our new mission is to ensure this city is ready for that moment."\n\nThere were some whispers, a few doubting voices in the small crowd. "All of us?" one spoke up. "For the entire city? Are they send us more aid to accomplish something like that?"\n\n"No," Midnight responded flatly, silencing the rest of the ponies attempting to speak up. "But they do not expect us to do this alone either. This city is fertile ground for turning the unfaithful to our cause, so long as we do not reveal our true intentions. So long as we can plant suspicions of the sun tyrant in their minds, they will accept any narrative we tell them later."\n\nThe whispers rose to murmurings, then questions and rebuttals between ponies. "There are many here leading efforts to promote thestral integration in Manehattan and beyond," one spoke up above the rest to Midnight. "If we approach them, they will filter down that distrust to the entire city by the time the Lunar Princess arrives."\n\n"The campaign organizers?" another responded. "That would attract far too much attention. It would be best to stick to the ground, speak to individuals so as to not reveal ourselves before the time is right."\n\n"And convince ten or twenty ponies in the entire city!" a third shouted out from the back.\n\n"Silence!"

He was no thestral himself, he was just a pegasus with a cutie mark in public speaking. But hearing the Princess of Night speak from her heart in Canterlot inspired him, lit a fire he didn't know he had. He and a few friends he knew had started the campaign here, attracting thousands to the cause of supporting Luna's efforts and bringing attention to the thestrals who had long since been forgotten.\n\nYesterday, though... it had been interesting. He had been approached by a few new ponies, ones he had never met before despite being generally knowledgable about the locals of Manehattan. They had congratulated him on the success of his efforts, and spoke of their own efforts in the southeastern jungles of Equestria as well as westwards in Canterlot and beyond. They had got along well, but there was something that still troubled Bright Light. They had also mentioned Celestia, and of her absence in all of this. Of those in Canterlot and elsewhere that would want to see the referendum fail, by any means necessary. And worst of all, that they might even be able to sway Celestia herself into aiding them, whether she wanted to or not.\n\nBright Light had always believed in Celestia and harmony. But the though that she might be against Luna's campaign... it troubled him. He would likely have to bring up the concern at the next meeting with the other organizers, see how they felt abou it as well. After all, if they were going to bring tue integration to all four tribes, they would have to push foward with or without Celestia's help."

 equestria.60.d:0 "The thestral communities in the mountains that surrounded the badlands did not get visitors very often. Ayacachtli was different; as the cultural capital of thestralkind, it often received an influx of visitors be they potential moonspeakers coming to study the old ways, or new historians to learn of the ancient history in the southeast. That city was the exception, not the rule, and whatever other villages and towns that dotted the mountain range were usually left on their own.\n\nToday though, something had changed. There was a group of newcomers, a few thestrals who had seemed tired and in a hurry. Crescent Star had been the first to meet them at the outskirts of his village, and the first to learn why they were there. Now, he was back at home, sitting with his wife and daughter as he stared out the window in deep thought.\n\n"I don't like them one bit," the mare next to him said, clearly upset. "Celestia may have banished the Princess long ago, but she has always left us alone during her reign. The idea that she could be working against her own sister, just to keep us out..."\n\n"Celestia has always put the stability of Equestria above everything else," Crescent reminded her. "I would not be surprised if she chose that over even her own sister."\n\nThe mare rolled her eyes in annoyance. "I can see you inherited your father's biases as much as you have his isolationism. Can't you think of our filly first for once? Ever since Luna began her campaign, I've never seen her more excited to listen to the Princess."\n\nCrescent glanced towards her daughter, who was at the radio listening closely to another one of Luna's speeches. It was true that she had been much cheerier since Luna had begun her efforts across Equestria. She had already asked if all of them could go to see Princess Luna on the eve of the referendum in person in Manehattan. He hadn't found it in his heart to say no, but going up north to the heart of Equestria, away from the safety of home... "It doesn't matter anyway," he finally responded. "The village council and Moonspeaker has already reached a consensus on what to do."\n\n"Well, what did they say?"

"We can't trust Celestia, and Luna has too many enemies. When the time comes and the Sun Princess shows her true colors, many ponies will rise up to stand against her, and we must join them when the time is right."\n\nCrescent's wife shook her head, grabbing his daughter and leading her away from the room. "You've gone insane," she said, disappointment laced in her voice. "All you're doing is making the situation worse, and leading us all into a war we're going to lose no matter what happens. Do whatever you want, but keep us out of it." She shut the door behind her, leaving Crescent alone with his thoughts.\n\nMaybe she was right. Maybe he was blinded by the past, by paranoia and anger and whatever else those newcomers had awoken within him. But he couldn't just sit around and do nothing, either. The new thestrals had promised shipments of weapons and proper training to use them within the month.

"Nothing like that," the former finally retorted. "Haven't you heard some of the stories coming out of the deep southeast, though? Everypony knows that there's still cultists in those parts. And it isn't like the thestrals always put their best hoof forward for us, either.\n\n"So does that mean you're voting no for the referendum?"\n\nSilver looked uncomfortable. "No," he answered, a bit slow and unsteady for his usual talking speed. "I don't know. Celestia's staying quiet on this whole thing, and that's what worries me.

"Oh, Celestia," he muttered while checking to make sure his rifle was close by and loaded. "That's worse than I thought."\n\n"What?" Purple hissed back. "What is it?" As he risked a glance himself, he quickly saw the cause for alarm: ponies, clad in dark robes and Nightmarist symbols. A lot of them. And judging by the weapons they were holding, the very ones they were looking for stolen from the shipment, he guessed they weren't here to make friends. "Ah, horseapples," he muttered while sliding back down. "Cultists."\n\n"I've been tracking them for the past few minutes," the scout whispered, giving as much of a salute as he could while pressing himself to the ground. "It looks like they're about to move out to the northwest, probably towards Whinnyapolis."\n\nSilver Spear nodded. "Rally the other guards," he ordered. "If we're quick we can still engage with the element of surprise, and press an advantage while we have it."\n\nPurple Heart blinked, then elbowed the other guard and shook his head rapidly. "Sir, with all due respect, are you insane?" he asked, motioning to the cultists below them with his head. "Even if we did get everypony back in time, they'd still heavily outnumber us. There's no way we can beat them in an engagement."\n\n"Well, do you have a better idea?"\n\n"We retreat and hurry back to Canterlot as fast as possible," he responded flatly. "The Princess will know what to do, but we won't get any help if she doesn't even know what's going on here! If there's anything like this going on anywhere else, Equestria is in serious danger."\n\n"Sir?" Both guards looked at the scout, who sank down further into the earth.

Should we move to intercept them?"\n\n"Obviously!" one voice cried out from the middle of the crowd of ponies. "With our numbers we could easily overrun them before they even get close to the capital! Come on, let's get moving!" More cries and shouts of agreement echoed out through the night sky before they were silence by the sound of gunfire.

And besides, this matter is not up for discussion.

"Of course, Princess, though her returning to Canterlot is likely to interfere with the schedule of her efforts involving the referendum. Is there something wrong?"\n\nThe alicorn sighed, using her magic to sort the remaining papers on her desk into a neat stack and putting them off to the side. "As a matter of fact, Raven, there is," she said, allowing her voice to betray her weariness. "There have been many concerning reports from all over Equestria coming in ever since my sister announced her campaign. Weapons shipments going missing, ponies becoming unusually hostile, and isolated thestral communities becoming increasingly reclusive. Flash Magnus even notified me that the Royal Guard had found groups of cultists loyal to Nightmare Moon."\n\n"Do you believe that-"\n\n"No," Celestia answered firmly, already finishing Raven's unspoken question. "My sister would never. But I do believe there are dark forces at play here that neither of us can be blind against. I had hoped that Luna would be able to do this alone, but it is too dangerous now. We must rethink things before Equestria falls apart completely."\n\nRaven Inkwell bowed her head silently.

"I didn't want to intervene in your campaign, especially so close to the referendum. But this... we both see how dangerous it is to continue. Tomorrow, we will announce together that the referendum will be delayed until we can ensure Equestria's safety."\n\n"Sister..." Luna looked away from the elder alicorn, her eyes starting to water. "These past few weeks... I have not been attending to my duties in the dream realm as I should have. And if everything we fear turns to be true, then that would explain much about my recent sleep." She took a step forward, looking back upwards into Celestia's eyes with thinly-veiled desperation. "Sister, I know the Nightmare is at work here.

Celestia realized instantly what it meant; she rushed forward, embracing her fellow diarch even as she grew taller and her coat darkened. "Please... don't go," the princess whispered, tears already falling. "I'm sorry you had to pay for my mistakes. I love you, Luna."\n\nLuna - Nightmare Moon hesitated for a moment. Stiffly yet gently, she returned the hug with a single foreleg.

The ponies bowed their heads and hurried away, the two holding Rarity dragging her back into the streets of Manehattan.\n\nThe Nightmare turned to watch the sun as it continued its ascent over the harbor in the distance. It had been a moment of weakness, nothing more. A false display of sympathy brought on by a weaker form. She had no place for love when only one princess could rule Equestria. But Nightmare Moon still remembered her sister's wings wrapped around her, her desperate pleas to stay with her. And for a brief moment, perhaps she did wish that there was another way.\n\n"There is no going back," she said quietly to herself. Nightmare Moon turned away from the rising sun.

Despite the early springing of their plot keeping them at a disadvantage, many expect that Equestria will fall quickly against the might of the newly-proclaimed Lunar Empire.\n\nAs the lines are drawn in the dirt, brother goes against brother and Equestria, once the land of friendship and harmony, finds itself split in twain. Nopony knows who will be left standing when the dust settles, but only one thing is for certain; Equestria will never be the same."

 equestria.85.d:0 ""Sergeant Flash Magnus reporting for duty, Your Highness!"\n\nPrincess Celestia regarded the ancient hero before her, still wearing his armor from the Royal Legion of Cloudsdale. It stirred a bit of sentimentality in the alicorn; she could remember back in the earliest days when it was still in use by the pegasi. It was only shortly after Luna's banishment that the Legion was disbanded and absorbed into either the Royal Guard or the Wonderbolts. Their last captain became the first Captain of the Royal Guard - yet another case of history repeating itself now. Celestia always appreciated the cyclical nature of history.\n\n"Rise, Flash Magnus," she commanded. Those in the guard usually appreciated the sacred nature of ceremony, and Flash was certainly no different. "With Prince Shining Armor predisposed in the Crystal Empire, I am in need of a new Captain. Do you accept this duty, and swear to lead the Protective Pony Platoons in the defence of Equestria and its creatures until your last breath?"\n\n"I do, Your Highness."\n\n"Then by the authority invested in me by the Three Tribes of Equestria, I hereby name you the new Captain of the Royal Guard. May you serve with distinction and honor." The alicorn dipped her head to touch each of the pegasus' shoulders with her horn. Once she was finished Flash Magnus gave a single salute before turning and marching back down the Royal Hall, the Royal Guards stationed now saluting him in turn.\n\nIt was a bit of a shame, having to replace Shining Armor. He had served well as the Captain ever since Celestia had been forced to sack his predecessor due to the Stalliongrad incident. But with his duties in the Crystal Empire now, it was simply impossible for him to maintain an active role in Canterlot with his duties. Perhaps in an earlier time this would not have been a problem, but now... well, she needed someone with dilligence and competence to turn the outdated Royal Guard into something for the modern era.\n\n"Fare thee well, Captain Magnus," Celestia said quietly, slipping back into an older tongue. "We wish you the best of luck.""

"It was not. I was always in your service, even as your tutor."\n"Why the formality?" Luna asked. "You seem rather serious."\nStar Swirl let out a heavy sigh. "I requested this meeting because... it is finally time."\nThe alicorns stopped smiling. "You've decided to go on that journey you spoke of?" Celestia asked.\nHe nodded. "I've explored enough of Equestria. I am eager to see how the rest of the world has changed in my absence. You might remember, I was quite the adventurer back in the day," he said in a tone that tried to enlighten the mood. "Besides, I wish to learn how to befriend folks from other races and cultures."\n"You could just go to Twilight's School of Friendship for that," Luna quipped, half-joking, half-serious.\n"Yes but... there are so many places I want to visit. The caves of Maretania, the eastern ponies, Scorpan's homeland... and all the new technology developed in my absence should make it far safer and easier."\n"Safer?" Celestia said. "We know you'll be safe. You taught us magic when we were younger, after all."\n"You don't need to hide your worry from me. There are many dangers out there, and while the limbo kept me from aging, my body is still more decrepit than yours. Yet... if this is the last thing I do, then so be it."\nLuna was struggling to maintain her composure. "Y-you came back but a few years ago, it is just a shame you are absent so often... when you return, will you promise to stay?"\nAnxiety was gone from Star Swirl's eyes as he smiled. "I promise.

But if I hear a single thing come from you two," she continued, pointing a hoof right up in each of their faces, "anything like your old tricks, and I'll make sure the both of you are sent right back to Las Pegasus."\n\nFlim and Flam gave mock bows.

Twilight (not you, the Princess Twilight over here) is just trying to keep Equestria from falling apart even more, and whenever I see her she looks even more exhausted then you do whenever you spend an all-nighter making something for the school science fair!\n\nBy the way, how are things going over there? Time works differently across the portal so I'm not entirely sure how long its been for all of you, but I think you girls are all still on break, right? I hope all of you can still enjoy the rest of your time off without me. I'll try to be back as soon as I can, once Equestria is safe and Princess Twilight doesn't need me here anymore. I also made sure to bring the picture Photo Finish took of us at the cornucopia, though I keep it hidden away from everypony else. It would be a bit weird explaining why I have a picture of all of Princess Twilight's friends here.\n\nWell, that's all I've got for now. Make sure to write back to me soon! I want to hear everything going on, especially if any more Equestrian magic gets loose again. (And no, Rainbow Dash, I will not help you cheat on your homework by just giving you the answers.

 equestria_civwar.1.d1:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle's mind was racing as she hurried into the makeshift war room in Canterlot, hurriedly giving her hellos to a few ponies before sitting down. Everything had happened so fast; Luna's thestral integration campaign had seemed to be going so well, and then the Nightmare struck, half of Equestria went dark, and the first reports of violence began trickling in from the new frontlines. War had been unthinkable for centuries, and the mere thought of pony killing pony... well, Twilight didn't want to think about it at all.\n\nLooking around, she was able to recognize quite a few ponies at the table. Prince Blueblood and Fancy Pants, both looking completely exhausted. Raven Inkwell, fiercely scribbling down notes on a sheet of paper as if it could be the difference between life and death. And all of her friends, all her fellow Element Bearers... with the exception of one. "Where's Rarity?" Twilight asked. "She's coming, right?"\n\n"I was just getting to that, Princess Twilight," Blueblood said, his voice as ragged as his appearence. "The Nightmare has caught us at a severe disadvantage, as it is clear they have been preparing for this for much longer than we have. It will take time to get Equestria in a state where we can push back, time we do not have. And as for the Element of Harmony, Miss Rarity..." The Prince trailed off for a moment. "...she has been captured by the Nightmare in Manehattan."\n\nTwilight and her friends all gasped in shock and horror, but Blueblood quickly put his hooves up to quiet them. "Rarity is fine," he continued, instantly calming the room down. "We know she is being safely held prisoner, and that does not seem like it will change soon. However, it does mean that you all will be unable to use your Elements of Harmony. The only way to end this war will be by force of arms, regrettable as it may be."\n\n"Wait, where's Princess Celestia?" Everypony looked towards Fluttershy, who seemed to sink a bit further into her chair. "Shouldn't she, um, be here to hear all this?"\n\nTwilight and Blueblood shared an uncomfortable glance. They both knew where she was; it was hard not to every time they walked past her chambers and heard the broken sobs coming from inside it. But all they ever saw was the locked door and the two guards always standing at attention, though neither would ever look Princess Twilight in the eyes. To do so would force both to face the truth, the reality of what the situation was.\n\nCelestia was gone, and nopony knew when she could come out again... or if she ever would."

However, due to the difficult terrain and resources available, their control over the wider region was tenuous at best. This has finally boiled over, as harmonists loyal to Celestia have regrouped in Stableside under the leadership of Daring Do, the previously assumed fictional character of A.K. Yearling's books. Having seized the city and much of the surrounding area, they have declared their loyalty to the real Equestria against the Nightmareists."

The Neighua, who have worshiped the sun and Celestia for over a millennium, quickly rose against the Lunar forces which would see them subjugated for freedom. What is surprising, however, is that they are being supported by a wide array of mercenaries, hired by none other than the formerly fictional character, Doctor Caballeron. Proclaiming himself to be the defender of the natives and fighting for their freedom, the newly-formed 'Aztlan Free State' has coalesced around Tenochtitlan to drive out all imperialists, whether they be Nightmareist or Equestrian."

In response to this dire situation, the remnants of the local forces loyal to the Nightmare have reorganized under Commander Stars Whirl, who leads the Disciples of the Night in attempting to reclaim the region and subdue the rebellions.

Now, with war spilling over and the buffalo once more becoming an issue, the south has chosen to taken things into their own hooves. Backed by big oil companies and other lobbying sources, the entire region has declared together an independent state from both Equestria and the Lunar Empire, free from the oppression of the alicorns in the north.

After Nightmare Moon has risen once again and plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to take up much of the administrative duties in Celestia's absence. That included filing through all the reports that the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them didn't paint a good picture of what was going on.\n\nPutting it straight, it was a complete mess. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was still clear that he couldn't lead and reform the entire Equestrian Army on his own. There just wasn't enough capable officers to lead the ponies willing to fight, causing chaos throughout all levels of the military. Blueblood would never admit it, but he needed somepony that could take some of the strain off of him from the top. But who in Equestria was capable of doing that? Twilight couldn't do it herself; she didn't know a single thing about militaries, and the palace staff needed her elsewhere as a Princess...\n\nTwilight's head snapped up. There was somepony... or rather, somebody who might be able to help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and frankly Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. In fact, she didn't even like the idea of trying to rope her into this whole mess. But it was the only pony Twilight could think of that might be able to handle what was needed.\n\n"Spike!"

It had been some trouble trying to keep the machinery she had installed on top of it intact, but she was fairly certain nothing had been damaged. What was more worrying was that there hadn't been any response from the journal yet. She was usually more punctual than this...\n\nThe surface of the mirror rippled, and out walked a amber unicorn on two legs. "Twilight!" Sunset Shimmer said, having difficulty trying to keep her balance upright before blinking and lowering herself on all fours. "Feels like it's been forever since the last time we've seen each other."\n\n"Well, the last time we saw each other you were leading an entire school's worth of ponies back through the portal," Twilight remarked. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything back at CHS-"\n\nSunset waved a hoof. "Nah, we're still on winter break.

Sunset rushed over to Twilight. "What happened?! Is Princess Celestia alright?"\n\nTwilight grimaced and looked away, which only worried the unicorn further. "She's fine... kind of," she answered evasively. "I'm sure you two can meet again later. Right now, we all need your help in stopping Nightmare Moon from taking over Equestria."\n\nSunset nodded.

She still slept as well; the Night Guard would whisper of the Princess crying out again during the darkest hours, begging for her sister to come back. But nopony still saw anything of her. The sun still shone with light, but it provided no warmth.\n\nThe guards stationed at the door looked at each other nervously. They were both new transfers to the castle, since all the Royal Guard with any real experience were sent off to the frontlines. At one point, they would have considering being the personal guard to Celestia a dream come true; instead, their nightmares had become manifest. Nopony knew what to expect anymore.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nBoth guards flinched, watching as Princess Celestia strode out into the hallway. She looked at one pony, then the other. "Where is Princess Twilight?" she asked, her voice still warm and empathetic. The Princess was impeccably dressed in her regalia, looking exactly like she had before she had locked herself away. If one saw her from a distance, they could not be blamed for seeing nothing wrong.\n\nBut her eyes betrayed her.\n\nThey were cold and empty. The warmth and comfort they provided were long gone, replaced by void.

Give up our biggest cities without a fight?"\n\n"We do not have a choice," Blueblood responded coolly, a sharp contrast to his colleague's aggression. "It is obvious that we will be unable to hold central Equestria, and what you are suggesting is lying to the ponies that live there. A quick victory against the Nightmare is impossible, so we must pull back and wear her down before striking back."\n\n"Blueblood has a point, Sunset," Princess Twilight said, attempting to defuse the argument. "Both of us ran the numbers together, and it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to hold back Nightmare Moon forever-"\n\n"Forget about the numbers!

"Pinkie?"\n\n"Hi, Twilight," the former party pony responded, mane completely straight and deflated. "I didn't know you'd be here."\n\n"Why are you here, Pinkie? Shouldn't you be back in Ponyville? I know your parents are still close to Rockville, but-"\n\n"They attacked Ponyville," Pinkie interrupted quietly. "Came from the Everfree while we were gone. The Cakes got hurt. They'll be okay, but..." The earth pony looked away. "I can't let any more friends get hurt, Twilight. The sooner this is all over, the sooner... maybe things will go back to normal."\n\nTwilight pulled Pinkie into a hug. "Please, just be careful." The earth pony gently embraced her back.\n\n"I promise, Twilight.""

Sunset Shimmer had entered yet another argument with Blueblood, as she had many times before. This time, it was about the ever-present issue of the thestrals. "If they want to fight, we should let them just like we would anyone else. Weren't you the one saying we needed more ponies to push the Nightmare back?"\n\n"Not at the expense of the effectiveness of our soldiers," Blueblood responded, a bit too dismissively for Celestia's liking. "As regrettable as it is, ponies do not trust the thestrals. We can not have soldiers busy having to look over their own soldiers, or civilians doubting in the ponies protecting them. We can let them fight, but in groups specific to their unique skillset."\n\n"There is a third option."\n\nBoth Blueblood and Sunset looked towards Princess Celestia in confusion. "Princess?" the former responded carefully. "What would you propose?"\n\nThe alicorn levitated a folder onto the table, letting it fall between the three of them. "Somepony brought this to my attention a few days ago. It calls for the total separation of the remaining thestrals in Equestria from ponykind until the end of the war, to ensure the safety of the war effort and the country."\n\nSilence. Blueblood found the courage to speak first. "Auntie..." he began, unusually quiet. "I do not believe that is a wise-"\n\n"Excuse me?!" Sunset Shimmer all but yelled, putting both hooves onto the table. "Celestia, you can't! The thestrals would never trust us again if we turn our back on them now! Don't tell me you're even considering that!" The non-response that the Princess gave was all the indication Sunset needed. "You are, aren't you?! You're going to ruin everything for what, just to feel safe? What would Luna say if she was still-"\n\nFire burned in Celestia's eyes as she slammed a hoof on the floor, cracking the stone beneath her. Sunset flinched and cowered behind the table, ears pinned behind her head. "That is enough," the Princess said, her voice hard. "Both of you are dismissed."\n\nBlueblood bowed and quickly left, not looking her aunt in the eye. Sunset quickly followed, looking more like a scolded dog than a field marshal. As soon as the door closed behind them, Celestia took a deep breath and looked back down at the folder on the table. Sunset had a point; her sister would be furious if she knew of something like this. Would she ever be able to forgive her if she did this now?\n\nWould Celestia ever be able to forgive herself?"

 equestria_civwar.25.d:0 "Equestria had won.\n\nThe remaining loyalists to the Nightmare were gone, having either surrendered or fled overseas. A few remaining to continue waging resistance in her name, but they were of no real threat. Ponies from Tall Tale to Canterlot took to the streets in cheers, as the most devastating war Equestria had seen in its known history finally came to its end.\n\nOne pony in Equestria did not smile, however.\n\nPrincess Celestia stared upwards at the moon in the sky, seeing the familiar etching of the Nightmare upon its surface once again. It had already felt like an eternity since the battle; her sister, out of desperation personally leading the last group of Lunar remnants against her. And with Rarity nowhere to be found, she had been forced to...\n\nTwilight and her friends had found her after it was done, sobbing on a floor still stained with blood and magical flame. She still remembered what had happened over a thousand years ago, when Luna had fallen the first time at her hoof. The millennium that had followed was hard and painful, but she had endured in the hope she would see her sister again. And when she had finally returned, Celestia had promised herself to cherish every moment she had with her sister, and to never again lose her to darkness. To never fail her in her time of need.\n\nLess than a decade later, and she had broken that promise.\n\nThe despair, the void of knowing the thousand year wait that lay ahead her tore at her, threatened to consume her. But there was also a spark. A flame, born not of hope or fear, but hate. Hatred of the ponies who had taken her sister. Hatred of those who had fought and killed for her, knowing what she had become. And hatred of any enemy of Equestria, who saw nothing but opportunity in her loss.\n\nThe hatred burned brightly, threatening to overtake her mind..."

 equestria_civwar.26.d:0 "Princess Celestia, monarch of Equestria and Princess of the Sun, sat on her throne looking out over the near-empty room. The only other ponies present were her ever-faithful royal guard, standing at attention unmoving. Her sister's throne remained empty next to her, cold and lifeless. Celestia had refused any requests to have it removed; it was a painful reminder, but one she was determined to endure. One she had to.\n\nIt was similar to ruling Equestria in many ways. A heavy burden, one with hardship and struggle that many ponies couldn't understand. To smile, wave and lead, to build Equestria anew waiting for a sister forgotten, the mistakes of the past eternally weighing heavy on every choice she made. How had things gone so wrong again? How did she lose Luna so soon?\n\nThe blame rested solely on her. She had grown too complacent, too trusting, too lax. Memories rushed through Celestia's mind again. Watching Sunset Shimmer leave the castle for the last time as her student, unable to save her from her own ambition. The Severyanian ponies, forced to rebel after years of oppression. Her laying powerless at the hooves of Chrysalis as she threatened Canterlot itself. And finally Luna, looking at her with hope and determination as she spoke of the thestrals, falling victim to a failing Celestia had never fixed. How could she have been so blind?\n\nCelestia had always believed that she had time. She was immortal, after all. She could wait for change, for heroes to rise, for ponies to become better and see the error of their own ways. But how many had suffered from waiting? How many ponies had died in a war of her own making? It could not go on any longer.\n\nFire burned in the alicorn's eyes. So much still needed to be done. Nightmare Moon had broken Equestria in far more than two, and Equestria was far from out of danger. But she would see it all done. She would have a perfect Equestria, atone for her mistakes, no matter the cost. She would earn the forgiveness of her sister. And if anypony, or anycreature dared to stand in her way...\n\n...they would step aside, or be broken before her."

 equestria_celestia.3.d:0 "A little over a dozen ponies stood in the throne room before their Princess, many looking nervously at each other or at the floor. Celestia regarded them with a cold expression; she never did have an affection for much of the Canterlot elite. The fact that she recognized very few of them would make what was to come all the more easier for her.\n\n"It has been brought to my attention," she began, demanding the eyes of everypony present, "that there are some within Canterlot who secretly aided my sister during the civil war. Treason is one of the highest crimes within Equestria, and I am certain at least one of you is guilty of it. I will provide one chance for any of you to come forward and confess of your own accord."\n\nNot a single pony moved a muscle. They all stared up at the Princess, who's face betrayed no emotion. Finally a single unicorn stepped forward, head low as he refused to meet the alicorn's gaze. Celestia waited.\n\n"I aided the Nightmare," he began, eyes never leaving the ground and his head positioned in a permanent bow. "I offered shelter, food and supplies to her soldiers throughout the war. My family lives in Manehattan, I thought if I could prove my loyalty to her, I could keep them safe-"\n\n"Enough." The stallion cowered further as Celestia motioned for one of her guards to escort him out of the room. His head hung and his tail remained between his hind legs as the doors closed again behind him, the remaining ponies quietly whispering to each other. "Anypony else?"\n\nNothing. "Very well. Your properties and wealth in Canterlot is to be immediately seized by the Crown, and all of you are henceforth permanently forbidden from taking any official office of Equestria." Ponies gasped, opened their mouths to argue, but were silenced by the withering glare their monarch gave them. "I am already aware that every single one of you is guilty of treason. Only one of you had the courage and honesty to admit so, qualities the rest of you sorely lack. As such, you all no longer deserve any privileges that your wealth and names have granted to you."\n\n"Equestria has no need for ponies who can not live up to the ideals of Harmony.""

 equestria_celestia.12.d:0 "It was that time again.\n\nPhilomena was sick, a mere shadow of her former self. Her feathers has almost completely fallen off, signaling the end of the cycle. Such was the life of a phoenix; one that Philomena had lived for centuries at Celestia's side. The Princess still remembered that time shortly after Luna's banishment, when she had found a lone phoenix egg while returning from a visit to the dragons. With no parents or other phoenixes to be found Celestia had taken her back to Canterlot, and in turn Philomena became her sole companion over the thousand years she had ruled alone. In many ways they were almost one and the same.\n\nCanterlot had learned better than to make fun of or take advantage of the phoenix while she was frail and weak. Those who did always found themselves on the receiving end of a prank once Philomena had finished her cycle. Sometimes ponies would complain to her, particularly if the form of revenge was mean-spirited, but Celestia had never reprimanded her companion for her actions. After all Philomena knew the limits of what she could get away with, and it was often a good lesson to ponies on how not to take advantage of another creature just because they were vulnerable.\n\n...Equestria was whole again, in a sense. The traitors had been dealt with, and normal life was finally starting to resume in the minds of her subjects. But that was far from the case outside of Equestria's new borders. Creatures would not cease plotting to destroy harmony just because Equestria had won a single war, against her own sister no less. And what was the only way to respond to provocation after provocation?\n\nThe bird in front of Celestia burst into flames, quickly becoming nothing more than a pile of ash. The Princess stood, watching as it trailed up into the air and coalesced into a tornado before a new phoenix burst out in a brilliant display of light. Celestia did not wince or look away; a foreleg extended outwards for Philomena to perch on.\n\nThe phoenix obeyed the silent command. The Equestrian Army was ready for its mission, the ponies ready for their Princess. Equestria had been reborn.\n\nIt was time to rule."

Yes, of course, she thought, chiding her internal hesitation. "That sounds wonderful, Luna. We were meant to rule together. Did you have something in mind?"\n\nLuna nodded, her throat catching "The Thestrals... it isn't right, 'Tia! Equestria doesn't just have three tribes. Thestrals shouldn't be shunned, but welcomed as the fourth tribe!" Celestia raised her hoof to object but Luna continued: "I know they don't even want to be 'Equestrian', especially with all the unpleasantness after, well...you know. But... they were my little ponies, and I failed them." Her voice dropped to a whisper "I failed them, Celestia. I need to make it right. Equestria should be a friendly home to everypony."\n\nOf course it would be this, Celestia thought. The bat ponies had hardly been willing to join the Three Tribes after their Princess was banished to the moon, and even after Luna's return they were suspicious.\n\nBut the bat ponies weren't the real problem. It was the Equestrians. A small horse is easy prey at night, and something about the night loving bats seemed to instil fear and mistrust even amongst many. When Nightmare Moon rose, terrified ponies attacked bat ponies and drove them into the mountains. Ancient prejudices still lingered."

Luna's anxieties eased. These ponies understood this new world. They knew how to transform will into power.\n\nBut it was the activists who most transfixed Luna. They looked at her with awe, and spoke passionately of their desire for change, whether motivated by abstract principle or personal experience.\n\nThey believed in themselves, not because they knew it would work out, but because every change must begin with hope.

 equestria.208.d:0 "Evening fell across the land as bat ponies huddled eagerly around the village radio, squeaking curiously as Luna's voice carried through the air "....is this Friendship? NO!". Flapping her tiny wings, Night Blossom around hopped excitedly. "Mama, mama, the Princess is talking about us!"\n\nDusk Horizons nodded patiently "Yes she is."\n\n"But why? Why don't the other ponies want to be our friends? Why is Luna helping us?"\n\nDusk Horizons sighed. "Over 1000 years ago, Luna was our Princess. She lived at night as we do and made the night wonderful. She loved us, and we loved her. But we didn't tell her. We complained about the other ponies instead, about how mean they were. They didn't like our night, or our bat wings. And Luna grew lonely and sad. Because we failed her, she transformed into Nightmare Moon for a long time, becoming angry and evil. The ponies got very scared of the night after that and chased us into the mountains, where we have stayed ever since."\n\nNight Blossom's face scrunched up, considering this. "We should help Luna then! I wanna go see the Princess!" She continued to bounce and squeak at the notion, making short, gliding hops. Soon, Dusk thought, she would be able to properly fly at night.\n\nThe door opened, and a sombre looking bat pony entered.

"LUUUNA, LUUUUNA, LUUUNA!"\n\nSilent turned back to Dusk. "We can't fail her again. We've paid for our mistake for a thousand years. Never again."\n\nThroughout the night, keening "EEEEEEEEE"s rang.

#NLR FORCES DISCOVERED - EARLY WAR PATH
 equestria.232.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrival"
 equestria.232.d:0 "The chamberlain hurried into the room, hooves echoing on the marble floor of the throne room. Princess Celestia looked up, curious at the disruption.\n\n"Your Majesty, a soldier is here to see you. We found her... well, we stepped up patrols recently and they were fortunate to find her before..."\n\nHe trailed off as the doors to the hall swung open."
 equestria.232.a:0 "Purple Heart stood, bloodied and bruised."
 equestria.213.t:0 "Confrontation"
 equestria.213.d:0 "Luna hummed cheerfully as she applied a wax seal to her note, working late into the morning. The reform campaign was difficult, but fulfilling. She had been sleeping well this past year, too.\n\nThe doors burst open, and Canterlot guards rushed in, Celestia behind them.\n\nLuna rose in shock, finding herself facing a dozen rifles.\n\nCelestia, tears streaming down her face, hurled a crate into the room. It broke open, rifles and ammunition clattering across the floor. "These are stolen weapons, found with Nightmare Moon cultists. Even now, they prepare for her return!" she shouted. "And they used royal codes to get them! OUR codes!"\n\nLuna gasped in shock. "Sister, I would never...!" Luna trailed off. Or would she? She recalled her recent restful sleep.\n\nCelestia's face hardened, even as it shone with tears. "Maybe not, but we cannot risk the return of Nightmare Moon. You will be detained until we can discover what has happened here."\n\nUnnoticed, a guard slipped away. Luna's dreams had prepared him for this possibility. The press, the people, must know - Celestia, bat-hater, had fabricated a national security crisis to detain Luna and end the reform campaign."
 equestria.213.a:0 "The news spread like wildfire."
 
 equestria.222.t:0 "The Bat Ponies Take Flight"
 equestria.222.d:0 "Screams filled the sky as tens of thousands of bat ponies took to the air. A millennium ago, they had failed Luna in her time of need, and she had twisted into Nightmare Moon. Now she had been imprisoned and needed their help. They would not fail her again.\n\nFrom coast to coast, major cities swelled with crowds never before witnessed in Equestrian history, as bat ponies marched in protest, chanting, blocking government offices, and screeching in anger. A year ago, ponies would have looked on, fearfully. And some still did. But many stepped out, marching in solidarity.\n\nIn Canterlot, large crowds grew at the Canterlot Palace gates, as guards nervously looked on."
 equestria.222.a:0 "Let's get this investigation finished quickly!"
 
 equestria.223.t:0 "The Nation Marches"
 equestria.223.d:0 "The situation at Canterlot had become a stalemate. Crowds camped outside the Palace whilst the gates stood barred.\n\nA guard sat trembling atop the wall. He just wanted the protest to end. The noise, the crowd, the yelling. It reminded him of a past he wished he could forget. Changelings streaming into the Palace. Luna and Celestia captured. Grinning faces wrapping him, cacooning him, as he writhed, unable to escape. Yet the nightmares would not end.\n\nHe started as the gates unexpectedly groaned open. The crowd, surprised but enthused, flooded into the Royal Palace, towards the throne room.\n\nNo! It was happening again. The Royal Palace was under attack! He hastily fired a panicked warning shot towards the crowd with his rifle, which then retreated, screaming in fear.\n\nA bat pony lied on the ground, bleeding.\n\nWithin hours, the news had spread like wildfire on the radio. An innocent protester had been shot in cold blood by a Royal Guard, who were meant to protect Equestria. Even with their ancient prejudices, many ponies knew. They knew this was not Harmony. This was not Friendship. And across Equestria, they poured onto the streets, marching united against barbarity."
 equestria.223.a:0 "This is a Nightmare!"
 
 equestria.224.t:0 "The Return of Nightmare Moon"
 equestria.224.d:0 "Celestia and Twilight stood sadly as Luna sat weeping on the floor of her cell. It had been her all along. Nightmare Moon had crept into Luna's subconscious, and raised an army whilst Luna slept.\n\n"Sister. Twilight. Please... do whatever it takes. I can't bear to cause any more suffering."\n\nTwilight nodded "It's not your fault. We will assemble the Elements, draw Nightmare Moon out, and drive her from your mind once and for all. Everything can go back to normal."\n\nThen the sound of a gunshot followed by screaming carried from the outside.\n\nTwilight and Celestia froze in horror, as Luna began to tremble "What have I done? WHAT HAVE I DONE?!" She lunged towards Celestia, pleading. "PLEASE! HELP ME! HELP MEEE!"\n\nCelestia backed away, overwhelmed. She had failed Luna. Again.\n\nLuna's sobs became wracking coughs, and then she began to laugh. And laugh. She grew, swirling with energy as her pupils narrowed and coat blackened.\n\nNightmare Moon. With a blast of her horn she blew open the back wall, and took flight, fleeing the castle.\n\nOutside, the crowd cheered. Luna was free! Bat ponies rushed to block pursuing pegasi, guarding 'Luna's' escape!"
 equestria.224.a:0 "You fools, that's not Luna!"
 
 equestria.225.t:0 "The Princess's Speech" 
 equestria.225.d:0 "The Equestrian army, already on high alert, swung into action, as broadcasts warned of the return of Nightmare Moon. But it wasn't enough.\n\nManehattan was the first to fall silent as it was stormed by angry crowds and brainwashed sleeper agents. When the broadcast towers resumed, a Princess addressed the nation.\n\n"Ponies of Equestria. A millennium ago, I committed a great wrong, and was banished to the Moon by Celestia, who worked to return and restore my old self. In doing so, she saved me, and I owe her a great debt.\n\n"It is with great sadness, that I must now repay this debt. Celestia, frightened of bat ponies and imagined threats, has gone mad. She imprisoned me and ordered a Royal Guard to shoot into the protesting crowd at the Palace. No longer the kindly sister I once knew, she has become Daybreaker, a cruel monster of flame and rage.\n\n"From Manehattan, I work to defeat my sister and end her madness, just as she did for me so long ago. I call all harmony loving ponies, be they earth pony, pegasus, unicorn, or bat pony, to join me in protecting our nation and restoring Harmony!""
 equestria.255.d_1:0 "Nightmare Moon's secret force was discovered, and Luna was placed under arrest. Furious bat pony protestors attempted to storm the palace, and the Canterlot Guard, on edge from previous attacks, opened fire. A bat pony died and news of the incident, unheard of in Equestrian history, was broadcast across the nation. Transforming into Nightmare Moon, a distraught Luna escaped the palace and fled to Manehattan. Competing narratives fight across the airwaves.\n\n'Luna' claims Celestia has gone mad, transforming into a mare of flame and massacring bat ponies.\n\nCelestia claims that Nightmare Moon has returned, and claims the death of a protester was a terrible accident.\n\nBoth sides call loyal ponies to fight for the good of Equestria. The civil war has begun."
 equestria.225.a:0 "She organised all this using dreams?!"
 
 equestria.226.t:0 "The Cause"
 equestria.226.d:0 "Flowing Current's limbs began to move again, as Luna's healing magic washed over the crowd. He couldn't believe it. Some reactionary had attempted to assassinate Princess Luna! She had emerged, blackened and angry, but alive. A week ago, an anonymous letter had instructing him that a terrible tragedy would occur and he would be needed at the power station, but he hadn't believed it.\n\nHe, the great organiser, was now in the wrong place at the wrong time. He launched into the air, racing across the city for the power station. In the streets below, gunfire rang out. Now they were making a grab for Manehattan! He pushed, his wings aching as he pulled in to land at the station entrance.\n\nFlashing his ID to a bewildered security guard, he sprinted for the boiler room. The Princess of the Night needed every advantage she could get.\n\n In front of him stood an emergency trip. With a station this large, it would take hours to properly restart. With luck, power fluctuations would trip other stations too.\n\nFlowing Current took a deep breath. Some would call this treason. But true justice required doing what was right, no matter what others thought.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and whispered a silent prayer "Please, let the Night rule. Just for this one day..."\n\nHe punched the button."
 equestria.226.a:0 "The lights of Equestria winked out."
 
 equestria.227.t:0 "The Calling"
 equestria.227.d:0 "Misty Night lay in bed, listening to the radio. Luna spoke righteous truth. But ponies didn't understand, couldn't understand. Then the radio signal cut out.\n\nMisty Night lept to her hooves, diving for her rifle under the floor. This was the moment promised in her dreams. The moment they had all trained for. And indeed, suddenly the moon seemed to ripple, and deep within her soul, she felt its call. Nightmare Moon had awakened. It was time.\n\nShe frowned... but the lights still blazed. She chided herself. She must be patient. She begin to pray. "Nightmare Moon, Princess of Night, Princess of Dreams, please bless me, your faithful Disciple, in what I am about to do". A minute passed. The crack of gunfire rang outside. Still Misty waited.\n\nThen the lights winked out, and the city was plunged into darkness.\n\nShe grinned, looking around the room. She could still see, for she was blessed of the Moon. She lifted her rifle, and sprinted out into the darkness, as thousands of others across Equestria did the same."
 equestria.227.a:0 "For Nightmare Moon, Goddess of Equestria!"
 
 equestria.228.t:0 "The Thestrals"
 equestria.228.d:0 "The crowd stood in the night air, candles held aloft. Silent Peaks huddled around radio as it relayed Luna's speech. Luna was actually doing it! Night Blossom could have a good future in a new Equestria, a fair Equestria.\n\nAnd then the radio went out, and an explosion thundered in the distance. The crowd scattered, bat ponies taking to the skies in panic, screeching. The moon's light faded.\n\nSilent collapsed in shock. If Luna had died, the bat ponies would be sure to follow.\n\nBut then then moon began to glow. Not a calm white, but a deep, blood, red of rage and sadness. It shimmered, and Silent felt the call deep within. Luna was alive. And she needed their help. He rallied his volunteers. Many cried even as they obeyed, their dreams of peace shattered. One asked "But what if it's... Nightmare Moon?".\n\nThe others nodded, hesitating.\n\nSilent himself barely held back tears. He needed to stop this kind of talk immediately. He grabbed the pony by the collar, shouting "It doesn't matter! If it's Luna, we help our Princess! If it's... Nightmare Moon, Equestria will try to imprison or expel every single bat pony! Do you think they would just forgive us?"\n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper, trembling "Do you understand? It doesn't matter." He looked at each of them in turn. "We fight, or we die."\n\nThe lights winked out, and the bat ponies charged into the night." 
 equestria.228.a:0 "For Princess Luna! We will not fail her again!"
 
 equestria.229.t:0 "Rarity Captured"
 equestria.229.d_1:0 "As if the outbreak of civil war weren't bad enough, reports have reached us that Rarity, one of the six wielders of the Elements of Harmony, was captured in Manehattan during the uprising by Nightmare Moon's forces. She had been visiting to help manage her clothing brand and market this seasons line of fashion but was unable to escape after the city was thrown into chaos. Without the ability to wield all six Elements of Harmony, a direct strike against Nightmare Moon is impossible, leaving our only alternative bloody military conflict."
 equestria.229.d_2:0 "As if the outbreak of civil war weren't bad enough, reports have reached us that Rarity, one of the six wielders of the Elements of Harmony, was captured in Manehattan during the uprising by Nightmare Moon's forces. She had gone to the Million Mare March as part of her role supporting Princess Luna and was injured in the explosion. Without the ability to wield all six Elements of Harmony, a direct strike against Nightmare Moon is impossible, leaving our only alternative bloody military conflict."
 equestria.229.d_3:0 "In another piece of good news, our forces successfully apprehended Rarity during the Manehattan uprising. She had been visiting to help manage her clothing brand and market this seasons line of fashion but was unable to escape after the night prevailed. Without Rarity as one of the six wielders of the Elements of Harmony the Celestial loyalists are deprived their most powerful weapon. This war shall be won through the clash of armies and industrial might, not magical artefacts."
 equestria.229.d_4:0 "In another piece of good news, our forces successfully apprehended Rarity in the aftermath of the Million Mare March terrorist attack. She has been treated and is in stable condition, but we have ensured she cannot escape, as her loyalties remain suspect. Without Rarity as one of the six wielders of the Elements of Harmony the Celestial loyalists are deprived their most powerful weapon.

 #CELESTIA+LUNA Reform Adventures - No Civil War events here
 equestria.214.t:0 "The Shadow Market"
 equestria.214.d:0 "During their centuries largely outside outside Equestrian Society, the bat ponies developed their own, parallel society and even economy. Being in many areas unburdened by taxes or Equestrian laws, this economy has established itself in many places across Equestria, allowing them to make sure that any bits they earn remains within bat pony society. Even the wages paid by those thestrals who worked as unregistered labourers in Equestrian industries or farms go into this shadow economy and stay there, and over time entire industries, though small scale, have grown up here. This has become a drain on the Equestrian economy as many of the three tribes have taken to spending their money there instead as well.\n\nMany thestrals take pride in their self-sufficiency, and resent the notion of having to bow to the obligations of the society they never were part of. This sentiment is echoed by several industrialists, who have tied themselves in knots trying argue for the preservation the system without saying outright that they want to be able to get away with not paying proper wages to their workers.\n\nIf the thestrals are to be integrated, this shadow market must be addressed, but the question is how."
 equestria.214.a:0 "Reintegrate them fully, but make sure to help them on the way."
 equestria.214.b:0 "We can make exceptions in some cases."
 equestria.214.c:0 "We should not be forcing this..."

 equestria.215.t:0 "Anti-Thestral Sentiments"
 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst bat ponies have traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they live apart from the citizens of other races in their own communities.\n\nBut many citizens want it to remain this way. They think that bat ponies do not need to be integrated into society and brought out of isolation. Some are afraid of possible side effects such as a disruption of societal Harmony, others fear the rumoured Nightmare Moon cultists among the ranks of the bat ponies, and a few think they have no place among the other three races of Equestria, seeing them as complete outsiders. To them, it's as if Celestia was suggesting griffons to be welcomed as a Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared an initiative to promote the integration. Groups of bat ponies would be invited to tour across Equestria, so the common citizens could see them with their own eyes. EEA syllabi would be rewritten to teach about bat ponies and their history. False rumours about cultists would be dispelled by official media. Pamphlets and posters would be distributed, showing photographs of smiling thestrals with the words "THESE BAT PONIES ARE OUR FRIENDS".\n\nHowever, if taken too far, pushing this pro-bat pony information can easily be considered propaganda or an attempt at forcibly changing ponies' minds about the matter."
 equestria.215.a:0 "It matters not. They must know the truth."
 equestria.215.b:0 "We could probably tone it down somewhat."
 equestria.215.c:0 "This is enough for now, then."
 
 equestria.216.t:0 "Thestral Mistrust"
 equestria.216.d:0 "Ponies may be skeptical, but the same is true for the thestrals themselves. Many of them don't trust the other Equestrians and only support the integration because Princess Luna is advocating for it. They simply want to be left alone, instead of trying to befriend other ponies.\n\nFortunately, nowhere is more equipped to handle this problem than the land of Friendship. As Princess of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle has drawn up a campaign plan that stretches down the hallway.\n\nThe plan is as inspired and diverse as it is complex and expensive - the Elements of Harmony visiting isolated thestral communities in jungles and mountains; Friendship clubs; inviting thestral students to the School of Friendship; Dusk Festivals where both bat ponies and other ponies would celebrate together; Celestia and Luna meeting with bat pony leaders; and the list goes on..."
 equestria.216.a:0 "Are we not a nation of Friendship?"
 equestria.216.b:0 "We can tone down Twilight's enthusiasm a little."
 equestria.216.c:0 "Our budget is tight. A little could go a long way."
 
 equestria.217.t:0 "Reforms being implemented"
 equestria.217.d:0 "Our campaigns to reform the economy, deal with distrust and promote Friendship have been drawn up and are now being put into action. Now all we can do is wait."
 equestria.217.a:0 "It's up to the ponies of Equestria now."
 
 equestria.218.t:0 "The Reforms"
 equestria.218.d_1:0 "Luna cheerfully began her nightly rounds of the palace. She passed offices where bat pony bureaucrats worked through the night, continuing the shifts from their daytime counterparts. Manehattan was often called "The city that never sleeps". Well it had become true here in Canterlot, too.\n\nAcross the nation, thestrals ventured into cities in greater numbers, attracted by employment opportunities and a new attitude of tolerance. The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but the Equestrian public was now ready to accept bat ponies as the Fourth Tribe, standing ready to protect their new friends from harm.\n\n"It's wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real. A thousand years in exile, all because she'd been too proud to ask for help!\n\nCelestia hugged Luna as the blue mare sobbed, cradling Luna in her wings. She would never let Luna down again."
 equestria.218.d_2:0 "Luna stood on a balcony, staring sadly into the night sky. She thought she saw a movement in the darkness - the flap of thestral wings perhaps? It was not uncommon to see them these days. Luna's reverie was interrupted as Celestia joined her, apparently content to stand silently.\n\nLuna spoke first "Celestia. Did we do enough? Many still have not accepted this change. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for over a millennium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even. But change will come, and one day, we will heal the scars of history."\n\nLuna nodded, holding back her disappointment. As always, her sister bore the hard-won wisdom of centuries. The foolish dreams and fancies of the night must always melt away before the illumination of the sun."
 equestria.218.a:0 "A great wrong has been righted."

'Luna' has taken to the air, warning that Celestia has gone mad, attempting to oppose bat pony equality and that as a result, she has had no choice but to assume governance.\n\nCelestia and the Canterlot administration appear to have been caught totally off guard, as many awoke to find a well-coordinated change of power had taken place in many cities - government buildings occupied, soldiers receiving orders to defend 'Luna' from terrorists, and objectors arrested.\n\nCanterlot and the west remain controlled by Celestia, and as the reality of the situation sinks in, war appears inevitable.

equestria.170.d:0 "There was a time when everypony lived in awe of the great bears Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor's call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters' heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

equestria_industry.8.d:0 ""Please, we want to help you too!"\n\nThe words rolled through Blue Shift’s mind like a tiny bug. A small and acute pain— barely more than an inconvenience. She hooked her hoof behind the shorter mare’s back and tossed her to the curb. She hit the ground with tears welling in her eyes. "You sound like you’re trying to bribe me." Her own rebuttal, perfunctory and curt, shut the other mare up instantly.\n\nThe police mare glanced up and caught sight of her comrades dragging a couple more defiant union-goers from their basement hidey-hole and onto the sidewalk above. At least they were too weak to put up a proper resistance. If these wanna-be traitors kept sowing sedition in her city they’d all meet the same fate. Each one would be dragged out of the dark and into Celestia’s light by her own hoof if she had to. Such was the duty of a Manehattan police officer, and that shining blue shield on her flank meant that she took her duties very, very seriously. More than that, she was a patriot. And she would not abide sedition.\n\n"Why are you doing this...?" The words, barely a whisper, sounded from the mare Shift had taken a guard’s stance beside. "We just want... the factories— we can’t work so hard. Please. We’re exhausted, making mistakes. Eventually, somepony will get hurt."\n\nBlue Shift rolled her eyes. Excuses made by the lazy to appease the only real servants of Equestria. "You have the right to remain silent," the police mare answered, and the union mare cowed. With a crestfallen expression her gaze fell down to the sidewalk. She closed her eyes and began to sob.\n\nBlue Shift sneered. As if a sad self-thrown pity party would work on her."

#MAIN SIX STORY EVENTS
#equestria.173.t:0 "Farewell For Now"
#equestria.173.d:0 "The small train station in Ponyville rarely had many ponies standing on the platform, but today it was more crowded than ever. Almost a hundred ponies had gathered there, half of them with heavy bags filled with food, tools and other supplies. Those would be necessary, for they were heading on a long journey, from which they may not return. The colourful Friendship Express whistled, signalling that it would soon depart. The mood was solemn and mournful; ponies were embracing each other, bidding farewell and crying.\n\nThey were going to war.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, was there as well, as were her friends, the Elements of Harmony: Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. The last three had saddlebags and were preparing to depart.\n"Well, I guess it's time to say good bye," Rainbow Dash said, breaking the silence. "The train's about to go."\nTwilight sighed deeply. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I respect your bravery and your choice to face Chrysalis' army. But I'm worried. This is not like the other threats we've faced. This time, a small band of heroes can't save Equestria. And I want you to remember that. Don't try to be heroes. Stay safe, and don't take unnecessary risks. We all want you to return in one piece."\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yes Twilight, you've said that a dozen times. Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll buck the changelings back across the border and be back home before Hearth's Warming Eve."\n"But she's right, Rainbow," Fluttershy meekly said. "You need to be careful. War is... terrifying and dangerous."\n"I'll make sure Rainbow doesn't get herself killed," Applejack said and grinned. "Dont'cha fear."\n"And I don't even plan on fighting," Pinkie said cheerily. "I will provide moral support! Cakes and parties will make even the most grim soldier happy. And maybe I can convince the changelings that war isn't as fun as partying!"\nTwilight smiled. "Alright. I trust you will be okay. We'll miss you."\nThe train whistled again.\n"Oh, wait!" Rarity exclaimed. "I still have gifts to give!" She levitated clothing and blankets from her bags and gave them to the three departing friends. "I made fabulous uniforms and cozy blankets to keep you warm."\nThey thanked her and put the gifts in their bags. "Well, we really gotta go now," Rainbow said. "Hugs?" Pinkie asked.\nThe six ponies smiled and embraced each other with their wings and forelegs. "We'll be waiting for you," Twilight whispered, and a tear flowed down her cheek."

Now he was back in Ponyville once more, worried about the burden the Great War had placed on the Princess. He entered the Castle of Friendship, whose hallways were empty. He headed to the library and his guess was proven correct: Twilight was there, absorbed in work. She was surrounded by books and notes and was frantically writing.\n"Twilight?" He said, trying to get her attention. "I'm back from the Crystal Empire."\nShe snapped out of it and lifted her gaze from the papers. "Oh, Spike! Glad to see you. You came at a perfect time!" She levitated a scroll from her table into his claws. "Send this to Celestia. It's important."\nSpike lifted a scaly brow. "Uh, sure." He breathed shining green flame which consumed the scroll, making it magically appear in Canterlot. "What was the scroll about?"\n"A report on the research programs I've prepared for the magical experimentation departments in Bales, Stableside and Albion. They need her approval before the research can begin."\n"What are they studying?"\n"Weapons," she said casually and continued to work on her notes. "Crystal armaments, combat mage training, use of magic in industrial production. Anything that can help us win the war."\n"I see." Spike walked closer to Twilight and looked at all the paperwork. "You know, you seem to be doing a good job managing all this. You're not too stressed out."\n"Abyssinian coffee does wonders. But thanks, Spike."\n"You know, maybe you could use your organization skills and leadership for managing the frontline? With your clever head, I'm sure we'd win in a month."\nTwilight's quill stopped moving. She sighed. "I would rather not."\n"Why? Would be more effective than trying to invent some miracle weapon. It's always been thanks to your leadership that we've kicked the butts of all those villains before."\n"I-I don't want to have that responsibility now. It's not just six friends, it's millions of soldiers. A single mistake results in thousands of dead and wounded." She shut her eyes. "I don't want to bear that burden."\n"Twi, you know... one day you won't have a choice. Celestia and Luna won't be princesses forever."\n"I'm not ready yet. Just... not yet. Okay, Spike?"\nSpike sighed. "Alright, fine. Do you need any more help?"\nTwilight smiled. "Yes, actually. I'm happy you're here."

#equestria.175.d:0 ""Ma'am, reinforcements have arrived," a pegasus mare told Applejack.\n"Fantastic! Just when we need 'em. Sergeant, keep an eye on the enemy. I'll go meet the fresh blood." The soldier saluted her and she walked down the muddy trenches, navigating to the rear of the network. Near the underground barracks were a row of trucks, pony soldiers with clean uniforms jumping out of them. A thestral officer saw Applejack and greeted her. "Greetings, ma'am. We've come to patch up your ranks."\n"Good, sir. They've been gettin' more and more sparse. The changelin' night raids are hard as Tartarus to repel." The bat pony turned to his soldiers. "Atten-tion! Miss Applejack is here." They immediately went rigid, standing in a neat line. Applejack approached them and inspected them. "Youngins, I see. I hope they've gotten at least some trainin'," she mumbled. She stopped in front of a red earth pony stallion, her eyes widening. He was wearing Granny Smith's old helmet. "Big Mac? The heck are you doin' here?" she exclaimed. He remained characteristically silent for a moment. "I came here to make sure you're okay, ma'am." Applejack rolled her eyes. "So who's lookin' after the farm now?"\n"Sugar Belle. Don't worry, ma'am." She snorted. "Alrighty then. But don't expect me to treat you differently just because you're my brother."\n"Nope, ma'am."\nLater that evening, the changelings launched a probing raid against the trenches, which they thought were depleted in defenders. Applejack quickly rallied the reinforcements, Big Macintosh among them, to prevent a breakthrough. There was brutal close-quarters combat and she had to crack the exoskeletons of several changelings with her strong hind legs. Big Mac tried to help, which didn't please her much. "Guard our rear, soldier. It's too dangerous here."\n"Yup. Dangerous for you, too."\n"I'll be fine! Now go, it was an order!" As she was shouting, Big Mac looked behind her and saw a changeling lying in the mud raise her head, her pistol glinting in the crimson light of a setting sun. "What're you lookin' at? Get goin'!" Applejack barked. Big Mac pushed her aside into the trench wall, and there was a loud bang. He collapsed onto the ground.\n"Big Mac!" Applejack screamed, and saw the changeling with her smoking pistol. She let out a roar and leaped on her as she was trying to fly away with her broken wings, and began stomping her to death with her hooves. When the insectoid pony had stopped breathing, she rushed back to his brother who was already being treated by a medic. "I-Is he fine?" she asked.\n"Y-yup," Big Mac weakly responded. "Sorry for savin' your life."\nApplejack embraced him. "No, it's me who should be sayin' sorry."\n"Ma'am, his chest is bleeding. I'd appreciate if you'd leave the hugging for later," the medic said."

#equestria.176.d:0 "Rainbow Dash had been away from combat ever since she had lost her left wing. Now she was glad to finally be back in action, commanding an air wing and training new pilots when she had time. One day, when refueling at an air base and chatting with ponies of the local garrison, she learned that Pinkie Pie was stationed nearby. She decided to go for a visit, even if it was technically unauthorized absence. So what, she thought, she was an element of harmony.\nAfter asking various soldiers, she finally found the barracks where Pinkie was stationed. She imagined it was a real party house at this point, where Pinkie cheered up the soldiers after tough fights against the changelings. She was wrong. It seemed like an ordinary barracks, with all the bunk beds arrayed in neat order. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place, but then she saw a pink pony lying on a bed. She barely recognized her.\n"Pinkie?" she cautiously asked. The mare with a straight mane slowly turned to look at her, then her eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Rainbow Dash. Why are you here?" Rainbow was struck by how dour she sounded. The colours of her coat seemed muted as well. "Uh, I thought I'd come by for a visit, to see how you're doing. We haven't talked in a long time."\n"Oh yes. You lost your wing, didn't you?" Rainbow extended her prosthetic metal wing. "Yep. But this new one is pretty rad, so I don't mind. Hurt like Tartarus at first but I'm getting used to it."\n"That's good."\n"Pinkie, is everything alright? Why aren't you... acting like yourself?" Pinkie breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. "I'm fine."\n"I might've lost my wing, but I still have my eyes and I can see something is wrong. What happened?" Pinkie grimaced. "I guess I should tell you, even though I don't want to. A couple months ago I was holding a party for Maud's Rock Troopers. However, there were changeling infiltrators in the group, and they revealed themselves and started shooting." A concerned frown formed on Rainbow's face. "Oh no. And then what?"\nShe shrugged. "I did what I had to, out of fear and desperation. In the end, the changelings were dead, and the party was thoroughly pooped."\nIt was a typical Pinkie joke, but the delivery was so dry that even Rainbow wasn't amused. "That... sucks. I wish I could've been there to protect you."\n"I don't need that anymore. I fight with Maud on the front. I haven't been in the mood for happy things after the incident."\nRainbow was speechless. "Pinkie, I—"\n"I'm fine, like I said. Don't you worry. War isn't the place for laughter. But after it's over, everything will be fine again."\n"Promise? I wanna to see you smile and hear you laugh. We can do our old pranks, maybe that will make you feel better." A faint smile appeared on Pinkie's lips. "Sure, Dashie.""

#equestria.177.d:0 "Clothing design was Rarity's passion, that could not be debated. But after months of designing dull military uniforms with drab colours and directing their production en masse, she was growing tired of it. Occasionally, when she had precious free time, she'd try to design a beautiful dress for her own enjoyment, but oftentimes even that wasn't as satisfying as it had been before the war. So now, when she had a day off, she needed another distraction from the stress of war-time production. She decided to visit her friend Fluttershy, who had recently come to Canterlot, and headed to her apartment near the underground magi-nuclear research facility, her mind full of questions.\n\nAs soon as the door of her home was opened, the stench of animals filled Rarity's nostrils. Fluttershy greeted her warmly, not minding the odour as usual. "Oh, hi Rarity, good to see you! I hope you don't mind that I brought some friends along from Ponyville." A bear was sitting on the living room sofa.\n"Uhm, no, not at all darling! Now, prepare some hot water. I'd like to drink tea and have a pleasant chat. We haven't seen in so long, goodness gracious!"\nA toucan and a ferret prepared two cups of steaming tea. Fluttershy thanked the animals and they replied with cheery sounds.\n"So, Fluttershy, first of all: What in Celestia's name are you doing in a magi-nuclear research facility?"\n"Oh, erm, I know it seems strange, but as the Element of Kindness, I was asked to give ethical oversight to the development of magi-nuclear weapons. I accepted, because I think it's important they're developed, and are then used right."\nRarity raised an eyebrow. "You think it's important that they're developed? Aren't they... extremely potent, from what I've heard?"\n"Oh, yes. That is the point. You see, their intent is to act as a deterrent and a threat. Once we have a working magi-nuclear bomb, Queen Chrysalis will be so scared that she will sue for peace for sure! And then no one else will ever threaten Equestria again."\n"I cannot help but regard that as quite optimistic. Chrysalis seems very determined in her cause. Also, what if someone else develops such a weapon?"\nFluttershy smiled. "The day when two countries can annihilate each other in one second, all of the world, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops. We will have world peace forever."\nRarity couldn't help but feel uneasy, and that this was going to end poorly. But she did not want to ruin the mood or insult Fluttershy. This seemed important to her. It was best to change the topic. "Well, I hope everything works out. So, who looks after your animal sanctuary?""

The old Friendship Express had been destroyed by a changeling bombing raid, so they returned home on a repurposed cargo train. It wasn't a comfortable ride, but they were still happy because they were finally together again.\nRainbow broke the silence between them. "So, we won. How many changelings did you kill? I got 241, mostly from air combat."\n"The heck? You kept count? Is everything a competition for you?" Applejack asked, appalled. "Anyhow, 242, mostly from close quarters combat, as my scars show."\nRainbow Dash chuckled. "Welp, better luck next time for me, I guess." She turned to Pinkie Pie, who still hadn't said anything. "Yo Pinkie, you alright? Remember what you promised to me. I miss your laugther."\nShe sighed. "Not now, Dashie.

"You all made it back home in one piece."\n"Rainbow didn't," Applejack said, grinned and poked her prosthetic metal wing.\n"Oh, you three look so weary and battered, and your clothes are beginning to fall apart!" Rarity exclaimed.\n"Well, you don't win wars by looking fancy," Rainbow said with a grin.\n"What's wrong, Pinkie?" Fluttershy asked with concern in her voice. All five turned to look at her. Pinkie averted eye contact.\n"Nothing. I'm glad to be back home. Even though it may not seem like it."\n"You know, Pinkie," Twilight said, "Ponyville is preparing to hold a party to celebrate the end of the war. But I think they need someone to organize it."\n"Aha."\n"Wouldn't you like to do that, darling?" Rarity asked. "Maybe that would make you feel better."\nPinkie sighed. "Alright, fine. But I think I will need you guys to help. I've gotten a bit rusty. And... well, I'm not the same as I was."\nRainbow wrapped her metal wing around her. "Pinkie, we'll be with you, always. And we will do anything to make you happy again. Of course we'll help you with the party.

equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as pony soldiers on the front prepared to celebrate Hearth's Warming Eve, something strange happened. There have been reports that at one fortified position near the changeling frontline, some ponies climbed over the trench waving a white flag. Changelings honourably did not open fire and allowed the enemy soldiers to get near. The ponies then invited the changelings soldiers to celebrate Hearth's Warming with them in No Creature's Land. Surprisingly, some of the changelings, even a few officers, accepted the offer.\n\nAs the moon rose, the ponies and changelings drank cider and hot chocolate milk, sang carols and even played some hoofball. Soldiers casually chatted with each other, talking of their families and civilian lives, and telling traditional stories. Changelings of course do not celebrate pony holidays, but were very curious and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAfter reports of the incident spread, the high command on both sides reacted. The Equestrian army used this as a chance to show the value of friendship and that changelings were fighting against their will, using the opportunity to portray Chrysalis and her posse as warmongering tyrants. On the other side, the Queen was outraged by this and forbid any knowledge of it to spread, putting the nation's censorship bureaus to work. She then ordered capital punishment on every single soldier and officer who had taken part in the "treachery". However, some of the changelings managed to desert and escape, being welcomed warmly by Equestrian soldiers. They are now prisoners of war but are treated well."

She was encouraged to hold the event by Princess Luna so various disputes could be resolved before they reached a boiling point. Princess Twilight Sparkle was once again responsible for organizing the event. The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of issues with integrating the local thestral minority and the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies while representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. At the end of the event, Princess Celestia held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

equestria.184.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle looked over the reports she had laid out on the desk before her, a look of heavy concern plastered on her face. After Nightmare Moon has risen once again and plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to help in some of the more administrative tasks involving the military. That meant filing through all the reports that the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them didn't paint a good picture of what was going on, especially in the high command.\n\nPutting it straight, Luna's fall had torn a hole in the general staff. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was still clear that he couldn't lead the entire Equestrian Army. They needed somepony to fill the place that the Princess of the Night had left, at least until a more permanent replacement could be found. But who could possibly do that? It was clear the generals didn't know, since all the reports were just blaming Blueblood when he just couldn't do everything at once. Twilight needed to figure it out, and soon.\n\nAnd then it came to her. There was one pony she knew who could help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and frankly Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But even with all that, Twilight was sure that she would still answer her call, and hopefully agree to help Equestria in its darkest hour. She was the best fit for the pony that they needed.\n\nBut first... Twilight levitated a large book from a drawer and opened it to the newest blank page. It was time to write a letter."

Should have known you'd already have it ready for me."\n\nTwilight nodded with a slight smile before taking a sip. "So, how things been going for you?"\n\nShe gave a small laugh. "Fine, I guess. Though we both know you wouldn't send a message calling me here if you didn't need me for something." Sunset put down her teacup and sighed. "Guess I better tell my friends that I'll be gone for a while, since I'm guessing it's related to how Equestria is... in a bit of trouble right now."\n\nTwilight nodded. "You're right, and that's exactly why I'm here. You're the only one I know who could help."\n\n"Alright, just tell me. Do you need me to help Equestria win?"\n\n"Yes. Princess Luna turning into Nightmare Moon has left the Equestrian high command in disarray, and Prince Blueblood can't lead the army by himself. Somepony else needs to help lead, and I know you learned a lot from your long time in the mirror world-"\n\n"Whoa, slow down," Sunset said, putting her hooves out. "I'm honored, Twilight, but are you sure that you want me leading an army? It's not like I've been doing that back with my friends, and it still hasn't even been that long since I stole your Element of Magic-"\n\nThe alicorn reached across the table and held one of Sunset's hooves. "Sunset. I know this is sudden, but I need you. Equestria needs you! Nightmare Moon and her followers are killing ponies as we speak, and the longer this civil war goes on..." Twilight trailed off for a moment. "I don't know how much more Equestria, or Princess Celestia can take."\n\nSilence held in the air for a few moments while the two ponies stared at each other.

The few that did, however, couldn't help but stare or at least occasionally glance at the pair enjoying their day.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't often that a pony got to see a Princess of Equestria and one of the highest ranking officers of the Equestrian Army.\n\n"I'm so glad we could both find time out of our schedule to meet here," Twilight said to Sunset, who nodded wordlessly. "I wanted to see you more often after we met in the castle, but with the war I was just too busy to even get a chance!"\n\n"Same," Sunset agreed, putting down her coffee. "Nightmare Moon and her forces never took breaks, and neither could we. Prince Blueblood and I had contests on who could pull longer all-nighters." She leaned in conspiratorially. "I think he might be jealous on how I won all the time."\n\nThey both shared a laugh. "Sunset, you know you don't have to keep doing this if you don't want to, right?" Twilight suddenly asked, her face more serious. "I know I put a lot on you, asking you to fill Luna's old role, but now that we've defeated Nightmare Moon you can always go back to your old friends. I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to do this for me or anything-"\n\n"Twilight." The Princess paused to look at her friend, who was staring at her. "Don't worry about it. Telling the truth, I was getting a little bored back there. I've already sent them a note letting them know I'll be staying here for a while longer, and they're doing fine without me." Suddenly, Sunset smirked. "Besides, it's nice knowing I've probably saved Equestria more times than you have by now."\n\nTwilight reached over to punch Sunset's shoulder before the two laughed again. "Well, as long as you want to stay here," Twilight said, her spirit much lighter again.\n\nSunset nodded, right before she got a devious look, one that Twilight was almost afraid of. "Hey, since you said I'm taking Luna's place, do you think I'll get to become an alicorn too?" Sunset asked in a clearly teasing tone. "I know I don't exactly have the most moon-related cutie mark, but I think I could do a pretty good job with this whole "protecting ponies' dreams" thing."\n\nNow it was Twilight's turn to smirk, barely keeping a full smile off her face."

The enemy was being relentless in their assaults, overrunning any defense Equestria could muster. Luna and Blueblood were doing their best, but it still wasn't enough to stop the advance. And all Celestia could do was watch from Canterlot, and lead her ponies from her throne while they fought and died for her and Equestria on the front lines...\n\nBut that wasn't what she needed to focus on at the moment. "Let her in," Celestia said, wondering who it could be. She knew many ponies in Canterlot, but the guards knew most of their names. So who was left that they would not know but she would?\n\nThat answer soon came when the doors across the room opened, and a yellow unicorn mare entered. Celestia's breath still caught in her throat for a moment when she recognized who it was, despite having seen her before not too long ago; her former student.\n\n"Princess Celestia, I know it must be a bit of a surprise to see me here," Sunset Shimmer said as she walked forward, determined but still respectful. "But I found out what's happened. How Equestria is in danger, and not just from some magical creature this time."\n\nCelestia remained silent as Sunset continued. "When Twilight first chased after me into the other world, I didn't come back with her because I was too scared to face you. I had hated you for so long, I didn't know what else to do. And I knew I should have come back to apologize then, to ask for your forgiveness, but I couldn't bring myself to come back to Canterlot." Sunset took a deep breath. "So I stayed instead. I made new friends, went on new adventures, learned new lessons I never would have if I hadn't jumped through the portal all those years ago. Even after I came back, I had hoped that I could find a new life there and be a hero just like Twilight."\n\nSuddenly, her voice became much clearer and steady. "Now though, I realize that it isn't there that I'm needed anymore, but here. Equestria is in trouble, and everypony needs to do their part. So that's why I'm here, to ask for you to allow me to help in any way I can."\n\nCelestia did not say anything. Instead, she got up from her throne and walked down towards Sunset, never breaking eye contact. With every step the unicorn's confidence faltered, but she remained resolute when the Princess finally reached her. Sunset blinked as Celestia laid a hoof on her, before she pulled her former student into an embrace.\n\n"Thank you, Sunset Shimmer," she said. And almost immediately, the unicorn returned the hug in kind."

"What are you sorry about?"\n\n"I helped Stalliongrad."\n"What do you mean?"\n"Remember my village? I did all that with Stalliongrad's help. They helped me set it up as a kind of experiment. And they let me keep going, even when I started brainwashing ponies... I should have known that they'd attack Equestria one day. I should have warned you, I should have stopped them, and now ponies are dying and I want to help but I don't know how and I should have, I should have-"\n\nTwilight wrapped a wing around Starlight as she started hyperventilating. "I'm proud of you for how far you've come, Starlight. You don't need to beat yourself up that you didn't do more."\n\nStarlight looked up at Twilight. "I'm glad you want to help though," said the princess, "You really are a talented unicorn, and if you want to help us fight off Stalliongrad..."\n\n"Will anypony accept me? After what I did?"\n\n"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that," Twilight reassured her, "Sunset is a Field Marshal, practically the head of the Equestrian military, and we used to be enemies! Fizzlepop Berrytwist too, ex-scourge of North Zebrica... Actually, now that I think about it... hmm. Anyways, I'll talk to Sunset, I'm sure she'll be thrilled to give you a commission.""

equestria.190.d:0 "Dear Emperor Grover VI,\n\nI’m sorry to hear this friendship problem has been bothering you. Balancing your own needs, and your persona as a ruling figure can be quite the challenge for anypony, or any griffon, to figure out. It’s important to focus on your responsibilities and ensure you aren’t neglecting your studies, but you also need to ensure that you’re giving yourself enough time with your friends. It is a delicate balance, and one that lots of creatures struggle to get right. Even I had it wrong once, if you can believe it!\n\nDon’t be afraid to put your claw down and be firm in separating your time as a Royal and your time as a person. Politely, yet firmly, ensure that the griffons wanting your attention and autograph know that you are relaxing with your friends. It can be hard to do sometimes and you might feel like you are letting your fans down, but you need to remember that you are only a person in the end. Every creature has their limits to what they can take, and every creature needs time to take a break and relax.\n\nFriendship is the most magical thing that any creature can experience, and you shouldn’t be forced to give up your time with your friends just to placate the demands of your fans. I’m sure they’ll understand if you explain to them you are merely trying to relax and unwind. Please feel free to write to me again if you have any other friendship problems, queries or questions.\n\nYours, Princess Twilight of Equestria.\n\nP.S. Your penmanship is excellent for a Griffon of your age."

EQS_BLUEBLOOD_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of September, 971 in Canterlot\n\n§YRank§!: Field Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Adoptive nephew of Princess Celestia and the scion of the House of Platinum, Prince Blueblood knows very little of a life outside of Canterlot. Raised in the palace with all the prestige and notoriety that the only informal relative to Princess Celestia at the time had, Blueblood soon found that less and less of his aunt's time was devoted to him in favor of the newly-ascended Princess Cadance, her first student Sunset Shimmer, and later her second and future Princess Twilight Sparkle. Rather than complain, which he believed to be ill-fitting of a pony of his position, he instead utilized his free time immersing himself at the head of Equestrian high society.\n\nThis continued for quite some time, and barring a brief debacle involving a Grand Galloping Gala and the Element Bearer of Generosity Blueblood remained a relatively stable fixture of the wealthy in Canterlot. Even following the Canterlot Attack in 1002, when the army reforms were just beginning, Blueblood used his relation to Princess Celestia and his influence in Canterlot to secure the rank of the first Equestrian Field Marshal, practically a purely ceremonial title at the time. However, everything changed in 1005.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Ain Trotgourait and a private talk with his aunt, Blueblood threw himself with surprising seriousness into his newly assigned duties of reforming the Equestrian armed forces by modern standards. Palace officials found him studying Griffonian and Zebrican tactics, histories of warfare, and foreign military organization. And while outsiders would say he is still woefully unskilled compared to his foreign counterparts, no Equestrian can deny he already knows much more about warfare than most other ponies in the peaceful land.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_SPITFIRE_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of November, 979 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Chief Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in the most famous pegasus cloud city in all of Equestria, Spitfire did not start out as the talented flyer she is known as today. In fact, compared to the other future Wonderbolts as fillies, she was relatively unremarkable; just another foal racing to be the fastest. Almost nopony could have suspected what future was in store for her, nor the sheer amount of time, effort and dedication she put in to being the most skilled pegasi in Cloudsdale. It was never natural talent that carried her, but an unshakable force of determination and dilligence to do her best and then some.\n\nOnce she became of age, Spitfire easily won the Best Young Flyer competition in Cloudsdale that year, gaining the attention of the Wonderbolts. Applying herself to running through the Wonderbolts Academy with top marks, the Wonderbolt Captain before her pulled her aside and explained that he would soon be retiring, and that he wanted her to take his place when the time came. He saw that the Wonderbolts of tomorrow would be defined not by their raw talent, but by how hard they could push themselves to be better than they were yesterday. And by 998, Spitfire had broken the academy record for fastest promotion to Captain of the Wonderbolts.\n\nIn the last decade, Spitfire has taken on many positions from leading Wonderbolt aerial shows to acting as drill sergeant for the Wonderbolts Academy and, following the Battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, the formal military position of Air Chief Marshal and the task of creating a new Equestrian air force. And working with her new direct superior Prince Blueblood, Spitfire has taken to learning about the age of aircraft just as seriously as she had the Wonderbolts years prior. Equestria will control the skies just as much as the ground if she has anything to say about it - for her, failure is not in her dictionary.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
EQS_SOARIN_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of August, 980 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: As a foal, Soarin never had the grand ambitions that many other prospective Wonderbolts had. In fact, he had never dreamed of becoming one in the first place. In his mind, his future was one in the weather factory much like his parents, living the easy life. Fate however had other ideas in store, once he found his talent in the skies outflying many of his fellow fillies and colts.\n\nSoarin did not win the year he entered the Best Young Flyer Competition; that honor went to Fleetfoot. That did not stop the Wonderbolts from offering him an acceptance letter to the Academy, which he took at the advice of his friends and family. Soarin was not a star student, but his peers respected him for other reasons; he was not preoccupied with being the best as much as he was having fun. Such a relaxed attitude made him many friends, and when he became a full-fledged Wonderbolt he quickly became one of the most renowned in Equestria for his easygoing nature.\n\nThis notoriety helped him become the official second-in-command of the Wonderbolts in 1002 right before the Canterlot attack, but it was only in 1005 after Ain Trotgourait that he was given the military rank of Air Marshal. Soarin prefers to handle the more administrative parts of the army and air force, as well as aiding Spitfire in the various duties as an officer. And while he'll never turn down a slice of apple pie, everypony knows he takes his job just as seriously as anypony else would.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_FLEETFOOT_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of February, 981 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: When one thinks of raw talent in a pegasus, their mind would usually go to a pony such as the legendary Rainbow Dash or until recently Lightning Dust. What few would remember was that right alongside them was Fleetfoot since the very beginning. A filly with the speed and agility to go far, she saw the path in her life from the beginning; an easy road to the Wonderbolts, to fame, and eventually taking her place as one of the fastest flyers of Equestria.\n\nHowever, things would not come so easily for the filly. She soon found herself outclassed by the rising star Spitfire, and only barely managed to win against Soarin at the Best Young Flyer Competition. This, combined with her time in the Wonderbolts Academy helped Fleetfoot realize that it is not just about natural talent, but also how much you can apply yourself using it. With that in mind she turned over a new leaf, studying the moves of Wonderbolts past and watching and listening to her fellow cadets to improve her own skills and eventually resulting in graduating as a full Wonderbolt in almost record time.\n\nNowadays, Fleetfoot acts as one of the Wonderbolts' fastest flyers and as one of the newly-appointed Air Marshals alongside Soarin since 1005. She prefers the more hooves-on aspects of her officer's role, test-flying new generations of fighter planes and giving feedback to Spitfire on their practical applications. To her, flying is still a serious business whether it be by wing or by plane, and she'd rather stay grounded than be in the air without skill, speed and style.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
EQS_FLASHMAGNUS_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown Date, in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Captain of the Royal Guard\n\n§YBiography§!: Countless centuries ago, the Equestria that Flash Magnus lived in was a far different land. Not much is known of his early life in ancient Cloudsdale, and what is known is mere speculation and legends passed down through the Canterlot and Cloudsdale Archives. But what the legends do say is impressive; wielding the legendary fireproof shield Netitus as a member of the Cloudsdale Royal Legion, he has faced dragons, thunderstorms, and the forces of darkness itself.\n\nLater legends, particularly those that were later confirmed by Stygian tell Flash Magnus as a Pillar of Old Equestria, representing the Element of Bravery. Assembled by Stygian to face the threat of the sirens, he much like his fellow Pillars were sent to Limbo in an attempt to seal the Pony of Shadows, and was only saved in the present day by Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\n\nAfter a brief period of adjusting to modern society, Flash Magnus found himself under the employ of the Crown and the Princesses, becoming a drill sergeant for the woefully outdated Royal Guard. His dedication, loyalty and distinguished service, as well as the legends surrounding him all culminated in his promotion to Captain of the Royal Guard, replacing the absent Shining Armor. And while some may question having an ancient legionnaire reform the the institution, Flash is determined to show that an old stallion can still teach some new tricks.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
EQS_SUNSET_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March, 974 in Prancisco\n\n§YRank§!: Field Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Shimmer has long been defined by one thing that has continued to drive her forward - ambition. As an orphaned filly in Prancisco, she took her natural gift at magic and turned it into her sole focus in life, accomplishing feats at a young age that many other unicorns could never do in their entire lives. Such early mastery of magic caught the attention of the School of Gifted Unicorns, and eventually even the eye of Princess Celestia herself. Such was her talent that the alicorn did something unprecedented in her long reign; she took on the unicorn as her own personal student, hoping to nurture her into becoming the Element of Magic.\n\nSunset's ambition proved too much for the Princess to handle however, and following an incident in 993 where she demanded to be made an alicorn Celestia banished her student from the castle. Instead of leaving, Sunset chose to flee through a magical mirror into an alternate dimension, where she stayed for almost a decade. It was only in 1002 shortly after Princess Twilight's coronation that she returned to steal the Element of Magic. The events that followed across the mirror are a secret known only by the Princesses and Twilight's closest friends.\n\nBarring a few more events involving Princess Twilight crossing the mirror again, very little was heard from Sunset Shimmer for some time. It was only after Equestria found itself in danger that she returned, and with the intercession of Princess Twilight was given a position as an Equestrian Field Marshal to the confusion of many. Nevertheless she has proven herself well in the position, even if many in the general staff find her relative youth for her age and her strange mannerisms confusing to say the least.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Having grown up in the southwestern rock farms, Maud spent much of her life studying to be admitted to the Equestrian Institute of Rockology. During her time studying for her degree in Rock Science she made many important geological discoveries such as the exploration of the Crystal Mountain Range cave systems, and she soon graduated with full honors as valerocktorian of her class.\n\nFollowing her studies, Maud moved into a gem cave near Ponyville and found a coltfriend, Mudbriar. While it was expected that she would continue her research into the many rocks of Equestria and their properties, many including her own sister Pinkie were surprised when she volunteered to lead the Equestrian Army alongside her sibling Limestone Pie. The exact reasoning remains a mystery, though some suspect that it stems from a desire to protect Pinkie from the horrors of war.\n\nMaud has a dry demeanor, monotonous tone of voice, and almost never smiles as a sharp contrast to Pinkie Pie. Despite this attitude she still has a deep passion for rocks, and deeply loves her sisters and family. As a general she primarily leads a commando unit of earth ponies along with her sister Limestone, and acts as a first-degree combat geologist utilizing her vast geological knowledge alongside her incredible speed and tremendous physical strength. Soldiers say that if Maud Pie can't hold a defensive position, then nopony can.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
EQS_LIMESTONE_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of March, 980 on the Pie Family Rock Farm\n\n§YRank§!: Lieutenant General\n\n§YBiography§!: As the oldest of the four Pie Sisters, Limestone Pie has rarely ever known a life outside the rock farm. Raised to be the inheritor of the farm and to carry on the Pie Family legacy, her entire childhood was spent learning the time-tested methods and traditions of the southwest, tending to and mining the rocks on the fields. Following Maud leaving to pursue her degree in Rock Science and Pinkie leaving to spread laughter across Equestria and settling in Ponyville, Limestone took over managing the farm from her parents and expected a long life of honest work alone ahead of her.\n\nThe war changed all that. When Limestone heard that her sister Maud was joining the army, she quickly left the farm back in the hooves of her parents and demanded to be made an officer as well. Given her almost inequine strength and a desire by multiple government officials not to have their bones shattered, she was made a Lieutenant General second-in-command to Maud Pie in the newly formed earth pony commando group. The rock farmer has taken to the role with the utmost seriousness, performing surprisingly well in leadership positions.\n\nLimestone is an incredibly aggressive and commanding pony, something that causes friction on occasion with superior officers. Nopony can deny her effectiveness in keeping discipline though, and many attribute to her the incredible effectiveness of the commandos whom she remains protective of. In her mind, they are all that stand between everything she loves whether it be her sisters, the rock farm or Holder's Boulder; everypony else can either fall in line behind them or get out of the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

EQS_FIZZLEPOP_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of January, 972 in Blackthorn\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Many years ago Fizzlepop Berrytwist was a unicorn filly much like any other, with dreams of attending Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns along with her friends Spring Rain and Glitter Drops. But on one fateful day, an encounter with an ursa minor left her horn completely broken and her face scarred. Feeling abandoned by her friends who soon left for Canterlot to continue their studies without her, Fizzlepop eventually turned her back on Equestria and left seeking to find a new path in life and become a fearsome warrior, taking on the name of Tempest Shadow.\n\nAfter some brief adventures in Abyssinia and Klugetown involving the Misfortune Malachite, Tempest struck a deal with none other than the Storm King; in return for acting as his second-in-command and right hoof, he would restore her horn upon conquering Equestria. She accompanied and led his armies on their conquest of North Zebrica, at this point a ruthless and driven military leader. It was only at that Battle of Ain Trotgourait when Princess Twilight Sparkle convinced her to betray the Storm King, resulting in his death and a Hippogriffian victory over the invading forces.\n\nSince then, Fizzlepop had returned to Equestria with Twilight and traveled the nation seeking to help others in need and make a difference. And yet, no matter what she did, she never felt like she fit in or belonged in a peaceful land that knew nothing but friendship. So when Equestria came calling for new minds to help in its defense, Fizzlepop returned to take up a new command, this time under the flag of Harmony. Her blunt and cynical personality as well as her knowledge of war provides much to the command staff, and she is determined to prove herself and take any opportunity to defeat difficult opponents, whether that be in personal combat or with armies on the battlefield.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

While she is earnest in reintegrating towards modern society, and earning the adoration of her subjects, Luna rarely enjoys the attention her elder sister, Princess Celestia, receives. Her efforts in guarding the dreams of ponies are greatly appreciated, but what is Luna's greatest contribution today is leading ponies in the field, much like in the glory days of old before Equestria's unification.

They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private schools, and once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions (who were suitably intimidated). After Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. During the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. Undaunted by a major injury, she simply cobbled a makeshift eyepatch and cantered back to her duty. Afterwards, she would continue to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps in a supporting role, albeit many question how her unit tends to be more generously supplied than the others.

His fondness of defensive strategies and digging trenches was favoured by the Equestrian command staff, and he eventually rose up to a part of the military high command. Sentinel would love nothing more than to personally oversee the construction of a defensive line on the Changeling border, which his colleagues jokingly call "the Sentinel Line".§!"
EQS_ponka_desc:0 "§gPinkamena Diane Pie, usually known as Pinkie Pie, is the Element of Laughter and works as a baker in Ponyville's Sugarcube Corner. She is energetic and sociable, loves to make others laugh, writes songs and organizes numerous parties for everypony in town.\n\nThat is, before the dark clouds of war covered Equestria. She takes the threat very seriously, knowing that if it is not stopped, the ponies she loves will suffer or even perish. Her attempts at using her happy and friendly attitude to approach the enemies of Equestria failed terribly, and now she knows the only thing that can save Equestria is violence. She has joined the officer corps of the Equestrian Army, ready to use her reality-bending abilities to save her homeland.§!"
EQS_tempy_desc:0 "§gFormerly known as Tempest Shadow, Fizzlepop Berrytwist was the second-in-command of the Storm King himself. In her youth she was a regular unicorn filly and dreamt of enrolling in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, but then an ursa minor attacked her and broke her horn. Without her magic, her friends soon abandoned her and joined the School for Gifted Unicorns. Bitter and lonely, Fizzlepop left her homeland to Zebrica, where she eventually stumbled into the Storm King. Having tricked his soldiers and impressed him with his combative personality, the Storm King offered her the vacant position of second-in-command. She accepted and in return the Storm King promised to restore her horn once he had gained enough magical power to do so.\n\nWhile Storm King was preparing his ambitious invasion of Equestria, Twilight Sparkle and her friends encouraged Queen Novo of Hippogriffia to attack him. During the following Battle of Ain Trotgourait, Fizzlepop managed to capture Princess Twilight Sparkle. However, when she presented her bounty to Storm King, he still refused to restore her horn, which enraged Tempest. After a brief fight between the two, Twilight intervened and saved Tempest's life, and she in turn joined with her and ultimately defeated the Storm King, turning him to stone with his own magical artifact.\n\nNow she has returned to Equestria and embraced her former name, travelling the land and aiding fellow ponies. Her military experience is great and she is more than happy to aid us§!"
EQS_sunrise_moonshadow_desc:0 "Born in 978 ALB, Southern Equestrian countryside. Sunrise was raised in the farming family whose export is mainly rice. He was raised among his older brother whom he didn't like, Sunrise did not have such easy life in his childhood due to the fact that poverty is common in the rural region, Sunrise enjoyed the outside world despite knowing how good, robust and beautiful the cities are, but still, he is particularly fascinated by the forest, jungle world. In his free time he was usually walking through the forests, sometimes living in there. Soon the harsh jungle is like a paradise for him - he could easily live there for the rest of his life. Some time later Princess Luna and Celestia came to visit his little town. That's when his cutie mark appeared, after the princesses have blessed him. From that moment he sworn to serve the princesses as best as he could. One day a draftpony came to his little town. Sunrise was fascinated by the world he can see by going to the military, but also that he can finally fulfil his destiny to serve the princesses. Almost without thinking he agreed to join the Equestrian Armed Forces.\n\nAfter much dedication and hardship, his efforts came into fruition. He was quickly assigned to Royal Canterlot Division in 1001, intense and harsh training was common place in the elite division. Time's passed. One day his company was chosen to a special training with the Royal Canterlot Guards and the Lunar Guards to strengthen the coordination between those units, after the lessons have learned in the first changeling attack on Canterlot in 1002. During those specialized trainings, it has shown himself his natural talents, Sunrise was one of the best from all of his company or even the guards. He quickly ranked up and was assigned to the Lunar Guards as an officer. Then later, the general of Equestria. When the Great War starts, he has shown his natural skills in managing his armies in the forest."
EQS_cynosura_desc:0 "A member of Equestria's naval high command, Cynosura stands firm in her beliefs that a powerful navy is essential in securing a future of Equestrian success. Born from a middle class family in Manehattan, she spent much of her foalhood gazing at the busy harbours of her city; the youthful stories of New Mareland's founding and age-old tales of trades and journeys in the distant lands of Griffonia amazed Cynosura, from which she learned that both riches and dangers lie in the vast ocean and beyond. Inspired to venture through the seas in this new age, Cynosura sought to look beyond the horizon; her parents were inclusive about her career, and had her enrolled to the naval academy she wished for.\n\nCynosura joined the navy once she graduated, and soon her talents began to show. She was capable of navigating large fleets with exceptional efficiency during war games, likewise knowing how to deliver heavier strikes while taking less damage during simulations. Combining her passion with profession, she rose through the ranks, attaining the rank of Admiral, a position only few were able to achieve at her age. She never gave up on her belief, and insisted that a fleet in being was essential even at times of peace. However with only pirates as targets, a navy was hardly Equestria's concern. Only recently, with the storm of war rapidly approaching her horizon, Cynosura might perhaps finally see the opportunity to put her talents and creed at work."

LEADER_OLI_DESC:0 "Like many of the thestrals who were shunned and forgotten, Oli Equites lived with his fellow bat ponies in the caves, ignored by all. It was not the ideal kind of life, lacking comforts and acceptance, but as long as they had each other, the thestrals were content. This isolation was broken when Princess Luna led her campaign to bring the issue to the forefront of the Equestrian public. Her words captured Oli's thoughts and he went off, despite his parents' protests, into the world beyond the cave.\nHis first and foremost desire was to protect the harmony Luna preached, especially after the incident occurred. Although nopony was hurt, and the event may have actually contributed to achieving rights for thestrals, Oli wanted to ensure that such would never occur again, and he made his way to the nearest recruitment centre. After proving his worth through an arduous training regimen, Oli became one of the first non-commissioned bat pony officers in the Equestrian army, proudly serving for the diarchy."

###TECHNOLOGY###

EQS_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Yak 'Tank' Infantry Fighting Vehicle"
EQS_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Equestria, reeling from the military defeats during the conflict with Stalliongrad rushed to produce prototype copies of the makeshift Stalliongrad vehicles. One tester, nearly overwhelmed by the exhaust choking the poorly ventilated interior, likened the experience to 'sitting inside of a fuel tank'. Critics of the project seized on the comment, and the nickname 'tank' stuck, with the true name quickly forgotten."
EQS_gw_tank_equipment_short:0 "Yak 'Tank'"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Following the failure of initial designs to produce adequate results for the new role tanks were entering on the battlefield, Equestrian theorists finally came up with the Breezie towards the end of 1005. Fast, lightly armored, and mostly designed to engage in infantry and unarmored targets it was nevertheless the first major step in Equestrian tank development. Despite major design flaws, lack of Equestrian production meant it saw limited combat in the initial stages of the Great War."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Hastily proposed for rapid design and deployment after the shocking Canterlot attack by Queen Chrysalis, the Muletilda was plagued by changing requirements, competing designs, and bureaucratic interference. The final result, once efforts to make room for wings of pegasi crew members were abandoned, was as idiosyncratic as its development, and little resembled other Equestrian designs. The Muletilda was lightly armoured, had limited firepower, but was fast, reliable, and a massive improvement over the Breezie."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Parasprite"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially a Muletilda replacement, the Rainbow's development was massively delayed due to its design being 'appropriated and adjusted' for the Timberwolf, a temporary Twilight stand-in. When the lighter Rainbow design was finally ready, it was arguably already obsolete, as Equestria struggled to repel the seemingly endless tide of well armoured Changeling Panzers."

EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experience with the Muletilda quickly demonstrated that tanks with greater protection and firepower were needed. Work on a new design, the Twilight, began, but progressed so slowly that a stopgap was required. The result was the Timberwolf, a modification of the incomplete Rainbow project, with a new engine, more armor, redesigned turret, and larger main gun added. The Timberwolf was the first Equestrian tank to combine adequate speed, respectable armour, and significant firepower."
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Timberwolf"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The story of the Twilight is the story of the Equestrian war in microcosm. An ambitious magitek design proposed at the onset of the Great War, its development began in an era of administrative chaos and was badly delayed. Ambition met reality, and the magitek elements were abandoned due to a lack of required specialist unicorn mechanics. When the Twilight finally began production, Equestria was a new, reformed military machine, and it symbolised the awakening of Equestrian military power."
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Timberwolf"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Manticore"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "With new expertise from the Stalliongrad tech sharing project the Comet revisited the ambitious goals of the Twilight, but with a more realistic approach. More refined in its systems, it utilized the very best of Equestrian technology. Arriving in time to lead the drive into the heart of the Changeling Lands, Comet tanks became a symbol of Equestrian liberation and victory, as they rolled through formerly occupied towns of cheering deer and sullen, defeated, hives."

EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The development of tanks led to two schools of thought on their use. The 'Trotists' envisioned them as the final word against frontier predators and localized threats, able to defend a village from elder dragons or work closely with infantry to clear out a rogue Changeling hive. The Cerberus was designed to their specifications; expensive, slow, and prone to mechanical problems, it had decent armour and carried significant firepower in its multiple turrets."

EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Experience with heavy combat demonstrated a need for larger, better armoured, tanks, with powerful main guns, to counter enemy tanks and entrenched defenses, and act as the spearhead for breakthrough forces. The Celestia was designed in response to those requirements, and, while it suffered from mechanical issues due to its weight and the failure of hoped-for magitek engine and transmission system components to be manufacturable on an adequate scale, it was judged to be generally effective in those roles."

EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially conceived to support a spearhead by the (ultimately shelved) Ursa Major, the (now ironically named) Ursa Minor refined the Celestia's design. Longer, with a new turret, and larger main gun, its mechanical systems were improved, and the armor somewhat reworked. It was effective as an improved breakthrough tank, but the mechanical issues were not entirely solved and it remained quite slow."

EQS_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As the daunting task of taking the fight into the Changeling Lands approached, many unusual and extreme designs were considered. Envisioned as the ultimate expression of raw force, this design's engineers hoped pure brawn could defeat Changeling cunning and resistance. It was ultimately shelved, with only a few prototypes produced, as much needed reinforcements of common sense continued to pour into Equestrian bureaucracy."

A jack of all trades tank to serve any role and protect any pony, the tank entered service four months after the final surrender of the Changeling Hives, and was widely studied in wartorn Griffonia, serving with distinction as Equestria entered a more active role in the world."

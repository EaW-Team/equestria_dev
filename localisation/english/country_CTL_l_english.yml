 ### FOCUS ###

 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "...One Must Remain"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and artisans of Chital and restoration of the fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With the Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Munpani season; he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 #CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 #CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With the Godi"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian Godi still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Jakob the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With the Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, a native religious sect known as the "Tuya" has existed on the political fringe of Chital. In these trying times, the Tuya's charitable actions, as well as its militant defiance of our regime have attracted new members. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast." 

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With the Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make difficult decisions regarding its future."
 
 #CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 #CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Yaril possesses his ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

 CTL_on_the_berserkers:0 "A Yaril's Reputation"
 CTL_on_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Our Yaril is known as a kind and timid figure throughout all of Chital and beyond. While this personality meshes well with the reform movements, advisors like Jakob the Grey are less than happy about his dissimilarity to his father Benjen IV. Perhaps it is time for the Yaril to try and change?"

 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer:0 "A New Face"
 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer_desc:0 "Currently Benjen lacks a comfortable power base where it matters in Chitali politics and appointing a new advisor to court the favour of one of the many factions in Chital would shore up his support in crucial ways. The only question that remains is who to appoint for such an important task..."

 CTL_council_call_up:0 "Seven Shall Enter..."
 CTL_council_call_up_desc:0 "Seven deer of all stripes make up the Council of Seven, forged in the chaos of the Hindian anarchy of the early 1000s, including Benjen himself. If Chital is to be reformed substantially before the end of the year, we must win the war of influence within this body, and secure the loyalty of its kingmakers... or if all goes south, kingbreakers."

 CTL_the_council_of_9:0 "Support for the Council"
 CTL_the_council_of_9_desc:0 "These times increasingly seem like critical ones in Chital's history, and all factions wish to make a move. With pressure from the entirety of the council, the Yaril will be adding a consultant to support the governmental body. Whichever faction can fill the role will become far more powerful in matters of governance..."

 #CTL_the_supply_issue:0 "Supplies Against Socialism"
 #CTL_the_supply_issue_desc:0 "The southern lands where communists and rebellious nobles roam have always been hard for the Chitali Yarils to control. And now, when the rebels have access to explosives and canons, our logistics have been thrown into disarray. We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 #CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Ending the CPLF"
 #CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Loyal military units have tracked down the CPLF's final holdout in the southern hills, and we are ready to finally put an end to this. The Yaril, by tradition, shall lead his forces personally to battle against the rebels. Chital shall be free of them once and for all!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "A Rumble in the Jungle"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "There have been recent rumours of growing discontent in some of the southern provinces that have begun to cause concern. There seems to be some communist agitator working in the region to stir up trouble among the native population. While it is still in its early stages, we should act to stop it before it starts."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "An Axis Connection"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "During our efforts to deal with the communist hotbed that is the south we've discovered several documents and correspondences that link the growing issues to the Axis. We're not sure of the authenticity or what the real connection is, but it might be worth digging into."

 #CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim the Spices"
 #CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. At present, they lie in the hooves of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts. Reclaiming these plantations would secure our regime much-needed funds for the continued conflict."

 CTL_royal_progress:0 "The Royal Progress"
 CTL_royal_progress_desc:0 "It is time for the Yaril to take a trip throughout the south. He will meet with supporters and dissidents alike to try and firm up his rule.\n\nLet's hope he knows what he is doing."
 
 
 ###THE NAVAL TREE, BOW DOWN###
 CTL_restoring_our_pride:0 "Restoring Our Pride"
 CTL_restoring_our_pride_desc:0 "When our Olenian ancestors arrived on this continent they did so in command of the greatest fleet of their time. Now, the pitiful state of our fleet leaves the spirits of our forefathers displeased, and our future as a serious power in doubt. We must dedicate resources towards reinvigorating our naval heritage."

 CTL_legacy_of_the_sea_kings:0 "Legacy Of The Sea Kings"
 CTL_legacy_of_the_sea_kings_desc:0 "The Sea Kings, the thalassocratic masters of the deep blue from centuries past, showed the world with their grand fleets the power of our people; nowhere was beyond the might and justice of deerkind, and no evil could rest with the righteous wind in our sails. Now is the time for us to look to the past so that we too may command great fleets and conquer our place among the glorious few in the coming storm."

 CTL_legacy_of_the_raiders:0 "Legacy Of The Vikingar"
 CTL_legacy_of_the_raiders_desc:0 "The Vikingar: sea phantoms of yore — whose sudden assaults swept every coastline in search of plunder — are romanticized subjects of national pride for deer of Olenian descent. We must reinvigorate their memory with raids anew; terror shall sweep the seas, and new developments into light vessels will ensure nothing is beyond our reach."

 CTL_a_new_form_of_raiding:0 "A New Form Of Raiding"
 CTL_a_new_form_of_raiding_desc:0 "Valuable experiences from our recent naval reforms, as well as conflicts abroad, have taught us the hidden strategic potential in regards to submarines. If we are to spread terror from the surface, then dread too shall emerge from under the waves as we innovate upon the principles of hit-and-run warfare to send enemy tonnage to the bottom of the sea."

 CTL_large_scale_submarine_investments:0 "Supremacy On The Seas"
 CTL_large_scale_submarine_investments_desc:0 "No race but deer, and deer alone, can be masters of the sea. Our submarines — with renewed funding fueling their development — will organize into herds, from which they can harass and destroy the enemy from beneath the depths with greater efficiency."

 CTL_form_the_chital_admirality:0 "Formalize The Chitali Admirality"
 CTL_form_the_chital_admirality_desc:0 "For long have we honoured our great heroes, our statues of the most talented admirals and intrepid sea lords looking down upon the nation of today. But looking back at our past will only do so much. By pushing for a new, more modern admiralty, new heroes may soon rise to stand just as tall as their glorified ancestors."

 CTL_prepare_the_chitali_marines:0 "Prepare The Chitali Marines"
 CTL_prepare_the_chitali_marines_desc:0 "The first and most renowned bulwark against outside threats are our Marines. The Chitali Marine Corps, CMC, has historically been our most elite fighting force: they are the tip of the spear, the shield of the Yaril's family, and they are in a piteous state of affairs. If Chital is to ever revitalize the ambitions of our ancestors, then we must bring the CMC to contemporary standards as soon as possible."

 CTL_infrastructure_near_sri_cervidae:0 "The Sri Cervidaean Waterway"
 CTL_infrastructure_near_sri_cervidae_desc:0 "The demand we've set for building new naval vessels has surpassed the capacity of even our greatest dockyards, and the space in our naval bases dwindle as more and more ships are forced into cramped harbours. As a remedy to this problem, several prominent politicians and naval officers have suggested building dockyards and a secondary port across the shores from Uusi Hirvimaa."

 CTL_dockyards_in_the_capital:0 "Building A Naval Hub"
 CTL_dockyards_in_the_capital_desc:0 "The art of building ships for a mighty navy is one of the centrepieces of our race and history, yet our shipbuilding economy is stagnant and our dockyards remain underdeveloped. Temporary construction grants to rebuild our naval prowess and infrastructure will hopefully kick our old traditions back into action."

 CTL_naval_designer:0 "Hire The Companies"
 CTL_naval_designer_desc:0 "Businessdeer representing a Macawian-based naval development firm have come forward with a proposal to work under a Chitali government contract. Accepting their offer will undoubtedly help make trade relations with our neighbours to the north more cordial while letting their experts hasten the development of our navy."

 CTL_support_from_the_naval_houses:0 "Rally The Naval Houses"
 CTL_support_from_the_naval_houses_desc:0 "The aristocracy of our nation is not immune to the draw of the sea, rather, many houses are ennobled by mastery of the waves. Over centuries, they have mastered techniques that many others have not. If we courted their support, the aid we receive in return could pay great dividends should we standardize the practices across the nation."

 CTL_formalize_the_yaril_aatto_port:0 "Formalize Aattohamn"
 CTL_formalize_the_yaril_aatto_port_desc:0 "An unofficial port of sorts has sprung up within the vicinity of Ostkranbi, a sizable village filled with seasoned shipbuilding families who have recently moved due to our moves to reinvigorate the naval industry. With its rapid growth, we should officialize this new city, and what better name could there be than one to honour the late Yaril Aatto?"
 
 CTL_worthy_of_the_old_traditions:0 "The New Knarrs"
 CTL_worthy_of_the_old_traditions_desc:0 "The first Olenians — the heroes we venerate, the ancestors we celebrate — to spot the coast of Zebrica were sailors aboard knarrs. Today, we honour their legacy by titling our newest achievement in honour of their triumph. Chitali Knarrs are bastions of the endeavours of deerkind: battleships of tremendous power capable of rendering our foes into submission with overwhelming firepower." 

 CTL_the_strongest_ships:0 "The Strongest Ships"
 CTL_the_strongest_ships_desc:0 "A mighty open seas fleet is not only imperative for maintaining the interests of our country abroad, but it is also crucial for our very survival. Dedicating resources towards research and development on more advanced battleships will ensure that no foreign navy can cripple our future."

 CTL_chital_rules_waves:0 "A Presence On Every Shore"
 CTL_chital_rules_waves_desc:0 "Deer, and deer alone, will once again be the masters of the sea. Our navy is now not only set to the modern standards we first theorized of but in many ways, an advanced force rivalling or even surpassing the greatest global powers. The incipience of our modernization program may've been slow, but now we can be certain: our seafaring ancestors smile down upon our illustrious navy from the heavens!"
 
 
 ### THE QUESTION OF THE MILITARY ELITES ###
 CTL_the_question_of_the_military_elites:0 "The Fate Of The Yaril's Army"
 CTL_the_question_of_the_military_elites_desc:0 "Backwater and destitute; orthodox and proven. These arguments linger like a plague in the halls of our military schools and debates between staff officers of the new and old guards. Chitali staff officers are torn on how the future of our army should fight, but between the two camps there is a unanimous consensus: our disorganized army must undergo radical changes if we are to survive the coming storm."

 CTL_purge_the_armed_forces:0 "Purge The Jakobites"
 CTL_purge_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "The future of our army is the future of our nation: the future of our people! Our patience for the Olenian peerage has run its course... the lily-livered Jakobite parasites must be annihilated, for the honour of Mahimata!"

 CTL_mass_assault_lol_funni:0 "We Have Troops! Use Them!"
 CTL_mass_assault_lol_funni_desc:0 "The Yogi teaches us of the strength of virtuous, overwhelming power. Therefore, to our new cohorts of strategists, there is nothing more righteous than an indomitable swarm of infantry and artillery! We shouldn't complicate ourselves with the matter of tanks and trenches, let the earth tremble, whether it be from our guns or under our thunderous hooves!"

 CTL_omg_epic_kemerskai_tactics:0 "Focus On Artillery"
 CTL_omg_epic_kemerskai_tactics_desc:0 "Fortune favours those with superior firepower. Artillery is the queen of the battlefield: she is the patron of grand batteries, who — unlike mighty battalions — consistently bring victory. We should dedicate all relevant military funding towards making our gunners the most skilled in Zebrica, as well as research towards bringing our field artillery tactics up to contemporary standards."

 CTL_fresh_native_officers:0 "Fresh Native Units"
 CTL_fresh_native_officers_desc:0 "Our nation's military has traditionally not been a very popular employer of the Hindian-majority population, who for generations has seen it as nothing more than an extension of the incessant bickering of the Olenian aristocracy. Now, new troops are needed to fill the vacant ranks left by recent restructuring. Sending recruitment officers to the countryside will invariably bring recruitment figures up."

 CTL_heat_acclimation:0 "Heat Acclimation Tactics"
 CTL_heat_acclimation_desc:0 "When the first Olenians arrived onto this continent it wasn't a war or a great disaster that decimated their settlers, it was the weather. The heat, unbearable for foreign invaders, can be of great tactical use to us; the natives of this land are already well-acclimated to the heat, able to evade heatstroke and illness. Further extreme weather training will ensure our forces are masters of hot weather warfare."

 CTL_adopt_their_theories:0 "Adopt Their Theories"
 CTL_adopt_their_theories_desc:0 "As the dominance of Olenian strategic theory declines as a consequence of the changing demographics of our military, proponents of previously ignored Hindian military strategy have become the dominant faction in our general staff. Hindian military theory places a higher value on frugal logistics and reconnaissance than traditional deer warfare, which we can exploit."

 CTL_army_of_a_modern_chital:0 "Army Of A Modern Chital"
 CTL_army_of_a_modern_chital_desc:0 "The modern Chitali army is unrecognizable to the ramshackle forces who safeguarded our borders in the past. Hitherto our regiments were the subjects of mockery, their officers an embarrassment to the art of war. Now those who once derided our army stand in awe at its magnificence. Chital is now guarded by a well-organized fighting force utilizing modern tactics and equipment. Chital is ready for war."

 CTL_depoliticize_the_army:0 "Depoliticize The Chitali Army"
 CTL_depoliticize_the_army_desc:0 "The Chitali Army is a disjointed collection of bickering factions, even after the Jakobite purge. If we are to seriously consolidate our army into an effective, organized fighting force, then we must move to depoliticize our army. A more thorough purge will also force open new investment opportunities for small arms concerns still loyal to the old guard."

 CTL_special_forces_divisions:0 "Promote Special Forces Research"
 CTL_special_forces_divisions_desc:0 "The capricious state of warfare shows an increasing trend towards elite units capable of performing specialized tasks no soldier could accomplish normally. The daring exploits of these nonpareil foreign troops — particularly paratroopers and mountaineers — have garnered enough attention amongst our staff officers for significant resources to be pooled into a special forces research fund."

 CTL_new_research_divisions:0 "New Research Divisions"
 CTL_new_research_divisions_desc:0 "The revolutionary changes to our army have brought many once irrelevant officers or those who couldn't even have their voice heard in the first place, to the forefront of our reorganization program. A band of company officers and industrial concerns have stepped forward to see how they can put their knowledge to good use, asking if they could form new divisions for military research."

 CTL_promote_ieffri_huddarnen:0 "Bolster Traditionalist Officers"
 CTL_promote_ieffri_huddarnen_desc:0 "The future of our army cannot be jeopardized by those too morally infirm and mentally incapable of properly running a military! Ieffri Huddarnen, a staunch Jakobite staff officer of Olenian descent, has proven himself to be a more than capable leader to guide this radical transformation. We should remodel the officer corps after his example and promote him to marshal at once."

 CTL_jakubs_obsession:0 "Jakob's New Obsession"
 CTL_jakubs_obsession_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey may be a traditionalist in the political sphere, but certainly not when it comes to the affairs of the army. A brilliant strategist, general, and admiral, Jakob's next modernization to Chital's grand army has been the institution of tanks, a process we must continue."

 CTL_the_tried_and_tested:0 "The Tried And Tested"
 CTL_the_tried_and_tested_desc:0 "Why should we complicate war with newfangled tractors with guns on them when weathering and swarming the enemy in elaborate plans always works? Why waste valuable time and resources on developing armoured vehicles when we can instead destroy enemy armies in one fell, dramatic swoop? There is plenty of experience to draw from to create a truly concrete grand battle plan."

 CTL_entrench_jakobite_control:0 "Royal Military Companies"
 CTL_entrench_jakobite_control_desc:0 "The Chitali arms industry is a collection of cottage private arms manufacturers and a hoofful of state-owned factories, and the Jakobites have voiced concerns about the inability of the current state of our military-industrial complex to fulfil the needs of our growing army. We should move to not just subsidize new military factories throughout the country, but to also establish a Chitali state armoury."

 CTL_conserving_our_deer:0 "Conserving Our Deer"
 CTL_conserving_our_deer_desc:0 "There is nothing more important in our military than our soldiers, those who are out on the battlefield fighting under our flag. Thus, it stands that we should attempt to keep as many of them alive as possible and spare no effort in keeping them in fighting shape. Such advances will also benefit the civilian sector if we invest in the proper infrastructure and employment."

 CTL_motorized_and_mechanized_finalization:0 "Huddarnen Motorized Plans"
 CTL_motorized_and_mechanized_finalization_desc:0 "The days of long, exhausting infantry manoeuvres on the battlefield are over! Marshal Huddarnen has long been an advocate for motorization and mechanization, which would give our command-level units greater manoeuvrability and flexibility on the battlefield. The future is now, and the future is deer on wheels!"

 CTL_branch_coordination:0 "Inter-Branch Coordination"
 CTL_branch_coordination_desc:0 "Every branch of our land forces should be committed to accomplishing the same mission. By integrating the commands of different branches towards a greater joint strategic command, we will be able to coordinate all elements of our army to succeed at a united objective."

 CTL_core_infantry_research:0 "Core Infantry Research Departments"
 CTL_core_infantry_research_desc:0 "All warfare is a matter of infantry. While our strategic theorists may have gotten lost with developing new tanks, or new ways to build trenches, we have not forgotten the importance of the soldier who truly carries the day. A hoofful of industrial concerns have requested the government to fund new research departments, and obliging them would ensure our infantry have the best weapons available."

 CTL_tap_into_olenian_magic:0 "Tap Into Olenian Magic"
 CTL_tap_into_olenian_magic_desc:0 "Deerkind is blessed with magic. Premonitions of the future and a spiritual link to the past guide the present being for a deer. The land we trot, the skies breathing wind over our heads, they're all extensions of an incorporeal reality, and we can and should weaponize that. We should look towards synergizing our tactics with the magic of the Olenians, masters of cold weather warfare and logistics."

 CTL_create_the_chitali_air_force:0 "Formalize The Chitali Air Force"
 CTL_create_the_chitali_air_force_desc:0 "The Chitali Air Force may not technically exist, but the groundwork for it already exists. Wealthy nobles, leisure pilots and foreigners have all contributed to our knowledge of air power, even if it is more an aerial yacht club with guns. If we formalize it into an official part of the military, perhaps we can turn them into something more useful."

 CTL_gadra_family_industrial_plans:0 "House Gadra Industrial Plans"
 CTL_gadra_family_industrial_plans_desc:0 "House Gadra, home to some of Chital's most renowned pilots, will be instrumental in creating a respectable Chitali air force that can hold its own in the skies. Renowned for their deerlike light frames and nimble nature, the designers have offered their help should we invest in the industry and air bases for them to do their work. A simple agreement, with wide-ranging benefits for both sides."

 CTL_hindian_recon:0 "Hindian Reconnaissance"
 CTL_hindian_recon_desc:0 "Throughout the history of deerkind, foreign threats have often been soundly subdued by the amount of information scouts and seers have been able to gather about their forces. Deer are masters of reconnaissance, and the importance of information on the enemy is not lost on our fledgling air force. No creature can hide for long with Chitali scouts in the skies."

 CTL_bombing_technology:0 "Begin Bomber Development"
 CTL_bombing_technology_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are very flexible and are shaping up to be an important aspect of the air force. However, our local designs for such aircraft are... practically nonexistent. We will rectify that mistake now, and begin our development for these important parts of aerial warfare."

 CTL_gri_plane_tech:0 "Support From The Feathisians"
 CTL_gri_plane_tech_desc:0 "Our air force must be flexible and dynamic, being able to adapt to any situation required in warfare. Tactical bombers can fulfil many roles, and few have looked into that doctrine more than the Feathisians. With the right words and perhaps a few gifts, we might be able to learn something about how to do things ourselves."

 CTL_capitalist_plane_tech:0 "Gryphussian Company Aircraft"
 CTL_capitalist_plane_tech_desc:0 "The number one priority of the air force should be the complete destruction of the enemy's war industry. Without it, they are left weaponless and our army can easily defeat them. Gryphus has done substantial research into the methods of complete and utter destruction via airpower, and we would do well to learn from them. A few diplomats could go a long way in shoring up relations too."

 CTL_wng_plane_tech:0 "Ties In The Regia Aernoautica"
 CTL_wng_plane_tech_desc:0 "Our army is what wins wars, and the air force should be modelled to support it in all ways possible. With support from the skies, our infantry will push ever onward into enemy territory. The Regia Aeronautica, or the air force of Wingbardy, is well known for its tactical support doctrine, which we should seek to study from abroad."

 CTL_procure_new_fighters:0 "Procuring New Fighters"
 CTL_procure_new_fighters_desc:0 "If we are to grow our air force to any significant operational capacity we will need to first procure actual aircraft. Fighters, the base of all strategic air manoeuvres, can be easily purchased through countries wishing to thin their inventory. We should look for sources of these new opportunities from wherever possible."

CTL_reopen_the_benjen_iv_industrial_bureau_desc:0 "Recent developments in Chital have alerted us to the disturbing fact that the reforms of Benjen IV, the father of Yarils Aatto and Benjen V, still need massive overhauls to complete their intended goals. Leftovers from the lacklustre abolishment of thralldom and incomplete urbanization must be addressed."

CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science:0 "Establish a Scientific Branch"
CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science_desc:0 "The Industrial Bureau's efforts to modernize our nation can not only be limited to factories and labour reform. Our nation is also far behind the rest of the world in terms of science, and it is time for us to catch up. Opening a scientific wing within the Bureau will be the first step on this path."

CTL_bridging_the_education_gap:0 "Bridging The Education Gap"
CTL_bridging_the_education_gap_desc:0 "While our northern cities have begun to develop an educated middle class, the same can not be said for the south. Efforts must be made to ensure that every region receives funding for basic education so that we can all move to the future together. One should not be left behind simply because of where they live in Chital."

CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers:0 "The Quest For Skilled Workers"
CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers_desc:0 "It does not matter how many factories or how much industry we have if there is no deer educated in the ways of using or working them. The shortage of qualified and educated workers needs to be rectified immediately; trade schools will be opened so our population can be educated on their opportunities and how to take advantage of them."

CTL_teach_the_ancient_rites:0 "Revive Magical Education"
CTL_teach_the_ancient_rites_desc:0 "Magic is part of a deer's inherent nature, and we must be educated in the matters of such as much as anything else. The ancient rites of the deer are part of our heritage, and the Hamaholm School of Magic will allow the next generation to learn as their forefathers did."

CTL_libraries_of_chital:0 "Libraries Across Chital"
CTL_libraries_of_chital_desc:0 "Establishing a network of free public libraries full of both educational and enjoyable texts will hopefully encourage literacy and education amongst our subjects. After all, there's nothing like reading a good book with friends, especially if you learn something from it too! The informal education will help guide the young into who they want to become, and how they can be a part of the nation."

CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm:0 "Kahnli's Southern Roots"
CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm_desc:0 "Our economy should remain rooted in the plantations and agriculture of our south, so says Southern noble and socialite Wasil Kahnli. We produce many useful products like tea, rubber, and spices there, and exporting these goods will surely bring us prosperity."

CTL_get_them_to_work:0 "Baronnen's Northern Innovation"
CTL_get_them_to_work_desc:0 "Our northern factories need further support to grow, and further subsidies will increase industrial output and lift many of the urban poor out of poverty. This will lead to unprecedented economic growth in Chital, so says Northern noble and administrator Elik Baronnen."

CTL_northern_industrial_primacy:0 "The Northern Approach"
CTL_northern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Elik Baronnen, a prominent Northern industrialist, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the North of Chital. Although his biases towards industrialization and the Olenians over the native Hindians in the North may prove cumbersome to deal with, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

CTL_southern_industrial_primacy:0 "The Southern Strategy"
CTL_southern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Wasil Kahnli, a flamboyant socialite and aristocrat, and a prominent supporter of the South and its native Hindians, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the South of Chital. Although we cannot be truly sure of his intentions, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

CTL_focus_on_resources:0 "The Rush Of Excavation"
CTL_focus_on_resources_desc:0 "Chital is rich in natural resources like minerals and rubber, currently unexploited due to our recent civil strife and instability. The possible economic boons from these resources are immense, and we should focus on the construction of the necessary infrastructure to make use of them."

CTL_allure_of_manufacturing:0 "The Allure Of Manufacturing"
CTL_allure_of_manufacturing_desc:0 "The modern economy is the manufacturing economy, the course of history inevitably showing that the economics of the future involves increased specialization and mechanization. One day we will no longer need to employ a massive amount of our population in agriculture and mining, and our economic policy needs to prepare for this day."

CTL_longships_into_traders:0 "Longships Into Traders"
CTL_longships_into_traders_desc:0 "Our history of Vikingar is long and full of great tales of glory, but with raiding international shipping is generally frowned upon in the modern era, our diplomacy requires a new strategy. The longships once used would be excellent trade ships as well, bringing back spoils for the nation in a different, less controversial way."

CTL_minimum_wage:0 "Begin Industrial Regulations"
CTL_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Uninhibited industrialization is a double-edged sword. It can bring great wealth to the factory owners, and the government through taxes, but it leaves open the possibility that the people may suffer. Thus, we must act as a shield between the desires and profits of industry and the livelihoods of our citizens."

CTL_freedom_in_markets:0 "Keep Our Hooves Out Of It"
CTL_freedom_in_markets_desc:0 "Industrial regulations have only ever led to increased strain on the government and business through bureaucracy and red tape, trying to have the administration watch over everything and enforce every code balloons costs that transfer down to the citizenry. Letting the market take its course is the inevitable best solution in the long run."

CTL_invest_in_industry:0 "Invest In Industry"
CTL_invest_in_industry_desc:0 "Despite being one of the more developed states in Hindia, Chital remains rather backwards compared to the rest of the world in its industry and widescale production. Government investments in certain regions of the country, as well as the encouragement of new industrial factories, should help us in closing the gap and making us a more competitive economy on the world stage."

CTL_sweet_sweet_rubber:0 "Sweet, Sweet Rubber!"
CTL_sweet_sweet_rubber_desc:0 "We are lucky enough to be in one of the most rubber-rich regions in the world, and as militaries modernize and more importantly motorize, the precious resource will only go up in demand. Expanding our current facilities and ensuring we benefit the most from this is an opportunity we can not afford to pass up."

CTL_arms_for_the_struggle:0 "Begin Industrial Militarization"
CTL_arms_for_the_struggle_desc:0 "Chital must not be left defenceless, and there are many regimes that may wish to see ours fall, and our deer enslaved. We must be ready for such a scenario, and focusing our efforts in arms manufacturing and military industry will give us the edge so that when the enemy comes someday, we will be prepared to strike back."

CTL_chitali_deer_in_chitali_factories_desc:0 "With the many resources we have available at our disposal, and our economic base which only grows by the day, we have found ourselves in a position to become a strong industrial power, if we just put in the effort. As our Chitali march to work in their newfound employment within the cities, it is within our sight to one day rival the powers of Griffonia and Equus."

CTL_self_sufficiency_always:0 "The Path To Self-Sufficiency"
CTL_self_sufficiency_always_desc:0 "Becoming reliant on foreign nations is a one-way path towards destruction. Chital, as well as Hindia, must learn to stand on its own four hooves and look outwards with an independent mindset."

CTL_restart_the_eastern_trade_routes:0 "Restart the Eastern Trade Routes"
CTL_restart_the_eastern_trade_routes_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Olenians came from the East, sailing from their homeland in Olenia. By looking back in this direction we find the wealthy and industrialized Equestria, open to our longships. This time, however, there won't be any sacking."

CTL_aid_from_the_macawians:0 "Chital's Own Pact Of 907"
CTL_aid_from_the_macawians_desc:0 "An industrialized and modern nation right to our west, the islands of Macawia have taken on a role as a protector of the waters of Northeastern Zebrica, and maintain dominance over trade in the region. While their occupation of rightful cervid land in Uusi Hirvimaa is a sore point for us, tightening economic ties could pay dividends in the long run."

CTL_legalize_labour_organizations:0 "Legalize Labour Unions"
CTL_legalize_labour_organizations_desc:0 "With industrialization, attempts of unionization come with it. These organizations are an important part of protecting workers' rights, ensuring that they are not abused by their employers and fighting for better conditions. By officially legalizing them, we offer them much-needed support and the thanks of the workers for little cost."

CTL_protect_employers:0 "Employers First"
CTL_protect_employers_desc:0 "Unions are a relatively new arrival to Chital, as our industrialization has been limited at best. But as the factories open, so do the parlours of the union bosses. Unions are a threat to the traditional economic structure that has created capital across the world for generations, but they allow workers a defence against abuse. So we shall tolerate them and grant some rights, but we must always think with our wallet."

CTL_let_them_know_their_place:0 "Crush The Movement"
CTL_let_them_know_their_place_desc:0 "Unions are a relatively new arrival to Chital, as our industrialization has been limited at best. But as the factories open, so too does the mouth of the red serpent, ready to swallow our naive populace. The only result of unions is the spread of socialism, and socialism is the greatest threat to our nation as a whole. We must destroy these subversive groups posthaste lest the fangs sink deeper."

CTL_close_the_bureau:0 "Close The Benjen IV Industrial Bureau"
CTL_close_the_bureau_desc:0 "The Bureau has served its purpose, and the time has come to close this chapter of Chitali history. Our industrial progress is far beyond what it once was, and we must now give thanks that we have entered the modern era. Whether we pray to the Olenian Gods or Mahimata, bread shall be broken this night, as Chital enters the annals of modern history."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control:0 "The Schemes Of Madame Hira"
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger daughter of Jakob the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakob and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakob the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information on the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still sceptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Operatives in the Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditionalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance so that it pains Jakob the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at each other."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and the Axis for years. Herra Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_work_with_hoversholm:0 "Work With Herra Ivar"
 CTL_work_with_hoversholm_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat's position in government is a complicated situation, but one thing remains clear - that he is not the correct candidate to serve as Hira's right-hoof deer, especially because of his radical ideology. Ivar Hoversholm, while a forceful and often disruptive personality, is a competent administrator and good friend to Madame Hira, and so shall take Bhushan's place as unofficial second-in-command."

 CTL_an_axis_eternal:0 "All Cards On The Table"
 CTL_an_axis_eternal_desc:0 "Chital is the Axis, and the Axis is Chital. With the legacy of the corrupt monarchy of the Kudlinens all but eradicated and a puppet monarch installed loyal to the populist goals of the Axis, it appears that a new dawn is finally in reach for Chital. Now, Hira must turn her eyes to the opposition that still lurks in the shadows... and on the world stage."

 CTL_restructure_the_army:0 "Eradicate the Viking Ethos"
 CTL_restructure_the_army_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey and his murderous raiders may have once been an influential part of Chitali society, but now, they are simply a useless relic of Chital's bloodstained past. The high position of these deer in society must end, and their ancient privileges must finally be abolished so that an egalitarian Chital can rise."
 
 CTL_the_watchful_eye:0 "An Army of Agents"
 CTL_the_watchful_eye_desc:0 "It takes but one crack to let in weakness and crumble a kingdom. The only way to ensure the safety of the kingdom and its citizens is constant vigilance on all matters of day-to-day life. Some might call this an intrusion but what have they got to hide that's what we want to know. Only the guilty have anything to fear."

 CTL_their_outdated_customs:0 "Diplomats On Every Corner"
 CTL_their_outdated_customs_desc:0 "Too many of our Hindian brothers view Chital's leaders as wretched imperialists, who have continued to oppress the natives of our nation even under Ramachan's government. This cannot be further from the truth. Our international policy must entail returning to the world stage as a friend to all Hindians, and an ally to the oppressed of all Zebrica."

 CTL_open_economy:0 "A Long Road to Justice"
 CTL_open_economy_desc:0 "For too long have the honourable deer of Chital been beaten down by an economic and social order that cares only for its image. We must chart a new course that can end the oppression of our Hindian brothers, but to do so, we must bring in some actual economic advisors not focused on lining their pockets."

 CTL_break_the_system:0 "All Power to the Agencies"
 CTL_break_the_system_desc:0 "The Council of Seven is above all, an undemocratic structure, designed to oppress the interests of the Axis of Chital and the Chitali people. It has only served to strengthen the authority of Yaril Benjen and his puppets, all the while maintaining a farce of democratic governance in Chital. The Council of Seven must be abolished if we are to truly cement the Axis and bring an end to the Yaril's lies."

 CTL_democratic_pretenses:0 "Just And Democratic Pretenses"
 CTL_democratic_pretenses_desc:0 "Hira and the Axis gained power on promises of populism and anti-elitism, and for that reason, it is clear that the Council of Seven and the oligarchic values it represented would be better left in the past. A Chitali Assembly, with elected representatives from across Hindia, would be a better advisory legislature to Brienna I and Madame Hira than any undemocratic privy council could ever be."

 CTL_redistribute_political_power:0 "The Deer's Ascendance"
 CTL_redistribute_political_power_desc:0 "Should the deer of Chital not rule themselves, as they had for centuries before the barbaric Olenians first landed on our fair shores? It should be the deer themselves that decide who represents them and what the path of Chital should be, not an unelected Oleno-Hindian minority, and certainly not an Axis of Chital dictatorship that would be just as undemocratic. Democracy must come to Chital!"

 CTL_religious_syncretism:0 "A Syncretist Platform"
 CTL_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "Hira has never been a particularly religious doe, viewing it more as a social and political tool than actual moral truth. However, Chital is a deeply religious nation, and simply declaring the nation a secular state would inspire mass resistance. Knowing that, we shall use religion as a tool to encourage unity and comradery between all free Hindians of Chital, even if we have to edit some fundamental tenets."
 
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers:0 "United Under Mahimata"
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers_desc:0 "Mahimata, the mother goddess of Mahimatism, is a core part of Chitali life, and her teachings have guided hundreds of thousands if not millions of Chitalis. Instead of dividing ourselves among Hindian and Olenian lines, we must unite under our common faith and Mahmiata's vision of an agrarian, protected, and integrated Chital."

 CTL_seers_as_propagandists:0 "The Traditionalist In The Room"
 CTL_seers_as_propagandists_desc:0 "Godi Konnar has been reluctant to accept any reforms that remove the dominance of Godi in the Chitali religious scene, continually claiming that they are the only party that can bring about a return to Chital tradition. Unfortunately, he does not seem to be placatable and continually has held back pro-native and progressive reform. He and his allies must be marginalized, or somehow... dealt with."

 CTL_a_new_elite:0 "The Herd's Aristocracy"
 CTL_a_new_elite_desc:0 "A new Council of Seven shall be formed for the benefit of the nation, but this time, it will not be overrun by absolutist traitors and controlled opposition without a voice. This time, the Council of Seven will serve Chital, its people, and especially the natives, above all. Ramachan's loyalists may hold all the seats, but if the people prosper, is that inherently negative?"

 CTL_only_the_loyal:0 "A Cloak and Dagger Confederacy"
 CTL_only_the_loyal_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was not fundamentally terrible. While the original design was a complete failure, there is always a possibility the aristocratic design of the Council can be used for something greater. Reforming the Council of Seven to serve the Axis and the people, not the crooked elite, would ensure stable, strong governance, even if it denies the people "democracy"."
 
 CTL_the_surveillance_state:0 "Total Control and Total Devotion"
 CTL_the_surveillance_state_desc:0 "To make something that will last you have to follow a design and stick to it; you can't just hope for the best and make it up as you go. To build a strong Chital that can stand the test of time every deer must know their role and stick to it. With a firm hoof Madame Hira has laid out a plan for our future and it is the duty of every citizen to follow it to the letter."
 
 CTL_the_hundred_year_yarildom:0 "A Chital to Call Home At Last"
 CTL_the_hundred_year_yarildom_desc:0 "Guidance and care need not be cruel. By setting out a framework of the state and allowing our deer to operate freely within that framework they can find the best way to achieve Hira's goals. Like the mother of the nation, she shall raise us up and help us find our path."
 
 CTL_the_new_democracy:0 "The Flower of Hindia Blooms"
 CTL_the_new_democracy_desc:0 "The government of Chital is there to serve the deer of the nation, not the other way. Maintaining stability and maintaining control are two very different things. By allowing our deer to dictate the direction they want the nation to go they will be happier and more willing to work towards that future, leaving the government free to take the best route there."

 CTL_banking_reform:0 "Liberal Market Reforms"
 CTL_banking_reform_desc:0 "A tightly controlled economy cannot respond quickly enough to global changes in demand, supply, shipping and conflict. By allowing the economy to develop in response to the market we can better predict these changes and trends and make the most of them. Not total freedom of course, that would be ridiculous, the corruption of the banking sector is well known for instance."

 CTL_begin_the_land_reform:0 "The Grand Southern Land Reform"
 CTL_begin_the_land_reform_desc:0 "The southern provinces of Chital have not just been passively overlooked, they have been wilfully ignored for hundreds of years and denied the chance to demonstrate their worth. There are perfect sites for industrialisation already marked and waiting for the factories."

 CTL_subsidize_waterfront_industries:0 "Waterfront Capitalism"
 CTL_subsidize_waterfront_industries_desc:0 "With the continued development of our economy and the greater opportunities available to our deer, we have a new chance to expand our exports aboard.

 CTL_phase_out_thralldom:0 "Decide Davirtannen's Fate"
 CTL_phase_out_thralldom_desc:0 "Benjen Davirtannen is a good industrialist but he is also a shrewd politician in his own right having served on the council for many years. He is a survivor above everything else and with an offer of peace and some mild threats, I'm sure he can be made to willing step out of the way of progress."

 CTL_radical_industrialization:0 "Statism for the Herd"
 CTL_radical_industrialization_desc:0 "If our government and economic advisory council would decide to follow a strictly capitalist system, the same structural inequalities that characterized the past Chitali regime would emerge once again, and the Hindians would be worse off for it. Instead, we must follow a policy of state intervention so that our government can alleviate such inequalities first hoof before they spring up again."

 CTL_control_economy:0 "Steer The Economy"
 CTL_control_economy_desc:0 "Our country has been allowed to stagnate for far too long, without Direction or purpose it is fallen behind and become the great shame of the modern world.

 CTL_hindia_united_desc:0 "The Hindian Wars are over, and we have emerged victorious with our opposition defeated. However, the truth is becoming clear; there can only be one nation to unite Hindia. To reclaim our destiny, we must continue our march, and finish what our ancestors started."

 CTL_deal_with_barasingha:0 "Issue of the Isolationists"
 CTL_deal_with_barasingha_desc:0 "Barasingha, despite being a part of Hindia, has long been isolationist even from its deer brethren.

 CTL_deal_with_doelhi:0 "Deal with Doelhi"
 CTL_deal_with_doelhi_desc:0 "A loose confederation of native Hindians, Doelhi has long been an enemy of Chital for the length of the two's existence. Peace always seemed an unlikely option between our two nations but now, as tides have changed, perhaps there is still a chance that we can reconcile. But either way, they must join a united Hindia as all deer will."

 CTL_deal_with_sambar_desc:0 "Sambar, the other state born of Olenian subjugation, remains an oppressive Yarildom under a tyrannical regent who refuses to give its bloodline the throne.

 CTL_llambeti_protectorate_desc:0 "We have conquered Llambet, but we do not mean to come in as conquered or oppressors.

 CTL_liberate_the_deer_of_stagpal_desc:0 "Stagpal is a small state, one on the border between Hindia and Llambet with sizable populations of both deer and llamas.

 CTL_demand_our_homeland:0 "Uusi Hirvimaa or War"
 CTL_demand_our_homeland_desc:0 "The island of Uusi is sacred to all Hindian deer. It is from here that we first rose and spread across Hindia, whether it be for the original Hindians or the Olenians who came after. That it remains outside our influence is an insult, and such an insult can not stand. No matter what, the island will be part of Hindia again, no matter the cost."
 
 CTL_common_cause_with_macawia:0 "Reapproach Macawia"
 CTL_common_cause_with_macawia_desc:0 "Despite their unlawful and downright insulting occupation of Uusi Hirvimaa, the Macawians do not need to be our enemies.

 CTL_fresh_faces_desc:0 "Although they have been denied a voice in the Council of Seven for years, the Yaril's faction at court, known to the nobility as the "Council of Six", has aided in the advancement of his progressive agenda throughout his reign.

 CTL_eqs_mode:0 "The Great Harmonic Transition"
 CTL_eqs_mode_desc:0 "Many obstacles have been removed that previously blocked our reformist agenda, yet our transition to Harmony will not be easy, nor will it be unopposed.

 CTL_replace_the_administrators:0 "Purge Noble Corruption"
 CTL_replace_the_administrators_desc:0 "Initially, the setbacks of modernization were chalked up to bureaucratic errors or local pushback in uncooperative regions.

 CTL_modernizations:0 "Bring Modernization South"
 CTL_modernizations_desc:0 "The north has seen real progress in the transformation to the standards of modern society but at the expense of the south and the native Hindians being left behind in almost primitive conditions.

 CTL_shattering_agrarian_monopolies_desc:0 "For too long has the agrarian economy of the south been controlled by the few and elite nobles, who exploit their monopolies for financial gain and stifle innovation in their respective regions.

 CTL_leap_forward:0 "Subsidize Southern Nationalizations"
 CTL_leap_forward_desc:0 "Benjen Davirtannen and his modernist have helped open the gateway for the south's prosperity, yet simply ending the monopolies will not do us much good. The state needs the ability to directly intervene and guide the process of industrialization, but doing so successfully would be... difficult. A few subsidies, as part of a wider plan proposed by Davirtannen, should smooth the process considerably."

 CTL_welfare_state:0 "The Chitali Safety Net"
 CTL_welfare_state_desc:0 "The world of today is one of hardship and poverty, but these are not things we must be forced to live with. To help alleviate these troubles of society, Yaril Benjen V and Davirtannen have announced a widespread welfare safety net, to ensure the people have what they need to survive and prosper.

 CTL_davirtannens_influence:0 "Unbearably Slow and Unfathomably Steady"
 CTL_davirtannens_influence_desc:0 "The Yaril should not sideline the idealists entirely, but the transition to Equestrianism should best be left within the hooves of moderate reformists.

 CTL_bolster_the_technocrats_desc:0 "The elite of the country should be included in building towards a new future.

 CTL_an_olenian_bureaucracy_desc:0 "It is not the nobility that is needed to run Chital. It is the bureaucrats, the endless and faceless deer who make sure that the affairs of state-run smoothly from day to day, who deal with the issues that crop up throughout the country. We have been severely lacking in the state of our bureaucracy as of late, and a major overhaul and expansion should aid the government in its administration."

 CTL_competent_advisors:0 "No More Schemers, No More Courts"
 CTL_competent_advisors_desc:0 "The royal court and its nobility has proven to be of no help to Chital, and only serve as a place for political schemes and alliances to push personal agendas upon the nation and its people.

 CTL_establish_the_council_of_six_desc:0 "The loyal Chief Minister Ninessen is the foremost proponent of Harmony in Chital. Therefore, it stands that any who oppose her or her methods and reforms also stand against Harmony itself. Any and all obstructions must be swept aside, including the old nobility who will be replaced with those who think similarly to our Chief Minister."

 CTL_the_tools_of_chitali_democracy:0 "Hunt Down The Pair"
 CTL_the_tools_of_chitali_democracy_desc:0 "Falsified reports, an intentional stirring of dissent, covert alliances with Southern traditionalists and socialist revolutionaries - and those are only some of Hira's crimes as spymistress! Our Yaril has been deceived since the moment he first appointed her to the Council, but now, things shall all be set right. Our deer will be sent to hunt them down, and eliminate them as threats to Chital."

 CTL_keep_around_hoversholm:0 "The Republican Détente"
 CTL_keep_around_hoversholm_desc:0 "Hoversholm's fears have been proven false, and neither traditionalist royalism nor hardline Equestrianism has won out in Chital. With such a seemingly beneficial outcome for him and Shah now in Chital, perhaps we can convince him to work with our Chief Minister or join a democratic opposition - anything but open sedition will suffice."

 CTL_crush_the_communists:0 "Lessons From Stalliongrad"
 CTL_crush_the_communists_desc:0 "One cannot be tolerant of intolerance. While it might pain them to admit it, republicans such as Dannya Shah and Ivar Hoversholm only play into the hooves of the Spymistress, just as Stalliongrad did the Changelings. We are not authoritarians, and a democratic trial shall commence for their sedition - afterwards, their sentence will be passed accordingly."

 CTL_ostracize_the_seers:0 "Sweep Aside The Godi"
 CTL_ostracize_the_seers_desc:0 "The Godi, and the other pieces of Olenian religion that have existed since the formation of Chital, now only serve as an impediment to our future as a secular and fair society. The unjust privileges that they have enjoyed for so long must be torn down so that deer of all faiths, whether they be Olenian or Hindian, can come together as one."

 CTL_the_democracy_plan:0 "Four Steps To Democracy"
 CTL_the_democracy_plan_desc:0 "Democracy is not something that comes instantly but instead takes time to truly achieve. If we are to do so, we must have a united, concrete vision of how to proceed. Our own Raili Ninessen has come up with four points, or 'Pillars' as she calls them, which will make up the foundation of our newfound efforts."

 CTL_the_secular_agenda:0 "For A Secular Chital"
 CTL_the_secular_agenda_desc:0 "With the Godi sidelined and their privileges gone, it is time to finish our process of secularizing our nation. Schooling, public services, land rights, everything must be adjusted to remove the unfair bias we have had for the Olenian faith for too long. Citizens will never again have their lives impeded by their religion, and be free to choose their own beliefs."

 CTL_benjens_brand_of_justice:0 "Benjen's Brand Of Justice"
 CTL_benjens_brand_of_justice_desc:0 "Corruption, underhoofed influence, and intrigue. This was once the state of Chitali politics. For us to gain trust in the system, our justice must be fair and clean, promoting open and harmonic discourse instead of the mindless propaganda of the communists and supremacists. If the people believe that we are fair, then they will believe in our harmony."
 
 CTL_civilization_to_the_south:0 "All Together Now"
 CTL_civilization_to_the_south_desc:0 "We are not split by our Hindian or Olenian heritage. We are Chitali, together as one and the same, united by our common belief in the idea of harmony. We may have our differences, and there may be issues we can never reconcile, but no longer shall we be judged solely by our birth or our ancestors. Friendship brings us together, and now we're better than ever."
 
 CTL_a_new_cultural_assimilation:0 "A New Cultural Assimilation"
 CTL_a_new_cultural_assimilation_desc:0 "There are parts of both Olenian and Hindian culture that are unique and should be encouraged. But at the same time, we can not let such petty differences fragment us and cause infighting. Both must come together and assimilate into a new unique blend of deer unity, of two pieces becoming one whole so that we all may see each other as equals and partners."

 CTL_benjen_secret_police:0 "Hindia's Own S.M.I.L.E"
 CTL_benjen_secret_police_desc:0 "Hira may have been a traitor and a fascist, but she was also an adept spy. Without her, our ability to conduct intelligence operations is extremely lacking and leaves us vulnerable. A more politically suitable infrastructure must be created in her place in order to defend democracy instead of assault it."

 CTL_the_kungliga_riksdagen_desc:0 "Finally, it is time to establish the structure we have been building the foundation for. This new parliament is Davirtannen's final step, and with his guidance as Chief Minister, we will finally step into the future Chital needs. Benjen will remain as a respected figure to guide society, while the state and policy are led by Divirtannen and the ministerial technocrats he has appointed to advise."

 CTL_the_yaril_and_his_mayors_desc:0 "Much like Celestia, the Yaril of Chital needs to be much more than just a title. It is a figure to look up to, something to unify all deer of Hindia under a serene and peaceful monarch. With our system solidified, we can finally call Benjen not just a ruler of Chital, but a Prince of Harmony all his own."
 

 ### JAKUB TREE ###

 CTL_the_old_advisor:0 "Uncle Jakob's Good Example"
 CTL_the_old_advisor_desc:0 "The time for reform is over. With the Council and people rallying behind Jakob the Grey, the traditionalists now have a clear mandate to save Chital. In time, the Equestranists, the progressives, the republicans, and the despicable Axis - they will all fall.\n\nThe old advisor will make sure of it."

 CTL_the_eastern_generals:0 "Warriors of the East"
 CTL_the_eastern_generals_desc:0 "Generals Huddarden and Westfelt, alongside many other important military figures in the east, have always been loyal to Jakob politically. While their tendencies may go a bit past normal traditionalism, to a point one might call them extremists, their dedication must be rewarded; turning a blind eye and giving them some say in the government should suffice."

 CTL_speak_with_benjen:0 "Speak With Benjen"
 CTL_speak_with_benjen_desc:0 "Benjen is unhappy with many of the figures Jakob surrounds himself with, and has openly opposed Chitali traditionalism ever since he replaced the advisory council of Aatto with the Council of Seven. Now, he has raised opposition in regards to the old reformists, who were his previous political allies. Jakob will speak to him personally to ensure he remains placated with the traditionalists."

 CTL_purge_the_axis:0 "Wiping Away the Stain"
 CTL_purge_the_axis_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan and Bhushan Gurat have done nothing in the past decade but subvert our government, scheme in the shadows, and attack all good-natured loyalists to the Yaril, whether they be reformist or traditionalist! Although Hira is simply an incompetent charlatan, Bhushan is much more dangerous - and as a result, must be eliminated."

 CTL_chital_lives_and_dies_with_benjen:0 "Chital Lives And Dies With Benjen!"
 CTL_chital_lives_and_dies_with_benjen_desc:0 "No matter what, Benjen is still the Yaril, and still the leader of Chital. While he may been led astray, Jakob would never attempt to remove his power out of some fear or anger towards him. He will remain in his place as the unifier of the country, just with a new advisory council more capable of aiding him correctly."

 CTL_liberating_the_yaril_from_himself:0 "Liberating Benjen From Himself"
 CTL_liberating_the_yaril_from_himself_desc:0 "The Yaril is too far gone. It was cause for alarm when he removed Aatto's old advisors, but now, he is moving into open resistance against all that Chital has stood for. With a heavy heart, Jakob shall make broad policy limiting the Yaril's powers and investing them in himself as the Diwan."

 CTL_leash_the_industrialists:0 "Leash the Industrialists"
 CTL_leash_the_industrialists_desc:0 "The industrialists have proven to be an opposition to our traditionalism, albeit a minor one. While they have committed no treason or done any crime which warrants punishment, they must still be marginalized to ensure their influence remains in check. In particular, the RMEC must be taken down and Davirtannen removed from his post."

 CTL_continue_the_priveleges:0 "Align the Southern Nobility"
 CTL_continue_the_priveleges_desc:0 "The south has for too long been ignored by Ostkranbi, leaving the entire region underdeveloped and a drain on the nation. If we are to fix this, the first step needs to be bringing the local nobility back in line, by any means necessary. Privileges will be given to those who listen willingly, and the remainder will be swept aside if necessary."

 CTL_national_employment_programs:0 "Get the Hindians Working"
 CTL_national_employment_programs_desc:0 "The Hindians are a source of labour untapped by Chital from the chaos of the south, despite the nation languishing from a lack of production for the army. National employment programs in the regions that need it most will rectify this issue, and give them the opportunity for honest and hard work."

 CTL_decrease_hours_of_leisure:0 "No Time For Recreation"
 CTL_decrease_hours_of_leisure_desc:0 "The Chitali people spend too much time on leisure as of late. There is work to be done in Chital, and the nation needs you! Wasting time on fruitless pursuits only brings the nation, and your personal glory down. Only through sacrifice can all of us rise to be something greater."

 CTL_work_for_chital_and_chital_shall_work_for_you:0 "Work For Us, And We Shall Work For You"
 CTL_work_for_chital_and_chital_shall_work_for_you_desc:0 "Personal gain is not what a true Chitali works for. They work for their brothers, their warriors who take the weapons they make and wage war in their name, bringing glory to the nation. There is no higher cause than such honour given through arming the soldiers, and let the deer know that as they work for Chital, Chital works for them in turn."

 CTL_challenge_sambars_jewel:0 "Challenge Sambar's Jewel"
 CTL_challenge_sambars_jewel_desc:0 "To be the master of the seas as we once were, we must have a mighty fleet to project our power.

 CTL_strike_at_trade_routes:0 "Strike At the Trade Routes"
 CTL_strike_at_trade_routes_desc:0 "In the hearts of all true Olenians, there is a calling for the sea. To feel the ocean breeze on your face, to look out over the deep waters of the oceans and sail into glorious battles against your enemies. We strike hard and we strike fast, our raids on transports once more becoming legend as what was once legend becomes real again."

 CTL_reshuffle_the_council:0 "Restore the Council of Aatto"
 CTL_reshuffle_the_council_desc:0 "One of Benjen's first acts as Yaril was dismissing all the advisors his brother Aatto had in place and creating the Council of Seven in their stead. This was one of his worst mistakes and one that almost caused Chital's collapse. These old loyal deer must be brought back to advisory to serve again, even if some of the nominees may be a bit... aged."

 CTL_strict_traditionalism:0 "Restrain the Yaril's Weaknesses"
 CTL_strict_traditionalism_desc:0 "The Yaril Benjen is one of the line of Kudlinen, yet his time among the reformists has installed many weaknesses which could one day threaten to topple Chital once again. Our loyal Diwan Jakob will speak to the Yaril once more, and hopefully, help him restrain such impulses or ideals for the good of the crown and nation."

 CTL_a_new_spymaster:0 "A New Spymaster"
 CTL_a_new_spymaster_desc:0 "Hira is gone, along with her entire intelligence network, yet we can not deny that she played an important role while on the Council, even if it was utilized for treason. We will need to find a replacement, one who hopefully will have the knowledge and skills necessary to track down the last unaccounted remnant of the Axis, and bring them the justice that they have evaded for so long."

 CTL_power_to_the_generals:0 "The Chitali Kratocracy"
 CTL_power_to_the_generals_desc:0 "The Yaril has been sidelined, but the nobility remains. Some work with us, but the vast majority now oppose our traditionalist values for the future of Chital; chief among them Eva Pillai, one of the former members of the Council of Seven. They must be marginalized and pushed out of Ostkranbi; warriors and generals will make much better advisors than they ever have."

 CTL_purge_the_puppetmasters:0 "Purge the Puppetmasters"
 CTL_purge_the_puppetmasters_desc:0 "While his father and brother waged wars for the soul of Chital, Benjen V was pampered and praised at every opportunity, growing up with court jesters, charlatans, and busybodies who spared no moment to instil him with Equestrian ideals of opulence and decadence. Those who once poisoned him must be dealt with; with all they have done, there can be no mercy for those who sought to put the Yaril on a string."

 CTL_no_mercy_for_the_axis:0 "The Axis of Evil"
 CTL_no_mercy_for_the_axis_desc:0 "The Axis of Chital was not merely an axis of resistance, but one of evil - bent on destroying the very foundations of orderly Chitali society. Even more worrying, Arad the Karkadanni has given us concrete evidence that Hira, not Bhushan, was the true mastermind behind the Axis. We may have underestimated the spymistress, but now, we will right all these past wrongs, and crush this great evil."

 CTL_a_royalist_heir:0 "Appoint Rashanth As Deputy"
 CTL_a_royalist_heir_desc:0 "With the support of the advisory council and the Yaril, Jakob has personally selected Pensha Rashanth, his loyal friend and general to succeed him as Diwan. A freed Hindian thrall, she will carry on the banner of stability and honour, and is certain to serve the Yaril as best she can; just as her mentor as taught her to."

 CTL_a_nationalist_heir:0 "Appoint Huddarnen As Deputy"
 CTL_a_nationalist_heir_desc:0 "After much internal debate, the military council and the Diwan have appointed Ieffri Huddarnen as the official successor to take Jakob's place. Certain to maintain traditionalist, kratocratic policy, he will certainly not allow a return to the weakness of reformism, for better or for worse..."

 CTL_remember_our_history:0 "Remember Our History"
 CTL_remember_our_history_desc:0 "We were great once - the heirs of Ivor and Cnoof, the most powerful conquerors the race of deer had ever seen!

 CTL_societal_militarization:0 "Our Duty to Fight"
 CTL_societal_militarization_desc:0 "When hard times come and enemies come to threaten Chital, do we bow down in the name of peace? Never! It is the duty of every soldier, of everydeer to fight for his nation and honour no matter what may come. And with war on the horizon, the time of conflict is coming very soon."

 CTL_mandatory_military_service:0 "Mandatory Military Service"
 CTL_mandatory_military_service_desc:0 "War breeds soldiers. Service breeds strength. The youth of today do not know of the trials and tribulations of their forefathers; they have known peace and prosperity, but not of the cost it took to reach it. Mandatory year-long conscription will teach them discipline, and perhaps motivate them to become the deer we need them to be."

 CTL_duty_to_civilize:0 "Our Duty to Civilize"
 CTL_duty_to_civilize_desc:0 "The Olenians came to conquer the Deerlaw, yes, but that was only the first step in their reign. The native Hindians were uneducated, divided and backwards, and they remain as such to this day. It is our duty, as proud Olenians to enlighten and civilize our brothers so they they can join us united as cervids together."

 CTL_olenian_missions:0 "Reestablish the Olenian Missions"
 CTL_olenian_missions_desc:0 "In the old days, Olenian Missions were established all across the Deerlaw, to teach the natives the lessons of the homeland and provide them skills to serve. They fell into disuse with time and the collapse of Olenian rule, but now our efforts can revive these institutions to serve their purpose once more."

 CTL_world_of_propaganda:0 "A World of Propaganda"
 CTL_world_of_propaganda_desc:0 "The right words in the right places can make all the difference, and there is nothing proven to be more effective at convincing the populace than hard propaganda. Unity, militarism, pride and legacy, tradition; all these things must be held in the highest regard and known throughout the entire country so that all from the oldest stag to the youngest doe know their place."

 CTL_we_are_all_sons_of_ukko:0 "We Are All Sons Of Ukko"
 CTL_we_are_all_sons_of_ukko_desc:0 "If thousands of freed thralls could search for a better life, rise up the ranks of the military, and help serve Chital with the strength of any Olenian, why could a native not? Now that we have instilled Olenian culture into our southern populace, it is time to treat the integrated as we would a true son of Ukko."
 
 CTL_wage_thralldom:0 "A Thralldom of Wages"
 CTL_wage_thralldom_desc:0 "To our enemies, the price we extract for the blood they spill, the Chitali who we have lost, is their eternal service. Not in the glory of the military, but in the factories, working off their debt by producing what others need instead. Times have changed, and unlike in the past we will still provide decent wages for them to live their lives, but they will continue to work whether they wish to or not."
 
 CTL_to_the_strongest:0 "Till de Starkaste!"
 CTL_to_the_strongest_desc:0 "Nodeer has ever gained anything by losing. Strength is a virtue and one that brings victory. And with victory, comes spoils and the glory of triumph. We are the strongest, we fight with honour with our brothers beside us, and we march forever onwards for the Yaril, for Chital, and for the Diwan. Long live Chital! Long live the Yaril!"
 
 CTL_obedience_above_all:0 "Shatter the Ethos of Dependence"
 CTL_obedience_above_all_desc:0 "Darker times create stronger deer, yet lighter times produce complacent deer, deer relying on the generosity of the state and their peers instead of their own discipline and iron character. As we save this nation and Hindia from certain peril, we must too stem any growing tides of weakness and dependence, lest we leave the warriors of the next generation without the strength to save Chital."


### EVA TREE ###

CTL_eva_marches_on:0 "Eva Takes The Reins"
CTL_eva_marches_on_desc:0 "To the surprise of many in Chital, from traditionalist to reformist, the Axis sympathizer and pragmatic royalist Eva Pillai has secured the blessing of the Yaril and formed a new government accordingly. With a strict focus on centrist politics, pragmatism, and national unity, Pillai hopes to unite the Council to seek the aims of the future - progress, healing, and modernization."

CTL_reach_out_to_the_reformers:0 "A Few Favors There"
CTL_reach_out_to_the_reformers_desc:0 "Ivar Hoversholm has been left out of Benjen V's inner circle, often referred to as "The Three", for years following his failure to secure the position of Chief Minister. Securing his support would be easy - make him feel like he is in charge, and promise him everything and more without giving him any of the power to enforce it."

CTL_talking_with_the_traditionalists:0 "Some Others Here"
CTL_talking_with_the_traditionalists_desc:0 "Benjen V and more radical members of the traditionalist faction have already clashed numerous times, and tensions between Equestrianists and far-right elements are clearly in a state of no return - or are they? With a few choice words and promises of restraint, perhaps Eva can yet sway the general staff."

CTL_the_one_who_has_to_go:0 "And Those Times Where Diplomacy Fails"
CTL_the_one_who_has_to_go_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has been a thorn in the side of our government for longer than many Chitali even know. Although Eva holds personal respect for his dedication, he must be given the treatment of Ivar after his failed coup years ago - exile from Ostkranbi and complete humiliation among the nobility."

CTL_march_straight_forward:0 "March Straight Forward"
CTL_march_straight_forward_desc:0 "The various systems of Chital that threatened to destroy each other are now all running like clockwork, all thanks to the actions of Eva Pillai and her fellow councilmembers. All that is needed is the formal assent from the Yaril to propel Eva to the highest seat in all of Chital, and save the nation from certain collapse."

CTL_decentralize_the_system:0 "Put on the Breaks"
CTL_decentralize_the_system_desc:0 "Chital has been divided upon economic lines for several hundred years with the native deer languishing behind as the north developed.

CTL_a_decentralized_apparatus:0 "Help for the Helpless"
CTL_a_decentralized_apparatus_desc:0 "There are deer amongst us who - through no fault of their own - are at risk of slipping into poverty. No deer should suffer for lack of opportunity or support in hard times, and it will cost us little to help shoulder their burden. A solid welfare state will benefit us all allowing every deer to contribute to the greater whole of Chital."

CTL_a_plan_for_modernization:0 "Full Speed Ahead"
CTL_a_plan_for_modernization_desc:0 "Over the last 100 years Hindia has become the backwater of Zebrica, technologically stagnate, economically decrepit and we have only ourselves to blame, but no more. It is time to end this idle running. We have the room, resources and drive to charge forward into the 11th century. The world awaits us, all we have to do is seize it."

CTL_what_the_south_needs:0 "Help for Those Who Help Themselves"
CTL_what_the_south_needs_desc:0 "Chital is full of bright, innovative and imaginative deer willing to take a risk to better themselves and their country.

With such minds and bravery amongst us, we shall achieve the impossible."

CTL_cement_a_united_council:0 "Meritocracy of the Nobility"
CTL_cement_a_united_council_desc:0 "The nobility is a valuable institution, but not in its present form; It has been hamstrung by tradition and slothful practices. These nobles were meant to help run the country; the best of the best drawn from throughout Chital to give their insights. It is time to shake up their ranks and reminded them of this. The best deer for the job, regardless of their title."

CTL_yaril_temporal_and_spiritual:0 "A Lord Temporal and Spiritual" 
CTL_yaril_temporal_and_spiritual_desc:0 "Benjen - our dear Yaril - is the face of Chital, the father of the nation. It is to him the nobles, scholars, industrialists, and common deer turn when the road ahead looks rocky. With a smile and a gentle hoof, he shall guide them onwards even as Eva lays the path to Chital's future before him."

CTL_popular_sovereignty:0 "The Yaril's Constitution"
CTL_popular_sovereignty_desc:0 "Benjen has expressed his wishes in no uncertain terms; there needs to be a power shift away from the monarchy and into the hooves of every deer. Under his plan, the council would be expanded to a chamber of elected representatives granting the common deer a say in their future."

CTL_eva_sovereignty:0 "Frouva Eva's Constitution"
CTL_eva_sovereignty_desc:0 "Eva has made her plans for the constitution clear; to push Chital to ever greater heights we need to be able to take decisive action when the moment requires. The council, made up of the smartest minds in the country, with Eva at fore will cut through the red tape and fine-tune the growing economy how and when it is needed."

CTL_chitali_cosmopolitanism:0 "An Empire of Trade and Trinkets"
CTL_chitali_cosmopolitanism_desc:0 "Hindia has a long history as a land of exotic goods and spices. When the Olenians came here originally it was to claim this wealth for themselves and seize our trade routes. With a little work, we can rouse this heritage and restore our market places, once more Chital shall become a centre of worldwide trade."

CTL_appeal_to_the_spectre:0 "Tie the Knot"
CTL_appeal_to_the_spectre_desc:0 "Benjen has eschewed a bride for too long, but with Eva now firmly in control of the Council of Seven and the Ostkranbi court, there is no better candidate for the young Yaril to wed and no better time to see it done. The Pride of the South shall wed the Heir to the Sea-Kings at once, and there will, at last, be a royal pair that represents not just the Northern elite, but the whole of deerkind."

CTL_sleekness_of_the_east:0 "Import the Wonders of Equestria"
CTL_sleekness_of_the_east_desc:0 "Equestria is far beyond us in every regard be it technology, industry or economy but with a little creative thinking we can catch up quickly.

CTL_sleekness_of_chital:0 "Export the Wonders of Chital"
CTL_sleekness_of_chital_desc:0 "When Chital produces goods we do so with care and precision by skilled craftsdeer who have practised their trade their whole life.

CTL_opening_up_chital:0 "Chital, Open for Business"
CTL_opening_up_chital_desc:0 "Tensions still exist between us and our neighbours. Sambar to the south and the Doelhi Confederation continue their aggressive rhetoric toward each other and us in turn which is driving away investors. To continue our climb we shall make it clear all are welcome in Chital. It doesn't matter where you're from, if you've got a dream and the bits you can make it here."

CTL_export_our_labor_force:0 "Labour for the World"
CTL_export_our_labor_force_desc:0 "Chital has no shortage of workers; we are a hard-working deer with a history of effort and quality in everything we make but the distractions of a developing modern world can often get on top of things. By setting up quiet, self-contained areas we can give our workers the chance to focus on their tasks without becoming distracted."

CTL_sugar_spice:0 "The Spice Must Flow"
CTL_sugar_spice_desc:0 "Wars have been fought over spices, lands traded between noble families and nations just to get that little bit closer to the source; Chital is the source. Though the need for spices has reduced with refrigeration, the demand has only risen and the amount of bits to be made is eyewatering. By expanding our farms, we can meet this rising demand and reap the rewards as money flows into our nation."

CTL_a_great_individualist_spirit:0 "A Culture of Consumption"
CTL_a_great_individualist_spirit_desc:0 "Chital's traditions and culture are beginning to slow down our development; living a simple, humble life is a noble idea but it doesn't make for a dynamic economy in the modern world. We need to overhaul how we view everyday habits. Mend and make do must be changed into make and make more."

CTL_the_charity_of_the_nobility:0 "A Proud and Noble Intelligentsia"
CTL_the_charity_of_the_nobility_desc:0 "The overhaul of the noble stratum has begun to bear fruit as the most skilled and educated nobles rise to the top of what was once a stagnant system. They are quickly becoming an inspiration throughout Chital and beyond as doctors, professors and leaders of industry take their rightful place in governance."

CTL_walking_on_tightrope:0 "Walking the Tightrope"
CTL_walking_on_tightrope_desc:0 "There is no denying that religion is a sensitive issue within Chital and must be treated delicately as there are groups with considerable influence aligned to the various religions, the Tuya being the most prominent. If we move against them it could spiral into civil unrest very quickly so perhaps a gentle hoof is best; perhaps Hira could advise, she's always been good at this sort of thing."

CTL_faith_in_chital:0 "Work with the Southerners"
CTL_faith_in_chital_desc:0 "The southern regions of Chital have always been neglected, being too far into the jungles with a native population resistant to the traditionally Olenian council, but times have changed, and new opportunities are opening up to us. As the Jungles open up, we'll get a better understanding of how many deer live in these isolated communities."

CTL_building_a_culture:0 "Building A Better Culture"
CTL_building_a_culture_desc:0 "The divides in Chital run deep. Olenian and Hindian deer lead separate lives with separate traditions, practices, and even different clothes. Trying to patch over these divides often serves to highlight our differences as we continue to push into the future. A new approach is needed, a cultural synchronous so we can move forward as one united deer."

CTL_purge_the_tuya:0 "Terrorize the Tuya"
CTL_purge_the_tuya_desc:0 "The Tuya must go. Monks armed with guns, wandering around the countryside spouting their faith and stirring up divisions will only end in disaster for us. Being decisive and harsh may create support for them in the short term but the benefits outweigh the risks. Send in Jakob."

CTL_the_great_evil:0 "The End of the Communist Charade"
CTL_the_great_evil_desc:0 "Dannya Shah's efforts may have come to nothing, but her influence has lingered on in the jungles and hills. Word needs to be sent to these guerrillas, they need to know they've won. Perhaps not the victory they pictured but we are building a modern, fairer society just as they wished. It is time for them to come home and help in the new effort as citizens, not soldiers."

CTL_faith_in_yaril:0 "Supremacy of the North"
CTL_faith_in_yaril_desc:0 "The north has everything we need for building up our heavy industry and half the work has already been done for us with easy access to the coastal shipping lanes and railroads.

CTL_favor_no_creed:0 "Protect Our Own Traditions"
CTL_favor_no_creed_desc:0 "Modern technology may make farming easier but we must not let that override our traditions.

CTL_the_ostkranbi_elite:0 "Cast Down Their Ivory Towers"
CTL_the_ostkranbi_elite_desc:0 "Olenian. There is no greater insult in the Hindian language than that. Corrupt invaders, twisted parodies of true deer, lost souls. We will cure this sickness in our society, beginning at the top."

CTL_a_return_to_tradition_desc:0 "Centuries ago, a legendary son of Her will, only called Bhushan, stood up against the great armies of the Viking devils, cutting down thousands. It was said Cnoof was so scared of him, that he went to his death in Stagpal before facing him in combat! Bhushan Gurat shall echo the great legend of Bhushan, and declare himself not Bhushan I, but Bhushan II, Son of Mahimata."

CTL_loyalty_to_people:0 "Loyalty to the Herd"
CTL_loyalty_to_people_desc:0 "The first loyalty of the deer is loyalty to the herd. Those Olenians who see the error of their existence can be saved through the Rite of Cleansing - the giving of a corrupted soul to Mahimata - and be reborn as pure souled Hindians.

CTL_loyalty_to_nation:0 "Loyalty to the Nation"
CTL_loyalty_to_nation_desc:0 "The blessed soil beneath our hoof provides all that we could ever wish, the food we grow, a place to build our homes and raise a family. The second of our great loyalties is to protect our land against all comers. It is sweet and proper to die for one's country."

CTL_loyalty_to_mahimata_desc:0 "The third of our great loyalties is the most important. She who is above all. The one true Goddess who guides our hooves in everything we do to greater strength and success. We will repay the love she has for each of us thousands of times over with our devotion."

CTL_end_the_race_mixing:0 "Crackdown On Miscegenation"
CTL_end_the_race_mixing_desc:0 "The Hindian deer must be kept pure if we are to truly follow the path Mahimata has laid out for us.

CTL_reward_sympathizer_loyalty_desc:0 "There are those who tried to make amends for the ancient crimes of their ancestors and help pave the way for our great revival.

CTL_shatter_the_jakobite_plot_desc:0 "That wretched old fool still has his antlers in the army.

CTL_spymistress_knows_best_desc:0 "Chital is not a small place, with terrain ranging from coastline to jungles and mountains to cities. To control the provinces, we need to up to date information.

CTL_full_control_to_tuya_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan is not to be trusted anymore, not with her continued opposition to the agenda of faith, reason, and justice becoming more apparent by the day.

CTL_a_sword_in_every_hand:0 "A Sword in Every Hoof"
CTL_a_sword_in_every_hand_desc:0 "The Tuya may have been a solely elite military force in the past, but necessity has forced our hoof. We must recruit as many of the willing faithful as we can, disregarding our traditionally harsh standards in these times of heathen posturing in Sambar and the South. A "kirpan" must reach the hooves of every would-be Saint-Soldier of Mahimata!"

CTL_great_anti_elitist_struggle:0 "A Great Anti-Elitist Struggle"
CTL_great_anti_elitist_struggle_desc:0 "There exists within the world a lie. That some deer are created better than others. This lie has been used to repress our herd for generations. We will follow the Raja's example of humility - despite his divine appointment - and free ourselves."

CTL_redistribute_the_land:0 "Land for the True Hindians!"
CTL_redistribute_the_land_desc:0 "Chital belongs to all Hindians. Hindians, not Olenians. All lands held by Olenians will be confiscated and returned to the native deer who owned them and a ban on Olenians buying property will stop the injustices of the past from occurring again."

CTL_end_northern_industrial_primacy:0 "Redistribute the Factories"
CTL_end_northern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "The jobs and work that should have long ago moved inland have remained in the hooves of the sea devils on the coast. The factories and manufactories will be moved where they belong if we have to drag them there."

CTL_anti_corruption_campaign:0 "Crush the Captains of Industry"
CTL_anti_corruption_campaign_desc:0 "Captain of industry is just another name for an overseer and monopoly holder. These deer have created a powerbase using the promise of their advice as leverage. Well, we don't need their advice and we don't need them."

CTL_crush_the_rmec:0 "No More Northern Bureaucrats"
CTL_crush_the_rmec_desc:0 "The Olenians are still trying to exert their influence over us through this class of middle administrators. We drove out the nobles and we'll drive out the pencil pushers. Admin is no refuge for the corruption of the past."

CTL_back_to_the_land_campaign:0 "Back To The Land"
CTL_back_to_the_land_campaign_desc:0 "The land is sacred, the soil which gives us all we could ever ask for and we give it the respect and honour it deserves in return. A dedicated agriculture class shall have the privilege of ensuring we uphold the values of the land."

CTL_eradicate_waste:0 "Eradicate Waste"
CTL_eradicate_waste_desc:0 "Hindia was not a frugal society; we just took no more than we needed. Then the invaders came and corrupted Hindia with consumerism. To save the moral soul of our nation and preserve our herd we need to return to our roots and use no more than we need."


 ### IDEAS ###
 CTL_native_resistance:0 "Olenian-Hindian Tensions"
 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."

Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinen. If we ever are to reform Chital, we must first deal with these pompous "champions of the people"."

Unfortunately, the fact that the inland is the home of many of the country's Hindian elements has increased unrest against the government and set back our development plans for the region. If we are to truly heal our relationship with the inland Hindians, we should first focus on developing their lands back to modern standards.

 ###ADVISORS###
 CTL_seer_advisor:0 "Dreia of Lavborg"
 CTL_seer_advisor_desc:0 "Dreia of Lavborg, often called the Laughing Priest for her bucking of many ritualistic trends in favor of an accomodating view of the Pantheon and the recruitment of new worshippers, has served as the de-facto second in command of the followers of Ukko in Chital for years. Although they have sparred on theological matters numerous times before, Dreia remains a loyal disciple of Konnar, the leader of the Pantheon's worshippers in Chital, and along with the native Caarlit Lawas, has helped bolster the outreach of the Olenian Gods throughout skeptic urban communities and zealous native ones."
 CTL_noble_advisor1:0 "Andreas Savannen"
 CTL_noble_advisor1_desc:0 "Andreas Savannen has served as a personal aide and advisor to chairdeer of the RMEC Benjen Davirtannen for as long as many Chitali can remember. Considered to be just as intelligent if not more so than his mentor, Savannen has paradoxically made a name for himself as a particularly skilled faceless bureaucrat with little prominent political and social leanings. Unlike Davirtannen, he has kept out of courtly politics, but personally, he holds significant sympathy for the causes of the disgraced Ivar Hoversholm and his mentor both, along with disdain for the scheming nobility of the Ostkranbi."
 CTL_noble_advisor2:0 "Tuomas the Quiet"
 CTL_noble_advisor2_desc:0 "Known for an almost-ritualistic silent nature, Tuomas the Quiet came to court with his good friend and fellow Fraskali noble, Elik Baronnen, but has now become a mind completely of his own. A ruthless enforcer with a habit for cruel and unusual punishment, Tuomas' strength does not lie in his haggard, shadowy appearance, which inspires fear into little, but instead his eerie demeanour and utter disregard for the international codes of harmony."
 CTL_noble_advisor3:0 "Caarlit Samara"
 CTL_noble_advisor3_desc:0 "A bumbling steward and personal confidante of Eva Pillai, Caarlit Samara lies out of place in the Chitali capital. His Oleno-Hindian demeanour, straight from Gondeerana, still carries a lingering effect on his personality that his largely dissipated from Eva's, and as a result, he knows little allies but his old comrade. A competent ally, Samara has served as Eva's eyes and ears in areas the powerful advisor is unlikely to tread."
 CTL_business_advisor1:0 "Ajit Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor1_desc:0 "Ajit Rashigas, a business and entrepreneurial mind from the West of Chital, serves as the civilian portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Ajit, weaker but more intelligent than his brother, has expressed sympathy and solidarity for Benjen V, Ivar Hoversholm, and Jakob the Grey, with disdain for the methods of the Axis and the percieved "elitism" of Eva Pillai and Davirtannen. A populist sympathizer, Rashigas remains a political wild-card, but would surely find himself at home in most any non-Axis administration."
 CTL_business_advisor2:0 "Gurunath Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor2_desc:0 "Gurunath Rashigas, a business and military mind from the West of Chital, serves as the military portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Gurunath, stouter and stronger than his brother, is an ally of Ivar Hoversholm within the court, but surprisingly, he has also been seen as a key potential ally of Jakob the Grey. Rashigas, having served as an aide to Hoversholm but collaborator to Jakob in military operations, is a political wild-card, but like his brother, remains independent."
 CTL_military_advisor1:0 "Jashiv Frawar"
 CTL_military_advisor1_desc:0 "Jashiv Frawar is yet another native ally of Jakob the Grey, a position many would believe to be an oxymoron. Frawar, a young "New Noble", has been appointed to numerous bureaucratic and military posts throughout his time in Ostkranbi as part of Benjen V's relentless reshuffling and reform efforts. Paranoid, and known for controversial statements in support of the far-right, Frawar would be an easy ally for Jakob the Grey among Benjen's inner circle, as part of a youth and native faction unlikely to normally support traditionalist politics."
 CTL_military_advisor2:0 "Grasya Kahnli"
 CTL_military_advisor2_desc:0 "Grasya Kahnli, the young commoner wife of industrialist and socialite Wasil Kahnli, has risen from a young, relatively modest courtier in Kahnli's own domain to become one of the most powerful does in Ostkranbi. An ally to Hira Ramachan, Eva Pillai, and her own husband, Grasya is known for her appetite for courtly intrigue and lavish parties and gatherings, which although gratifying to the former commoner, mostly serve as a honeypot for various nobles to spill their secrets to an Axis spy... or for said Axis spies to connect."

 CTL_da_chonker:0 "Elik Baronnen"
 CTL_da_chonker_desc:0 "The only thing more apparent than Elik Baronnen's bitter rivalry with fellow noble and industrialist Wasil Kahnli is his own size, a testament to the deer's wealthy, opulent lifestyle and the sheer power the aging populist commands. A critic of the government whenever it suits him and a loyalist to Benjen whenever it doesn't, Baronnen is a clear supporter of the North's economic dominance and seeks to maintain that without ever clearly establishing himself in opposition to the old Yaril. Within the nation, he is believed to align himself with moderate conservatives, and his distrust for Kahnli and radical politics is well known."
 CTL_da_twink:0 "Wasil Kahnli"
 CTL_da_twink_desc:0 "The young and impulsive Wasil Kahnli, despite his rather obscure heritage and position in the minor nobility, has risen to a key advisory position within the royal court of Ostkranbi ever since he gained the patronage of Eva Pillai. Kahnli, known for his friendly demeanour and flamboyant status, has found a political home within Pillai's faction of market reformers. Though generally an opponent of some of the Yaril's recent reforms, Kahnli holds little sympathy for fellow industrialist Elik Baronnen, once a key ally at court, or extremists of any sort within the Yarildom."
 CTL_hira_advisor:0 "Hira Ramachan"
 CTL_hira_advisor_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan, born a minor noble to the small Mayor of Haarihus, was plucked from relative obscurity to serve at the court of Benjen V as Chital's spymaster and premier intelligence authority. None can doubt her prowess and skill at finding secrets, even if sometimes they are ones the government would best have kept under wraps themselves... of course, if the government is similarly aligned with her pro-native, reformist interests, they will have nothing to fear."
 CTL_non_hira_advisor:0 "Anders Snier"
 CTL_non_hira_advisor_desc:0 "A bumbling bureaucrat, Anders Snier is not exactly one's first choice to take over the intelligence apparatus left by Hira Ramachan, but he is perhaps the only candidate willing and able, with much of Hira's once-strong connections across Chital no longer in the hooves of the government. Hopefully, such a bumbling bureaucrat with a taste for starry-eyed reformism can truly bring something to Chital's growing intelligence network."

Hailing from a mixed race background in the cosmopolitan hub of Gondeerana, the economic miracle Pillai established there as Frouva even under threat of revolution and reaction both left her a key candidate for Benjen V's new Council of Seven. Commanding an army of socialites, Eva is a cultural symbol in her own right - the merger of North and South. A friend to all who occupy the centre of Chitali politics and a charming trendsetter, Eva's proposition to the Yaril is simple - let reason win out, let economic development continue, let our disparate cultures unite, and let the beauty of Hindia spread across oceans as a new economic, cultural, and political superpower is born.§!"

A career bureaucrat, Davirtannen founded the Royal Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation, or RMEC, on the orders of Benjen IV, and the royal corporation has become the face of Chitali industrialisation ever since. Representing "old reformism", Davirtannen eschews Equestrianist progressivism and radical social restructuring for the purpose of classical welfare statism, and is perhaps the most left-leaning figure tolerated by the Olenian military and economic elite. He is certainly not the most influential reformist (that goes to Benjen V's favourite, Raili Ninessen), but he is the Kind Viking's last hope, and Davirtannen will make sure with all his strength that his dreams are made reality.§!"

Now, he must save Chital again, but this time from itself. Benjen V, in his efforts to unify the nation, has only driven it further apart, as Axis traitors and harmonic lackwits scheme to destroy the House of Kudlinen in its own court. Never a political deer, Jakob may have to forego the seas and fields on which he had done so much battle in order to pursue the most important battle of all - protecting his nephew from the vultures that surround him.§!"

Originally a supporter of the Yaril, a failed petition to become Chief Minister and subsequent political suicide led Hoversholm to convert classical constitutional monarchism into fanatic republicanism, and join the opposition Axis of Chital. Utopian at heart, Hoversholm envisions a future in which unconstrained by scheming courtiers and byzantine bureaucracies, a true democratic, unified nation-state can bloom... the Axis of Chital is simply a means to an end.§!"

Originally appointed spymistress as a safe, apolitical option, Hira has disguised her true intentions well, but the visage is beginning to fade. She is beginning to win. The Axis has won concession after concession, and through her connections to Southern paramilitaries, Hira can continue to wage proxy war after proxy war to win more. This coming season though, seems to be different for the young spymistress. The Yaril is waking up to her schemes and treason, but the Axis may just be strong enough to secure the hearts and minds of the Chitali people - the future of all Hindians depends on their success.§!"

An open opponent of House Kudlinen and commander of the Tuya, a radical sect of saint-soldiers devoted to the Hindian goddess Mahimata, Bhushan has no intention of participating in democratic norms, nor paying lip service to Benjen as his confidante Hira is so prone to do.

chital.1.d:0 "\"...Are you seriously going to deliver this drivel of an Evening Dew address to your cabinet about those fawnhood fantasies of yours? Have you learned nothing from our last heart-to-heart Benjen?\"\n\nThe elderly stag sighed and shook his head in disappointment at the Yaril, the weight of his wrinkles and battle scars only helping to accentuate his evident frown. It was only ironically fitting to have journeyed all the way to Ostkranbi from Gondeerana for the bi-monthly crown speech after having conducted a review of its garrison troops only to witness the Yaril, his very own nephew, once again gush about his ludicrous ideas of \"harmony of the masses\" and \"reform of the classes\" for Chital, he thought to himself.\n\n\"Drivel? Fawnhood fantasies!? Uncle Jakob, you must understand the gravity of the situation at hoof here,\" Benjen replied with a huff of annoyance, the dark bags under his eyes betraying his lack of sleep - and patience - after a night of writing and rehearsal, \"the Yarildom is in a dire state of affairs, and we can no longer present our backs to the Hindians and their needs. We must intervene and provide bread for the poor and a voice to the--\"\n\n\"And embolden those wannabe rebels in the inland with your bleeding-heart ideas?\" Jakob interrupted in his rough voice, \"Benjen, your father would have brought the axe to them to strike them down, and so would his father before him. That speech of yours will simply add logs to the fire if we are not to reaffirm our commitment to strength, tradition and national integrity.\"\n\nBenjen sighed, looking down at the paper he had spent all night painstakingly writing in his hoof. Jakob had always been rigid as a stone in his beliefs, and while the needs of his subjects could no longer be ignored, perhaps his uncle was right about Chital's past speaking for itself. He then lifted his head and said..."

He had a task ahead of him to which he had fixed his purpose and, for perhaps the first time in his life, he welcomed the responsibility for it gave him a chance to do something worthwhile.\n\nTaking his place at the head of the councillor's table he greeted each of them in turn. Eva and Davirtannen smiled warmly accepting his welcome. Jakob nodded in encouragement, a hint of pride in his gaze. Hira returned his greeting with the watchful thoughtfulness she was known for. Ivar looked eager to rise and give a greeting of his own but the deer was smart enough to know that right belonged to Benjen. Bhushan accepted the greeting with a nod, ever the warrior monk ready for a fight. Taking a breath to steady himself Benjen, Vth of his name, began.\n\n"Councillors, it is good to see you all again. I have been giving the current state of Chital a great deal of thought since our last meeting and I am now ready to share with you all my new grand design, the unification of Chital. For too long we allowed ourselves to bend to the whims of traitors, terrorists and instigators who seek to divide us. We have been kind, we have been fair, we have tried to help them and they have spat in our face." Bhushan grunted disapprovingly. "That is all going to change. It is time we end the threat at our doors once and for all. We will make every loyal deer feel safe in their homes, protected and guarded against those who would destroy our traditions. A massive effort is needed with the deployment of troops and the agents of the state. I will need each voice at this table to help me in this but we must be of one mind. You all have your unique talents which can be brought to bear in this united effort. If we are to protect our deer, our livelihoods and our country we must crush these dissidents with such force that no others will ever raise their voice against us again."\n\nFinishing with a grave scowl, Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen looked horrified while Eva seemed deeply conflicted. Hira appeared relaxed but disapproving, her eyes watching the others closely. Ivar appeared to be trying to figure out what to make of it. Worst of all Bhushan looked ready for a fight, veins in his neck bulging as he glared daggers at Benjen. The only one round the table who appeared to approve was Jakob, who sat up just that bit straighter than before, a rare look of pride filling his face."

A reform of the classes, a reform of the economy. I will need each voice around this table to help me in this, for your opinions and views on this matter are unique. You each see the problems differently and if we're to hear the voices of our deer we must first hear the voices of each other. So let us listen, let us try to understand and start making Chital a better place for all."\n\nFinishing with a smile Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen looked proud while Eva certainly seemed to approve of the message. Hira appeared relaxed and happy. Ivar stomped his hoof in agreement. Even Bhushan looked interested, one eyebrow raised quizzically as he returned Benjen's gaze. The only one around the table who appeared downcast was Jakob who looked even more annoyed than before.

chital.4.t:0 "A Council For Four"
chital.4.d:0 ""They cannot be trusted!" Jakob slammed his hoof down on the table. "Why they're even on the council I cannot understand. Forming into their little three deer team, calling themselves the Axis, they're conniving, scheming and paranoid."\n\n"Of course they're paranoid, we're plotting against them! We meet without them to take decisions that affect them, their provinces, and their deer. Are you so thick-headed you can't see why they're annoyed, why they feel the need to band together just like we have?" Eva returned a salvo of her own from the other end of the table.\n\n"Perhaps if they showed a bit more gratitude for their positions they'd be included more. Their loyalty and duty should be to Chital! They should be honoured to be allowed to speak, not grumbling about their complaints being ignored. Look at Davirtannen, he wouldn't go about sneaking and plotting, would he?"\n\n"Don't drag me into this," the industrialist responded from his chair - his attempts to remain out of the argument hadn't worked.\n\n"Enough!" Benjen shouted. "Enough of this, both of you! I will not listen to any more of your bickering. Go, you both need to cool off." Eva and Jakob sat motionless, staring death at each other. "Go! Now!"\n\nThe force of his demand shook both of them from their feud. Pausing only to bow to Benjen on their way out, the two stormed from the room, slamming doors as they went.\n\n"Well, that was heated," Benjen sighed, head in hooves. "Thanks to all of that I've forgotten what we were discussing. What was this meeting even meant to be about?"\n\n"The reforms, Yaril," Davirtannen offered.\n\n"Ah yes, your proposed reforms." Benjen visibly brightened. "Well, I'm sure we can handle those on our own. We agree on most of the points anyway, correct?"\n\n"Indeed we do, Yaril. Shall we begin?""
chital.4.a:0 "An excellent agenda."

chital.5.t:0 "News From The South"
chital.5.d:0 "Eva poured over the reports, her concern growing with every new page, paragraph, and sentence. What started as a minor incident in a corner of the Yarildom was growing into the very real threat of a communist rising across several provinces. A figurehead had started to appear, a single deer named Dannya Shah. She'd managed to turn a hoofful of discontent farmers into the beginnings of a militia that was at risk of doing considerable damage.\n\nReports of blown train lines and kidnapping had arrived in the capital. The fragile economy of the south was already at risk and so her advice had been requested. But despite her expertise, she simply couldn't understand it. They hadn't issued any demands, made any statements about their intent other than to call themselves communists, and generally acted more like a gang than a political army. They'd arrive in a region, Dannya would give a few speeches, rally some support, then they'd sabotage something and move on. Round and round the provinces they went; Mahorna, Haarihus and Gondeerana had suffered but worse still were the implications of this tactic.\n\nKeeping up momentum like that required more than just charisma and drive, it required money. Some outside agency was fermenting this unrest, providing them with funding and equipment, she was sure of it. With the current supply shortages in the army, every gun and bullet was tracked and accounted for, meaning the weapons had to be coming from somewhere else. The Doelhi Confederation was a possible source, considering they'd welcome a chance to destabilise the Yarildom. Or perhaps it was Sambar; their border disputes went back a long way. There had to be someone who knew something about this. Perhaps, Caarlit Samara, her steward and confidante could help, with his ear on the ground. Hira was also sure to have some information about what was going on, and with her help, they could get to the bottom of the issue. It would also be a nice gesture to reach out to council members for support.\n\nEither way this needed to get fixed and fast."
chital.5.a:0 "This is certainly worse than we thought."

chital.6.t:0 "Reaching The South"
chital.6.d:0 "The brief was simple, get supplies and troops to Mahorna to help deal with the unrest in the area, but even this had gotten political. Benjen and Jakob had been discussing it for close to an hour as they walked around the grounds of the white tower; the quickest route would take the convoy through Ditar, Bhushan's territory, Axis lands. Jakob took against this plan, arguing that the convoys should be routed through Gondeerana, Eva's lands, instead.\n\n"It will add days to their travel time." Benjen reiterated "There are deer suffering now, we need to help them. How many lives will we lose because of that delay? I cannot have that on my consciousness, it's heartless."\n"Benjen, it is better to be heartless than mindless. The history of the world is the story of the triumph of the heartless over the mindless. By routing through Gondeerana we guarantee the security of our forces. We cannot account for ambushes in Ditar and knowing Bhushan he'd place his lunatic sister, Marsha, in charge of the security and if the convoy is compromised it cannot help anyone. How many lives would be lost then?" The discussion swung back and forwards around this point but there was no hostility in the debate, both deer took it as a chance to educate the other. Benjen sought to demonstrate the value of trust to Jakob while, in return, Jakob took the opportunity to educate Benjen on military strategy.\n\n"Bhushan's local forces can protect the trunks as they travel, he's a fighter and will know what is required. By trusting his skills, we can engage with the militias all sooner and reassure him of our faith in him."\n"Combat is not a matter of faith, you do not have faith that your enemy is weaker than you, you gain information, prepare, practice and train, you have to rely upon your own strengths. I have no doubts about Bhushan's abilities, but these are our troops, we should be the ones protecting them as they protect the civilians. It's about morale as much as transport."\n"Hmm, this is harder than I thought it would be." Benjen pondered, scratching his chin. He took a deep breath of the evening air to clear his thoughts.\n"That's why I'm here to help. From such small decisions are wars lost and won but know, whichever you go with I will support." Jakob patted his shoulder reassuringly."
chital.6.a:0 "The Axis's supply lines will protect us."
chital.6.b:0 "Reroute supplies through Pillai lands."

chital.7.t:0 "Her Final Fortress"
chital.7.d:0 "Jakob pushed his way into the command tent, the sounds of distant gunfire in the jungle dwindling as the last of the fighting ceased. Within the tent officers congratulated each other on a job well done, Dannya shah captured, her stronghold broken, her forces scattered. This was a great day for the Chital, but the work was only just beginning. On the far side of the tent, the remainder of the council of 4 awaited his return. As he crossed to them, setting his rifle down on the table, Benjen addressed him.\n\n"General Huddarnen has informed us of Shah's capture but there's a problem, most of her forces have fled into the jungle. If they get away there's a chance they'll reform and come back in strength, if we want to go after them, we'll have to do it now before they can escape."\n"We should-"\n"Go after them now." Davirtannen cut Jakob off. "If we capture them, it will stabilise the region and we can turn a new page on this sorry saga. Let the criminals serve their time and we'll move on with better things." Jakob surprised at Davirtannen's boldness and his plan to pursue the rebels, composed himself.\n"I agree that we need to go after them but to make examples of them. There are other strongholds out there to clear up and no one will believe they've genuinely reformed. An enemy beaten is still an enemy, we need to eliminate them."\n"You think making martyrs of these deer is going to help us?" Eva interjected, a fierce glint in her eye aimed at Jakob. "Let them go, our priority is the locals, those injured in the fighting, those who've suffered under the attacks. If we show them kindness, they'll know the rebels were fighting for a false cause and most of them will slink back to their villages and not trouble us again." General Huddarnen, an old ally of Jakob's, approached the table once more.\n\n"Yaril, I need an order. It's now or never.""

chital.8.t:0 "Looking A Little Deeper"
chital.8.d:0 "Sitting at his desk, deep within the citadel of the White Tower, Benjen lit a candle. Its warm light soothed the stress he felt as he held the letter in his hooves. It bore the cherry red wax seal of Dannya Shah, a letter just barely intercepted by his loyal servants before it could reach its intended destination. He could only hope it would contain something that would help bring peace to the realm. Opening the document, he began to read...\n\n"To the Shadow of Chital,"\n\n"You are close to letting your ego get the better of you. I caution you to not probe me for any further action, lest you put our efforts at risk."\n\n"Though I am thankful for the shipment of weapons, the Yaril came too close to finding them. We'll control the south soon enough and remove the 'Kind Viking'. But when that day is passed, we will need to work out the finer points of this partnership; otherwise, the revolution will not stop with the dynasty of Benjen."\n\n"Best Wishes, Dannya Shah."\n\nBenjen blinked a few times and read through the letter again. Who in their right mind would write something like this? At its core, it was a letter to an ally, but why the veiled threats? And this "Shadow of Chital" talk made Benjen nervous. Though at the same time, he could not help but chuckle at what he read; it truly was a unique specimen.\n\nBut the real question was, who was this to? Who was providing weapons to the rebels? Wait... the Shadow of Chital...\n\n"Could it be Hira?" Benjen wondered to himself. Turning to the bed in his study beside him, he spoke to the doe sleeping beneath its sheets. "Ruusu, my dear, could you fetch me a member of the royal police?"\n\nThe only response from the bed was dreaming groans. "It seems I will need to do this myself," Benjen thought. "But is it worth the risk?""
chital.8.a:0 "An investigation would be superfluous, the Axis has no connection."
chital.8.b:0 "I must take action."

chital.9.t:0 "The State of the Seven"
chital.9.d:0 "Benjen V relaxed into the chair on the balcony overlooking the sea, his shoulders sagging under the weariness of the day; arguments amongst the council had turned what was meant to be a half-hour meeting into a two-hour one. The smallest details and word choices caused flare-ups, it didn't matter that they were all saying the same thing in different ways to them. It was like they wanted a fight, going into the meeting expecting conflict, just like yesterday and the day before. A nonstop loop of infighting, stuck on repeat over and over again.\n\nHe needed to find something to unite them, to put them on the same page, but that was another problem half the time. They knew what needed to be done and agreed upon the goals, but the path to those goals was where the issues always spawned, the devil in the details. He'd never seen deer argue so much while all agreeing with each other. Sometimes, he wished he could just leave his royal duties behind and ride the waves instead.\n\n"Gods, I hate politics," he groaned.\n\n"How are you holding up?" Ruusu asked, setting a glass of water on the table next to him. He took a deep breath of the evening air and steadied himself.\n\n"I'll manage. We finally finalised the agreement of equal education rights so that's something at least, even if it did take all afternoon."\n\nHis beloved Ruusu looked at Benjen with concern. "You've been working too hard recently. How about we go away for the weekend, just the two of us? No late-night meetings, no reviewing documents or issuing statements. A little relaxing getaway will do you a world of good."\n\nThe Yaril brightened just imagining such a trip, desperately wishing he could take her up on the offer. "Where would I be without you?" he sighed while laying his head on her shoulder.\n\n"Probably in another council meeting," she chuckled. "So, tell me, how was the council this time?""
chital.9.a:0 "Unstable, but beneficial."

chital.10.t:0 "A Meeting With The Godi"
chital.10.d:0 ""Tell me Yaril, when was the last time you listened to the gods?"\n\nThe old Godi walked at Benjen's side; the air was blessedly crisp and warm this evening, the sun setting behind the white tower as they strolled through the grounds. "Prayer is not my thing, Konnar," Benjen replied in a placating tone.\n\nKonnar chuckled, his crown of raven feathers rustling against his antlers. "Nor is it mine, but that's not what I asked. Those who rule above us will do what they will, prayer or no prayer. But when was the last time you listened, sat and heard what they had to say?"\n\n"I... I don't follow." Benjen stopped, confusion written across his face. He turned his full attention to Konnar.\n\n"Well, think of it like this. Everydeer wants something, even the gods, but sifting through their nonsense and hyperbole to hear what they're saying, that's the trick."\n\nBenjen laughed. "You're making them sound like politicians."\n\n"Now you're hearing my truth." He smiled. Glancing over the Yaril's shoulder he saw Katarina, Ivar's sister, cross the gardens toward the tower. She smiled and waved at them as she went; Konnar returned the gesture. "Do you listen to the truth the 'gods' are saying? Do you grasp what they want?"\n\nBenjen watched Katarina as she went. "I think so, I just... can't decide who to listen to."\n\n"I'm not here to tell you what's important, I'm not a missionary. I want you to ask yourself what is most important to you. I cannot make these decisions for you, but the wisdom of the Godi is yours should you wish it; all I ask is that you hear what we have to say.""

Benjen gathered his papers, satisfied after another meeting; things seemed to be getting easier these days. It seemed that he'd gotten his hooves on managing each session now.\n\n"Benjen, may I have a word?" Bhushan stood at the Yaril's shoulder, his expression the standard indifference that gave little indication of anything.\n\n"Certainly," Benjen responded, "though can it be quick? I have dinner arrangements." The Yaril placed his papers in his saddlebag.\n\n"The Tuymaiyānatu." Benjen signed and bowed his head. Bhushan was being straight to the point as usual. "Legitimise them." It was a statement, not a request.\n\n"Bhushan, you know we ca-"\n\n"It is to your benefit. They would supplement the army and help to keep the peace in the provinces."\n\n"It would not help public stability to give a bunch of armed monks military authority. This is a conflict of interests; you're the head of that order, are you not?"\n\nBhushan did not seem dissuaded by the Yaril's continued protests. "That matters little. They would be placed under the instruction of the council. You cannot deny their usefulness."\n\n"I'm not denying anything," Benjen pressed. "I'm merely saying that legitimising the Tuya would cause disruption we cannot afford."\n\n"Yaril, I believe you are mistaken. It will cease disruption in the long term by increasing our reach and placating a group which would otherwise feel excluded and victimised. Even you must see the benefits to keeping the peace.""

You - Nearly broke an antler," he seethed. "Why do I have to sit here and listen to this piddling nonsense? There must be somedeer else that can do this."\n\n"I'm sorry Yaril, but most of the government is paperwork, as you well know."\n\n"Wait, didn't Hira say yesterday we should be expanding support for the council? I remember it being on the agenda."\n\n"Yes, item eight if I correctly remember, Yaril. The proposal to hire an advisor to support council business and alleviate the administrative burden."\n\n"Yeah, to do the boring jobs. Let's do that instead of this."\n\n"Very well, Yaril." The advisor reached for a briefcase he had with him and pulled out four different folders, each with the picture of a deer attached. "There are 4 candidates. The first is Katarina Hoversholm, Ivar's sister. A bit hasty in her idealism, but ideologically she is much closer to and works better with Davirtannen."\n\n"Next is Ieffri Huddarnen, a general and old friend of Jakob's. He would certainly know what is expected of him even if he is a bit more... nationalistic than one would expect of an advisor."\n\n"Then there's Caarlit Samara, recommended by Eva. He's got a more grounded view on these matters if a bit inexperienced in serving as a government figure."\n\nFinally there's Marsha Gurat, Bhushan's sister. As the suggestion to support the council originally came from Hira, she also proposed and supports this candidate.

If I gave you the job of managing industrial output say, what's to stop you settling old scores against Davirtannen's factories, or him getting paranoid and subverting you, it goes both ways you see."\n\n"So you're saying you cannot trust me because no one else trusts me?" She raised an eyebrow at that. Benjen had decided to invite Hira to a private brunch, just the two of them in his quarters. He had hoped that a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, a couple of friends breaking bread together, would produce a good discussion and help to bridge the gap in the council. He'd forgotten that Hira never relaxed, always on guard, always inspecting her surroundings, eyeing the doors and windows cautiously as she spread marmalade on her toast, the spymistress through and through.\n\n"No that's not what I mean. I do trust you as you know, I'm trying to think of how we can build relations with Davirtannen, Eva and Jakob. If you could trust each other we could get so much positive work done you see."\n\n"Benjen, I don't think you quite understand where I'm coming from. Myself, Bhushan and Ivar have been repeatedly excluded from discussions that affect us, our provinces, our deer and with which we can help. Our voices carry less weight in the meetings we do attend, our advice is overlooked, and our activities are relegated to unimportant matters. Look at the work we do; Jakob controls the army, Davirtannen oversees industry and Eva plans the economy and manages the budget. I'm in charge of information in a country with poor communications infrastructure, Bhushan oversees religion in a country with religious freedom and Ivar is just, kind of, there. You see how that doesn't compare, correct?"\n\n"Yes, I can see why you might feel a bit... bitter about things when you put it like that."\n\n"Bitter? I'm not bitter Benjen. Bhushan is bitter, Ivar is hopeful, and I'm just tired. Why should I be the first to make some offering of peace to the others, I have done nothing save what was asked of me, I did it well and I am still expected to kowtow. If you want an offering of peace ask Jakob. Those with little should not have to beg from those with lots, it's not right, as well you know. I give you my word I will only act with Chital's best interests in mind but if you want to bridge the gap in the council the work has to begin from the other side." She sipped her tea calmly."

chital.14.d:0 ""Tell me, Andreas, how was your first day advising the council?" Benjen passed the minotaur a glass of whiskey before settling himself into his chair. After a long and rather dull meeting which had mostly been used by the various other council members to try and sweet talk Andreas, he just wanted a moment's peace.\n\nWhen the motion to add a dedicated advisor to support one of the council members had been proposed, they'd all thought Benjen was mad to offer the position to Andreas. The minotaur was a general, not a politician, but that was exactly why he'd been picked. He had no prior allegiances to any of the little cliques and factions within the council, being overlooked and thought of as unimportant, making him impartial. To top that off a lifetime in the army had taught the old bull the ins and outs of administration as well as navigating the political currents. The army was not immune to cliques themselves, after all.\n\n"It's just a battle of a different sort, isn't it?" the minotaur responded. "Even before my appointment was made general knowledge, I'd received dinner invites from Ivar, tickets to a gala with Eva, drinks in the officer's mess with Jakob and a promise of some weapons factory tours with Davirtannen; they're all playing their own games, trying to pull me to their sides. It's been getting so bad recently I was considering calling in a few artillery strikes just to make a point. The only one who hasn't been trying to get favour is you, Benjen, which is interesting in and of itself. Are you waiting for your moment to strike? A glass of whiskey in a comfortable office, maybe?"\n\nHe gestured to the room around them as he sipped his drink. "Let's be frank, Benjen. What's your angle, what do you get out of this?"\n\n"Balance, Andreas. I get balance, on the council and in all the backroom deals. All I ask is that you help me in this, tip the scales a bit."\n\n"And who would you have me support?" He held out his glass for a refill. Benjen smiled and lifted the whiskey.\n\n"Well, I was thinking...""

The strong muscles of his barrel flexing in their detail, his antlers high and noble borne upon those broad shoulders. That strong jaw, that firm brow, the very figure of regal power.\n\nAt least, that was what the portrait portrayed; the reality was somewhat different. His neck hurt from posing, his back ached from standing all morning, the cloak was heavy and hot, and he just wanted to sit down and have a cup of tea. The whole thing was a farce, but he could hear Jakob's words echoing in his ears. "A royal procession will require a royal portrait."\n\n"Finished?" Jakob asked as he entered the room.\n\n"Just about." The artist painted one last stroke with a flourish. "There we are. Yaril, tell me what you think." Benjen sagged, a sigh of relief slipping out as he stepped off the dais, letting his cloak fall to the floor. His back creaked like a rusty cement mixer as he came to stand next to Jakob and view the portrait. The old soldier looked very pleased, Benjen not so much.\n\n"It doesn't look a thing like me."\n\nJakob scoffed. "That's the point. It's not about what you look like, it's about what you can become, the making of a new deer. An image to be passed around and inspire all of Chital for the future as it proceeds the Process."\n\n"I'll look a fool from here to Colthage. Benjen the Fake, Benjen the Fraud, the Painted King." Benjen stared at Jakob in shock, the colour fading from his face.\n\nHis uncle seemed to brush off his concerns with a wave of a hoof. "That's the wrong attitude to take. See this as your potential, your future. Set your mind to it and you can become the figure of strength you see here." Jakob slapped him on the shoulder."

"It's 3 am, couldn't this wait till morning?" he asked, annoyance clear in his voice.\n\n"No, I'm afraid it can't, Yaril." Davirtannen quickly glanced around the corridor to make sure they were alone. The hotel had been vetted before they'd arrived, but one could never be sure who was listening. "You need to see this."\n\nHe produced a file from his saddlebag and passed it to Benjen. "Dannya Shah, the communist guerrillas, they were all being financed and supplied by Hira."\n\nBenjen snapped awake. "You... you can't be serious." Now wide awake, he grabbed hold of the file and, pausing only briefly to close the bedroom door and avoid waking Ruusu, started frantically flicking through the documents and pictures contained within. Examples of guns registered as destroyed being found in insurgent arms dumps, transfers of funds routed through shadow accounts that traced back to Hira... it was all there before him. "I... you... but... this is insane, Hira is the Shadow of Chital?!. Why would she do this? Why would she try to topple the government, the nation?! She can't be so mad as to burn down the whole thing."\n\n"And rise from the ashes to take the top spot no doubt; I don't know what game she's playing, but we've caught the light glinting off her scales as she slithers."\n\nBenjen's expression quickly turned from shock to steadfast determination. "We've got to do something about this, we can't allow this to go unanswered. Get Eva on the phone and tell her to pull all funding from Hira's department, then get Jakob to cut her military clearance, and make sure all the factory owners know what she's been up to and not to supply her with anything that hasn't first been approved by you and me. We're going to cut the head off this snake here and now."\n\n"Right away, Yaril." Davirtannen quickly walked back down the corridor."

chital.17.d:0 "As the train moved along towards the great southern city of Gondeerana, the cabin was alive with sounds and activity. After leaving Ostkranbi, the Royal Progress, including the Yaril and much of the council, had stopped at various stations along the route to the Southern City, picking up passengers on the way. Meeting them in Dehler was Eva and a crowd of Oleno-Hindian officials and notables excited to meet and speak with the Yaril.\n\n"So as you can see, my Yaril, by increasing cooperation between Ostkranbi merchant organizations and southern spice farm owners, we are sure we can increase the economic output of the south by margins unheard of in recent years!" Benjen nodded along silently to one of the Oleno-Hindian representatives, genuinely interested in the nitty-gritty of economic reform and administration. Beside him was Davirtannen, also nodding along. Turning his eye to the seat across the car, he saw Jakob, asleep and drooling, entirely bored by all that was happening. Shaking his head, Davirtannen looked around the rest of the cabin.\n\nNot much else was happening, the delegates wining and dining with members of the Yaril's court. No one knew what was going on. This tour was more important than any of them, and they sat drinking and eating.\n\nBenjen stood up, startling Davirtannen, who he assumed must have zoned off at some point. "Well, thank you, sir. I'm delighted we could meet, and I love your ideas and plans." Benjen glanced down at Davirtannen, meeting his gaze for a second before turning back to the delegate, he continued, "I hope we can meet in Ostkranbi soon, and we can put those plans into action. Come, let's go get something to eat."\n\nAcross the country in a quiet office Hira lifted a telephone and after a few moments was greeted by Bhushan's voice on the other end.\n\n"What is it, Madame?"\n\n"It's time.""

chital.18.t:0 "Meeting The Southern Lords"
chital.18.d:0 "Bowing his head, Benjen remained as still as he could. Eva had advised him that if the flowers got caught in his antlers, it would be taken as a grave insult. Fortunately, however, they passed over his antlers and landed gently around his neck without incident.\n\nHe smiled and raised his head to the nobledoe who bowed in return and stepped away from him. Eva gave him a warm smile; everything was going smoothly. The gardens were immaculately presented, with tables spread and food and drinks dotted between the flower beds. Deer were dressed in their noble finery and the mood was better than he feared it would be. The minor lords and ladies of Gondeerana had come out in force.\n\nThe southern lords were mostly Hindian and none too fond of Benjen, but Eva had assured him over and over that as long as he gave no insult and respected them, the local nobility would do likewise. They did not hate him, just mistrusted him. There was scope to build a better relationship and that was the first step in developing the region which had historically been ignored and neglected.\n\n"Well done, Yaril. You were quite dignified and graceful if I may say so." Eva said, coming to stand on his left side.\n\n"Yes, it's nice to see things going smoothly."\n\n"Why wouldn't it? These deer aren't your enemies, they've just been forgotten about until now. It tends to make one a bit prickly, but just remember what I taught you and you'll be fine. Poise and grace in all things, Yaril. We'll have lunch, then the fire dancing followed by a meeting with some teachers and students. It should make for a busy afternoon."\n\n"Indeed. Strangely, I'm looking forward to it." He took a deep relaxed breath of the evening air, savouring the scent of the flowers in the gardens. "I quite like it here. To be honest, I don't know why I don't spend more time in this part of the country."\n\n"Well, I'm certain a special somedeer could show you around sometime." She winked at him. "Lady Indeera, might I have a word?" Eva left his side with a slight smirk, off to mingle.\n\nSurely, it couldn't be this easy."

chital.19.t:0 "The Macawian Sharpshooter"
chital.19.d:0 "It was almost too easy. The route had been published in the paper, and everydeer from Ostkranbi to Gondeerana knew where the Yaril was going to be. Publicized as a public event, a celebration, anyone in Chital was welcome to attend. There were no worries of any kind, at least among Benjen's entourage.\n\nThe Yaril had met the workers of a local factory earlier this morning before heading into the city proper to meet the mayor. His car had taken the main road south before turning onto Doenka avenue; crowds were lining the route all excited to see Benjen on his way through. Jakob personally accompanied him, and both the Royal Guard and the city police were nearby just in case. It was a nice day, the sun shining and Benjen was able to enjoy himself and his country. Jakob still looked as grumbly as ever as he sat next to the Yaril in the car, but Benjen could tell the old soldier was enjoying the weather, and perhaps even just a bit of the crowd's appreciation.\n\nOn a rooftop overlooking the route a harpy sat eating a sandwich. To his left was a small radio tuned to a dead frequency, on his right a Karabiner 'Kralle' 06, the finest mid-ranged rifle on the market. A simple weapon for a simple job. As he finished his lunch the motorcade made its way slowly down the avenue towards his vantage point; he had his instructions, half the bits for the work and as usual, an indifferent nature to the situation. With a sigh, he lifted the rifle and placed it upon the ledge of the roof, humming to himself as he gave the scope a small twist, adjusting the range and compensating for the angle.\n\nA pity. This one would be all too easy, with no challenge in it at all. He looked down the scope and saw the car approaching, a clear shot. The Yaril was oblivious to his presence, too busy waving a hoof at the scores of deer that gave their adoration, too busy to notice anything else.\n\n"Here's to Benjen V, last of his name. Your death will free you from the burdens of government you've always hated," the Macawian mumbled. His claw tightened on the trigger."

chital.20.d:0 "The door to the office burst open as the deer charged into the room.\n"Elik. I've just heard the news, what are we going to do?!"\n"Jargien, how dare you barge into my office!" Elik set his half-eaten lunch on the desk before him. "What are you talking about, what's hap-"\n"Benjen's dead! He's been assassinated." Silence flooded the office as those words hung in the air. Elik, shocked by the revelation shook himself into action.\n"We've... we've got to act and fast. Do we know who did it?"\n"No, but I can guess." Jargien replied, fearing that he was right.\n\n"Axis, ok, let me think. Worst case scenario Bhushan takes power and we're all dead. If Hira takes power we're bankrupt, possibly dead. That just leaves Ivar, now If he takes over we've still got some leeway to work with, he's an egotist but he's not a psychopath and he's not smart enough to be a schemer. Ok, Jargien, we've got to do everything in our power to support Ivar, get on the phone and start spreading the word to shut the factories against all comers. Get the watchmen and the workers told, they need to know whose side we're on. If we work fast we can lock down the city before any of the Axis get here."\n\n"What about Jakob and Eva and Davirtannen? Surely, they can do something to stop this?"\n"If they were going to stop it they would have before Benjen was killed, they may already be dead for all we know. The Axis would not have done this unless they were prepared, no we can only assume they are now on their way here. We must do everything in our power to prevent the loss of life.\n"But what if it's Bhushan or Hira, we can't stop them taking the city can we." The increasingly panicked Jargien replied.\n\n"Don't you get it" Elik shouted. "They've already won..."

Benjen had been dead for less than 4 hours and the capital was collapsing in on itself, soldiers and police alike had abandoned their post when word had reached the city. If they couldn't protect their own Yaril what hope had they of protecting themselves? That was before word arrived that Bhushan and Hira's enforcers were on their way.\n\nThe panic had started then, the desperate fear of the unknown driving deer to act; several prominent members of the city council tried to organise a march in solidarity but it quickly got out of hoof and turned to violence. All the while Hira's agents moved among them stoking the fires and disappearing prepicked problematic politicians. And then the Tuymaiyānatu arrived.\n\nBhushan's warrior monks beat back all opposition in their path, the civilian deer were no match for them as they were left beaten and broken in the Tuya's wake. It would take some time but within the next few weeks all of Chital would be under their control and, as Bhushan, Hira and Ivar climbed the stairs to the white tower, the future lay firmly within their grasp."

chital.22.t:0 "A Safe Return Home"
chital.22.d:0 "The royal train pulled into Ostkranbi station to the cheers of crowds gathered around the tracks and platform, hissing to a stop with a great gout of steam. News of the Royal Progress had been mostly positive while he was away, but this was not what Benjen had expected to return to. A few interested bystanders, sure. An odd bored official, certainly. But this? This was something else entirely.\n\nJakob and Eva both remained inside the train car, the former under the guise of organizing the Yaril's protection and the latter for her own reasons. They both knew whose moment it was, especially after the attack. The heavy bandages across Benjen's shoulder were a stark reminder of that.\n\nTaking a breath to steady himself and make sure the top button of his uniform was fastened, Benjen left the window and made his way down the carriage. As he stepped out into the light the crowd erupted into cheers, all welcoming him home as a hero of Chital. He flinched just a little as the noise hit him before smiling and waving, doing his best to look comfortable and only failing somewhat.\n\n"My fellow deer," he called, trying to be heard over the crowd. "My fellow deer!" Gradually a quiet fell as they became silent to allow him to address them. "It warms my heart to no end to return to such a welcome. You have heard, no doubt, of my travels throughout the length and breadth of our country, as well as the tragedy that occurred recently. I have seen a great many wonders and, sadly, a great many injustices. I have heard and heeded the advice of lords, doctors, teachers, and construction workers. I have stood in the shadows of our monuments to the past and seen the light of the future to come. And above all, I have stood tall, even as attacks on my life sought to bring Chital to its knees."\n\nThe Yaril motioned for Davirtannen to come and stand by his side. The advisor blinked before he cautiously stepped down from the carriage into the small space cleared by the guards. He smiled as he looked around, regarding the crowd as though they were friends come to welcome them all home, before approaching Benjen. "You, all of you have made this possible," the Yaril continued to the crowd, "and it is for all of you that I shall use what I have learned to build a new Chital, a better Chital, a stronger Chital. With my close advisor and good friend, Benjen Davirtannen, we shall give all we have to reform Chital for a new, modern age of Harmony, together!""

chital.23.t:0 "The Fate Of The Axis"
chital.23.d_baronnen_end:0 "The transition of power is seldom a smooth process but with Benjen's death, things had to be done and done swiftly. With the Yaril gone any hope of Eva, Davirtannen or even Jakob keeping their grasp on power had gone up in smoke, it was clear they no longer had the influence to stay in government for much longer and that left only the three members of the axis to make their claim for the head of the council.\n\nFearing the influence of the more radical members of the axis, the industrialists up and down the country came together in secret to support Ivar Hoversholm, knowing him to be moderate with an understanding of the economy and reasonably easy to work with. They had promised to support Madame Hira but decided that since the Yaril has just disappeared mysteriously and the spy mistress was about to take power maybe it would be a better idea to look elsewhere.\n\nThe court officials favoured Hira as their choice, whether this was willingly the case, or she had some dirt on them couldn't be said for certain. She had influence in every corner of the White tower and nothing left its halls without her knowing about it. Surely such a master of detail could steer the nation on the right course. This left Bhushan without much of a base, always having preferred the strength of his faith and soldiers to politics and everydeer breathed a sigh of relief at that fact.\n\nNow it they just had to decide who had the firmest grip on power, Ivar or Hira."
chital.23.d_violent_end:0 "As Ostkranbi burned and Tuya was grasping for power up and down the country locked in battle with local forces, Hira realised a little too late just the kind of stag Bhushan turned out to be. For too long she had seen him as little more than a tool, a blunt instrument she could use to threaten those around her and balance the scales of power, but seeing his chance to rise to the top as a goddess-given gift Bhushan had slipped his leash and now asserted his claim. There was no way they'd have been able to seize power legitimately, not after the repression of their policies and ideals, now all they could do was take power for themselves in the chaos of the assassination of Benjen V.\n\nEva, Jakob and Davritannen were thrown completely off kilter by the rising, being away on the progress they could not respond fast enough to those in the capital. Ivar was not made for this kind of takeover and so he was side-lined straight away. That just left Bhushan and Hira to assert themselves over the other.\n\nHira had the political influence and contacts to remove anydeer who could be a challenge to her with enough secrets to keep hold of power for the next decade or more, provided she could find a suitable puppet to serve as Yaril, leaving her as the power behind the throne.\n\nBhushan was not so subtle. His saint-soldiers were loose, hunting down their Olenian oppressors and seizing whatever local power they could. A large portion of the capital was already in their hooves and if things went on, he would undoubtedly come out on top. It was a race against time now, force vs guile."

It had taken all of Hira's southern spies, the promise of a thousand favours for Bhushan and the Tuya, and even a few reports out of Hoversholm's seat in Valdeland, but at last, some small part of the centuries of Hindian humiliation was erased.\n\nSome nights ago, as a hundred caravans of rich Chitali traders, bureaucrats and nobledeer transporting trafficked native labour and ill-gotten bounties of Mahimata arrived in the great city of Gondeerana, Bhushan's Tuya emerged from the shadows to meet them. Masked deer wielding holy two-hoofed scimitars carried off cargo, slaughtered guards, and took prisoner hundreds of deer behind the exploitation of their brothers and sisters. The spoils were distributed among the hungry folk of Gondeerana, those pressed back into thralldom returning to their homelands on caravans commandeered by Tuya stalwarts. For those choice caravaneers found to be funnelling opium and other such poisons to the people of the South, or known to be among Jakob and Eva's inner circles, the Tuya did not give them the mercy of a trial in Ostkranbi, instead holding impromptu religious trials that found them guilty on the spot.\n\nFollowing the carnage in Gondeerana, Ramachan's agents turned their attention to the letters of Haarihus, of Fraskal, of Kanelimpra and Ostkranbi all, which now formed a great ledger of nobles and bureaucrats known to be involved in economic impressment, corruption, and violent reprisals. Prosperous plantations one day soon found themselves without owners the next as a brutal campaign of assassination and intimidation menaced those who would dare harm the fawns of Mahimata. Scores of allies of the Axis of Chital, of course, found themselves candidates for every vacancy.\n\nAs she pondered on the days before her, the Chief Minister and spymistress turned a letter, and another, and another, and simply smiled - instead of Madame Hira Ramachan, they were all written for "Mother Hira", the blessed matriarch of Chital."

There were no words for the rage that coursed through him, his old bones creaking under the tension in his shoulders. This one document had robbed him of his home, his country, and his life.\n\nThe letter that lay open before him looked to the untrained eye like a promotion, an important role on the world stage but to anyone who'd been keeping up with the news, it was a death sentence. By the order of the council, he was to be sent to Olenia as a diplomat. He had the greatest insight into Olenian culture and customs and could provide a valuable bridge between their nations. Olenia, that famously stable and prosperous nation, oh no wait, it's a war-torn hellhole constantly on the brink of collapse. Hira's hooves were all over this, this was how she'd planned to dispose of him, her schemes finally come to fruition.\n\nHe could refuse but rejecting a direct instruction from the council like this could land him in prison or accused of treason. Accepting meant he'd never seen his homeland again. Either way, Hira got what she wanted. Snatching up the letter he ripped it into pieces in spite. He could rally his allies in the army, drive Hira out of office and take back his country, but starting a civil war would lead to the deaths of many of his nearest and dearest, not to mention many of the citizens of Chital. Were the lives of all those deer worth less than his own? Could he justify starting a war to save his hide? Gritting his teeth and staring at the shredded remains of the letter he knew he had no choice.\n\n"It would be easier if she'd just shot me.""

Then a packet of documents arrived one morning - at the Chital Times newspaper office - which demonstrated that not only had he stolen from the charity, but he'd also pinched most of his employee's pension pot. Lord Sverre was quickly hauled in by the police and proceeded to rat on every noble he knew to get himself a deal.\n\nLady Thea was smuggling opium from Colthage, he'd seen her offering it at her dinner parties. She was storing it in Lord Thorvald's warehouses on the Ostkranbi docks in exchange for not telling the authorities about his deer smuggling practices. They in turn sold out Lord Jens and Lady Katje who had taken to selling state secrets to Kiria, who in turn sold out Lady Elise for running gambling dens, and on and on it went. Within the space of 2 and a half months, nearly the entire noble class was arrested and under investigation for one thing or another. Even those who'd appeared to have done nothing wrong at first were later discovered to have had some shady tax arrangements.\n\nThe crimes were real, they were investigated thoroughly, but the chain of events - which would become known as "The Moral Affair" - was being fed by an outside source. When an investigation would hit a dead-end because the money was too well hidden, a stack of papers would appear filling in the gaps and despite the best efforts of the police to keep the investigations secret the newspapers and radio received constant updates on their activities.\n\nThe country was leaking like a sieve, everything was out in the open. The reputation of the noble classes imploded as they turned on each other and many of them faced lengthy prison terms for their crimes. With one smooth tug of a string, the entire web had collapsed.

A gentle knock on the door stirred her from her thoughts as Madame Hira slipped into the room instantly brightening Brienna's mood. Hira had been a real friend to her, helping her deal with all the recent changes.\n\n"Brienna, how are you feeling?" She asked as she crossed the room to the foot of Brienna's bed.\n"Nervous, I guess. Do I have to go through with this?" Smiling warmly Hira settled herself on the bed next to her.\n"Brienna, the state must have a leader and I'm sorry that this burden has fallen on you but there's no one else who has the qualities needed to do the job." She draped a hoof over the doe's shoulders.\n"I don't want this. I... I never wanted this. I'd never even left the grounds of my father's estate until three days ago. I just wanna go home." Brienna quietly muttered as tears slipped down her cheeks.\n\n"Don't worry. I'll be right there to help you through." Hira replied, pulling her into a tight hug.\n"You... you will?" Brienna looked up, hope shining in her eyes.\n"Of course, I'm your friend, your father may be gone but I wouldn't let you go through this alone." Taking a hoofkerchief Hira gently dried Brienna's tears. "You know, this position doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, boring paperwork and scary decisions, it can be a lot of fun.

For the past weeks, he has continued to badger Ramachan over her reluctance to enshrine the Godi as the official leaders of Chitali religious life, declaring that the Yarildom's devotion to the traditional values of Olenian religious culture must come first, before any populist promises or democratic reforms.\n\n"If we give the Mahimatists and their backwards, destructive ideology any more power, they will eradicate the entire vision of the Godi as we know it, and make this country some kind of primitivist mother cult devoted to the destruction of all of the gains the Yaril's government has made in the past few years," Konnar had angrily said during the conference, slamming his hoof upon the table, "The Tuya are terrorists, and the Mahimatists have allowed them to operate, cleansing the countryside of all opposition to the Yaril! What Chital needs is tradition, glory, and to be ruled by the Olenians and their Gods again. If any syncretism must be done, I say, Mahimata shall only reign as a goddess within the pantheon, and among equals."\n\nKonnar's doctrine of the supremacy of the Olenian temples, however, has been challenged by others at the court, especially Bhushan Gurat, a member of the Axis of Chital and close friend to Hira Ramachan. Bhushan, a member of the Tuymaiyānatu religious militia and staunch devotee of the Hindian religion, has proposed that if the religions are ever unified, Mahimata should rank above the other gods as a mother figure by core Mahimatist monotheistic principles.\n\n"Konnar is incorrect, clearly, and continues to spew his propaganda about Mahimatist principles and Mahimata as a goddess," Bhushan declared, "Mahimata is the mother of all Hindians, and the Olenians would only like to see us return to the corrupt modernism of the vapid Olenian temple system. They would have us destroy our lands, end our traditional structures, and eradicate our own culture so that we can return to some kind of "sound" governance."

Let us all remember that the idea of the Council of Seven was not inherently bad - of course, we, the nobility and leaders of Chital, should run the nation, but the reckless elitism and disregard for the common Chitali was what set the Council apart as a uniquely disgusting institution."\n\nHira cleared her throat, then continued. "It is for that reason that I have called you here - to rise from the ashes of the old council and bring a new system for Chital, one that does not pretend to support the voices of all Chitali, but one that does what it says it will.

He continued; the rumours of Madame Hira's network of agents were true, he had to tread carefully lest he find out what other rumours were true.\n\n"What if I were to offer you Chital." Konnar stopped in his tracks as Hira continued strolling without looking back at him. "On the first of next month, Yarila Brienna will announce that the official state religion of Chital shall be Usko. The worship of Mahimata will be rolled into the pantheon as just another goddess and every town and city will be required to have a temple dedicated to their honour; that is if I tell her to go forward with it." She glanced back over her shoulder at him meeting his eyes.\n"Such a great honour would require some recompense surely. There must be some way we can repay this example of generosity." He bowed his head low, playing the game she'd laid out.\n"I am interested in the status of the faith in Chital. I would like reports every two weeks on who is attending these services and how often. Seems fair doesn't it; to care for the spiritual wellbeing of our deer."\n"Oh, very fair indeed but, why do you need us for this? Surely your agents could find about anything you wish?"\n\n"True, I can find out anything about anydeer I wanted, but I want to know everything about everydeer.""

It was her favourite part of the day when she could just take a break and relax for an hour while picking up little bits of gossip from the idle conversations around her.\n\nSmiling gently to herself and relaxing into her chair with her tea, she lifted that morning's newspaper. The front page was dominated by the headline "Leading Godi Murdered." With a picture of Konnar below. The old Godi who had once sought to advise and influence Benjen now lay dead, choked to death with his sermons shoved down his throat. Such a brutal murder would be very badly investigated, and his murderer never brought to justice, she was sure of it.\n\nWhat a pity though; with Konnar dead the Godi would have to elect a new representative but with no clear candidate, it would quickly turn into infighting and arguments. In that power vacuum, the Mahimatists would step forward and take over the spiritual support of the nation. In just a few months, Mahimatism would be declared the official state religion of Chital and an ancient wrong would be put right.\n\nBlowing gently on her tea her eyes met those of a doe sitting across the room from her. Hira nodded gently, setting the paper down on the table and with that the doe rose and left the restaurant."

chital.33.d:0 ""What is the meaning of this?!" Bhushan stormed through the door, finding Hira squaring off against Ivar across the meeting room.\n"Join the queue." Hira muttered between clenched teeth.\n\n"It's all perfectly straightforward." Ivar smiled. "You're done. The Axis is finished, and you will return to your lands, never to darken my door again. I've taken over and there's nothing you can do." The silence in the room was palpable as his words hung in the air. Bhushan's face slowly contorted and turned red with rage.\n\n"We pulled you from the gutter and this is how you repay us by going behind our backs and seizing power whilst we defended our future!" He roared. "You won't get away with this I still have the Tuya and-"\n"I have the army and a complete list of where all your ammo dumps are, the numbers and positions of your monks and even as we speak my troops are poised to strike. It would be a slaughter."\n"Then I'll just have to do it myself." He moved to draw his blade.\n"There are four guards behind that door, you'll be dead before you can take a step." Bhushan paused before slowly lowering his hoof back to the ground, glaring daggers at his former ally.\n\n"Ivar, I'm genuinely impressed." Hira complimented through the tension. "I never thought you had it in you." The initial shock of the takeover had left her and now, seeing the pieces fall into place, she couldn't help but appreciate the underhoofed nature of it all.\n\n"We always knew there would only be one winner here but don't think me ungrateful, I am letting you walk away, your lives intact and lands unmolested. Consider it a consolation prize for coming second but there's no room in my new Republic for you both. For your lies or your bloodlust." He looked from Hira to Bhushan "You're outdated, traditionalist and far too controlling to be allowed to interfere so just go home and be proud you made it as far as you did.""

"Don't you have something better to do?" he asked, his voice gruff as usual. "You still haven't fully recovered from that assassination attempt."\n\nBenjen sighed internally, filling up two glasses of brandy and giving one to Jakob before taking his seat. "I know you care a lot about me, Uncle. And I know that you only want what's best for Chital. But we're taking a new path now, one free from the old strife between deerkind. The Council needs new faces, and you are needed elsewhere now."\n\nJakob only raised an eyebrow as the Yaril continued. "You have served the nation honourably for many years, advising both father and Aatto. But the military needs you now more than ever. Chital's troubles are not yet over, and our soldiers will need you at their side, not in the palace arguing about politics."\n\nThe only sound was the seconds slowly ticking by from a clock as the two Kudlinens stared at each other. The elder was the first to speak. "I thought this day might come," he said, unusually softly. "You are not my brother nor yours, nephew. And you are standing on your own four hooves now, regardless of tradition. It's time for me to step aside, and let you rule."\n\n"Thank you, Uncle-"\n\n"Now don't get sappy on me again," the deer replied, his old rough manner back again instantly. "It took you long enough to realize you can still take time off for family." Jakob took a sip of the brandy and gave a satisfied grunt. "Olenian.

chital.35.t:0 "A Progressive Administration"
chital.35.d:0 "The table was an extravagant thing, a circle of mutual respect and equality made of the finest mahogany. It was an idea taken from abroad, and the simplest way to understand it was that by seating all involved in a circle none were the head of the table. All were equal, a sign of progressivism borrowed from Equestria.\n\nOld habits died hard, however, and Benjen's chair was clearly more ornate than the others. It had been a simple accidental gesture by the staff. Why, after all, would one not want to have the head of government in a position of special respect?\n\nDespite his comfortable seating arrangement, unfortunately, there were still many issues ahoof. To Benjen's left had been Davirtannen, who had been taking ample opportunity to speak on the potentials of industrialization. To his right, Eva had jockeyed with Ivar for his attention, and both had been outspoken trying to sway Benjen's hoof on which policies should come first. Katrina Hoversholm, Ivar's sister and one of the newcomers to the council, seemed to be taking more time discussing something with similar outsider Raili Ninessen across from him.\n\nBenjen sighed quietly and sipped at the glass before him. Olenian, just as he liked, and it settled his nerves slightly while those at his side desperately demanded his attention in any way but just saying it. Eventually, the din was settled by a book slamming opposite Benjen in the circle, and he shot up in surprise as Raili Ninessen barked out a word he didn't catch before speaking further.\n\n"We're wasting our time! Equestria has already paved the road for us, why are we insisting on digging it up and remaking it?" Raili demanded.\n\nA moment of brief, thankful, silence passed before the whole room erupted in an uproar and Benjen lost the scattered arguments once more as they blended into white noise. With another sigh, he reached for his glass. Perhaps some ideas were not so readily emulated."

chital.36.t:0 "The Fall Of The Axis"
chital.36.d:0 "With the power of the Yaril and the reformists secure, it was only a matter of time before the Axis of Chital, the force against Benjen's rule for so long was to be removed. Officially, there was an exact date when it happened, when their seats were dismissed from the Council and the capital. In reality, things were far different.\n\nHira and Bhushan had already long fled their quarters in Ostkranbi, with little evidence they were ever even there. The Tuya, Bhushan's loyalists, were nowhere to be seen, their temples empty before the royal officers even stormed the doors. It was certain that, at least in the north of Chital, the influence of the Axis was gone.\n\nHoversholm, however, faced a far different fate. Due to his reformist economic ideas and his royalist past, Yaril Benjen V personally offered a place in the government to him, a new position now that the Axis was defunct. Ivar, of course, quickly accepted, once again regaining his former place in the inner circle of the Yaril. Overall, it could be seen as a success, and yet some among the reformist ranks still spoke in hushed whispers of danger, of a plot moving to the south of Chital. Perhaps the schemes of the Axis were not over yet.\n\nPerhaps the danger was just beginning."

chital.37.d:0 "When the progressive agenda began, many expected a gradual transition into harmonic and Equestrianist values, with the government and Yaril working in tandem to pass reforms in a timely yet balanced manner. What they did not expect, however, was for Benjen V to announce the complete dissolution of the Council of Seven, centralizing all political and legislative power completely under the Yaril for the duration of what was referred to officially as the "Harmonic Transition" period. Widely regarded as a massively authoritarian move, it is clear that this is meant to ensure no more obstruction of the reforms can be undertaken in Chital.\n\nThe reception to this announcement was extremely mixed, for many reasons. Discontent has risen drastically both in the far east and south of the nation, the former due to traditionalists opposing the reformist Benjen securing full and complete power, and the latter due to their representation in the north and the capital being wiped out in a single move. Despite all that, the bastions of reformism such as the northern heartlands and Ostkranbi itself have seen large continued support for the Yaril, giving large rallies for him and his new Equestrianist order.\n\nChital remains divided, yet it remains to be seen what will happen now..."

chital.38.d:0 "The bonds holding the Axis of Chital together, unfortunately, were not severed when the organization was de-facto abolished months ago.\n\nBhushan Gurat, along with, we suspect, Madame Hira Ramachan, have declared a new government in South Chital in response to our new progressive policies. Although many in the court suspect Hira is using Bhushan as a front for her own operations, the new rebellion has taken up the name and flag of the Tuymaiyānatu, a native religious sect determined to protect their lands and faith from what they believe is an encroachment by a foreign Yaril. Bhushan, a staunch member of the organization and one of the movement's leaders, has declared already that Benjen wants "nothing but to see our ancient customs and traditions annihilated under the boot of what he calls progress."\n\nOur scouts believe the Tuymaiyānatu have a significant presence in Hira's domain in Haarihus, along with Bhushan's in Mahorna. Interestingly enough, Bhushan and his warlords have also managed to take much of the native province of Gondeerana, controlled by Axis sympathizer Eva Pillai. If the native Eva Pillai decides to let the rebels into the city itself, nationwide turmoil could endure, and the Yaril's reign over all of Chital might even be threatened.\n\nThe situation is grim, and all eyes are on the Yaril's next move to answer the rebellion."

Thankfully, none of those protests reached the site of the port itself, and Aattohamn now stands as a possible landing ground for an invasion of [HRV.GetName], or simply a centre of trade to facilitate the mass amounts of Chitali spices exported to Macawia and the Griffonian South.\n\nAlthough debates have erupted on the usage of the port, postponing much of Chital's political activity, one proposal has made its way through - a motion to dedicate Aattohamn to the Chitali workers who built the port town. While squabbling continued on the matter of what the port town should be dedicated to, the spirit of the proposal itself has seen widespread support. All that is left to decide about the future of the new hub of commerce and naval engineering, it seems, is the exact dedication."

Despite the most dangerous politics being behind us now as a nation, the military continues to suffer from the same division that the government did, leaving our armed forces paralyzed. Jakob, the uncle of the Yaril Benjen V, has long been an important voice in the tactics, reforms and leadership, but opposing him are many Hindians and reformists who would like fresh blood seen in the higher ranks of the Chitali army.\n\nOn one side, the traditionalists have held the army for generations now. They consist mainly of Olenians with a few native Hindians in their ranks such as Jakob's trusted subordinate, Pensha Rashanth. Jakob personally advocates for mass motorization and a transition to the modern tank brigades seen abroad, while others remain steadfast in the old style of intense planning and methodological warfare.\n\nOn the other side, a growing opposition wing of the army is primarily unified in opposition to the traditionalists but takes many different directions politically. Generally, they rely more on native tactics and Hindian-style warfare, far from the Olenian methods of old. Many talented generals could rise if given the chance, yet doing so would require a thorough purge of the existing Jakobites.\n\nEither way, the army requires a complete reorganization, which only we can provide."

Ulrik watched from the crowd. He'd come into town from his farm for this, it'd better pay off. Ivar - taking his place at the front of the stage - did not cut the expected figure: dressed down in a loose shirt he looked less like a noble of the council and more akin to a common worker. The crowd went quiet as they waited for him to begin.\n\n"My fellow countrydeer." He spoke, his voice quiet but carrying over the audience. "I come to you with a message. You all have heard of Benjen's passing, you have heard how he was cut down in his prime. His family are heartbroken, Jakob most of all though he does not show it. Jakob - that honourable stag - who tried to aid the Yaril and make him strong. Where the Yaril spoke of compassion Jakob strengthen him to disdain, where the Yaril spoke of care and hope, Jakob grounded him in caution and suspense; but our Yaril did not give into Jakob's council. Where one attempt fails another must take its place and as Jakob killed Benjen you and I and all of us fell down with him as bloody treason flourished over us!" A collective gasp and murmur ran through the crowd at the accusation as Ivar's words rose to a shout.\n\n"My message comes from Jakob's mouth! He says 'do nothing, remain here as you are and do not be stirred to revolt at the Yaril's cruel fate. His weakness had to be removed! Would that I had such skill to move the very stones of Ostkranbi to rise and mutiny!" The crowd roared, the fire of Ivar's words taking hold of them. "I cannot stand by and watch our Yaril's dying dream of a united Chital be smothered as Jakob seizes power and warps our home into his twisted image.

Ivar asked as he trudged through the sand, coming to a halt next to the pyre; he hadn't attended the execution 2 days prior.\n\n"Yes." Andrea replied, the general had come to pay his respects to a fellow soldier. "The noose broke his neck instantly."\n\n"Any interesting last words?"\n\n"Not really, didn't say anything but he was brave, took it very well I thought."\n\nTheir small group of six arrayed themselves around the boat. Eva looked the saddest of those present. The whole affair had largely passed Ivar by. He hadn't been present for the arrest or the trial, he'd been too busy building his support base and if he was being honest, he didn't care. At least Jakob had served a valuable purpose by acting as a scapegoat for Benjen's "murder". With it Ivar had been able to rally public support and tighten his grip on power; he owed the former councillor a debt there but nothing more.\n\nThe old soldier would have approved of an Olenian burial at sea, a fitting final tribute but the sooner the whole affair was done the sooner Ivar could move forward with dismantling and rebuilding the status quo.\n\nAndreas gave the ship a shove as Ivar tossed a lighter on dry straw in the boat, the tide pulling it out to sea as the fire took hold.

We are now faced with a choice as a nation, look for somedeer to take the throne anew or take a fresh path. This is the first time in hundreds of years we've had a chance to decide the fate of our nation and it is a responsibility I have not taken lightly. Would you be so willing to give back that choice we have waited so long to regain?\n\nIt is my decree as interim head of the council that the nation of Chital shall begin the transition to a full republic-" Ivar was temporarily drowned out by the cheers from the crowd as those present exploded with celebration. A smile slipped onto his snout, breaking the image of dignified restraint just for a moment. "With- with a chamber of elected officials representing the provinces and a head of state as the final arbiter." He continued as things quieted down. "The chamber shall be known as the Riksdag and the head of government as Kansleri. Over the coming months, we shall create these positions and transition our nation into the full democracy of the new Chitali Confederation.

A small mahogany table held two porcelain cups of steaming Sambar tea as they talked. They might have appeared as old friends to any onlooker, but they were both all too aware of the hidden tension.

You'll be working against me. I want you to use your influence and take over the leadership of the opposition, appear as the bitter defeated opponent coming back to have another swing, everydeer would believe that."\n\n"And together we push the country in whatever direction you desire?"

He raised a single eyebrow at her offer\n\n"Ivar is the politician." The question did not go unmissed by Hira.\n"Exactly, that's why I can't trust him. He plays the game, makes his plans, and tells deer what they want to hear rather than what he means. I need somedeer I can trust and there are very few of them around. That and you have a line directly to deer of Chital. The common stag trusts you, so, what do you say?" She offered him the bottle.

It came as no surprise to any of the thirty advisors, civil servants, and industrialists in the room that almost all these sites were in the north and clustered along the coast. Eva shook her head. For years she'd been arguing that the south needed investment and support but nodeer had listened to her.\n\n"As you can see" Hira began "The current economic development model has left a great deal to be desired. Regardless of the social benefits, having all our industry localised in one place is a terrible idea. When one freak storm can cripple our economy, we're in a bad way. The Benjen IV bureau is starting to yield results, but we have a long way to go. Eva." The doe was startled at the mention of her name.\n"Yes Hira?" the deer around her shifted as she made her way next to the table to get a clearer view of the map.\n"How would you address this imbalance." Her question seemed surprisingly earnest; no tone of derision thinly failed.\n"I'd start by cancelling the construction of all new factories along the coast and relocate the plans inland, there are a few locations already scouted and opportunities for nearby mines. I wrote a report about all this a few years ago." Did Hira care about her opinion or was this just another one of the spymistress' schemes?\n"I know you did, I read it. I want you to take your plans and put them into practice. Don't move any existing sites but bring the rest of the country up to the same level."\n\n"Very well, I'll make the calls."

No doubt Davirtannen was a symbol of the old regime to Hira, a decadent industrialist with no interest in sharing any of his power with poor Olenian nor any Southern native.\n\nNow, however, that fragile peace between them had been shattered, and Davirtannen found himself before Hira, crowned in the finest regalia fit only for a Princess of Chital, let alone a humble spymistress, and Bhushan and Marsha Gurat, her willing puppets in the grand quest for power that had taken the young deer to rulership.\n\n"Madame Hira," Davirtannen bowed, "I had not expected that you would call upon me now, some months after you had first taken power, not of course that I had any reservations about such a coup. My only duty is to serve Chital, of course, and accomplish the great goals of the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau."\n\nHe forced a smile while Hira entertained a whisper from Bhushan. The delicate little noble who had first been appointed to the position of councildeer so many years ago now seemed a giant, and Davirtannen knew the fate of his operations was all in her hooves - Hira's. The famously fickle and jovial lady who spent most of her time in public laughing with others, reading and listening to cheap Equestrian entertainment, and if the rumours about deviancy were true, certain... other things, was the sole arbiter of the position of the old and weathered industrialist, but Davirtannen wondered if all that fanfare was just an act, a disguise. It didn't matter now. What mattered was her response.\n\n"I have called you here for many reasons Davirtannen, but hearing your old spiel about service to the crown was unfortunately not one of them," Hira smiled to herself and Marsha Gurat snickered next to her, "The fact is that I have missed exacting the judgement of the Axis upon you, as one of the Council, but I had been pondering your place in Chital for many months."\n\nA pause took the room as Hira chose her next words with careful deliberation:"

Most of them had cut deals with the police and ended up paying extortionate fines to avoid prison time; the few unlucky enough to be made examples of would never see the free light of day again. Once the decline had started there was no stopping it, the rot set in and ate through the nobles like worms through a coffin lid.\n\nHira stamped her signature on the seizure order and added it to the pile. Everything was proceeding just as planned. Across the south nobles were on the verge of bankruptcy, their wealth stripped bare by the strangely precise fines and penalties, as though they'd been worked out specifically to push them to the edge. The council, in its kindness and wisdom, had agreed to buy up their lands - at below market rates - and nationalise them. Some would become new industrial land, but most would be turned into parks or given back the wilds, a gift to the common deer.\n\nThose who wouldn't sell? Well fortunately they were all in prison and their lands forfeit. In fact, it appeared that only a small hoofful of Hira's friends and few councillors had managed to hold onto their lands and escape the accusing hoof of the law.\n\nStamping her seal on another order, she took pleasure in a job well done. The money seized would drive future investment and the tyranny of the Olenian nobility had finally been wiped clean."

chital.54.d:0 "The gavel hammered on the table and Ivar swore he could hear the leg crack. This was ridiculous, 64 deer crammed together into the meeting room which wasn't finished; scaffolding and pots of paint lying all over the place. The Riksdag building was at least 2 months behind schedule and still far from completion, but the session had already been set and they couldn't move it just because construction was still ongoing. So here they were, the new Republic conducting its business on a building site.\n\n"I call to order this session of the Riksdag. The first order of business is the ratification of the constitution. I propose we discuss the position of representatives and the manner of voting. I take it all members of the house have read the draft?" A murmur of positive responses ran through the room. "Good and anydeer have any comments to make?" Again, there was general consensus as everydeer expressed their happiness with the document. Ivar sighed and shook his head; not one deer in the room had read the draft, if they had they'd have noticed that it was a complete farce, granting the office of Kansleri final say over pretty much every law that came through the Riksdag.\n\nIt was as he expected. The entire hall was full of yesdeer. None of them had any real experience with this "Democracy" thing; most hadn't even understood the rules when they stood for election and had fallen butt backwards into success. They all looked to Ivar, the self-professed 'Great Republican' to lead the way and would do pretty much anything he said. While a nice situation to be in, it really wasn't what he wanted, now he'd have to do everything from organising the completion of the building to planning the nation's school curriculum because every deer here would be hounding him constantly for his help. Sometimes being the hero is a problem all its own."

To Ivar Hoversholm, however, it was simply politics, and to his benefit, the people of Chital tended to forget their past convictions when their Kansleri took to the stage.\n\n"Countrydeer," the Kansleri began, adjusting his loose tie and gleaming at the audience, "What I am to announce is both unfortunate, necessary, and glorious - an end to an age of reaction and treachery, but the fall of many of Chital's old heroes, who in a time long before now I once considered my greatest allies."\n\n"The inner circle of Benjen V, his puppetmasters... you have heard me refer to them as "Progressives", but now, I shall be blunt - they are nothing more than traitors. Before I came to power they preached reform, spoke of a future of peace, justice, and harmony for the Chitali people and unity to heal the Oleno-Hindian conflict - worthy goals, I'm sure we would all agree. But now? Now? They have abandoned their past pretences, our exceptional visions, and attempted, with all their power, to lead the government of and by the people to utter and complete collapse, for the sole goal of removing me, a "bigoted anti-harmonic despot", from power."\n\nHoversholm pictured them in his mind, and his blood curdled - Katarina, his sister, who in the great jealousy of an older, neglected sibling betrayed him the moment Benjen V cast him out, and Ninessen, the traitor, who appeased the court in one breath and condemned them in the next. It brought him a peace nothing else could bring him that these does would soon fall beneath the might of the Republic.\n\n"Under the cover of shadows, these members of the secret "Council of Six" plotted to destroy the fruits of my regime and... with no doubt finance an Equestrian-backed coup with the help of the repulsive S.M.I.L.E - and now, they stand detached from any substantive positions of power.

The employment advisor asked, raising an eyebrow in confusion.\n"Because the proposal does not merit further discussion." Ivar responded without looking up.\n"Yes, it does." Kjetil responded, slightly taken aback at Ivar's flippant response. "I'm not the only one to think so either, the defence, health and education advisors are all on board." He looked around the table for support and met several nods of agreement.\n"I think you'll find if you check the minutes of the last meeting that there is no record of any such support." Ivar responded, meeting the advisor's eyes with a bored expression.\n\n"I... This... This is a fiddle. Why are you blocking it like this?!" The advisor asked, shock turning to anger as he became confused and frustrated.\n"Decentralising government business means less control of the country. It is folly to increase your knowledge at the expense of your power. There are benefits to the country I grant you but the Republic is still new and should not be destabilised like this and you'll just have to accept that." Ivar responded, his hooves calmly folded on the table as he answered the advisor.\n"I won't accept this. This is absurd!" He yelled, slamming his hoof on the table.\n\n"You don't quite seem to understand your position. You are not a member of the Riksdag, nor do you have any power over the policy of the government. You are an advisor, that is what you do, you advise, nothing more. I, however, as you quite rightly have said am Kansleri. I have the first and last word within Chital and if I say we're not doing this, we're not doing this. This is a one deer, one-vote system. I am the deer; I have the vote.

Despite all that a sense of dread welled up inside of him as he made his way to the Kansleri's office for a small chat He knew it, deep down inside he knew, he was going to be dismissed or at least shouted at.\nSwallowing, his throat dry as he stopped outside Ivar's office, he gently knocked the door. From within he heard a muffled voice bid him enter and, heart thumping, he entered the office. The Kansleri sat behind his desk in the humbly decorated office; he smiled at Mikael as he entered and motioned to the chair on the other side of the desk.\n\n"Mikael, just the deer I wanted to see. I wanted to have a little chat; hope you don't mind."\n"Yes of course Kansleri, what can I do for you?"\n"Well, it's this public transport grant scheme, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter."\n"Oh I, I'm just a junior minister, surely you'd be better asking the minister for transport."\n\n"Perhaps but I asked around a bit and I heard you used to work for the Gondeerana bus company before the elections. I believe you can provide some real working insight into the issues, and I believe in promoting the best deer for the job at hoof, no voice is too small if they have something valuable to say. Now I know this work would be quite the promotion, but I feel you're up for it, so what do you say?"\n\n"I... but, but of course Kansleri how could I refuse."

It was a strange sensation, he'd never taken part in such a rite before, but needs must when the matters of state were involved. The whole process gave him time to think about his own religious beliefs. The decision to declare Usko as the state religion had not been taken lightly and it had stirred up a lot of hostility in the provinces. More than once the police had to be sent in to break up a rally and the Tuya were almost always involved in some way. It was fortunate they'd lost a lot of their influence and weapons stashes otherwise there might have been full-scale civil war by now.\n\nThe benefits outweighed the risks; by bringing the Godi into the fold they had placated the Olenians throughout Chital, those deer held a lot of influence and keeping them onside mattered. The whole affair still felt strange to him though, he'd considered religion an important part of the state but on a personal level there were so many to choose from, where would he even begin and going down that rabbit hole could end badly? There was no shortage of fanatics in the world, the Tuya of instance or the Chiropterrans of the west. The world needed more moderates, not more devotees.\n\nThe old Godi finished knotting the charms into Ivar's antlers and began to mumble a prayer Ivar had little understanding of and less interest in.

Ivar had been visiting a local school as part of a tour of the eastern provinces when Eva had unexpectedly arrived in a foul mood and demanded they talk, dragging Ivar into the nearest room. It turned out the nearest room was the broom cupboard and now these two former council members were wedged together with no escape from questioning.\n\n"Why am I hearing rumours that you plan to seize the land from noble families across the country?!" She demanded.\n\n"That bill has not yet been brought before the Riksdag and it will be discussed caref-" He tried to placate before being cut off.\n\n"Don't give me that, we both know you can push anything you want through that place. I want to know now if there's any truth in it. My family lands are not just something you can seize. We have history there, my grandfather fought for every inch of it."\n\n"Eva, I understand, I do really, but we both know that among the nobles there are still some monarchists who would see a new Yaril crowned. To get rid of them I must seize their lands and titles, but I can't play favourites. If the state seizes some land, it must seize it all otherwise I won't look impartial anymore. I'm sorry, I really am, and I'll make sure you are reimbursed at above market rates for the land, you and your partner won't go hungry but this needs to happen for the stability of the Republic."\n\n"If I could swing a hoof in here, I'd knock you out."

It was a particularly special visit as the Jewel of the South - Eva Pillai - had joined him at his invitation to spend the day meeting the deer of the province. That was what the papers reported, the truth was she had been invited along to discuss the position of the nobility. The presence of the public guaranteed that their discussion would have to remain civil.\n\n"And what," she asked between chats with the deer, "would be the terms of this arrangement?"\n"The nobles on the list will have to give up their titles and become private citizens but they'll keep their lands. They'll also be offered positions in the civil service suitable to their skills."\n"And those not on the- why thank you, what lovely flowers." She smiled as she bowed her head, a shy young fawn draped a small daisy chain over one of Eva's antlers before scamping back to her mother. "Those not on the list, what about them?"\n\n"Titles gone; lands gone; they're gone. They've either got no skills to speak of or are too attached to the idea of the monarchy. Have you come far?" Ivar asked an old stag in the crowd who caught his eye. He was leaning on a walking cane for support. "Somedeer get this gentlestag a chair, would you? So good of you to come out Sir."\n"I see." Eva said, catching Ivar up. "And this is not an offer; it's an instruction, so what do you need me for?"\n\n"You Eva are the example of the old guard made good, your economic skills are well known, and you are well-liked throughout the country.

I hope my state-owned corporation has not acted contrary to the goals of your reformist policy - surely you and I both know we are on the same page."\n\n"Well, Mr Davirtannen," Hoversholm stated, looking him square in the eyes and smiling, "You do understand that I cannot go galivanting around calling the premier state-corporate asset in Chital a Royal Corporation.

You have done more for Chital than any of the prancing elites who pass for industrialists these days, that is for sure."\n\nHoversholm chuckled and then turned to sign off a seat of paper.\n\n"There," he said, passing the contract to the old bureaucrat, "The state will take a more... active role in your industries, of course, and the name - the name will simply not do."\n\n"How about the Chitali Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation, sir?" Davirtannen finally queried, polite as always.\n\n"A good name for our new partnership," Hoversholm smiled once more, reaching across the table to shake the hoof of CMEC's new CEO - a mutually beneficial alliance that would surely go a long way in securing reform in Chital, Davirtannen knew.

The system worked perfectly. So confusing, backwards, and unusable was the Bureau that many deer just talked to each other and sorted out their issues at a local level without involving the Bureau for fear of making the issue ten times worse. Just as intended.\n\nBy providing a public institution that everydeer could hate and direct their hostility at, the state had made it easier for them to trust each other.

He held a two-page summary in his hoof, a vague attempt to sum up five years of errors, misjudgements, and terrible decisions.\n\nIt was badly designed at best, utterly useless at worst. It talked of providing hoof tools for farmers instead of tractors, the best way to encourage localised weaponsmiths instead of centralising production in factories, and how to improve upon existing construction instead of experimenting with completely new engineering approaches. It was also rather derogatory, assuming most of the native Hindians lived in mud huts in the jungle and survived on subsistence farming with little understanding of land ownership. It talked of seizing farmland to grow spices without payment for the land.\n\nThis report was three thousand pages of outdated, meaningless administrative drivel. He sighed letting the summary fall to his desk. He'd known Benjen IV better than most, had the most insight into the various departments that had worked on the bureau and through his political connections could get access to the minutes of every meeting that had discussed this.\n\nHis conclusion; scrap the whole thing and start again.

Finally, Miss Laghari broke him from his concentration.\n\n"Hunar, over here." she called.

chital.70.t:0 "The Reason Of Davirtannen"
chital.70.d:0 ""Let me just say, my Yaril, that it is my greatest honour to be able to serve as your Chief Minister. To pick me of all deer from the ranks to serve-"\n\n"So you've said a thousand times by now, Davirtannen," Benjen answered, almost giving a sigh. When the reformist had asked for a private talk in the royal gardens, he had hoped it wasn't going to be just for more platitudes. "You've served Chital loyally for my father and brother for decades now, what made you think I wouldn't pick you?"\n\nThe deer tightened his tie a bit, still a bit nervous. "Well, I was worried that you might listen more to the others instead, like Ivar or Raili. Don't misunderstand me, I know why you brought them in, but Ivar's economics are rather bold and Raili's stance towards politics is..."\n\n"Radical?"\n\n"Yes, exactly. What we need, or rather what I believe we need, is a middle course. A constitutional monarchy, with a strong democracy to support it. I have heard that Raili and Katrina were speaking to you about emulating the Equestrian monarchy; I'm sure their hearts are in the right place, but we can not just copy their principality and expect things to work."\n\nThe Yaril thought for a few moments. He supposed he had gotten quite caught up in her fiery speeches and literature to really think about what she was suggesting. Equestrianism had seemed so enlightened, so perfect... but Raili had seemed so willing to do whatever it took to reach it. And Davirtannen had seen a lot in his many years serving the Yarils; much older than Benjen himself, he carried himself with a sort of slow reason and determination that was all his own. "I suppose you're right," he said finally to his Chief Minister. "And I'm sure you've already planned out everything to get to your democracy, right?"\n\nDavirtannen gave a slight smile. "Just leave everything to me, Yaril.""

chital.71.t:0 "The Passion Of Ninessen"
chital.71.d:0 "The last few weeks had been... hectic.\n\nEver since Raili had been made Chief Minister of Chital, the government had gone through a major upheaval. Countless old ministers, advisors and bureaucrats had been fired on the spot, anydeer being deemed unharmonic removed from their positions no matter how small. In their place came in Raili's own progressives such as Katarina Hoversholm, and industrialists like Davirtannen remained in their positions as loyal servants of the Yaril. The most controversial additions, however, were the foreigners. The Equestrians, ponies never seen before in the Chitali court being appointed to some of the highest positions of government. Needless to say, there was quite a few upset at the turn of events.\n\n"I assure you Yaril, all of these is completely necessary for what we're planning to do," Raili said to the Yaril as he watched the countless ponies in the room with confused interest. "I've worked with the Equestrians for many years, and if we're going to make a real Equestrian principality, they will be invaluable to doing so."\n\nBenjen nodded, seemingly not paying much attention to what the doe was saying. "I've always wanted to bring the magic of friendship to Chital," he said, captivated by the scene and his own thoughts. "You have my full support, Raili. I trust you to do things right."\n\nRaili smiled. It was certainly a far cry from the opposition of the old Yarils. "Thank you, Benjen. By the time I'm done, Chital will be far different from what it was.""

chital.72.t:0 "Pleas to the State"
chital.72.d:0 "Despite the flourishing progressivism of Benjen's administration, some things never changed. The courthouse where Dannya Shah had been brought to in chains was a well-embellished building, with an intimidatingly grand facade and an enormous central room. It was designed to express the strength of the State, and for Ninessen's purposes, it was perfect. Even a democratic state, after all, had to be strong towards those that would subvert it.\n\nBefore the judge, and with Ninessen in the wings 'observing', Dannya Shah was brought to testify. She approached the bench with a feigned confidence, but her face quickly turned from a forced smile to a simpering look of fear as the judge rattled off her accusations. They ranged from treason to bribery of public officials, to culpable conspiracy in several homicides. \n\nWith her chains clattering slightly as she stumbled to speak, Dannya started simply, "I was..." she whimpered, and the judge demanded Dannya speak louder. "I was doing what was best for my country!" she croaked awkwardly and gasped in a breath before continuing under the judge's gaze.\n\nFor a moment, her eyes darted around. Ninessen watched her closely and noted that the chained doe closed her eyes, and took a soft breath. She started speaking before her eyes were open.\n\n"The tyrannical... regime of the harmonists can only bring festering rot to Chital, a-and... and..." Dannya started, but quickly lost her steam and sputtered to a halt. "I plead not guilty."\n\nThe judge sighed and rolled his eyes before he struck his gavel. "Your plea is noted. A jury trial will begin tomorrow," he spoke, and his voice echoed around the large hall while Dannya staggered back and fell into her seat.\n\nNinessen smiled and leaned back in her seat, and watched as the next communist was brought in. Slowly but surely through the day, they filled a bench, and all of them tried- and failed- to make a rhetorical stand before the bench. All of them were cowed by the strength on display, and Ninessen was sure that they would crack given how serious the penalties were for their charges. There was seldom honour amongst thieves, after all, and that's all they were- thieves." 
chital.72.a:0 "Justice serves harmony."

chital.73.t:0 "Intervention"
chital.73.d:0 "Not long after Dannya Shah had been convicted of her crimes, with sentencing due the following week, was the simpering and terrified doe replaced with a pathetic image of an equally terrified buck. Hoversholm was dressed in a very fine suit, Equestrian by fashion, and his mane had been styled equally so. He would not have looked out of place in Manehattan, and he opened his statements with bold but rhetorically empty points of how it should be the pride of our nation to hear the viewpoints of others.\n\nThe bucks charisma was obvious, but Ninessen was hardly fazed. The judge, now and then, glanced to her position in the viewing stand and she would nod to allow the buck to continue. His words were empty, and allowing him to speak would allow them to preempt others that spoke with more radical zeal.\n\nIt wasn't long however before Ninessen felt a nudge at her side, and turned to see a doe, dressed in a similar fashion to the buck at the stand but with a far more feminine flair, looking at her. "Can we talk?" she questioned.\n\nNinessen blinked, "...no?"\n\nThe doe, not dissuaded by a simple refusal, rose and slapped her hooves to the chair before her. "That's my brother!" she shouted and interrupted her brothers rambling with her bold words. "I demand an opportunity to speak with him!"\n\nNinessen sighed, she knew that right existed, and the doe turned to her and huffed, "What about now?"\n\nSo it was that Ninessen was pulled into the judge's office during a quick, awkward, recess in court. In that room, the judge lost his sense of domineering control, and he sat behind his desk as he looked to Ninessen and the well-dressed doe opposite her. Ninessen spoke first.\n\n"I'm fairly certain I know why you've come here, so speak and make it quick," Ninessen demanded.\n\nKatarina leaned in her chair slightly, and looked to Ninessen. For a moment the confidence in her face, and the glare of stern protection, faded. She knew the enormous threat hanging in the balance. Her brother's freedom, or perhaps even his life, was hanging in the balance. So she spoke, slowly, choosing her words carefully.\n\n"My brother..." Katarina started, "Has broken no law, hurt no deer, and is hardly a radical. He's an idiot, a charlatan- he just saw an opportunity for attention and profit. Please, have some mercy. He's not a threat to the state, he's just a con-stag that got in over his head. Give him some community service or something- don't try him as a damned revolutionary."\n\nNinessen sighed, and the judge shrugged when she glanced to him. Before long, she spoke."
chital.73.a:0 "Fine, but he can at least clean up some litter."

chital.74.t:0 "Ostkranbi Summit"
chital.74.d:0 ""So, Chief Minister." Ivar Hoversholm sat back with just a hint of resentment as Benjen Davirtannen took a puff of a cigar, his glasses carefully perched on his muzzle. "Can't say I expected you of all deer to get that role."\n\n"Believe me, I'm as surprised as you are," he responded, letting off a bit of his normal formality. "And I mean no disrespect since I know how much you wanted this role before you were first cast out of the court. Your reformism was just a bit too fiery for the time."\n\n"It was the only way to save Chital!" Ivar protested. "Look at Raili, she's still going around preaching about her Equestrianism straight to the Yaril!"\n\n"Just like you were about Republicanism?" Davirtannen simply raised an eyebrow as the truth of the matter sunk in. "Ivar, we've been friends for a long time now. You've been a great statesdeer, someone that's had many a great idea for Chital that we could agree on. But you have to concede some of that idealism if we're going to work together." The industrialist leaned forward, trying to get his point across. "Hardline Equestrianism is not the future of Chital; surely you can put aside some of your Republicanism for the good of the nation too?"\n\nIvar grimaced, moving his head from side to side as if he was debating it, before finally sighing and moving to shake Davirtannen's hoof. "Alright, fine. Benjen's not the worst Yaril Chital could have, anyhow. Just make sure to keep me away from Raili; I don't know how long I can stand that Equestrianist prattling."\n\nDavirtannen smiled. "I'll see what I can do.""

chital.75.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
chital.75.d:0 "Hira Ramachan had not been seen at court or in the city of Ostkranbi for weeks. In the beginning, the phenomenon was merely a laughing matter - Benjen Davirtannen and Ivar Hoversholm would joke about the various deviant pleasures or deep revenge schemes Hira could be indulging in, and Raili Ninessen and would remark "good riddance" under her breath whenever the topic was mentioned.\n\nThree weeks into the loss of Hira, the situation with the spymistress was not exactly to Benjen's liking, and so the Yaril finally brought it up in one dull meeting of the Council - Hoversholm shrugged and suggested she was off in the south somewhere commissioning new propaganda, and Davirtannen declared no one had seen her at any of his industrial sites for months, before breaking out into laughter at the very thought of the petite Ramachan ever visiting a factory. Only Ninessen furrowed her brow and spoke up with a serious response, declaring that Eva had sent notes the previous day about disturbing news in the South - agents of the Chitali government were found dead outside Haarihus, their warrants for Dannya Shah's arrest still in their hooves. Eva, of course, had assumed it was the Reds, but Ninessen and the Yaril both knew Shah no longer had the base to make such bold statements.\n\nIt had to have been Ramachan.\n\nWith Ninessen and Davirtannen's backing, primitive automobiles set out at dawn to track down the spymistress and find the last known places she had reared her vile head in. Eva Pillai's domain of Gondeerana would be an excellent place to start."
chital.75.a:0 "To Gondeerana it is, then!"

chital.76.t:0 "On Her Tail"
chital.76.d:0 "The agents got to Gondeerana in a relatively fast time, entering the Southern city and immediately getting to work attempting to track down Hira Ramachan's location. It was difficult, as the spymistress was notoriously secretive and the city was the second-largest in all of Chital, and the locals were not exactly the most cooperative at times.\n\nAfter a few days, however, the forces on the ground finally reported to the Yaril with a lead. Somedeer had reported a disturbance next door, and multiple testimonies had lined up with Hira and her agents taking temporary residence. The team reacted with lightning speed, breaking in ready for a fight.\n\nHira, however, was already gone. Almost no trace of her presence remained, dust already settling upon the countertops and tables of the many rooms. The spymistress had sensed the approaching threat and fled, leaving her pursuers with not a clue of where she was heading. Letters to the Yaril reported failure after failure, and the one possible lead that they had, at least for now, was a loss."
chital.76.a:0 "Always one step ahead..."

chital.77.t:0 "Eva's Guidance"
chital.77.d:0 ""So, we're stuck." Yaril Benjen put down the latest letter from the deployed guard in Ostkranbi, sitting at the table with the Council. "Gondeerana was a dead end, and Hira is nowhere to be found. We can not let such a threat to Chital get away, but Hira is keeping one step ahead of all of us. We need more leads, and fast."\n\nThe six deer at the table thought for a few moments. "Well don't look at me," Davirtannen finally replied. "I've informed the factories to keep an eye out, but I doubt Hira would be foolish enough to try and enter one for some reason."\n\n"I know," Eva spoke up, grabbing everydeer's attention. "My contacts in the south has told me that they've seen the spymistress at her estate in Haarihus. If you send your forces there, you may be able to catch her."\n\nBenjen nodded, while Raili seemed less convinced. "And why would she be there?" the orator questioned. "That would be one of the first places to look, she wouldn't be in a place as obvious as that. Hira is more likely to try and flee across the border; cutting her off at Mahorna is a better plan."\n\nEva seemed rather offended at the insinuation of being called a liar, but the notion was enough to give the Yaril pause. She did raise a good point, and Eva was known for her previous Axis sympathies... but at the same time, she had proven to be a reliable ally in court. A choice had to be made, and decisively - no matter where she was now, the spymistress was unlikely to remain there for long."
chital.77.a:0 "To her estate - when has Eva lied?"
chital.77.b:0 "Ninessen is right - she could not be there."

chital.78.t:0 "An Empty Estate"
chital.78.d:0 "Upon receiving the orders from Ostkranbi, dispatched forces quickly made their way to converge on Haarihus, ensuring that Hira would not be able to escape this time. Her estate was, after all, public knowledge, and getting in would be foal's play. It was simply a matter of finding her, arresting her and hopefully her crony Bhushan while they were at it. The strike was coordinated, well-prepared, and done with precision.\n\nIt also happened to be completely fruitless. The estate was, much like the safehouse in Gondeerana, completely empty. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious that nodeer had been there for some time. It wasn't a case of barely missing Hira again, it was getting a location completely wrong. The lead was false, the trail completely cold. Who knew where the spymistress was?\n\nThe news was quickly sent to Benjen, who was not happy in the slightest. Angry both at Eva for lying and covering for the Axis, and himself for not listening to Ninessen. He would tell the guard to keep looking, of course, but the chances of catching Hira before she escaped to wherever she was heading was slim to none now."

After all, it was the homeland of Bhushan, who few did not know of his opposition to the Olenian elite's domination over the native Hindians. However, luck came in the form of an excuse to enter; a large festival was going on, in celebration of some local holiday. Many deer from the region were coming to attend, and it would be easy to slip unnoticed by the crowd.\n\n"What's the situation?"\n\nThe soldier looked up to see an officer standing next to him expectantly. "Our forces are in position, sir," he responded with a salute. "The city is on unofficial lockdown, and we have ever exit watched for any sign of the spymistress or her entourage."\n\n"Excellent," the officer nodded. "Any sign of them?"\n\n"No, sir. We have deer gearing up in plainclothes as we speak to enter the festival and search for Madame Hira. However, it is rather crowded, and it may take some time to track them down if they are within the city."\n\n"Keep at it, private." The officer turned away.

When the reformists had originally won over Chital, he had seen the writing on the wall; even before Hira had told him to, the Hindian had already begun preparing to make his escape from Ostkranbi. Travelling south, he was to lay low in his home province while Hira attempted to stir trouble elsewhere, and when the time was right, meet her to cross over the border into Doelhi. Unfortunately, it seemed that the spymistress was running late.\n\nAt this point, Bhushan was starting to question his loyalties. Not towards the Yaril, of course; he would always be a symbol of decadence and Olenian oppression, no matter what he claimed to stand for. It was Hira, once seeming to be such a stable and useful ally, who was beginning to grate on him. Always acting as the leader of the two, pushing for the assassination attempt that got them to this place, it seemed she was in control of everything. But now, her help was no longer seeming to be necessary...\n\n"Bhushan." He snapped back to reality, seeing Hira already approaching. "It's time. If we're to see Chital fall and Hindia free, our luck will be better aiding Doelhi. Are you coming?"\n\nIt was time to make his choice."

It seems he killed her before fleeing alone soon before we reached them."\n\n"I suppose the so-called "unity" of the Axis was a lie," Raili commented before turning to face Ivar instead. "Aren't you lucky that you got to side with us instead of them?"\n\nThe republican's face contorted in annoyance while Katarina tried to calm the tension.

"Just a stroke of misfortune that you gave us the wrong information?"\n\nEva looked both shocked and insulted at the accusation, with Davirtannen merely raising an eyebrow. Interestingly enough the most neutral-looking deer present was Ivar, who seemed wholly uninterested in the events unfolding.\n\n"None of that matters anymore," Benjen continued.

But no, Bhushan had insisted that they remain at least for some important celebration from his homeland, and so here they were. Remaining in Mahorna, at some glorified party.\n\nWell, it wasn't completely bad. Though she was sure Bhushan would have disapproved, one or two stations to gamble had been set up among a few deer. Hira had decided to join in, always fancying a bit of a game of chance. Luck was appearing to be on her side, as her winnings had nearly doubled since she first started. The dice were rolling in her favour, unlike the winds of politics which had clearly not. At least something was going right.\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, she spotted a new deer coming to the table. He was a young stag, couldn't be more than twenty-five, with a fair amount of money to bring to the table. Interestingly enough, he seemed to pay more attention to the players than the dice. And there was something familiar about him too, something that Hira couldn't put her hoof on...\n\n"Place your bets!" The spymistress snapped back to attention, pushing forward a sizable amount of her winnings towards the next roll. But out of the corner of her eye, she saw the newcomer stare at her, a flash of recognition in his eyes, and that was when it finally hit her.\n\nHe was a Yaril loyalist.\n\nIt was already over. Hira could hear the two deer coming up behind her. There wasn't a point in running. Sighing, she sat back and tried to relax at the table, at least for a few more moments.

The secrets, the intrigue, the backstabbing... he had no love for it, but it was something he was used to. A mainstay of every day acting as Yaril, hearing their complaints, their suggestions and usually ignoring a vast amount of them.\n\nDavirtannen had turned that all on its head. Calling it a 'court' would be misleading - there was no nobility now, only bureaucrats and publically-appointed officials. Deer like Eva had been completely sidelined, relegated to their estates and kept out of the new politics of Ostkranbi. Replaced with faceless stags in suits and ties, socialite extravagance had gone to debates on policy and state efficiency. It felt more like an office than a palace, with Benjen presiding over it all.\n\nIt was certainly... different. More boring, absolutely. But did he miss the old and exciting plots between the nobility? That was hard to say. At least he had to do less now, which was nice. Davirtannen seemed right at home, speaking with his fellow industrialists about matters the Yaril didn't even pretend to understand or care about. Something had been lost, a spark or a spirit, and replaced with the same dull routine of daily government management.\n\nOh well. At least Benjen could have more time to himself now.

The way the dress she wore flowed off her frame was elegant and beautiful, and she had been waiting weeks for it to come in from Baltimare. Equestria made the finest dresses, after all, and she had paid a substantial bag of bits for this piece. With a soft sigh, and one last glance at herself. Ninessen left her room and stepped into the hall. Today was the Gala of the Dancing Deer, and Ninessen was delighted to attend. \n\nAll around her the does and bucks of the flourishing new order of high society were dressed in the finest of Equestrian clothing. They bowed respectfully as Ninessen passed, and soon enough she was introduced by a well-dressed servant as she entered the ballroom. Even that had been taken from Equestria, and so was most of the food on display. The alcohol, however, was Olenian. Ninessen knew Benjen would find some excuse to refuse to attend had it been otherwise.\n\nThere were of course ponies as well in attendance, and Ninessen noted that they were well respected by the deer nobility. Chital looked to them for guidance and inspiration, even if Ninessen could see in their eyes a bit of mockery. They knew that Chital was emulating Equestria, and in some cases awkwardly. The first step to equalling Equestria on Chital's own terms, however, was internalizing what had already been accomplished. There was no reason to reinvent the wheel.\n\nLike Equestria, those in attendance weren't landed nobles or- for the most part- given to their attendance and respectful station simply by lineage. They were academics of note, merchants of wealth, or statesdeers of good reputation. It was a meritocracy of those that had proven themselves worthy to have their hooves on the steering wheel of state, even if not perhaps absolute control of it.\n\nNinessen made her way towards the food, and there she found just as she hoped Benjen sampling some of the drink. She stepped up to his side, and leaned into his ear, "You really should try Equestrian cider some time," she teased, and Benjen snorted before he turned to her.\n\n"You can speak to me about Equestrian superiority until you go mute, but it'll take more than that to convince me Olenia doesn't make the best alcohol," Benjen returned.\n\nNinessen giggled, again.

Almost every estate and plantation I've visited suffered from some glaring issue; some were well-intentioned attempts that fell from incompetence, and others... well, the less said about them, the better. Many prefer to live their decadent lifestyles using embezzled funds than actually use them for their intended purpose."\n\nThe Yaril frowned. "And how long has this been happening?"\n\n"Since the very beginning. Remember that industrialization project in Valdeland? The one with the new arms factory?"\n\nBenjen blinked, trying to rack his memory for a moment. "Yes, I believe you said it fell through from the bureaucracy. But that was years ago!"\n\n"It was, and I did tell you that because that's what I was told in turn. But in reality, the local nobility had used the money on one of their galas." Davirtannen slid over a folder, flooded with documents and images of the Chitali countryside and cities.

Stripping noble protections entirely, overturning the entire religious society of Chital... many found themselves asking if Equestrianism was worth the price, but it was certainly too late to turn back now.\n\nAll they could do now was put their faith in the Yaril and hope for the best."

chital.89.t:0 "The Chameleon"
chital.89.d:0 "As Herra Ivar Hoversholm made the trip to Ostkranbi with only a small retinue of Hamaholm bannerdeer, he considered new schemes, plots, and local nobles to align with, but most of all, his mind turned to his old failures.\n\nYears ago, he had the honor of sitting in the Yaril's inner circle and whispering in the ear of the most powerful deer in all Hindia, and often as not, Benjen would do what he wanted, for who could deny someone with the best interests of all Hindians at heart? A hasty request for the position of Chief Minister, a denial, a violent reaction from Hoversholm and then an equally brutal one from the Yaril, though, resigned that once-so-tangible power to nothing more than a historical footnote. Humiliation followed, cries of schemer and traitor and power-hungry usurper, but Hoversholm could do little to defend himself, for, in the end, it all was true.\n\nWhen the Council of Seven opened yet again, he found himself among the opposition - not as Ivar the Reformer nor Ivar the Traitor - but as Ivar the Chameleon, a humble member of the Axis of Chital, and a voice of passion, reason, and kindness to all in court - and as a voice of snide and condescending disapproval behind their backs. Hoversholm preferred to think of this new persona, not as one of the contradictions, but as one based only on simple bendings of the truth to further his superior ideals, and the prosperity of all of Chital as a result. Smiling, he recalled moments laughing off the Axis to the face of Benjen, then plotting in shadowed meetings with that same group of deer, all the while speaking fondly of the common traditionalist deer to Jakob the Grey.\n\nIf all went well this next session of the Council, that friendly face to both the Yaril and the Axis would be Hoversholm, and a simple change of pace could grant him the power to bring prosperity to Chital's fawns for generations."

chital.90.d:0 "The door smashed open, countless deer pouring into the building that had been converted into a Tuya compound. Countless fell as soon as they entered; those loyal to Bhushan Gurat were prepared for this, after all, and they were well-armed. But they were falling just as fast as the Yaril's loyalists, and simply did not have the deerpower to sustain prolonged combat. Room by room, inch by inch, they were slowly pushed back until they were cornered.\n\nBhushan himself fought bravely, right alongside the Tuya he had trained and taught for so long, but it was only a matter of time before a stray bullet hit his leg and he was forced to his knees. Pensha Rashanth, the one who led the operation by the order of Jakob, walked up to the southern noble and raised her pistol.\n\n"Any last words?" she asked, her voice hard as her loyal deer surrounded the few left.\n\nHe responded by spitting on the general. "Foul Olenian puppet, you betray your native brothers," Bhushan responded. "There is no place in Hindia for those like you, nor will Mahimata give you mercy."\n\n"Then we both have that in common."\n\nThere was one more gunshot, and Bhushan Gurat, the face of the Tuya for so long, fell to the ground dead."

chital.91.t:0 "One Step Forward"
chital.91.d:0 "When the first steps were taken, Jakob knew that it would not be long before Benjen discovered it. That there would be a reckoning, that there would be conflict, that he wouldn't understand. And if this had been before the Royal Progress, it would have almost certainly been an overstep. But with all the traditionalists now in power behind his back, there was no opposition left that mattered.\n\nUnfortunately, there was still the minor case of that reckoning to deal with.\n\n"Uncle, what are you doing?!" Benjen walked into the room, furious at the old deer. "Issuing these emergency powers, leaving all legislation and decisions to the military, and excluding the Yaril from all national affairs? This isn't what you said you would do when I appointed you Diwan!"\n\n"I said that because I believed you would be a Yaril," Jakob replied coldly, unflinching. "But instead, you continue to work with 'reformists', antagonize loyal Chitali deer and try to bring Chital to the ground. If you are not going to rule properly, we will do it for you."\n\n"So is that how it is?"\n\n"It is how it has to be." His voice softened just a bit, perhaps in one last attempt to reach his nephew. "I do not intend to hurt anyone you love or to seize the throne. If there was another way, believe me, I would take it. You will understand someday."\n\nBenjen shook his head, an equal mixture of regret and anger. "If I ever understand why you are doing this, then I do not deserve to rule Chital anymore." Without another word, he turned and left the room, leaving the old vikingar alone as the sun set through the window and the lights slowly dimmed. For a moment he almost moved to follow, but instead remained where he stood, slowly lowering his head."

I still trust you to rule, Benjen, but it's clear you need a new council."\n\nThe yaril nodded, taking his filled glass and taking a sip. "I'm sure Hoversholm and Davirtannen would still be available to rejoin-"\n\n"They will be nowhere near it," his uncle interrupted firmly. "I meant loyal advisors, who serve the country first. They need to be willing to overrule you if necessary. Your reformism almost left the country on the brink of collapse, and now it's time for us to step in."\n\n"Oh." The two were silent, but for different reasons. Benjen from disappointment or perhaps shame, and Jakob because he simply had nothing to say. The latter finished off his own brandy before getting up.\n\n"Head up, Benjen. I'm sure you can be a great Yaril yet, as long as you have the right people to guide you. And I'm still here with you for every step of the way."\n\nBenjen nodded slowly."

chital.93.d:0 "Benjen Davirtannen circled the factory once more, his eyes glancing from machine to machine, worker to worker, all alike in one common purpose like cogs in a machine - focused, efficient, but almost unnatural. It had been the crowning ideal of the reign of Benjen IV to move into the Industrial Revolution as Equestria and the Griffonian Empire had, and it was the job of Davirtannen to make sure every one of Benjen IV's reforms actually functioned as intended. And work he did, every day, to make sure Benjen V did not have to bear the public relations nightmare of an industrial accident, machinery collapse or brutal injury to some young apprentice.\n\n"Each death for us is another tool for Bhushan to continue his anti-technological fury and continue to keep technology out of the south," Benjen IV had told him matter-of-factly when he originally appointed Davirtannen to his position as overseer of Ostkranbi industrial affairs decades ago, "One accident could cause a chain reaction that would tear the whole south apart in fury - a fury you know would be directed against us, and only us."\n\nThere was truth to that, Davirtannen knew. Although he could still not comprehend some of the sheer absurdity of the tactics of the jackals in the Chitali government, Benjen IV had taught him much about the court, lessons that would translate to his rise to more and more powerful positions during the reigns of the next two Yarils. Davirtannen could not shake off the feeling, as he walked, however, that he had made the wrong choices. That Jakob or Hira or even Hoversholm, his old ally, would someday devour him, and crush the old bureaucrat under the spirit of a new age of reform.\n\nIf there was anything he could do, it was to move on with his projects, make them as efficient as possible, innovate into electronics, industry, RADAR - to make himself so vital to the spirit of Benjen IV's modernizations that he would be more than a politician or an opportunistic reformer. Then, Davirtannen would triumph, and guide the Yaril through an age of wisdom and reason."

These were Jakob's words towards Pensha Rashanth and a group of Hindian loyalists as he appointed them to lead the campaign of promoting cultural unity and igniting patriotism in Chital. All so that the country can overcome its internal division and be ready for the upcoming war with Doelhi.\n\nDue to her background as a former Hindian thrall that was allowed to reach a high position under Olenian rule, Pensha was naturally selected to lead this campaign. Together with other Hindian loyalists, she promotes the qualities of Olenian religion and values, using herself as an example, while simultaneously emphasizing the view that all Chitali deer are not so different and should work for the same cause. \n\nThe campaign shows promise, with a lot of deer relating to Pensha and already feeling more patriotic towards Chital, but it remains to be seen how effective it will be. But if it's successful, all of Chital will be ready for a war with Doelhi, which will be the first step towards the unification of Hindia under Olenian values." #Mara for trainee

chital.95.d:0 ""I used to be like many of you, once," Pensha started, standing on a platform in front of a crowd of Hindian deer. Everydeer gathered in the city square of Mahorna had their eyes pointed at the general, ready to hear what she had to say. "I was born a thrall to a couple of Hindian deer, without many prospects for the future. My parents thought I would lead the same life as them, in poverty and doing mindless physical labour, but thankfully, it wouldn't be the case."\n\n"First, thanks to our late Yaril Benjen IV – may Ukko bless his soul – we were liberated from the shackles of thralldom. For the first time in decades, my family saw freedom again. I finally had the same chances as Olenians, and I wasn't going to squander this opportunity. I decided to join the army, and serve the Yaril who gave me this chance, and Chital as a whole."\n\n"It wasn't easy," Pensha continued, her voice becoming slightly softer and more gentle. "I faced a lot of hardships to get where I am now. I often wanted to give up and come back to my old life. However, before I made that mistake, I saw the truth in the Ukko's Patheon and the value of the teachings of the Olenian faith. Thanks to my faith, I managed to persevere!"\n\n"What I would like to take away, is that we are not so different overall. Remember, you have access to the same opportunities as me, and it's all up to you to reach for them I got where I am now thanks to the Olenian rule and their faith, without sacrificing who I am. I saw that the differences between Hindians and Olenians are not worth fighting over. We are all Chitali, and we are meant to fight against our common enemies together!" \n\nThe crowd erupted in ovations, as General Rashanth concluded her speech. Some deer in the crowd were still not convinced, thinking that Pensha's story was a one-in-a-million chance. However, even more, began to think that perhaps it wasn't impossible to follow her example and serve Chital the best they can." #Mara for trainee

chital.96.t:0 "Who Are We?"
chital.96.d:0 "With a great amount of trepidation in his heart, Ionur lightly trod in place upon the ground. He was not the only young buck in a similar position, as all around him were others of likewise age. They were fresh-faced and each seemed to have a familiar expression of outward exuberance and enthusiasm, however, it was tempered with natural anxiety. He, like the others here, had answered the summons that had been placed for those of the designated age to assemble at the nearest mustering location. Taking a moment to size up his contemporaries, Ionur mused that none of them had bags or equipment with them. He had been divested of everything he'd brought prior to this general mustering, as everyone else around him presumably had. A loud drum sounded once, twice, and all the youngsters quickly moved into a rough formation as they'd been quickly shown earlier. From a platform at the centre of the pavilion, a stag that was a well-known face came to view. It was Jakob the Grey in the flesh, and he seemed to be about to give a speech.\n\n"Stand tall, stand proud." He began, loudly orating for the assembled bucks. "You are assembled here today to enter into a great and noble accord, a contract to serve and protect this great nation. Beyond our borders, the slovenly Olenians wallow and neglect their once great heritage. It is our duty, our honour to stride forth and brings the error of their ways to the forefront." A short pause for breath.\n\n"In a few moments, you will head off in groups to begin your orientation, induction and basic training for your military service. You will treat your instructors with the greatest respect, as befitting those who truly venerate their ancestors. Be proud, all of you, for you serve in a noble tradition that those who have come before you have shared. We are Chitali! We are Sea-Kings!"\n\nTo the sound of stomping hooves, Jakob waved to the assembled mass and then retired. From all around Ionur and the other recruits, clearly experienced deer appeared and began to bark orders. There was no going back, but now a fire was lit in all their collective hearts." #Mara

Connections among the nobility needed to be maintained, after all, and there was no better place to make them than in the halls of Ostkranbi, surrounded by food and drink. Impeccably dressed, as befitting an event, does and stags laughed, got drunk, and perhaps even entertained a dance or two. The night was still young for them.\n\nAnd then he arrived.\n\nJakob and his officers, all in uniform strode into the room, the distaste for the event obvious. Eva quickly strode over to contain the situation; she was certain a few words could defuse whatever was coming. "Jakob, what brings you here," she asked. "I didn't think you one for these events."\n\n"Pack your things, you're leaving," he responded back, leaving the noble sputtering. "You are not welcome in Ostkranbi, helping the Yaril and opposing Chital. A train is already ready to take you and your entourage back to Gondeerana."\n\n"I... but..."\n\n"There will be no 'buts'. Now get out."\n\nAnd all across Ostkranbi, countless nobility found their once-untouchable positions crashing down upon them in one fell swoop. The court was gone, and Jakob was the one with the power now. And it would be the military, not the decadent nobles, who would lead."

chital.98.d:0 ""How dare you?!"\n\nThe door burst open and Benjen stormed in, the angriest any deer had seen him in a long time, perhaps even since his brother's death. Every deer in the court immediately froze, looking at the Yaril glaring daggers at his uncle, who similarly had a look of annoyance on his face. "You said no harm would come to my friends, and yet this is what you do? Banish Raili back to Equestria and imprison Katarina for sedition?!"\n\n"They were only seeking to use you, and this is not the time," Jakob answered firmly, ignoring Benjen's accusing outstretched hoof. "Now return to your quarters and we will discuss this later."\n\n"No, we will discuss this here and now!" the Yaril continued to press. "You can not just brand anyone who disagrees with you a traitor! Father would never have done half of what you want-"\n\nAt the mention of the late Benjen IV, Jakob the Grey, war veteran and Diwan of Chital, exploded. "My brother would be ashamed at what you've become!" he yelled back at his nephew, causing the latter to take a step back in shock. "Your brother Aatto died in service of Chital, and you spit on his death by promoting 'harmony' with the very deer who killed him! He was a Yaril who understood the value of tradition and legacy, and yet you do nothing but defile his own."\n\n"I... I..."\n\nJakob knew how difficult Aatto's death still was on Benjen, yet continued uncaring of the tears forming in the Yaril's eyes. "If any other of the Kudlinen line was here, they would tell you to do as you're told and have a fawn for Ukko's sake. Stop whining about losing what doesn't matter and think about your own legacy for once in your life. Now get. Out."\n\nAnd for once, the nephew heeded his uncle, wiping the tears as he galloped out of the court, the other deer present stunned into silence. Jakob sat back in his chair and let out a heavy sigh; with each passing day, the toll of the sacrifices he took for Chital grew more and more. But he had to keep going, if not for himself then for everything he had worked for, everything that would one day be written in the history books much as his ancestors were."

She had gone and disappeared without a trace as if she had never existed in the first place.\n\nJakob was not like most deer.\n\nIt was infuriating that she had gotten away, even with the death of Bhushan. Her lack of evidence wasn't a clean wipe of her influence, it was simply moving all her assets to Ukko knows where. Despite the death of Bhushan, the Axis still lived, and he needed someone new to help him track the remnants down. Fortunately, a specialist had arrived just in time.\n\n"Diwan." The Karkadanni horse bowed deeply to Jakob, showing his respects. "It would be an honour to serve a true soldier of Chital and aid in any way I can for your lofty goals."\n\n"Your loyalty will be proven in time," Jakob responded, still unsure at the foreigner. "What do you have to offer?"\n\nHe pulled out a massive file, filled and cluttered with various papers and images. "Five years of work. Everything I've gathered on the Axis and Hira Ramachan's schemes. She is now working with Marsha Gurat in Mahorna, seeking to overthrow Chital once again. Countless schemes against Benjen are coming to fruition over years of planning. Obstructionism of industry, attacks on garrisons, the communist plot in the south; all of it was her doing."\n\nThe old soldier was shocked at this information. Even more, was the question of where he even discovered such things. But there was no time to wonder or discover such motivations - if this was true, he had to act on it immediately. "Then we must move at once," he finally said. "With your help, Arad, we will end this menace once and for all, and bring true safety to Chital!"\n\n"Of course, Diwan.""

"We've searched and found multiple files linking the entire Axis to obstructing various projects in the South, intentionally forcing them to fail to make Ostkranbi look weak. It seemed that Hira was willing to go to any cost to force concessions from the Yaril."\n\nThey all nodded. "Hira was also sending military information to the rebels," another general said. "Giving away all our troop movements, leading them into ambushes or warning them into incoming attacks. Was it not for her, I doubt they'd have lasted long?"\n\n"They wouldn't have existed at all." A third deer slammed a file onto the table, pushing it over for Jakob to look at. "Arad was right; she was behind the whole communist plot the entire time. It started and was funded by her. The Yaril seemed to have caught a bit onto it, but even he did not find the full extensive support Hira gave."\n\nJakob nodded; this was good. While these plots were insidious, at least they could finally end with the inevitable death of Hira soon. "And what about you?" he asked the last stag present. "Do you have anything to report?"\n\n"Other than that Hira was behind that one time the Yaril got sick from eating the wrong dinner, no." Somedeer in the room snickered; the event had been rather humorous at the time, at least for some.\n\n"Then it's decided."

As he consolidated himself more and more, however, the writing on the wall was clear. Ivar frequently had nightmares of what could happen; himself tied up, being sacrificed in some elaborate viking ritual to the old Olenian gods, Jakob overseeing the entire event. So instead, he had quietly left Ostkranbi back to his home estate in Hamaholm and done not much else since. A few words of support to the country's economics and political system, and he hoped that eventually he would be forgotten about and this would all be over.\n\nThat idea was shattered with a rude awakening by the Chitali military.\n\nIvar opened the door to see the last deer he was hoping to even meet again leading the armed group. "Jakob!" he said, trying to put on a friendly face. "It's very good to see you again, what brings you to my estate?"\n\n"You're under arrest for conspiring against Chital and treason," he responded, his soldiers already moving to grab Ivar. "You've been implicated in multiple proxy wars orchestrated by Hira, and thus will stand trial. Your schemes are over."\n\n"I... but you..." the republican sputtered, trying to find a defence.

In the command tent, three deer stood looking over the maps on the table; Pensha Rashanth, Ieffri Huddarnen, and of course Jakob himself.\n\n"The Axis is cornered," Ieffri reported, pointing his hoof at various points on the map near Mahorna. "They have nowhere to run, and we've confirmed they're all that's left now.

There was still gunfire, of course, but countless Tuya and Chitali soldiers had given up their firearms to draw their war axes and charge headfirst into the fray. Jakob was right at the front, feeling the old rush of battle course through his veins.\n\nIt was a complete rout. Without Bhushan, the forces of the Tuya were disorganized and completely unready for an assault. Countless bodies were littered on the ground, blood soaking the grass and dirt. In fact, the entire affair was much faster than Jakob had anticipated; Hira and Marsha were already dead, and the battle seemed to be drawing to a close.\n\nWith a mighty swing of his waraxe, Jakob expertly parried a strike from a revolutionary before delivering a deep blow to the stag's shoulder, than turning to strike another fatal wound at the other deer who had just grabbed his weapon. It brought back old memories of his glory days, when he and his brother or even Aatto would be fighting side by side, bringing glory to Chital no matter where they went...\n\nJakob stumbled. One of his hind legs was weak, too weak. The tiredness had returned in full force; even the battle was not enough to keep him going anymore.

He was much younger, much happier, much more himself. He saw his brother, a deer he had not seen in a long time, and his wife. He saw Aatto, still a young stag, looking curiously at everything around him. It was his old family, everyone he had lost over the years, all the people that he had been forced to see taken from him one by one. But what did it mean?\n\nBut soon, he saw him. Benjen V, his nephew. The newborn is still blissfully unaware of the world around him. Jakob saw himself take the child in his hooves, hold him like he was his own child, saw his own self smile with his family as Aatto kept watching his younger brother and Benjen IV laughed at his brother going soft. Back when things were better, back when things made sense.\n\nThat was when it finally hit him. How could he be so blind? Benjen was his family, and he had gotten so caught up in saving Chital that he had neglected his own nephew. Benjen would always be Benjen, and he was the Yaril that Jakob, as his uncle, was supposed to guide and support, not control. It was not his son that Benjen IV and Aatto would be ashamed of, but himself.\n\nThings became brighter. The child Benjen stared at Jakob, the real Jakob, light coming from his eyes.

Out of the military council, he had been the one chosen by majority to follow in Jakob's hoofsteps. He was the very model of the Olenian of old; a proud viking from the rural traditionalist east, never shying away from force to get things done. Some called him brutal, others called him harsh, but few could not call him effective.\n\n"I am sure you will," Jakob replied, his pace slow with his ailing health. "It will be up to you to guide the Yaril as I have once I am gone."\n\nThe stag's smile turned almost wicked. "Of course, Jakob. I will make sure he stays on the right path, even if I have to force him on it."\n\nThe Diwan shook his head in warning. "Do not be too harsh with Benjen. He is still the Yaril, even if we had to put him on a different path. Only intervene when it is completely necessary. Is that understood?"\n\n"I-" Ieffri seemed to break for a second before composing himself again. "Of course, Jakob."\n\n"Good." Jakob stopped at a window and looked out at it wistfully, seeing the glowing rays of the sun over the horizon. "I've hurt Benjen too many times already. I just hope that the future is kinder to him than I have been.""

chital.107.d:0 "This group was certainly different from the old Council of Seven, that much was certain.\n\nOh, there were familiar faces of course. Eva was on it, ever the loyal pragmatist who would serve Benjen well, as well as a few prominent nobles that she and Jakob had hoof-picked as the best and most competent. What dominated the room, however, was the large number of ancient deer who now occupied it. Many older than even Jakob, they showed their age very visibly, the remnants of the supporters of his brother, Benjen IV. Kept on during Aatto's reign, they were now back, though some looked a fair bit lost.\n\n"Where is the Yaril?" one asked. "I must inform him of his brother's victory against the Sea-Kings!"\n\n"Forget that, he should know about the Republican Revolution on Griffonia!" another said.\n\nMore continued to spout complete nonsense, events from countless years ago that Jakob himself could barely remember. He could see Eva giving him a certain look, one that just questioned the insanity of it all, of placing these old loons in power with Benjen. What she did not understand was the point of them.\n\nJakob knew each and every one of them personally. He was sure that they would sign off on anything he wanted, and would act just as they would for Benjen IV or Aatto when advising the Yaril. But most importantly, they would serve his nephew resolutely. Loyalty and tradition were what was important, and these deer had it in spades... for what they were lacking in a few other areas."

chital.108.d:0 ""Nephew, we need to have a talk."\n\n"Don't we have one every day now?" Benjen asked with a bit of humour in his voice as he sat down, the fireplace in the room crackling and providing light to the room late at night. The moon was high over the sky; it was almost midnight.\n\nJakob leaned forward, focusing his attention on Benjen and forcing him to provide the same towards him. "You are the Yaril, and that means you have the duties that come with it. Just because I've assembled a loyal council for you and the reformists are gone from Ostkranbi does not mean you let them handle everything. Being the Yaril is not about pawning off power to others, it is about action. Legacy. Honour. Being a sea-king that deer can look up to, that they can accept and trust to protect them."\n\nBenjen rolled his eyes a bit, trying and failing to hide it from his uncle. "You've said this spiel a thousand times, uncle. Don't you think it's getting a bit old?"\n\n"I will stop when you finally understand what I am getting at!" Jakob replied, getting annoyed. "Benjen, like it or not, you are the Yaril. Not your father, and not your brother. It is up to you and you alone to carry their crown on your head, now that they are gone. You are your own Yaril, and you do not need to act like them, but can you at least make them proud? If not for yourself, then for me."\n\nThe Yaril remained silent. "I'll think about it," he finally responded, deep in contemplation.\n\n"That's all I ask.""

chital.109.t:0 "Slowing Down"
chital.109.d:0 "Benjen Davirtannen was in his office, writing yet another report to the Yaril about the affairs of the factories of Ostkranbi when he was approached by agents of Jakob the Grey, clad in military uniform. He could of course recognize Ieffri Huddarnen, one of his least favourite deer among the nobility - a backwards traditionalist with little respect for the Yaril he was supposed to serve by his own royalist principles. Among him was a diplomat of House Gadra - no doubt Sanjay, the young conservative rebel. Both misguided deer, dreaming of a world where they, the traditionalists, were the only clique capable of saving Chital, and where deer like Davirtannen and Ninessen were all crypto-marksists, traitors and radicals working from within to corrupt the Yaril. No doubt some on the left wished they were right, but Davirtannen was no radical Marksist.\n\n"Benjen," Sanjay Gadra smiled, glancing down at a paper stamped by the Yaril himself, "You are hereby relieved of your duties as chief executive officer of the Royal Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation and chief advisor to the Yaril on the matters of welfare and industry. By the.. er... orders of Diwan Jakob Kudlinen, and Benjen himself."\n\nA sour feeling came over Davirtannen, but he knew better than to resist an order from Jakob the Grey.\n\n"Of course, Mr Gadra," Davirtannen bowed, "I was glad I could serve my Yaril while I could. Do tell - will my industries themselves be nationalized?"\n\nGadra and Huddarnen glanced at each other with shock, as if they thought Benjen another Ninessen, ready to defend their harmonic beliefs in the face of any traitor. For Benjen Davirtannen, however, it was different.\n\n"Of course not, sir..." Gadra could not find the words to continue.\n\n"Good. Well, I shall be off then, as I still have factories to inspect among my own domain. For the glory of..." Benjen smirked, "Jakob the Grey and his loyal Yaril.""

chital.110.d:0 ""I think that's everything, sir. Un- unless you wish to see something in more detail, of course...!" Factory manager Rodfisk was trying his hardest to hide how nervous he was. Ieffri Huddarnen, who came to inspect his factory, had been almost completely silent for the past two hours, as he was being shown around. It was already hard not to be intimidated by the old Marshal's presence even when he wasn't judging all of your work and the value you bring to Chital.\n\n"No, it's alright. I've seen everything I wanted." Huddarnen didn't even glance at the stressed-out manager, instead looking at the deer workers below. They were mindlessly working to make new guns for the army; most of them didn't even notice the Marshal's visit. They were doing everything correctly, but they seemed lost in the monotony of their work and some looked even miserable. "Do you mind if I say something to the workers, Rodfisk?" \n\n"Wha-?" The manager's eyes widened in surprise. "No, sir... I mean, yes, sir! I mean... Do as you wish, sir!" \n\nThe Marshal already stopped listening to him. He cleared his throat. "Alright, listen up, everydeer! I'm usually not the one to give speeches, so I'll try to keep it quick and simple!" \n\nAll of the deer in the factory raised their eyes from their work and looked at Huddarnen, curious and attentive. \n\n"I've seen what you are doing here, and I have to say that I'm satisfied. However, from the lack of fervour in your work I've noticed that you seem to have forgotten why you are doing this at all. Remember, you are doing this all for Chital! Every weapon you make here is going to be used by our brave vikingur for the glory of our nation!" \n\nHe paused for a moment. He heard some enthusiastic shouts from among the workers. "Also, if any of you here are one of those who want these Ukko-forsaken "unions" or "worker benefits", just stop. A work for Chital should be a reward on its own for you! But if you really need anything material, just work harder and your dedication will be noticed. That is all! Now, get back to work!" \n\nHuddarnen stepped down and left the production hall, with still stressed-out Rodfisk following him. The deer immediately got back to work with newfound enthusiasm and dedication. While the speech wasn't objectively the best, it filled them with a desire to do the best they can for the glory of Chital." #Mara for trainee

chital.111.d:0 "Jakob rarely had time to visit the Ostkranbi docks ever since he had become Diwan. Not that he didn't want to; his love for the ocean was well-known, as was his skill on the seas. It was just that with all the work to be done in Chital, there was no time for such trivialities anymore. He was needed in the court, not out far away on a ship.\n\nAt least, most of the time. Today was different.\n\n"Thank you for personally testing the new ships, Diwan," Ieffri Huddarnen said as they made their way towards the newest part of the Chitali fleet, one of the smaller vessels already ready for launch. "Your personal expertise will be invaluable in making improvements to ensure our victories overseas."\n\nThe Diwan only grunted back, already looking at the ship with a pedantic eye. "There's too much weight towards the front," he said gruffly as they boarded. "Safety equipment should be closer to the doors. The lights need to be half a meter to the left."\n\nComment after comment, constant criticism was all he said as the sailors on board pushed off and the ship began its trip across the waters of the Hindian Sea. But as they picked up speed and the coastline of Chital slowly faded, so too did Jakob's annoyance. His stern face faded, leaving a deer that had not been seen in a long time. He remained at the front, feeling the wind and the sea spray and everything around him. Ieffri knew this would happen; there were two things Jakob liked, protecting the Yaril and the open seas. It was good for him to get out and enjoy himself once in a while, and he was just fine sitting back and letting the old deer stay in his element.\n\nIf only the trip could never end..."

chital.112.d:0 ""Peace in the east for only three days, and the Yaril is already ready to send me back to that horrible city once more," Jakob the Grey sighed and shook his head at the news, "Would that he would only tell me sooner as if I was not some mastiff to obey and watch as he let our country be subverted by sweet-talking idealists and power-hungry southrons."\n\n"Peace in the east? I would hardly call your mission anything but ceremonial, Jakob," his lieutenant, the young freed thrall turned officer Pensha Rashanth, turned and gave him a smile, "It's clear the Yaril cares little for your advice, and why would he? Too busy listening to - who's that new doe - Ninessen? They tried to hold me up as a progressive native officer once... ah, I remember how my disapproval to follow their every whim shook the Yaril's little clique..."\n\nJakob snorted and let out yet another sigh as the carriage bumped along the western road to Ostkranbi, his eyes glancing out the window to the open farms and plantations of Kanelimpra. "I have served in the courts of three Yarils, but our little nephew Ben seems more and more interested in disregarding my knowledge and lending his ears to weak-willed traitors," Jakob responded, "Progressives grow boldened and so does the Axis... would that he would take a lesson from his father and let me do what I do best. No doubt I would have all of them fired within days - at my nicest."\n\n"That kind of talk would get you nowhere with him, Jakob." Pensha gave a sigh of her own, "You are a dying breed in Ostkranbi, remember that. Your allies are all here, just waiting for you to strike - not that the vultures circling you are even remotely fit for advisory."\n\nJakob gave a grimace and turned his gaze from outside to himself. Haggard, frail, and tired - that was what the hero of Chital had been reduced to. He knew he was dying, but the doctors, filled with fantasies of brutal vikingar, had all been be too scared to give him the diagnosis. A shame, spending his last hours plotting and scheming, but if it could save Chital..."

For someone who was on the verge of losing everything for the second time in their life, Ivar looked rather calm; perhaps that first political kicking all those years ago had prepared him for the shock.\n\n"Eva, I understand where you're coming from, I do. You were the underdog, overlooked because you had no strong political alignment 'Eva would never make a play for control, she's too focused on the economy, but that just worked in your favour and allowed you to drop little hints and suggestions on all sides without drawing ire. Very clever all things considered, a campaign run like a well-oiled machine." He sipped his tea and gave her a genuine smile, a rare thing for Ivar. "I'm impressed truly."\n\n"Why thank you. Coming from someone with your skillset that means a lot." She smiled hiding her slight confusion at his relaxed attitude.\n\n"So yes, I'll be retaking my seat on the council as normal when it's all reshuffled, no need for a pay rise or anything, oh and I'll handle the industrial disputes when they arise, take them off your plate, you'll be much too busy running the country to deal with all that anymore.

She retorted, slightly insulted.\n\n"Look at the options. A mad monk, a malicious plotter, a power-craving craven, a deluded Idealist. That just leaves you, me, and Benjen.

She rolled her eyes. "I'm not blind to the ways of the world Jakob, Chital will always need an army and no one has their hooves deeper in the army than you. I could start ripping apart your influence bit by bit but neither of us wants that. I have a country to build, and you'll have an army to train. It is best if we just accept these facts and get on with it."\n\n"Agreed, but I reserve the right to implement some military reforms. We've stagnated for too long under Benjen.""

The other 8 members stood in judgement of him, and their attitudes ranged from sympathy to delighted revenge. Jakob did not attempt to hide his pleasure at the proceedings, grinning from ear to ear whilst Hira had the decency to look guilty.\n\n"Bhushan." Benjen began, Eva, standing to his right. "You have been brought before the council to answer for your crime. Treason. The organisation of an attempted communist coup." He gestured to documents on the table before him. Everyone in the room knew Hira had been the one behind the coup but she was too important to be removed, so the blame had fallen - after some slight edits to some reports - on the monk with an armed cult.\n\nFor his part Bhushan knew which way the wind was blowing and would not lose any dignity over it. "I will not give up my principles."\n\n"That's the problem." Eva put in. "Your principles are our precipice. Your refusal to give any ground or acquiesce on any point has led us here. There are two ways to deal with a problem, work around it or remove it and you have made that choice yourself." She looked away, annoyed that they'd been forced into this position.\n\n"Eh, yes quite." Benjen continued. "The Treason. As you have offered no defence you are hereby stripped of your titles, lands, and position of this council henceforth. Andreas, please escort him from the chamber." The General turned advisor nodded and, placing a hoof on his shoulder, led the deer out of the chamber.\n\nBhushan left the hall, his head held high."

It was important to demonstrate to the nation that a new Chital was on the rise; it needed to be public, it needed to be inclusive, and it needed to demonstrate prosperity.\n\nThe Yaril's marble long-hall was filled with nobles from the length and breadth of Chital; Hindians and Olenians in all their regalia. Banners hung between the pillars, one for each of the provinces bearing the crest of the regions. The scent of cooking from the banquet hall drifted through the air making more than one guest keen to get the whole thing over with.\n\nUpon the stairs of the dais - just before his throne - stood Benjen in his full-dress uniform, cutting a semi-impressive figure as the head of state. It was slightly undercut by Eva who drew all attention in the hall as she processed towards the Yaril, wearing a gown which wove the orange and greens of Hindia with the pale blues and whites of Olenian, a living symbol of unity with her head held high cutting a figure of leadership with grace. The gathered officials watched with rapt attention, for many this was the fulfilment of a dream; a Hindian deer taking her place as she approached the Yaril. She stopped at the foot of the dais and briefly bowed low to him; Benjen lifted the badge of office and fastened it to her sash.\n\n"Eva Pillai, I grant you the position as head of the council of Chital.

No one had seen or heard from the Yaril that whole time, and no decrees came out of the white tower to instruct the rulership of the realm. Guards never before seen guarded the doors, and the city was effectively on lockdown. Everydeer was suspicious and frighted until Hoversholm emerged from the council chambers. Everyone had awaited this briefing, it would tell them what the Tartarus was going on in their nation, and the council must have some answers. But what emerged was not the council as a whole; it was just Ivar himself, dressed in his signature loose suit and glasses, looking sombre as none had seen him before.\n\nStepping to a podium before the assembled reporters, he began to speak, "My dear countrydeer. A great tragedy has befallen this nation. During the Royal Progress two days ago, our Yaril Benjen was kidnapped and killed by far-right, reactionary generals, including General Huddarnen. Since then, national soldiers have had the city on lockdown to search for clues, and I apologize for waiting this long to inform you all. We needed all the evidence first. And from that search, we can also place incriminating evidence on another figure, Jakob the Grey for participating in the plot." At this, the crowd gasped, while before they had been silent in shock now, they were outraged. The ancient advisor betraying the Yaril?! Many were confused, but many more seethed with anger. Ivar continued, "Due to the collaboration of the nobles in this plot, it has been decided we will be postponing the coronation of a successor until further notice, and I will be assuming the title of Kansleri of Chital. I would like to ask you to postpone asking any further questions, for I must take my time to grieve. Benjen was a close friend of mine, and I must now make my peace as well."\n\nIvar exited the stage as the crowd erupted in shock and rage at what he had told them, republican chants began to rise amongst them as reporters rushed to get the story to the presses and broadcast it all over Chital.\n\nWalking back into the council chambers, Ivar Hoversholm sighed and said to himself, "Sorry old friend.

But he knew he would never see that city again, or at least not for many years. Opening the paper in front of him, he read the headline, "Yaril Benjen dead! Jakob the Grey and Noble Generals Implicated!" And smack in the middle of the page, a picture of Ivar Hoversholm, the new Great Kansleri. The deer scoffed; this was the respect he got then. I guess this is what he got for doing what he thought was right.\n\nLooking down from his porch, he could see one of the guards, red and blue insignia on his shoulder—the flag of the new Confederation. The door beside him opened, and his wife emerged. At least now, they were able to be married—the stress of rulership off his shoulders.\n\n"Do you need some more dear?" she asked. He replied with a soft voice, "No, my rose, I still have enough. I haven't been able to drink much with all that is going on." "Would you like to talk about it?" she responded. The deer laughed, "You know I've already said plenty. But it's all the same, I guess. I just feel uncertain. This nation was supposed to be under my care. But here it is, under his." The doe frowned, "But you trust him, do you not? Try to think about the best in things!"\n\nBenjen smiled.

The royal progress had been a resounding success and the enthusiasm for the Yaril had grown significantly. Now was the right moment for a grand public display, a second coronation for Benjen to reflect the new nation Chital was becoming. Andreas had planned out the route for the procession through Ostkranbi in the royal carriage followed by the honour guard of the Royal Grenadeers. The coronation would take place in the White Tower and be broadcast by radio to the country; it would secular to avoid any awkwardness about religion but with flairs of Hindian and Olenian culture. Nobles from all over would come and make a big show of coming. Then the Yaril would be presented to the nation from the balcony of the White Tower to the nation.\n\nBenjen was, understandably, not happy about this plan but as Eva had explained "Whether you like it or not you are a symbol to Chital and it's time that symbol was something the nation as a whole could support."\n\nSmiling as her tailor adjusted her dress Eva let the plan play through her mind again."

He hadn't been too happy, but he understood - as Benjen had - that Chital needed this marriage to bring together the deer and start to heal the old divisions.\n\nAcross the room Benjen fussed over Ruusu. She'd put a brave face on things, seeing her love married to another doe couldn't be easy. "Don't worry," Eva called, gaining their attention as she crossed the room to the couple.

Throughout the building security officers received word and stormed the offices of nobles, collecting every scrap of paperwork they could find. Those nobles unfortunate enough to be in their office were read the bill and dragged from the building.\n\nThis was the largest seizure of land since the invasion hundreds of years ago. Fully half of the nobility would lose their holdings and be stripped of their titles and positions to be left to fend for themselves. Fortunately, there was little they could do about it as all the useful nobles who could organise a resistance were to keep their lands.\n\nThose that remained would be organised into advisory committees specialising in science, industry, cultural development and more, the more qualified of them holding more senior positions.

There was sporadic gunfire as they advanced but most were taken prisoner before they had a chance to arm themselves. Any quick enough to grab a gun were shot where they stood with no offer of surrender. The prisoners were tied up and dumped together in the centre of the temple.\n\nThis was not Eva's first choice, but Jakob had pleaded his case effectively. When dealing with an armed group of militarist monks it was best to handle them quickly and precisely even if she'd have preferred to negotiate.\n\nBhushan was the only one offered quarter, dragged by the antlers from one of the temple rooms, bleeding from several slashing wounds where he'd put up a fight. All told around 150 monks had been captured alive and throughout the south, similar dawn raids were taking place.\n\n"Nice to see you again Bhushan." The former councillor spat blood at the soldier's feet.\n\n"Just get it over with Jakob, if you're going to kill me then kill me." Bhushan snarled.\n\n"Kill you? We're not the savages you seem to think we are Bhushan. No, you will be put on trial as the head of an illegal terrorist organisation and serve your time in prison.

They were shown into a small room lit by candles with the scent of incense heavy in the air.\n\n"Hira, so you're Eva's lapdog now?" Bhushan greeted her. "I had hoped you were dead, pity. Wishful thinking perhaps." He sat on his haunches by a small alter.\n\n"Bhushan." She pushed down the insult and set her mind to the task at hoof. "You know why I'm here. You need to disarm the Tuya."\n\n"And why should I do that? Let me guess if we don't disarm Jakob will come down here and force us to disarm. We both know how that ends."\n\n"I know you are prepared to die for your faith, but are you prepared to live for it?" Bhushan raised a curious eyebrow at her question. "If you voluntarily give up your arms the Tuya will be recognised as an official religious order and allowed to continue their practices, free from interference. The state does not want to wipe out your faith, it just doesn't want armed organisations running around in the jungles."\n\n"What proof have you of this claim? What's to stop you wiping us out once you've taken our guns?" If Eva wanted his trust, she should have picked a better messenger than the doe who'd stabbed him in the back. Hira produced a scroll from her saddle bag.\n\n"Here is a draft of the bill recognising the minority faiths in the state, yours amongst them, it's currently going through a review and just needs Eva's stamp of office. This is all publicly available; you can check it yourself in the council minutes. When you give up the guns, she'll sign it." She passed him the scroll. Read through the bill he confirmed it was all in order. The choice was his, give up the guns or have the Tuya wiped off the face of the earth. Not much of a choice at all."

There were very few railways to speak of and the roads, water supplies and electricity lines were clustered around the coast, very few of them extending inland, much as they're feared.\n\n"This isn't going to be easy, is it?" Caarlit asked over his shoulder, the councillor had been assigned to help and keep tabs on the former axis member.\n\n"What gives you that impression? All we've got to do is industrialise a nation that's a good 70% jungle, 50% is without electricity and 40% doesn't have piped water." He sighed, picking up a quill as he began to make a list. "If we're going to do this, we'll have to bring each province up to the same standard before installing more advanced projects."\n\n"Sensible. It saves areas getting left behind and deer moving for better amenities."\n\n"It'll also be very popular with the deer in the outer provinces, build up our support a bit. We'll start by making sure the whole country has access to water, then power, and then we'll look at expanding the rail networks and roads. In the long run, it'll make Chital easier to industrialise as all the infrastructure will already be there when it comes time to build new factories.

Andreas added, a tone of annoyance creeping in. He'd been asked to make sure that Davirtannen didn't lose sight of the nation as a whole and it was a tougher battle than he'd expected.\n\n"Ahh, good point, well you tell me where the bases are and I'll draw up a plan for connecting them to the train hubs, best of both worlds."\n\nIt was a solid plan, focusing on key areas would mean they could expand quicker, saving time overall; the only problem was it didn't account for a lot of civilian infrastructures; large sections of the country would just have to develop on their own when issues arose. It would turn the cities into economic powerhouses and leave the countryside behind but you can't build an economy without treading on a few toes. Besides, those deer who wanted a better life could always move to the city which would bring in more workers, a win-win really, provided you weren't a farmer."

For that was what he was now; Chital was his and Hindia lay ready to be reclaimed. Already the tainted of Olenia were fleeing the country en masse, their places in the cities being taken by Hindians. The lost were not without hope though, a few Olenians had begun to approach the monks of the Tuya, curious of their faith and this talk of salvation. There was a chance for these souls and - by Mahimata's grace - they may yet be saved and restored.\n\nThis is only the beginning, Goddess be praised. Mahimata raised him up to save his herd, the faithful making pilgrimages from all over Hindia just to see him, he would not let them down and he would not stop till all deer had been saved and returned to the mother's embrace."

Now Hira knelt next to Bhushan as the Sann-aiasi daubed her forehead with red powder, the temple filled with the Tuya and whatever ordinary Hindians had managed to get a seat.\n\n"May the Goddess guide your hooves in all your actions." The Sann-aiasi intoned before her as he laid a wreath of pale flowers over her antlers about her neck. Turning to Bhushan he began the same ritual with him as she bowed her head and pressed her forehead to the floor. This was going far beyond what she'd signed up for. During the takeover, she'd somehow found herself siding with Bhushan and once the fighting had started it was impossible to stop it; she had completely lost control of the situation. Bhushan's warrior monks had seized all major cities and all she could do was watch as he began to rebuild the country in his image.\n\nThis Diarchy was a sham; she knew it just as much as he did. He could have her removed at any time despite her contacts but with the careful pulling of threads, she might still have some influence to call on. She knew what his faith would lead him to attempt, the rites, the divisions in society that would come; Chital - and by extension Hindia - stood on a precipice.\n\nAs for the rest of the council she had yet to hear anything tangible. Eva and Ivar were being held under house arrest, Jakob had been dealt with and she had no idea about Davirtannen. Despite their disputes, she hoped they'd be ok, things of the past though they were.\n\n"May the Goddess guide your hooves in all your actions." The Sann-aiasi finished as Bhushan placed his head on the floor next to her, glancing sidelong at her."

chital.130.d:0 "The furniture was arranged in a large pile outside the White Tower, flames from the bonfire rising high as a desk was tossed on. Bhushan watched on as another Olenian noble was dragged from the building toward the waiting truck, his jewellery confiscated, and his clothes cast onto the fire as he joined his fellow former nobles. Bhushan offered each of them redemption, the last courtesy afforded to everyone. Their reaction varied between outraged, dejected, denial and sobbing.\n\nTwo took the offer, they were placed in another truck with the Hindian nobles who were treated slightly better, allowed to keep their dignity, they'd be held until a decision could be made about their future. Their Olenian counterparts were being sent straight to the docks, put on a ship and sent to Olenia and whatever fate awaited them there, it didn't matter they weren't his problem anymore.\n\nThe tower itself - That ancient symbol of their oppression - would be demolished and the materials used to build a temple to Mahimata on the site, a fitting tribute to her authority, the highest authority in Hindia and a fine example of the changes that were going to take place throughout the whole country.\n\nFinally, the deer he sought was dragged from the tower. Jakob was bleeding heavily and missing an antler, the old soldier had not come quietly. The monks dragging him threw him to the ground at Bhushan's hooves. The Raja looked down on him. Jakob's eyes held nothing but hatred and determination, he would not insult the soldier's honour by offering a redemption he wouldn't take. Jakob hauled himself to his hooves, aware of what was coming but too broken to fight anymore. He would die with his dignity if nothing else. Nothing needed to be said as Bhushan drew his Kukri and placed the tip on Jakob's throat, out of respect for a fellow warrior he would make it quick. With one swift thrust, he drove the blade through Jakob's neck.\n\nJakob spat blood on Bhushan's face, his eyes holding the Raja's to the last."

Bhushan was no fool, he knew that a nation can't be governed if it doesn't want to be. He had the army and the infrastructure but to make the takeover complete he needed to pull the common deer to his side.\n\nThe murmurs went through the streets and slums in every city. Runners pass scrolls to the gang leaders and local figureheads. The message? "Bhushan calls. Take back your lives." A rallying cry they'd been for generations to hear. That night, when the protestors and supporters of the council took to the streets they were met by the dispossessed, the oppressed masses rising to meet them. Confused, a few thought these downtrodden deer were coming to join them and went to greet their new allies. They were the first to be beaten.\n\nAll over the country the protests turned into a rout. The oppressed outnumbered the well-off four to one and - fighting with the desperation of deer given hope - they drove the supporters of the council from their streets. The redistribution of wealth was swift as many deer were pursued to their homes, their doors smashed in, and possessions seized. The night was not without its casualties. Many deer were cowed, beaten and more than one lost their lives as the fighting spread, generations of anger finding an outlet in "The Night of Retribution.""

When Mahimata made deer, she made us perfect and peaceful but the gods of Olenia, jealous of her ability to create, stole some deer away and twisted their souls into aggressive and savage forms. To protect us she cast those deer across the ocean but, at their god's behest, they returned; the rest is history. She has not given up on them, those who accept her forgiveness shall be reborn into her grace and I shall never stop trying to save those who wish to be saved." His heart was heavy as he spoke, so many refused, so many had to be cast out.\n\n"Our nation was lost by the schemes of the past. We were not prepared for the tricks of the sea devils. We were a trusting nation; a kind nation and they took advantage of that. Never again will we make that mistake. Time forged our trust into determination, our kindness into a Kukri to be wielded and with it, we hacked our way free of them. Loyalty and duty to Hindia and the refusal to give in are what will keep us safe, so stay true to Hindia and hold it in your heart." He glanced out of the window at Ostkranbi and the hills beyond it. Perfection.\n\n"The Goddess is third and ultimate. Our herd is as she blessed us to be. Our nation is as she shaped us to be. It is from her that all is given. To deny her is to dishonour the very soul of everything we are, were and could ever be. She loves all deer but Hindian - who have remained true and pure - hold a special place in her heart so hold her in ours, as the foal loves the doe."

It wasn't the lessons - he quite liked learning how to read and add - or even the teachers - he liked Miss Laghari, she was kind and knew lots of interesting things about birds - the problem was a fawn by the name of Olaf.\n\nFor the last 4 months Olaf had been making the Hunar miserable. Two years above him, Olaf used every opportunity to call him names, trip him up, knock the books out of his hooves and general make his life unpleasant. The walk every morning was defined by the fear of what Olaf would do that day. "Will he steal my lunch money? Will he hide my books? Will he hit me? I don't want to go to school."\n\nAs he approached the gates and raised his head for the first time, he realised something wasn't right, there were fewer fawns around than yesterday, maybe some of them were sick or had mane-lice. Making his way into the building Hunar headed to Miss Laghari's classroom.\n\n"Good morning, Hunar." She greeted him with a smile.\n"Morning Miss Laghari. Where is everydeer?" He asked quietly, noting that half the chairs in the classroom were empty.\n"Well class." She addressed the room as Hunar took his seat. "There's been a bit of a change. You see the Raja." She inclined her head in respect. "Has decided that those with an Olenian parent are going to be sent to a separate school so that the school's resources aren't wasted on them. All of our time can now be focused on you and not taken up by those who don't deserve it." She smiled warmly.\n\nHunar put up his hoof.

This was a moment for solemn celebration for they were to be reborn through the Rite of Cleansing. They knew what to expect and they showed little fear save the odd shiver and shuddered breath.\n\nThey had been bathed, anointed with sacred oils, and dressed in white linen robes; their bodies made ready as their souls had been. They had learned the ancient truth, the corruption that had befallen their ancestors when the Olenian gods had cursed them, made them less than their Hindian cousins and stolen them away from the goddess's embrace. When they had learned what they were the five Olenians had been disgusted, ashamed and lost. That was when their guides, the holy monks of the Tuya - Sann-aiasi - had offered them the path to redemption. Through the rite their souls would be delivered to Mahimata and, through her grace, they would be cleansed and reborn as pure Hindians.\n\nThey had even been honoured by the Raja's presence for the ceremony, keen to see the first of the converts to take this step, his usual cold demeanour broken by a warm smile, today five souls would be returned to the goddess, the first five of many. He took up his position before the first convert, a young deer of no more than 20 years, hope shining through the fear in his eyes. Bhushan bowed and touched his forehead to the deer's.\n\n"She waits for you, will you go to her?"\n\n"I will go." He replied softly, closing his eyes as the Raja slipped the blessed kukri through the convert's ribs and into his heart. He gasped for a moment as the light slipped from his eyes and he was gone, gone to Mahimata. By the time the sun rose tomorrow his soul would be cleansed and reborn somewhere in Chital, a pure Hindian.

It had been a minor delay but enough to put the captain on edge, he longed for the roll of the waves and the smell of the salt. Crossing the deck, he leaned on the ship's railing and looked out over the Ostkranbi docks. It had been years since he'd seen it this busy but under the new Raja, life was returning to the city. He'd heard word whilst in Colthage that Bhushan, Raja of Chital needed ships.\n\nTrading vessels, private military ships and even one luxury yacht had arrived to take up the task; the expulsion of the Godi from all of Chital. How simple it would have been to drive them over the border and be done with it, but this was about more than getting rid of them, it was about sending a message. They were to be sent to Olenia, back to the icy wasteland they came from and when they arrived, they were to tell the deer there; Chital is free and you are not welcome.\n\nThere were several thousand of the Olenian priests that needed transport and the journey would be long and difficult, crossing the ocean and approaching Equus from the west. The money was there for anyone willing to attempt it and that promise more than anything had brought many a brave captain. The Raja knew there was a good chance a ship wouldn't make it, hence he hired foreign crews to attempt it and save risking the lives of his navy.\n\nThe captain sighed, he knew the risks having crossed the ocean once before and losing a leg in the process, but if he could do it again then the money he'd make would be enough to retire on, set up a little bar on the harbour in Baltimore maybe. His hold had been emptied, the basic supplies for 200 deer loaded on board, and now he just had to wait for the trucks to arrive with their living cargo. Perhaps a few hundred Godi praying in the hold would calm the storms and keep the creatures that dwelt below the waves at bay, smoothing their passage; or maybe they'd just do their funeral rights on the way to the bottom."

The entire palace would smell of incense and ring with quiet prayers at all hours, a fitting tribute to the goddess who made it possible.\n\nIt would be grand and impressive in its scale and function but the decoration simple, humble even. Here was to be found no gold trim, no silk banners, the Raja did not need such things, the money that would buy them went into paying advisors and scholars and from all over Hindia and beyond, they would all come and pay him homage and tribute in the mighty halls of his new home."

The Hindian Confederation had graciously agreed to come to the talks which itself was a sign of progress, given the recent building tensions we had prepared for a rejection of our offer.\n\nThe main subject of discussion was of course the unification of Hindia. There was no point tiptoeing around the subject. They made the case that they should be the ones to unify the continent due to their superior population numbers. We countered that our industry was closer to a modern state than theirs and would be able to provide the economic support that such a union would require.\n\nThese two viewpoints are very difficult to argue around without resulting to base comparisons and national bravado. One wrong word here or ill-conceived comparison there and these peaceful negotiations would turn very violent very quickly."

The future of a united Hindia has just taken one massive leap forward with the conclusion of the Stagataka summit."

chital.147.d:0 "The Stagataka conference has ended in disaster. Exactly what we feared would happen has come to pass. During a discussion about the shared cultural history of our nations, the Hindian Confederation's ambassador took a throwaway comment about cooking and blew it out of all proportions, claiming we had insulted their history and culture. Things quickly escalated when they claimed that we weren't fit to annex a dung pile let alone Hindia.\n\nThe summit descended into a brawl with tables flipped and stags rutting on all sides.

The final ratification of the constitution was complete and the country now had a governing body it could trust and rely on; the final signature on the constitution hailing the future of a free nation.\n\nThe Republican party had become the only recognised political party in the country. True this had alarmed some, to begin with, but once he had explained his reasoning it all made sense. Only those who hold to the ideals of freedom and democracy could be allowed to govern the nation, lest it slips back into stagnation. By having only one party and ensuring that members of that party relied upon supporting these beliefs the future liberties of every citizen were guaranteed: a small sacrifice of choice for the betterment of the nation.\n\nFurther there was no need for any such concept as party loyalty. Once within the party, a member was free to vote in any way they chose, in support or against whatever motion was being presented. This made it more of a loose group of independents rather than one solid party, there was no shortage of opinions that's for sure.\n\nPleased with his work, Ivar leaned back and relaxed, another stepping stone on the road to a bright future."

chital.152.d:0 ""And that is why you should support the National party." Ivar watched on from the sidelines as Magne left the hastily erected stage. He'd heard about this new National party, lots of bluster and a grassroots movement that built its following on "A united culture." United in the sense that it excluded anydeer they didn't like of course. They were a unique new party with the unique policy of hating Hindians and the rich, be they rich Hindians or rich Olenians. A nice broad spectrum of hate; nice and inclusive.\n\n"Nice speech." Ivar greeted Magne. "Lots of noise, very little message, you'd fit in with a lot of other politicians I know."\n\n"I'm not just some politician, I speak from the heart and represent the suppressed masses." Magne turned and gestured to the smattering of a few dozen deer who'd turned out to hear the speech.\n\n"Yes, of course, you're the voice of the common deer, just like everyone else." Ivar rolled his eyes. "I'd been informed of your National Party, heard you had a few emerging members around the country, thought I'd come down and have a look at it's all about, first hoof you know. I'm glad to see I'm not disappointed, it's everything I expected."\n\n"I'm glad to hear there'll be no hard feelings when we take a few seats from your Republican party." Magne grinned. Ivar smirked and turned to depart, shaking his head as he went."

chital.153.t:0 "Disestablishment At All Costs"
chital.153.d:0 "To be impartial is a difficult road to tread. Favouring one faction alienates another but being impartial can alienate both. The only sure way to follow the middle ground is to wipe the slate clean. When the moment came to decide which of the two main religions would become the new official state religion Ivar had picked the third option; Secularism. For arguably the first time in its history Chital would be a nation free from the grip of superstition, he just had to deal with the stumbling blocks.\n\nThe dismantling of the Tuya came first; with their membership being mostly armed religious fanatics things could go very badly. Fortunately, they only went quite badly. As the local forces moved in to arrest Bhushan and dismantle the Tuya the old councillor decided he did not want to go quietly and instructed his saint soldiers to open fire. Knowing this was a possibility, the army had stationed a few snipers on the outskirts of the temple complex. When the shooting started, Bhushan was among the first to fall, and the rest of the Tuya quickly collapsed into chaos. The survivors were rounded up and it was the same story at temples up and down the country.\n\nThe Godi was another issue. Konnar and his Olenian mystics - while not armed - were politically connected and still had some pull amongst the nobility. The first step was severing these ties by revoking most of the Godi's lands and returning them to the state. Without the income these lands provided, they would become reliant on donations. Secondly, the Godi would be barred from holding any public office other than their role within their faith. Konnar was no fool though, he saw what was coming and agreed to give up his position and influence in exchange for no further action against the Godi. A smart stag even till the end.\n\nWith these two power blocks removed Ivar could finally breathe easy, free from troublesome priests."
chital.153.a:0 "Necessary sacrifices."

chital.154.t:0 "In the Den of the Tuya"
chital.154.d:0 "The incense was heavy in the air and more than once Ivar sneezed, interrupting his flow as he tried to make his point clear. The stares of the Sann-aiasi - the priests of Mahimata - arrayed before him were intimidated but more than them, Bhushan's gaze was cold, hard and unyielding.\n\n"The Godi are too fixed in their power structures and landholdings to ever provide a real spiritual outlet to the deer of Hindia. They talk round and round in circles without saying anything. When you put on top of that most deer in Hindia are Hindian it means that they will be serving a small group and serving them badly." Ivar paused, giving Bhushan a chance to interject but the monk just stared at him and said nothing.\n"Eh..." Ivar fidgeted a little before continuing. "The Tuya are in a prime position to take over the role of providing religious functions for the nation. They are Hindian, locally known in the many regions they occupy and trusted by the common deer to be respectful and take care of their needs. There's also a lot of you so you'd be able to deal with our growing population." Again, he paused to allow Bhushan to speak. Again, nothing.\n\n"I... Bhushan I know we had our disagreements in the past but I want you to know that I always respected you, regardless of how we might have parted ways recently. You have built up something truly worthwhile here and I think it could be of great service to the nation." At that Bhushan snorted, at last, a sign of life.\n\n"Ivar, listen carefully." The monk grumbled. Ivar leaned forward a little. "I hate you. All you have said means nothing to me. Mahimata is the one Goddess of Hindia and we will reach out to the herd, just don't get in our way.""

chital.155.d:0 "Despite our conquest of the region of Llambet, it is clear that direct occupation of the llamas is unsustainable. After all, we are two very different races, with our own cultures, ways of life, and national identities. An autonomous protectorate has already been chosen and headed majority by local llamas willing to work with us in a new government, and it seems that the transition to a loyal state with a future long friendship with Hindia is assured.\n\nHowever, we are left with one decision to make. Even though the administration is local, the protectorate needs a protector. A deer, one from Hindia who can be trusted to lead well and in the interests of both Hindia and Llambet. Somedeer loyal, trusted, and above all, competent. Fortunately, we do have quite a few options to choose from, as our court has bred many a doe and stag who is fit for the job. The question now is, who do we nominate to lead our new autonomous subject state?"
chital.155.a:0 "Elik Baronnen, the bureaucrat."

chital.156.t:0 "Hindia Demands Uusi Hirvimaa!"
chital.156.d:0 "Years ago, our government chose to occupy and create a local protectorate over the island of Uusi Hirvimaa, despite the local population being majority deer, to protect local shipping and our fleet from raids coming from the island. With the mainland so fragmented, there were general objections from the natives, but we were left largely unopposed in administrating the territory. Now, however, it seems that it may have come back to bite us. The Hindians, finally united under a single government, have come to us with a simple demand; claw over the island, or risk war. It carries much historical significance to their race, and denial is not an agreeable option to them. Only direct ownership will suffice.\n\nMany within our nation do not wish for this war. The Protectorate was meant to mainly be a temporary measure, anyway, and the local deer wish to reunite with their mainland brethren much more than they want to remain under our rule. However, international politics are complicated, and it is quite possible that giving over this island may not be the end of their aggression against us. But if we refuse... we can say goodbye to any chance of friendship with the Hindians."

chital.158.d:0 "The Macawians, the greedy and oppressive harpies they are, have completely refused our demand of Uusi Hirvimaa.

chital.161.d:0 ""This is so nice." Brienna sighed, relaxing into the steaming waters of the spa.\n"Agreed. It's nice to get away from it all for a day, just relax and not think about paperwork for a change." Hira agreed, the cucumber slices and facemask hiding her expression.\n\n"umm... I was hoping to talk to you about that." She shifted nervously in the water as Hira removed one slice from her eye, raising an eyebrow. "I know you said that my position was there for enjoying but I can't help thinking I should be doing more. You know, like my charity work but more official. Ever since that ambassador's dinner it's been playing on my mind, wha... what do you think?" She looked down at the water, her hooves fidgeting beneath the surface.\n\nHira turned to face her, the remaining cucumber slice falling into the water. Regarding Brienna's fidgeting, she thought over their time together. Originally just intended as a puppet she'd grown quite fond of the doe. In the quiet moments they spent together she'd noticed hidden confidence just below the surface. Brienna had the very real desire to make Hindia a better place and had set up several charities on her own to do just that; the idea of releasing some control of the country back to the Yarila, in truth frightened Hira, she had things just the way she wanted them but then... what if there was a chance that Brienna would grow into the Yarila Chital could be proud of, she should take it right? All she need was a helpinghoof and some moral support.\n\n"I think... I think that's a great idea." Hira smiled warmly. Brienna's head shot up, disbelief shining in her eyes. "you're more than capable of rising to the challenge."\n"Oh thank you thank you!" She jumped at Hira, wrapping her in a tight hug and splashing water everywhere."

chital.1611.d:0 "The shouting and jeering in the street went on despite the soldier's attempts to maintain order, the crowds of angry deer pressing against the hastily erect cordons. One by one a line of deer were led from their houses under guard and forced into the back of the waiting trucks; fear, shock and misery filling out each seat as the soldiers struggled to protect them from the crowds.\n\nThese deer were the enemies of the state, the weakness at its heart that needed to be expunged. Madame Hira had sent her forces to dig out these foreign agents and subversives; it was no secret, the cleansings had been announced on the radio, it was for the public good so of course, it was public knowledge.\n\nThe only downside was the mobs that had come out to rip these subversives to pieces. The state was firm but it was not a monster, these deer would have trials and serve their time when inevitably found guilty for whatever crimes were needed but to leave them to the crowds of fanatics would be a death sentence and a rather gruesome one at that.\n\nIt was not totally unexpected, after all, Madame Hira had saved their nation from the depredations of Benjen and Brienna - under Hira's guidance - was rebuilding the nation into a fairer, freer society so, of course, her supporters had come out in force to show her just how far they were willing to go. These little roadblocks along the way just needed to be cleared and once it was done everydeer would be happier. Well, everydeer that was left."

chital.1612.t:0 "A Mother's Love"
chital.1612.d:0 "The art of democracy was not something that came easy to the deer of Hindia. Centuries of living with Yarils and Yarilas had rendered the idea of having a say in government ridiculous, that's what the nobles were for, the common deer were there to work. The Moral Affair had shaken that idea; overnight the noble class went from enlightened rulers to corrupt fools and suddenly the idea of choosing their leaders by vote did not seem so strange.\n\nHira stepped up to the booth and set the ballet paper before her. This was it, the first time in Chital's history that a democratic vote would be cast to decide the future. All over the country deer would be joining her in their first real taste of democracy voting for their local representative who would then form the newly expanded council. Yarila Brienna would remain as the head of state of course with Madame Hira as the president of the council keeping a watchful eye on things to ensure the newfound freedoms weren't abused.\n\nThis one action would cement her in Chital history as the great reformer, bringing freedom to her herd and nodeer would be able to question her motives from this day forward. After all, she had done more to lift the nation in the last year than any other deer and done within the last century. Democracy guided by a gentle loving hoof to a bright and noble future."

chital.162.d:0 ""Oh, let's go here now! Hurry up, Benjen!" Eva disappeared into the crowd of the commondeer again, not looking back if the poor Yaril is keeping up with her or not.\n\nBenjen let out a sigh and tried to follow her. The doe had been going on like that for over two hours. She'd go from one market stand to another, get excited over some items on it, and sometimes buy something, the testimony to which was the sacks he carried, filled with tea, Hindian textiles, Olenian jewellery, and Ukko knows what else at this point. To his dismay, she showed no signs of wanting to stop anytime soon.\n\nHe finally managed to catch up with Eva, mostly thanks to the deer moving out of the way for the Yaril. Benjen saw their surprised and confused looks after suddenly seeing their Yaril in some crowded Ostkranbian market.\n\n"There you are, Benjen!" said Eva, taking her eyes away from a stand with some Olenian alcohol. "I was starting to worry I lost you again. Though, you look tired. Do you feel fine, my dear?"\n\n"I'm alright, Eva," Benjen reassured her. "Though I still wonder, why did you insist on going to this market in person, with just me? You could have just sent one of the servants to get what you need for you."\n\n"What would be the point in that, though?" Eva spun around a bottle of mead in her hooves. "I didn't take you here necessarily to buy something, though that is one of the reasons as well. I wanted you to experience it yourself."\n\n"Experience what?" the Yaril asked, confused.\n\n"Everything!" Eva smiled. "I wanted you to experience the crowd, the smells, the talks around you, the joy of choosing and buying, everything. We, nobles, can get so stuck in all of the riches, politics and diplomacy, that we sometimes forget what it means to actually be a deer living in this nation. It is especially important for you to not forget that since you are their leader."\n\nBenjen considered her words for a moment and nodded. "You are right, Eva. Though, I doubt Jakob would be happy with me going here more often without security."\n\n"Jakob is intelligent and means well, but is too stuck up in his old-fashioned ways." The doe scoffed. "To the point where he'd rather keep the status quo in this country, rather than what it truly is: a beautiful cultural mix with infinite potential. Which is why I bought all these items for you." She pointed at the sacks carried by the Yaril. "To remind you that Chital is a diverse land, and despite the differences between the deer that inhabit it, that's what makes it so unique and wonderful!"\n\nBenjen finally smiled and looked at the doe. "Thank you, Eva. Thank you for helping me remember that.""

chital.163.t:0 "In the Dining Hall"
chital.163.d:0 "The servants brought in silver platters filled with a multitude of salads, soups or different types of curry, and put them on the long table in front of Benjen and Brienna. Having done their part, they left, leaving the Yaril and his cousin alone in uncomfortable silence. The vastness of the dining hall in Jakob's estate and the size of the table separating them, clearly made for accustoming more deer than just two, certainly didn't help either of them feel more at ease.\n\n"So... I assume you know why your father wanted us to meet?" asked the Yaril. It was maybe too direct, but he doubted they could hold any casual conversation right now.\n\n"He would like us to marry. He believes that I'm currently the best marriage candidate for you," replied Brienna. She managed not to show any specific emotions in her voice, but she avoided his gaze.\n\n"Yes." Benjen nodded. "But what do you think about it, Brienna?"\n\nShe finally raised her eyes to meet his. "I... I've never been good when it comes to politics. My father says that since I'm your relative, high-born and not affiliated with any specific group, this marriage is a safe and easy option. You won't get any new allies or change the public's opinion of you by this, but it also won't anger or surprise anyone."\n\n"Yes, he's been telling me that a lot, and he's most likely right about it..." Benjen sighed.\n\n"He also said that the commondeer look more fondly at the Yaril that is married, in general," Brienna continued in a dispassionate voice. "That it would show that your rule is stable and that you are socially adept since you got a wife or something like that. And he also said that..." She gulped. "That you need an heir as soon as possible." She lowered her eyes again. "My father believes this marriage will be the best for both you and all of Chital, and if that's truly what he thinks, then I'll do what's necessary."\n\nThey both fell silent again. Benjen tried to force himself to continue his salad, but he has lost all his appetite.\n\nThis marriage really was most likely the safest and most sensible option for him right now. Jakob was right that for the good of his rule and the good of Chital itself, it was one of the best options he had. Neither Benjen nor Brienna was particularly happy about this prospect and he doubted there would be much actual love in this marriage.\n\nBut if this was what had to be done, then they were both ready to accept it."

chital.164.d:0 ""You know, I never expected you of all deer to be the one uncle would send to me."

"When I first heard a native, a freed thrall no less had become his right-hoof deer, I could barely believe it."\n\nPensha Rashanth pushed her rook forward, taking one of the Yaril's knights. "Jakob is a good deer and looks for natural ability over things like heritage. He wants hard work and dedication, and he really does care. If it wasn't for him, I'd still be just a soldier in the army."\n\nThe Yaril raised an eyebrow. "But don't you worry about your countrydeer? Their culture? Doesn't Jakob care more about the Olenian legacy?"\n\n"The Diwan does not discriminate based on things like that," she responded defensively, keeping her eyes on the chessboard. "Those that have true hearts will succeed just like I have, just as natural-born Olenians that do not will fail. The spirit of the deer is what he looks for, and nothing else."\n\n"If you say so..."\n\n"And checkmate." Pensha put her queen right in the line of Benjen's, ending the game. "Don't be so hard on your uncle. He's the most brilliant general Chital has ever seen, and he deserves respect. Treat him with respect, as family and as your Diwan, okay?"\n\nBenjen sighed. This was just a waste of time after all."

Still, even with that restriction, there are plenty of candidates to choose from, provided we took the time to survey them.\n\nThe first is Eva Pillai. The local noble of Gondeerana, she is an important member of high society from the south and would do well in binding the region to the north with Benjen. Well-suited for court life, she would certainly advise Benjen well, even if she is also not the most straight traditionalist in the nation.\n\nThe second is Brienna Kudlinen. Jakob's own daughter, she would secure the bloodline between the Yaril and would be a very pliable bride to Jakob's wishes, for better or for worse. She has accepted the responsibility that comes with being the wife and knows the importance of having an heir to the throne, and she is likely the safest or most politically stable option.\n\nFinally, there is Pensha Rashanth, Jakob's own right-hoof general. A very talented commander, she has served for many years after being freed from thralldom by the reforms of old and quickly rose through the ranks as a native Hindian, now one of Jakob's closest friends and advisors. A neutral choice uniting military and Yaril, and a balanced personality politically between hard traditionalism and internal reform supporting the Yaril.\n\nSo, who will Benjen choose?"

"The bosses, the Olenian wolves, they've been rounding up any able deer they can find to work in the big plantations, and the Tuya are doing too much to see to it at all at once," were the words of another plea, and others spelt even grimmer circumstances than the economic exploitation so common in her old homestead of Haarihus and the surrounding fiefdoms of the South.\n\n"The wolves came and burned the temples here, ran out the Tuya with their long rifles and searched the homes for the leader of the assault on that caravan 'ran through here a couple of weeks ago," wrote another, while the author of "The scene of the caravan's anything but convincing; the jackals burned their own crates and killed their own deer to root out the free brothers of the Tuya here. Well, Madame, if you'll allow me, I think we ought to start again here, start sacking those caravans for real if the consequences 'gon be the same" clearly had another opinion in mind.\n\nSo much anger. So much hatred. So much blood in the South, yet Benjen, Davirtannen, Jakob, even Ivar were oblivious to it all. How could they not be, when it was in their very interest to do so? The strong could play their games of reform and reaction, of "progressivism" in the urban strongholds, debate measures of Sambar and Doelhi and Macawia, yet all the while her old home would suffer for it.\n\nIf all goes well, Bhushan shall set the plans in motion, Hira thought as she set the last of the pleas for aid aside..."

Hundreds if not thousands of deer sat together on great woven rugs displaying scenes of the glorious fall of Bhushan the Liberator, the first leader of the Tuya, at the hooves of faceless viking hordes. They gazed up from the ground to meet his gaze, utter devotion and reverence in their faces, their eyes consumed by fire. Bhushan took his place in front of them, clad only in threadbare robes.\n\n"I notice that there are many new pilgrims among us," he finally spoke, raising a hoof and nodding, "let us instruct them of the commencement of Her Will, of the knowledge of the Way Temporal and Spiritual and the Doctrine of the Saint-Soldiers of the Tuya."\n\nThe mass of deer turned beside them to their sacred scrolls, and the recruits followed. Peace, Bhushan thought, let me keep calm, remember the words, ponder on the teachings... "As the ranks of the Saint-Soldiers of the Tuya yet expand, the force of the people shall yet grow with it, and in their greatest hour crush these Olenian oppressors, these servants of the Mind, of impulse. It was impulse that brought them here, these barbarians from the frozen shores, base impulses for gold and blood and power, of the material world in all its riches but never the world of spirit, never that of the charity or contentment. No, it was gluttony of the highest order, of lust for more and more and more until finally, Mahimata screamed "Enough!", and the pure remembered their conscience, remembered the teachings of their Goddess when their scriptures had been torn away from them, their values broken by the black idols of the wicked Pantheon!"\n\nBhushan pulled a double-edged shortsword and a bowl of sanctified nectar from his belt and held them atop for his adoring followers to behold. "If you are to remember your conscience again, drink in the nectar of Mahimata, the lifeblood of the Hindian, stirred by the sword of eternal struggle, and rise again, a soldier of Her Tuymaiyānatu!""

chital.168.t:0 "On the Matter of Hoofball"
chital.168.d:0 "Today, Kansleri Ivar Hoversholm has announced the creation of the All-Chitali National Hoofball League, with founding members from amateur teams and sporting clubs across the nation arriving in Ostkranbi this week to lay the groundwork for Chital's premier sports league. Hoofball is a long-time passion of the Kansleri, who discovered the sport in Jezeragrad during one of his many tours of the Republics of Griffonia and was enraptured by it ever since.\n\nHoversholm, however, has been quick to deny any rumours that he founded the league as a personal vanity project, declaring that he hopes for investors across Zebrica and Griffonia to put money into teams in Chital and eventually formulate new international club competitions to further bolster a sense of cross-continental republican unity. The sport is a key pastime within the Republics of the River Federation and in Sicameon but has never seen broad popularity in Chital, leading many Southern activists and even Olenian traditionalists to decry the move as an imposition of a foreign cultural tradition upon a nation with a rich sporting history of its own. Olenians have recommended deer hockey as a new national sport for Chital, while Hindians have countered with the suggestion of Kabaddi, a classical tackle sport of Hindia, but neither are too keen on the idea of imposing hoofball for hoofball's sake, regardless of the sport's popularity internationally.\n\nThe Kansleri has used his clear majority in parliament to pass the initiative as it stands, but large amounts of foreign and domestic money pouring into the league without proper domestic support would only spell a public relations disaster for the Republican Party government. Hoversholm's foreign contacts have encouraged the move to go ahead and the people's game to expand to Chital, but would such a deer of the people risk the empty stadiums and washed-up Riverlander sensations that could turn Chital's hoofball league into a farce?"

chital.169.d:0 "There is a certain principle in Chital's new Confederation: everywhere the Kansleri even so much as breaths, a mob is bound to follow.\n\nThe initial success of the "Battle for the Soul of Chital" appeared apparent to any in Hoversholm's government as a sign the worst was over, that the fighting in the streets had subsided and a return to normalcy once again stood on the horizon, but such optimistic readings only turned out to be illusions. The symbols may have been torn down - Benjen V is nowhere to be seen and presumed dead by all but the most conspiratorial of traditionalists, Hira and Bhushan have returned to the shadows and taken the Tuya with them, and Jakob the Grey lies in the halls of the Olenian Pantheon - but the anger remained, and now, new leaders have wrapped their tendrils around the minds of the Chitali people.\n\nIn Ostkranbi, the papers of Benjen's lackey Raili Ninessen and the snake Katarina who bears a Hoversholm name have escaped any attempt at censorship and instead are now in the hooves of every urban elite and Equestrianized academic, and all decry our Kansleri, not for his reformism, but his "right-wing socialist, state-promoted social hierarchy and an assimilation of all Chitali with our wonderful differences into a militarized band of republican fanatics standing against all hopes of a harmonic future."\n\nIf such progressive jargon is unappealing, one can only look at what the traditionalists of the East and the Tuya of the South distribute, each painting the Kansleri as a member of the other. He is a viking lord reborn, a devotee of assimilationism, and has publicly admitted to ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of Ostkranbi Tuya, yet also has used the Tuya as his own paramilitary force to raid temples of the Olenian Pantheon and sacrificed Jakob the Grey on the altar of his bloodthirsty Goddess, even while simultaneously promoting atheistic thought and announcing the collectivization of hundreds of thousands of acres of noble estates across Chital to be put in the hooves of mindless freed thralls.\n\nIf all that was true, at least our Kansleri would have the power to deal with this slander directly, but he has not even been afforded that luxury, as there are now whispers of such Jakobite rhetoric in the army as well. We must take measures to rebuild Hoversholm's popularity, if it even existed in the first place, or risk the destruction of the Republican Revolution in Chital before it began."

Fasting and meditation for three days had prepared his body and mind, now his soul needed to be renewed before he could begin the great task ahead. His path would take him to every corner of the country as he rallied the deer to arms, the holy war for the salvation of Hindia.\n\nFrom Gondeerana he would travel the length and breadth of the country, meeting his herd and speaking to them face to face as he had once done before entering government; savouring the chance to reconnect with them, to see how far they'd come with his reforms. They might not have known it but everything he had done was leading up to this point, readying the nation for the final struggle.\n\nHe would rally the deer of Hindia to their final great task, for while they'd been saved from the taint of Olenia there was one more danger which needed to be expunged. To the south lay the dark lands of Kiria, within its borders dwell creatures born from nightmares, creatures who used the guise of kindness and civility to lure in the innocent and then consumed them in the flames of their true, dark nature, destroying souls in the process. Ridding the land of these demonic creatures would ensure the safety of deer souls for evermore."

It is warm and welcoming but waits to burn your hopes to ash. I speak of course of Kiria."\n\nBhushan spoke clearly and with intent, his voice carrying over the congregation that had come out to hear the words of the Raj. The temple was packed, the heat within its confines making several deer feel faint, or perhaps it was the words of their saviour: a touch of the divine in their presence.\n\n"We have set right a great wrong of the past and reclaimed our sacred land for the glory of Mahimata and she, in turn, overjoyed at the redemption of her fawns, has raised us to new heights. Our land restored, the souls of our deer redeemed, our herd even now being purified; there is but one final threat we must face. Kiria."\n\n"There lies in that land creatures which seek our ruin. They are the worst form of deception; they tempt and lure in the unsuspecting before consuming them with dark demonic fire and devouring the ashes which remain, feasting upon the very soul of their victims. Do you grasp my words brethren? They would destroy everything we hold dear and rip us from the embrace of the Goddess to send us crashing and burning down through whatever pain they might yet be capable of engendering until we are not even ash. The Olenian demons might have corrupted some of our deer but the Kirin, they would destroy us utterly. To protect ourselves we must draw the sword first."\n\nMurmurs of horror went round the temple growing in volume and concern as they feed upon the fear of the deer next time them. At the back, a doe jumped to her hooves and yelled.\n\n"Mahimata wills it!" The shout was taken up by the congregation and as the call to arms was echoed back at him Bhushan smiled warmly.

They might have dressed themselves up in civilisation, but they never strayed far from their past. The problem was only made worse by how close Macawia sat to Ostkranbi, effectively strangling the shipping lanes. The deer of Chital were a proud seafaring herd like all their kind and would no longer stand for this economic domination, they would fight back in kind. Through blockade and undercutting the harpies, Hindia would bankrupt Macawia and force them to release their grasp over the seas restoring the deer's proper place as the economic superpower of the region."

A trade fleet happened to be returning to port at the time having delivered a shipment of rubber and came up against the blockade. We're unsure if they tried to run the blockade, ram it, or were just unaware of its nature but we do know they tried to sail past and head for port.\n\nThe Macawian ships ordered them to stop and when they refused, open fired on the convoy. Five ships were lost to the sea and 700 souls were sent to the bottom. The Hindian fleet was swiftly mobilized and drove the Macawians off after a brief exchange of shellfire.\n\nIt is clear now that the measures Eva has taken have not gone far enough. Chital cannot allow such an act of aggression against innocent deer to go unanswered and mobilization for war has begun."

The problem is all these deer have gotten ideas about their own cultures and history, splitting the species into many different parts.\n\nThe solution is easy though if they can just stop fighting long enough to listen; it doesn't matter where they're from, be they Olenian, Hindian or even Austerian, they are all deer. That is the unifying message Hindia needs to propagate. The idea that all deer should work together to build a bright future for their race and their fawns.\n\nThe first steppingstone is the annexation of Austurland. Long left to their own devices they have developed their traditions and identity. Surely, they can be convinced of the greater gain of uniting the Cervid race. Protection from their opportunistic neighbours for instance. With such a union deer would own the seas from here to the waters off Olenia itself.\n\nEven now Rashanth and Huddarnen are drawing up their "Declaration of unity."

His heart was failing him, keeping him bedridden for the majority of every day, keeping him locked away from his true callings.\n\n"Uncle?" Benjen came into the room, taking a seat by the old general's bed. "What is it?

Our division, after months of rigorous training and preparation, finally marched out under the shade of freshly-tailored visor caps and silk banners from the high-rises and industrial projects of southern Ostkranbi to the ports and ancient hillforts up north. Everywhere our column went there was a crowd waiting for us, celebrating our arrival as if we've liberated the hearts of our country. They made me a lieutenant during training, so I had the opportunity to lead my platoon, always the first to be cheered by the multitude of smiling faces, waving flags of our country between their hooves.\n\nIt's all so surreal to remember now. They tell us we're the first generation to rekindle the torch of the household guards and Vikingar of the past; that we're the young faces of the country's maritime Olenian and Hindian military pride. We've yet to prove ourselves, but we were heralded in as heroes; like saviours, to Chital.\n\nAs our division made its way through the increasingly narrow, cobbled streets of the northern city — closer to our barracks — I kept discerning this one face poking out from the sea of thousands: a doe, wearing a green wide-brimmed hat, with a half-smile lighting up the corners of her youthful face. She kept looking at me... just at me. She looks so familiar, yet I don't recollect ever meeting her. All I know is she's the one for me, dad. Maybe when my contract's up I can find her waiting for me out here. \n\nI'll write to you later, father. It's getting dark out and soon it will become impossible to find the time to pen letters.

This was the bustling of his many native servants throughout the castle, and he could hear them saying their dedication to their own Mother Goddess.\n\n"This is the duality of Chital," Benjen said to himself. "This day, like all others, I have much ahead of me."\n\nWalking now to the west balcony, Benjen felt the presence of the Seitsemän Sali, the council hall where he would hear court later that morning.

The wind blew thick today, ruffling the Yaril's cloak, and bringing a serene calm to his mind.\n\n"Your majesty?"

At least his nephew seemed to be enjoying himself; the cheers of the crowd gave him the support and love he had wanted.\n\nYet out of the corner of his old, tired eyes, Jakob spotted something.

Benjen rushed over to the old general, seeing the red pool on the floor where he lay. "Guards!" he roared, an exceedingly rare righteous fury entering his voice, "get that assassin!"\n\n"I'll be fine, Benjen," Jakob said as strong as he could as he struggled to get back on four hooves. He may not have been the young stag he once was, but he still had plenty of strength left in him.

You can guide the people as our heart and benevolent Prince of Chital- and we can take care of the rest." Ninessen explained.\n\nBenjen finished with his glass, and set it down softly. "So you want to run the country yourself, Ninessen? Chancellor of State is a powerless position in Equestria, little more than a paperwork secretary with a bigger salary. You thought, you would be writing the same policy you're overseeing..."\n\nBenjen paused to consider, and his eyes glanced between Ninessen's fire-cast persona and the bottle of alcohol.

The issues of Chital can not be answered with words and peace alone. Were it not for you, I would be dead, and the Axis would have won."\n\n"Do you see now why I was trying to push you?"

If you can fix everything and bring order back to Chital, then... I am willing to listen."\n\nThe old warrior nodded and patted his nephew on the back with his good front hoof. "Don't worry, nephew. I promise I'll sort everything out. Your father and brother would be proud of you."\n\nAnd with that single stroke, Jakob had won."

chital.186.d:0 ""Indeed I-" The slamming of the door cut Benjen's conversation with the mayor off as Eva strode into the room carrying what appeared to be a rifle. Dropping it to the floor before him with a dramatically loud clatter she turned to the mayor.\n\n"Would you please give us a moment." The mayor nodded at Eva and rose from his chair, pausing briefly to bow to the Yaril before leaving the room a little unsure of what had just happened. As the door closed Benjen turned to Eva with an annoyed scowl.\n\n"Eva, would you care to expl-"\n\n"You nearly died today, Benjen." She stated, he looked at her nonplussed. "When your car was coming down the main street there was an assassin on one of the roofs. My guards just about caught him. That is the rifle that nearly took your life." The rapidly paling Benjen glanced between the rifle and Eva. "Jakob for all his bluster did nothing, he'd have sat there next to you and watched you die." She pulled up a chair next to him. "Benjen, I might have stopped this today but I don't know if I can stop it again, not as things currently stand.\n\nThis progress has really brought to light the differences between the cultures in Chital and if we're going to fix this country, we need to pick a way forward. I have the support and the influence but I'll need our help. We can't wait any longer the next time we might not be so lucky."\n\n"Benjen, I saved your life, now help me save Chital.""

chital.187.d:0 "Julio tamped his pipe and took another puff, pondering the situation. Macawians were not ones for open warfare, preferring the more subtle approach or some light theft; possibly something to do with their cultural history of piracy. Here though was an interesting opportunity presented by the Kansleri himself. Ivar Hoversholm wanted their assistance in a war of "liberation" in Kiria.\n\n"You understand my hesitation. We have no quarrel with Kiria, quite the contrary. The tariffs and harbour fees on their shipping generate a steady tax income. That coupled with the distance between our territory make it unlikely" Julio pointed out, making his position clear from the outset.\n\n"That's why you're perfectly placed. Macawia is far enough away that you don't have to worry about air raids or invasion and with your navy, you can blockade the ports whilst the Chitali army does the rest. Of course, if the honourable Macawian army wants to join the fray we will not object."\n\n"What's in it for us?" Julio raised his eyebrow as he took another drag of his pipe.\n\n"The division of territory in the peace terms will, of course, grant Macawia ports of importance as well as monopolies on certain resources and industries." Ivar smiled but seeing Julio expression unchanged he pushed forward. "We would even be willing to accept some legations around major kiria cities as well as further economic claims." Julio couldn't quite believe what he was hearing. These deer must be desperate, and desperate creatures are willing to pay a high price.\n\n"Those seem like a good starting point.""

It was no secret that he had long hated the enforced silence of the Kirin, verbose as he was, he believed all should be able to speak of their value. The talks with Macawia had been fruitful and here was the culmination of his efforts delivered to the herd.\n\n"You all know me, I am not covetous for gold, it doesn't bother me if my garments appear shabby; such outward things are not in my desires. But if it's a sin to covet honour and liberty, I am the most offending soul alive. I have proclaimed so many times and granted such gifts to our nation and herd who are all able to raise their voices and speak their hearts in this new age, but we cannot rest upon our happiness whilst others within our reach suffer for want of assistance."\n\n"Kirin live upon a bended knee to a monarch who has silenced them, muted their calls for aid and is deaf to their concerns. We here and beyond know this to be true, the Macawians stand at our side in this belief and so we must take to our cause and liberate those kirin who cannot speak for their own sake."\n\n"This day shall be held upon a pedestal for all who come after. This story shall the good stag teach his fawn, and through all the days that shall go by from this day to the ending of the world we here shall be remembered and deer in Hindia who now sleep in their beds shall think themselves cursed they were not here with us!""

#chital.189.d:0 ""This is getting ridiculous." Ivar was clearly struggling to keep his voice under control as the meeting reached its fifth hour, with no end in sight. "How are we supposed to get anything done if they don't speak?"\n\n"That is the point of why we're here," Raili reminded the statesdeer. "But I do admit, this is getting rather frustrating."\n\nThe kirin dignitaries present, including the Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, simply tilted their heads. Ivar raised his hoof to his forehead as his sister attempted to calm him down, and both Eva and Davirtannen huddled close to the Yaril.\n\n"I must admit, attempting communication with a party that does not speak poses an intriguing challenge," the industrial commented. "I've spent many years in the Chitali courts, and even I can't see what they're thinking.\n\nEva nodded. "Perhaps our Yaril may be able to help?" She and Davirtannen turned to Benjen. "You are the Yaril of all Hindia now; if any of them will listen, it will be to you."\n\nBenjen nodded and stepped forward, grabbing the attention of the kirin present. "Matriarch," he started respectfully to Rain Shine, "I understand why you believe in the Silence. Conflict is difficult, and there is always risk involved. But you can't give up your laughter because you're scared of a little pain."\n\nMore kirin tilted their heads. "In Chital, I had to take risks too. We couldn't have achieved harmony without them. And even when I had my life on the line, we still achieved peace in the end. We, all of Hindia can help you regain your voices again... but only if you let us help you."\n\nRain Shine looked at her fellow kirin, presumably to gauge the opinions of the kirin that the deer there could not. Then, she gave a single nod, and slowly walked away, the rest of her entourage in tow.\n\n"...Was that a yes?" Davirtannen asked.\n\nKatrina shrugged. "I guess it's the best we'll get.""

#chital.190.d:0 "It had been an event quite some time in the making. Even though the Yaril had persuaded the Matriarch Superior to finally end the Silence for good, Kiria was a massive country, and such an undertaking was not something easily done. The special tea needed to lift the spell needed to be created en masse with help from Chitali advisors, and many Hindians personally worked with kirin to oversee and volunteer in transportation, administration and distribution of the necessary materials. Friendships were struck, kirin laughed and cried and cheered for their newfound voices. Praise has never been higher, and the ties between Hindia and Kiria have never been stronger.\n\nOf course, not everything is perfect again. Cases of niriks have once again started appearing, arguments rising and resulting in chaos and instability within the Kirin nation. We have done our best to help contain and limit these events, as well as repair any damage done during their rampages. It may take a few years for these events to finally subside, but until then we are more than happy to help in calming nirik so they can once again find their peace.\n\nRain Shine has given the Yaril her personal thanks for the help in both convincing the kirin to break their Silence and helping to remove it entirely. A formal agreement has been signed up, promising eternal friendship between our nations and a promise of aid should we come under external attack. Hopefully, it will never come to that, but at least we know that now, we have new truly harmonic and free people willing to help in Kiria."

The unlucky had been put out of their misery by the attackers.\n\nThey wore the emblems of Taungpau badly hidden by mud and dirt, even spoke with a badly concealed accent which seemed to wander depending on who said what. Aside from this somewhat clumsy disguise, they seemed very professional, moving swiftly to clear up the survivors and get off-site. The attack was well planned, the blast had damaged the rail lines so any help would be delayed. By the time the authorities arrived, they were long gone, having stolen blueprints and reports of fuel supplies for the region.\n\nThey made one mistake though. A single survivor hid beneath some wreckage. She didn't say much before being whisked away to a hospital, only that the attackers were clearly from Taungpau but they also mentioned something about Kiria.\n\nThe papers went wild with the story filling in the missing details themselves claiming that the Taungpau government was little more than radicles back by Kiria.

Panic had not yet set in, but news of the Diwan's ailing state was sure to spread sooner or later, and something had to be done. They could only keep the staff silent for so long.\n\n"...Is it true?" Pensha Rashanth asked the Diwan as he slowly sat down in his chair, having barely recovered from his stroke. "Are you..."\n\nJakob nodded. "It seems Ukko finally calls for me. I fear I may not have much time left."\n\nThe council immediately went up in uproar. Chaos reigned as deer turned against deer, arguing over who's fault it was and who did what that could have caused Jakob's strength to fail so. The noise was maddening, and eventually, Jakob slammed a hoof onto the table as hard as his body allowed him to. "Silence!"\n\n"This has been approaching for a long time. Now we must turn to the future of Chital, one without me. I will be appointing a successor as Diwan soon, and until then I expect all of you to run Chital while I am absent. The Chitali people may know of this, but ensure that peace and stability remain in the realm above all else. I trust you to perform the tasks I have assigned with the utmost importance."\n\n"And what about you?" Pensha questioned. "What are you going to do?"\n\nThe ageing deer sighed. "I...

chital.196.d1:0 "When Jakob the Grey had called for the Yaril, he had responded almost immediately, taking time off for a meeting with him within hours. It had been a slow day, with little for him to attend to personally, and he was looking forward to speaking with his uncle again. After all, he still had not told him how the war in the south had gone; all that had been relayed back was that it was a stunning success, with Jakob once again proving his great skill in battle. Benjen was never a warrior, but he had great respect for Jakob and his many stories of war both on land and at sea.\n\n"So uncle, what's so important today?" he asked, pouring two glasses of brandy. "Another lecture? A meeting with the council? You do still need to tell me about the battle at Mahorna, I do want to hear your tale of victory from it sooner or later-"\n\n"I'm dying, Benjen."\n\nEverything stopped. Benjen froze, the glass he had in his hoof falling and shattering on the floor. He saw his uncle give a grunt; even now, he left little room for mistakes such as that. "I... what? What do you mean, uncle?"\n\n"I had a stroke hours ago," Jakob explained, his voice softer than it had been in years. "Ukko calls, Benjen. There is not much time left for me here."\n\n"No, no, you can't die now!" Benjen struggled to maintain his composure in front of his uncle, his hooves shaking even more now. "I've already lost father and Aatto, I can't lose you too! Not now! I... I..."\n\nJakob watched his nephew as tears began to form. It was difficult to watch others go, it was true. Jakob had wept for his brother, and for his other nephew when they had moved on. But what was hardest of all, was seeing the suffering your own passing brought, for you were powerless to stop it. "I have complete trust in you to rule without me. You have learned from your mistakes, and you will continue learning. It will be up to you to carry on the legacy, just as it is up to me to spend the time I have left as best I can."\n\nThe Yaril was unable to respond. Jakob did not expect him to. "I will be choosing a successor as Diwan soon," he continued. "They will advise you as I have, and help you in ruling Chital. They will also take over much of the duties I currently perform, which I will soon become too weak to do. Until then..." Jakob offered a hoof to his nephew. "Can you join me in spending the time I still have? As family?"\n\nBenjen looked at his uncle's outstretched hoof before wiping his own tears and pulling Jakob into an embrace. "Of course, uncle," he said, holding him tight. "Of course.""
chital.196.d2:0 "Jakob the Grey had few regrets in his long and storied life. He had driven off fleets of sea-kings, led armies to victory in battle, and remained forever loyal to the House of Kudlinen in its reign over the Yarildom. He was one of the greatest heroes of the realm, a name many in the military sung in praise of his exploits, wishing to one day be like the great Jakob.\n\nAnd yet, nothing weighed quite as much on his heart as how he had treated the deer before him.\n\nBenjen V made his annoyance at being summoned clear as he took a seat opposite from his Diwan, taking the chance to speak first. "What is it this time, uncle? Here to berate me again? Banish more of my friends away? Or are you here to teach a lesson now that the Axis is gone, and tell me I was wrong to form the council in the first place?"\n\n"No." Jakob's voice was soft, softer than it had been in years. It betrayed his weakness, something he had tried for years to keep hidden except in private moments. "I'm here to apologize. For everything."\n\nThe Yaril scoffed. "A bit late for that, don't you think? And what brought on the change of heart this time? Does one of your advisors finally need me for something? Are you hiding a speech you need me to read again?"\n\n"I'm dying, Benjen."\n\nThe monarch froze, his anger fading away to shock. His hooves dropped and he stared at his uncle, who refused to meet him in the eyes. "I had a stroke. There is not much time for left for me, and I have realized... you will soon have to rule without me. It is my fault for being short-sighted, for trying to sideline my own family. It will be up to you alone to carry on the legacy. And it is up to me to make the most of the time I have left."\n\nThe two were silent. "So, what will happen then?" Benjen asked, once again back to his timid self. "If you can not be Diwan soon anymore..."\n\n"I will be appointed a successor soon. They will help you in ruling the country. I put my faith in them to rule well. And I put my faith in you-" he said putting a hoof weakly on his nephew "-not to rule as I would want, but as you believe you should."\n\n"I..."

So, after leaving his courtly duties to Pensha for the day, Benjen had hurried to the royal hospital as fast as possible. The sight he was greeted with was not pretty as he sat in his chair, Jakob only turning his head slightly to see him.\n\n"The doctors told me already. That... you're going to leave soon."\n\nJakob nodded using as little motion as possible. "I wasn't going to just give up until I saw you one last time though," he said, stubborn as ever. "Ukko knows you'd never forgive me otherwise."\n\nBenjen would have smiled at that if the situation had been any different. "I will miss you, uncle. Though, that's not just why I'm here. I wanted to show you something." Jakob's eyes widened as he finally saw what his nephew had been holding; a newborn fawn, sleeping peacefully.

"I'm sure he'll grow up to be a fine Yaril someday," he said. "What did you name him?"\n\nNow it was time for Benjen to smile. "I only named him after the finest warrior and leader that Chital has ever seen, and the uncle that taught me how to be a true leader for Chital." The look of complete shock on Jakob's face was almost enough to cause the Yaril to laugh out loud. "And when he grows up, I can tell him that the spirit of his granduncle is with him, watching him overcome any obstacle he may face, just as you did for me."\n\n"Benjen..." Words failed him as he hoofed the fawn back to the Yaril, tears in his eyes. "I don't know what to say."\n\n"You don't have to say anything." Benjen carefully hugged Jakob, letting himself remember this moment. "I love you, uncle. Never forget that." Standing up and moving to leave, Jakob watched silently as his nephew made his way to the door, only looking back once he had opened it.

One stood at the front; the Yaril, his cloak drifting lightly in the wind, with a bow and single arrow nocked.\n\n"My uncle was a great deer," Benjen began. "He fought countless battles in the name of Chital, he served loyally to my father, brother and I, and he only had the best for the nation at heart. He was the most loyal protector I had ever seen, and always believed in what he thought was right. Even when we argued over what I did, he only fought because he saw the dangers I couldn't, saw what troubles Chital had ahead."\n\n"I was so afraid of becoming like my uncle. Mostly because I thought I never could. The Yaril he spoke of felt so different from who I was; how could I be that great, that brave, that strong? I always thought he wished that he still had my brother instead, that he wanted me to be like Aatto. It was only later that I realized... that he just wanted me to be my best self. To be a better Yaril every day, to care about the responsibilities given to me. He wanted me to try."\n\n"A Yaril protects his own. Jakob taught me that by example, and I know he would want me to do the same. I know he will remain with me always, watching me as I rule the Hindia he brought for me. And I am ready to take up the legacy he wanted me to, the one my father trusts me to follow. I will remember Jakob the Grey as a warrior. A statesdeer. A hero. But most importantly, I will remember him as my uncle. One who was loyal until the very end, no matter the price."\n\nThe arrowhead caught fire, and Benjen pulled back the string.

But I know he wouldn't want us to sit around moping for him either. He'd want us to go out and bring more glory to Hindia, to work every day to make the nation better than it was before. I don't think he would care about what you are doing, as long as you put your best into doing it."\n\n"You're right, Pensha." Benjen stood up just a little straighter, watching the city of Ostkranbi. "I have a feeling that things may be getting just a bit better for Hindia, day by day. As long as I work at it, we can do better than what we did yesterday."\n\n"Within reason, of course," Pensha added. "Jakob told me to protect you, and that's exactly what I plan to do.

"You will refer to me as Diwan," the general replied coldly, his tone leaving no room for discussion. "What is it, Yaril?"\n\n"Oh. Well, I just thought that we might discuss some of the new policy going forward. I know uncle's funeral is still in the minds of many, but the sooner we-"\n\n"We?" Ieffri laughed, a dark and sinister laugh that gave Benjen chills. "There is no 'we', Yaril. You have already proven yourself to be a liability to Hindia, and that can not stand. Jakob needs to curtail you just to keep you under control, and I have no intention of deviating from his hoofsteps. The military will be leading going forward, proud warriors as it should be."\n\n"I... but..." Benjen sputtered, his slight optimism completely broken at this point. "But I'm the Yaril! Jakob would have never-"\n\nThe Diwan cut Benjen off, his face full of fury. "You are not worthy of speaking the General's name after what you put him through! He gave his life for Chital, and you have given nothing. It is time for true deer to take charge, and for you to sit on your throne and listen like he would have wanted you to. Perhaps your son will prove to be an actual warrior unlike you, but I doubt it." Ieffri marched off, his tone of voice and body leaving no room for debate.\n\nAnd Benjen? He only stood there stunned, unsure what to even do. The Hindia that Jakob left behind was dark, its fate uncertain... and it was completely out of his control now."

chital.200.d:0 "Ivar adjusted his hardhat a little, unfamiliar with the sensation of it rubbing against his antlers.\n\n"How do you wear these things." He joked to the foreman standing next to him.\n\n"You get used to it, Kansleri." The construction site was buzzing with activity, cranes, diggers, cement mixers, workers with blueprints pointing at things having very important looking conversations and all about them parts of the statue.\n\nThe idea had come from Kiria, a joint project with Hindia as thanks for their liberation from the silence. When finished it would stand at over a hundred feet tall, a beacon to all those arriving in Ostkranbi, the image of the great liberator Ivar Hoversholm himself. Of course, he'd been keen on the idea, it had done wonders for his ego, but it was also a great opportunity to show the world what Hindia was now capable of.\n\nThe idea of building such a statue would have been laughable less than a decade ago, but Hindia was a strong nation now, technologically advanced, and economical sound. To undertake such a task would demonstrate just how far Hindia had come and how much further it would go for the cause of liberty.\n\nFrom taking control of Chital to rebuild the cultural nature of the country, the Hindian wars and the democratic restructuring; Hindia was not the nation it had once been. It was something completely new in this corner of the world, a nation devoted to liberty, to the ideals instilled by Ivar and it was a nation that knew its destiny to help spread that liberty beyond its borders.\n\nAs he laid the foundation stone at the base of what would one day be the statue a small crowd of workers and reporters clapped and gave the odd cheer, maybe for him, maybe for the statue, or maybe for the world he had given them."

chital.201.t:0 "The Watchful Mother"
chital.201.d:0 "Hira signed off the final document and added it to the pile. Another day another round of paperwork. It was starting to feel like she'd spent her whole life looking at paperwork but then information and controlling the flow of it was how she'd gotten this far in the first place. Somewhere in some disused warehouse basement, there was a vault with all the secrets and documents hidden away to be used when needed. When that vault was cracked open in 50 years and it all came to light, she knew her motives would be understood.\n\nEverything she'd done from the communists to seizing power and rebuilding the nation, Brienna's time as Yarila, the pact with Roam; it was all done to protect deer kind. She knew better than anyone that covetous eyes watched their borders waiting for a sign of weakness. The Kirin to the south were only the start of it but that threat had been dealt with and thanks to the network of informants now established in neighbouring nations, Hindia would never be taken by surprise.\n\nRising from her chair she crossed the room to look out over Ostkranbi in the afternoon light. Another hot day in Hindia like every day. This is what she wanted, normality. For every deer to be able to live a happy normal life safe in the knowledge that somedeer was looking out for their wellbeing. They were protected from all the pain and hurt the world could throw at them, secure in the knowledge that was a job waiting for them and a prosperous future ahead.\n\nBrienne. She'd come to view the doe as something of a surrogate daughter, a representation of the care she wished to give all Hindia. Certainly, their relationship had grown, they met most days to chat and stay in touch. She hoped the Yarila returned the sentiment, she hoped she understood the difficult road they had to take for the betterment of the nation and the protection of the herd. She hoped the future would be kinder, that these systems wouldn't be needed for long.\n\nShe hoped."
chital.201.a:0 "A grateful future."

chital.202.t:0 "By Her Grace..."
chital.202.d:0 "Bhushan sat upon the steps of the temple palace in the morning light looking over the hills of Gondeerana below. He supped his tea and enjoyed the peace, wind in the trees, birds amongst the rafters and the faint sound of distant prayers in one of the shrines.\n\nHis great path for the salvation of the deer had been completed and yet he felt no sense of great victory, no triumphant moment of ecstatic celebration, just a quiet sense of contentment at a job well done.\n\nThe souls of the herd were safe, pulled from the clutches of Olenian corruption by the Tuya. Even now as the dawn's light crested over the horizon Mahimata returned cleansed and reborn souls as fawns to the world, free of the taint of the invaders, free and pure as she had made them to be.\n\nThe demonic Kirin, consumers of souls to the south had been pacified, no longer would they pose such a mortal threat to the salvation of deer kind. Soon they would be nothing more than a forgotten story told to frighten fawns.\n\nHindia had been rebuilt by his hoof, Chital rising to the helm of one of the mightiest nations in the world, a feat none would have thought possible ten years ago. He had done all this for his herd, to protect them, to keep them safe from a world that had sought the twist and destroy them. Now Hindia was a safe place, a place where any creature, be they zebra, griffon, pony or even a penguin could come and seek the deeper meaning of who they were, of what their gods wished of them. With the slate wiped clean and the taint purged Hindia could soon become the spiritual centre of the world.\n\nBut that was for another day, for now, Bhushan was simply content to enjoy his tea and watch the sunrise over a safe and prosperous nation."
chital.202.a:0 "... We were saved."

chital.203.d:0 "Eva smiled as the fawns ran past her on their way to class. Her visit to the school was just wrapping up as she shook hooves with the headmistress.\n\n"We really can't thank you enough Yarila, the funding has made such a difference here and in other schools. I know the fawns are very grateful."\n\n"Indeed they are." She chuckled, glancing over at Caarlit whose saddlebags were stuffed with crayon drawings and glittery pictures. "I'll treasure these always I assure you, but I really must be going. So much to do you know. I shall pass on your thanks to the Yaril." Parting ways happily, she trotted towards the waiting car only to pause as she went, her attention caught by the street around her. She had grown up here, and how things had changed. The city was alive again. On every road and pathway deer went about their business, on their way to or from work, out doing some shopping or even just going for a stroll.\n\nFive years ago they would have shot dirty looks at each other as they passed. Five years ago, beggars and the homeless were to be found in the streets. Five years ago, education was a luxury. Now it was a right, the right to an education, the right to a job and a right to feel safe in our own country, the wheels of industry had driven Hindia to new heights. The old divisions of culture had been healed by mutual benefit, the final crack sealed by the war with Macawia; Hindian and Olenian deer fighting together for a prosperous future. In countries as distant as Skynavia, there was a demand for Hindian goods, Ostkranbi had become a marketplace for the world and the nation was Zebrica's workshop. There were more jobs than deer to fill them, they'd have to look at open immigration soon to meet the demand.\n\nAdjusting her dress slightly she smiled as she slipped into the car, her nation had become a true world power and showed no signs of slowing whilst her herd's place of importance was guaranteed."
chital.203.a:0 "Onwards to new heights."

chital.204.t:0 "A New Dawn"
chital.204.d:0 "The day was peaceful. It was a picturesque view of all of Ostkranbi, seeing the sun and the vast city filled with deer, Hindians and Olenians alike. Harmony had changed Chital for the better, and the people loved their Yaril more than ever before. While demonstrations in support of Benjen were still not enough to exactly be considered common, one would not be surprised to see a procession occur.\n\nToday, however, the streets were silent. Benjen preferred it this way, at least at the moment. Distractions were the last thing he needed at the moment, given what he was doing.\n\n"I'm sure he'll be a fine Yaril when he comes of age," Davirtannen said as he watched the young fawn walk around, legs still weak. "He has your sharp mind, and I am sure he will inherit Ruusu's charisma."\n\n"I still think a more Equestrian name would have fit better," Raili added, the line between teasing and seriousness incredibly thin. "Hasn't there been enough Benjens by now?"\n\nThe Yaril smiled as he saw the new heir to the throne stumble, then carefully try to get up again. "Well, you know Jakob would have given me a whole talk if I hadn't done a traditional name. Besides," he said, eyeing one of his advisors, "he wasn't just named after the royal line."\n\n"I beg your pardon?" All the deer laughed as Davirtannen was so startled that his glasses fell off his muzzle, eyes blinking rapidly. "You couldn't possibly mean-"\n\n"Oh, he certainly does." Ruusu had become a regular of the council ever since the marriage between her and the Yaril had been made official; just one of the many things the reforms had allowed him to get away with. "Benjen was quite insistent on it. Said he wanted him to be able to have two great deer to look up to when he grows up."\n\n"And he'll be able to choose whatever he wants to be." The Yaril pulled Russu close, both of them looking at the newest Benjen in the bloodline. "He'll have the freedom to be an artist, a scholar, a teacher. I don't know who he'll be, but I know no matter what he chooses, the future is bright for him."\n\n"Bright for all of us.""

A member of the anti-government Axis of Chital before his ascendancy to power, many have certain reservations about Bhushan's ties to spymistress Hira Ramachan.

 ### TRAITS AND DESCS ###
 
 CTL_BENJEN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of June, 975 in Ostkranbi\n\n§YBiography§!: They say that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, and that cannot be more true for Benjen V Kudlinen, Yaril of Chital and staunch reformist, beset on all sides by scheming nobles, traitorous former allies, and heartless revolutionaries.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doelhi. Born in Ostkranbi, the capital of Chital, to Benjen IV Kudlinen, Benjen would be trained in stewardship from a young age. An intelligent and soft-spoken young deer, he was quick to make friends with numerous noble fawns and even the older deer at court, and was consistently applauded by his father, even if he was not exactly the most diligent of deer. Even when his father died in 998, and his brother, Aatto, became Yaril of Chital, Benjen remained gregarious and ready to take up the mantle of chief advisor to his brother.\n\nThe Yaril's life, however, would soon come crashing down. Aatto died in 1001 pacifying native rebels, and Benjen was forced to carry on the torch of the Kudlinen Dynasty. His chief advisors annuled his engagement to his fiancé, a commondeer, and Benjen was left ruling over a Yarildom that condemned him as a fat steward and doe-ish coward - "The Kind Viking". Slowly replacing Aatto's advisors with his own old friends, Benjen's reign culminated in the establishment of the Council of Seven in 1003 - meant to serve as a united advisory council of both Hindian and Olenian nobles, all originally loyal to the Yaril. Unfortunately, his opposition on the council began to resent him, and three of his greatest adversaries on it formed the Axis of Chital, to curtail what they believed to be his blatant abuses of power and failure to bring reform to Chital.\n\nWith the Council becoming more and more hostile, it seems Benjen will need to act fast if he wants to ensure the survival of Chital - and his dynasty.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"
 
 CTL_BENJEN_HARMONY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of June, 975 in Ostkranbi\n\n§YBiography§!: In all of Chital, there are few deer who have gone through as much as the Yaril, or been as successful within the Council. Benjen V Kudlinen, once called the "Kind Viking" as an insult for his doe-ish nature, now has the same name used as praise for his final success; the complete reform of Chital.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doelhi. Born in Ostkranbi, the capital of Chital, to Benjen IV Kudlinen, Benjen would be trained in stewardship from a young age. An intelligent and soft-spoken young deer, he was quick to make friends with numerous noble fawns and even the older deer at court, and was consistently applauded by his father, even if he was not exactly the most diligent of deer.

Unfortunately, his opposition on the council began to resent him, and three of his greatest adversaries on it formed the Axis of Chital, to curtail what they believed to be his blatant abuses of power and failure to bring reform to Chital.\n\nNow, however, things have changed. The Axis has been disbanded, the Council's power has been vested in himself and his reformist allies, and few obstacles remain between him and his vision for Hindia; not one bound by traditionalism, but by harmony. Perhaps soon, he will leave a legacy just as great as that of the Benjens before him.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"
 
 CTL_IVAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of July, 966 in Hamaholm\n\n§YBiography§!: Has there ever been a deer as great, as visionary, as wholly noble in his pursuit for justice, prosperity, and popular will as Ivar Hoversholm? And yet, has there even been a deer so ignobly cast down, so forced to stoop to the level of those traitors and vipers who surround him?\n\nBorn in Hamaholm in the Thanedom of Valdeland to a caring noble family, Ivar Hoversholm was considered a gifted child from birth - a fact that would propel him into the politics of the nation's capital. Ivar and his father, Elik, became voices of reformism and the rule of law on then Yaril Benjen IV's council, and when Elik resigned his courtly duties out of old age in 1000, Ivar became even more influential in the coastal nation's court. Close friendships with industrialist Benjen Davirtannen and then heir to throne Benjen Kudlinen made Ivar a prime candidate for a spot on the Yaril's advisory council, which would eventually become the Council of Seven in 1003.\n\nHowever, with the establishment of the Council of Seven, came Ivar's undoing. Hoversholm, ever the opportunist, saw in the Council the instrument of true reformism, and in a midnight coup, demanded Benjen grant him the long-vacant post of Chief Minister and leadership of the body. Benjen, astonished by what he believed to be a blatant power-grab, expelled Hoversholm from his inner circle and shattered his political influence. Hoversholm, convinced of a conspiracy against him, privately denounced the monarchy, and found safety in the Axis of Chital - more reactionary than the Yaril, but as a road to power in Chital, second to none.\n\nNow, Hoversholm's reliance on the Axis as the instrument of his vengeance against Benjen has succeeded, but whether Hoversholm's reforms can succeed is another tale entirely.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: bunnyshrubby"

 CTL_JAKUB_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July, 943 in Kanelimpra\n\n§YBiography§!: Jakob "the Grey" Kudlinen - younger brother of Benjen IV, gracious and loyal uncle of Benjen V and his brother Aatto, and now, the most powerful deer in Chital.\n\nBorn two years after the heir to the throne, Benjen IV Kudlinen, Jakob the Grey has always been second-in-consideration - for Yaril of Chital, for chief of Chital's great Viking navy and army, and then, for Chief Minister with the establishment of Council of Seven. While his brother sought to bring fire and blood into the lands of the natives and the glories of the industrial revolution into the lands of Chital, Jakob was right beside him, with an exemplary education in Macawia's top naval academies. A fierce raider before the practice was eventually discouraged by the internationalist Benjen IV, Jakob soon became a war hero to the people of Chital as he fought the influence of Macawian pirates and upstart Hindian revolutionaries through the reign of three Yarils.\n\nNow, however, life for Jakob is much different. A military deer at heart, he has found himself in the upper echelons of government, whispering into the ear of Benjen V and promoting a return to the traditions that made Chital great at every turn. A loyalist to Benjen IV, Jakob has never kept his clear resistance to the Yaril's reformist views silent, and with the aid of extremist military elements, his new base of power, he has become the most prominent right-wing royalist in all of Chital.\n\nIf he can balance his far-right general staff and the hostility of an increasingly rebellious Yaril toward the traditionalists, Jakob will not only be enshrined in Chital's futures as a war hero, but as the greatest statesdeer to grace the nation.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 CTL_HIRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of November, 976 in Haarihus\n\n§YBiography§!: Too many in Chital are born with blue blood and the blessing of Ukko, with not a connection in their life to the plight of those at the bottom.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Hira Ramachan. Plucked from obscurity and relative poverty, Hira first rose to prominence in the south following the appointment of her father, Jheri, as Mayor of Haarihus during Aatto's great pacification of the southern lords. From then, she was sent to Ostkranbi to plead for further priveleges for the destitute natives and former thralls of her father's lowly seat, in the process catching the eye of then Kronprins Benjen Kudlinen. When Aatto died, Benjen V then found a sure ally in the young noble, who remained out of the ancient traditionalist clique of rulers Aatto surrounded himself with.\n\nHira, however, soon became much more than just a puppet spymistress. Her missions to root out traitors in the South saw her make covert allies in resistance movements while on the other hoof declaring to Benjen that they were all "sorted out", and her missions to discover secrets among the court led her to uncover a disturbing amount of information on each and every of Benjen V's Council of Seven - Benjen, of course, received barely any of it.\n\nNow, Hira continues scheming as the leader of the Axis of Chital, and with a united alliance of Southern upstarts, disgraced nobles, charmed bureaucrats, and true populists, the young spymistress has now fully consolidated her hold over the nation.\n\nWhether she shall forge a society of equity and tolerance or simply reverse the roles of power is unknown, but the choices are all hers to make.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel" 

 CTL_BHUSHAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 971 in Mahorna\n\n§YBiography§!: Normally, an aristocrat who promotes open disobidience to an established rule of law is purged, killed, or otherwise removed from office within days. Bhushan Gurat, through either a reputation of incompetence, status as a useful extremist, or a reputation as such a barbaric force of will that many are too scared to even challenge him, has remained an open opponent of House Kudlinen for a decade since the young native first inherited the seat of Mahorna.\n\nA firebrand religious populist, Bhushan the Brash, as he is called, is one of the most extreme politicans in Chital, but yet commands a sizable and extremely devoted movement - the Tuya, "Faithful" in the native Chitali language. A militarist religious order of Mahimata, the mother goddess of the Hindians, the Tuya have fought against the Olenian pantheon ever since Bhushan first took command of a once-weak organization of squabbling theologians which bore that name.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful Southern noble in Chital, Gurat was appointed to the Council of Seven as a voice to appease his subjects in Mahorna, part of the vast native Hindian population, who he soon became a key voice of. Brash and bumbling, many view Bhushan as nothing more than a charlatan playing with fire and dreams greater than his own, but little, if any, doubt his convictions - his fanatic Chitali patriotism, his love for his people - and his desire to make the heavenly mother come to Ostkranbi, whatever the cost in blood may be.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx" 

 GENERAL_SANJAY_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Sanjay Gadra, a distant heir to the fortunes of House Gadra, an Oleno-Hindian upon the outskirts of Gondeerana, is a loyalist to Jakob the Grey and Ieffri Huddarnen, who he is seldom seen without. Together, the two have formed a bloc in the army promoting the continued usage of trench tactics and an aggressive foreign policy in response to the Hindian threat.\n\nSanjay has risen to a relatively high position in the army, one surprisngly high for his military expertise, solely because of his connections with his industrialist and arms manufacturer family in House Gadra. With experience in the air force as well as in the armed forces, Sanjay Gadra echoes his family's ties to the grand pursuit of flight and their continued lip service to the army and the traditionalist forces of Jakob the Grey.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LIEM_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Allies of Liem Wesfelt, born in the eastern fields of Kanelimpra, would describe him as a visionary general and a powerful and promising member of the young officer corps of Chital. His enemies, however, would paint a much different picture, focusing largely upon his great abuses of power in service to Jakob the Grey and sheer brutality of his anti-resistance methods.\n\nBeloved among the Oleno-Hindians, the young officer has already completed numerous tours of duty against the natives in the South, ones that have seen violence and bloodshed on the scale of the efforts of the Iron Regent in Sambar. However, many whisper that Wesfelt's ascendancy to power will soon collapse - if Benjen V and the reformists have their way.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LUDEN_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: A spirited stag of the Katiavan coast, Vaalan ventured inland on the scent of spice, securing a small parcel of land near the forests of Merkaanan to build a modest fortune on cinnamon. It was less fruitful than he envisioned and neither did he relish the work; he would do his best to find excuses and reasons for other errands and business- that was, until a belligerent CPLF force swept through the locality.\n\nWith the spirit of adventure burning boldly within, Vaalan decided he would rather try all four of his hooves at repulsing the raiders, and happily left everything behind to roam the wilds. He followed their movements, harassing them around the clock with whatever means he had at his disposal. Vaalan was always careful to disappear (or, more often, high-tail it) whenever things became troublesome.\n\nOnce he realized he had a knack for this work, Vaalan began to informally organize ventures with others and chased after bandits, beasts, and other malign powers, growing bolder and travelling further by the operation, while taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to survey the lands. His antics eventually grew to be enough that a local noble presented him with an ultimatum: to either put his skills to use with a generously given commission into the Chitali military, or be hunted down himself as an outlaw subverting authority.\n\nThough sudden, the choice was simple enough. With time, Vaalan turned his lowly commission into a respectable rank.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

 GENERAL_NAT_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Born in 976 AD to the family of one of the Yaril Benjen IV's commanders, He was raised to follow the family trade, war, brutal and unjust. Living his early life in luxury, he grew up among his father's serfs, but soon began to notice the cruelty with which they were treated, and couldn't help feel a pang of emotion in his heart for them. Spending time with them, learning their stories and their lives, he grew close to many of them, and decided he would do everything he could to help.\n\nWith these sympathies, it was no wonder that when offered a chance to study at a military academy in New Mareland, he seized his chance. Finally he could spend time in a land a friendship and harmony, hopefully something he could import back home. Compared to his home... it was like comparing a flower to axe. But he always knew he would need to return home eventually, and try to implement what he had learned. As he finished his studies he received a letter from home, his father was dead, killed along with Yaril Aatto in another battle of the never-ending wars against the native populations. Now the owner of his father's estates and riches, he made some changes. Doing far more to help the lives of those who worked under him.\n\nJust the same, he began learning about the new Yaril, Benjen V. He was pessimistic at first, but as he heard more of "the Kind Viking", he decided he needed to see the deer for himself. Offering his military services, and touting his foreign training, Benjen accepted him into the General Staff and he soon became romantically involved with a fellow officer. And now, as tensions in Chital continue to grow, Sven still trusts in his king, and is prepared to fight for Chital and for its people.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 GENERAL_LAURITS_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Laurits was born to an Olenian mother and a Chitali father of middling means. His upbringing was defined by one hoof in one society and another in the other. Well educated he expressed an interest in the military from a young age, joining the cadets and studying a degree in mathematics at Gondeerana university where he first encountered Eva Pillai with whom he'd forge a lifelong friendship. At the age of 23, he was admitted to a military academy and through hard work and creative thinking in the developing use of artillery he earned his place in the army. He eventually rose to the rank of Colonel gaining a reputation as an officer who could crack the uncrackable, with enough artillery in the right place no enemy could resist for long.\n\nColonel was as high as he was ever likely to climb however with Jakob and his group of loyalists unwilling to let a Chitali take the rank of General despite having openly rejected Mahimata and declared himself a Lunarist. This was a hard time in Laurits' life, he took comfort in another officer with who he has remained romantical involved. With these loyalists gone, however, he has finally been given the position he has earned and a chance to demonstrate his thinking on the modern use of artillery.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Twotail"

 GENERAL_PENSHA_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Originally one of the many thralls recruited in the forests and grasslands of Eastern Chital, in Kanilimpra, Pensha Rashanth was freed during the great reforms of Benjen IV. The young Hindian, eager to prove herself in a sphere of Olenian elites, enlisted in the armed forces from a young age, and caught the eye of Jakob the Grey, who had aided in suppressing resistance and overseeing freed thralls in her native territory for years. Rashanth and Jakob soon became good friends, and the new commander showed a lust for battle that saw her rise in rank faster than any native Chitali before her. In politics, however, her fate would be much less glorious. Rashanth, a freed thrall, was enlisted by countless harmonic activists, chief among them Raili Ninessen, in plans to prop her up as a symbol of a new, progressive Chitali deer that could bridge racial conflicts and fight injustice at home and abroad. The general, however, soon came into conflict with the very harmonists that showed such kindness to her, and following tense periods of debate over her demeanour and conflicts with Jakob, broke with them entirely. Returning to Jakob and the military, Rashanth made amends with the traditionalists, but continues to advocate reform even within their ranks.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 CTL_EVA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of June, 974 in Gondeerana\n\n§YBiography§!: Eva Pillai, more than any other deer, is the archetype of the new generation of Chitali leadership that has risen to prominence under Benjen V and his Council of Seven. The daughter of the rich Thane of Gondeerana, a classical Oleno-Hindian nobledeer, and his native Hindian wife, Eva was raised in with a diverse environment unseen in much of Chital's elite, an environment that allowed her to become a beloved heir to the throne among natives and settlers both.\n\nFollwing graduation from the premier university of Chital's southern regions, Eva soon took control of the court of her father, transforming the dreary Thane's hall into a vibrant blend of two cultures, a cosmopolitan sanctuary that brought caravans and tourists a plenty to view the Southern Jewel's transformation. When her father went to war to fight for Yaril Aatto, Eva remained as a de-facto regent, and began to take over the economic matters of the city as well. Her university-trained business expertise and a flood of Equestrian and Macawian advisors brought unprecedented growth to Gondeerana as market outreach and investment soared.\n\nWhen her father was eventually killed in the same doomed assault that brought an end to Yaril Aatto's reign, Eva, only Lady of Gondeerana in her own right for a few days, was immediately invited to Benjen V's new council, and from then on, has continued to serve as a stalwart defender of cultural unity, cosmopolitan ideals, and unbridled capitalism.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

 CTL_DAVIRT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of February, 955 in Prauma\n\n§YBiography§!: If you have ever heard of Benjen Davirtannen (a difficult feat, as he is completely vacant from the public sphere and oft-confused with the Yarils he is named for), you would know him as one of the most important civil servants and advisors in Chital in the last century. He built the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau and brought social reform and modernization during the Great Struggle in Hindia, preventing revolution in the South, penned lucrative contracts with Equestrian conglomerates and Griffonian trade companies that saw wealth flow into Chital's coastal hubs and Gondeerana at the meeting of the rivers. Suave, personable, and empathetic, those who know the old deer have only praise to lay at his hooves, and his workers know some of the finest conditions this side of the globe. One of the leaders of the Reformist movement, his position in politics was well-entrenched during the rule of Benjen IV, Aatto and Benjen V, even striking up a personal friendship with Ivar Hoversholm, another well-known reformist.\n\nNow as Chief Minister of a system long since in the making, slow measured progress is being made on the path to harmony, to modernization. To a liberal order controlled not by the bully pulpit of demagogues or by some faux-democratic despot deriving its power from the cycles of sun and moon, but by calm, reasonable, and considerate bureaucrats. The Chital that has been created is far different from that of before, yet Davirtannen reminds the same as he has always been. Forever loyal to the Yaril, and forever ready to take as many slow steps as needed to bring painstakingly measured reform and intellectual governance to Chital and Hindia.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Tofus"
 
 CTL_NINESSEN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of September, 979 in Ensuu\n\n§YBiography§!: Sometimes, harmony just isn't harmonic. Bridges are burned, friendships are broken, and disunity lies palpable in the air; all occurances Raili Ninessen is all too familiar with. What use do words have against threats so existential to the very stability of harmony they seek to shatter its fabric entirely? As one cannot tolerate intolerance, the harmonic cannot tolerate the unharmonic.\n\nWhen Raili Ninessen first arrived at the Ostkranbi court, she was shunned as a traitor to the Olenian order, a dissident and a troublemaker, but above all, an activist dedicated to the fall of the monarchy in Chital. Ninessen's first papers and orations demonstrated limited appeal for Equestrianism, especially if it involved the replacement of a traditionalist Olenian monarchy with some new, diverse dynasty.\n\nDismayed at her lack of support and the possibility of treason charges, Ninessen departed for Equestria, where she learned and studied the princesses' response to the rise of Chrysalis and return of Nightmare Moon. The strength of harmonic action and dedication of the ponies to their ideals bolstered Ninessen's own fervor, and the second time she arrived at court, her mannerisms were much more ruthless.\n\nWith the death of Yarils Benjen IV and Aatto, Ninessen found Benjen V a willing ear for harmonic ideals, and a promising candidate for the role of an Equestrianist prince. With the support of the court's firebrand reformists, Ninessen's faction at court superseded Ivar Hoversholm's as the main power on the left... much ire surrounds the doe and her band, ruthless in their criticism and driven in their pursuit of radical harmony, but one thing is certain: she is winning.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

 ### IDEOLOGIES ###
 
 CTL_socialism_desc:0 "Hoversholmism is a branch of social democracy that promotes aspects of political authoritarianism and the supremacy of the executive for the purpose of achieving reformist socialism in developing countries, such as those of the Hindian subcontinent. Although more authoritarian than classical harmonic democracries, Hoversholmists believe that after the initial period of "state developmentalism", true populism can emerge in which a strong, stable, watchful government can anchor policies below the national level based on direct democracy, decentralization, subsidiarity, and above all, solidarity."

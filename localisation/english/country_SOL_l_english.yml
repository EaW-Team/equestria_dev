 equestria.142.d_off:0 "With our army bravely fighting the enemy, some of the leading national publications have started to print pacifist messages, urging to end the war immediately.

 equestria.148.t:0 "Martial Law"

 equestria.151.a:0 "Reforms of civilian administration will suffice."
 equestria.151.b:0 "Military will join civilians for the time of war."

I know how hard it is to rule, especially now, but some of the measures you have enacted hurt our ponies, not protect them. Please, sister, stop for a while and think about this."
 equestria.153.d_nobles:0 "Your Majesty, we couldn't help but notice that you, please pardon the term, seem different that before. The policies you have enacted, while of course necessary, have been considered extreme by some. Perhaps Your Majesty could reconsider some of the details?"

 equestria.154.d_nowar:0 "Surrounded by enemies, both internal and external, the Harmony is in danger. My ponies need to be protected from them, even if they don't yet see the danger.

Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 calibre revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags. "I am here to seek asylum from the Illegitimate Solar Imperial Rule. Please, Sir, I need to see my brother and sister-in-law.""

Step one was done; now it was time for step two."
solarempiresparkles.4.d_susp:0 "He didn't seem to be buying it, by the squint of his eyes. I did my best not to let my nerves get the best of me, as my motley band of commandos did the same, behind me. It felt like an eternity as he judged me with his gaze, before giving a short nod. "Very well, follow me. I'll have to report this to my commanding officer, ma'am- you understand I'm sure- but otherwise I'll send you on your way."\n\nI exhaled a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. "Of course, sir.

solarempiresparkles.41.d:0 "The rather dull guardspony rushed us to the throne room, as I put on the best Twilight Sparkle impression that I could, and Scorecard's group put on the best wayward Rebel impressions they could manage.\n\nUpon the guard's introduction of us, Cadence immediately leaped down from her pedestal, and pulled me into an impressively firm hug. "Oh my goodness, Twilight! I'm so glad that you're safe! Were you followed? Did they hunt you? Are you okay?"\n\nI wheezed slightly, as Cadence attempted to murder me by hugging, which she took for being a tad sickly, as she pressed a hoof to my forehead. "Cadence, I'm okayyyy, promise. Just a bit ragged, is all. We got out okay. I have no idea if we were followed." That seemed to ease her concern at least, as she led us to our rooms, to get cleaned up and food in our bellies."
solarempiresparkles.41.d_susp:0 "The meeting took far too long to arrange, for my liking. Far, far too long for an asylum request. I would have to instruct Scorecard and his lackeys to be doubly careful with his preparations. Finally, I was allowed to enter the throne room, where my Sister-in-law was awaiting me. The tone was... cool, to say the least, but I could work with cool, if I had to.\n\nI gave Cadenza a respectful bow, from my position in front of her throne, as Scorecard and the twins did the same behind me. "Cadence, it's good to see you." I began, choosing my words carefully- she was already suspicious of me; being overly cold or overly honeyed with my words could blow my cover just as easily as being caught out as a spy. "I was starting to worry you wouldn't see me at all."\n\n"Yes, well... can't be too careful, after all. You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least. Come, Twilight, why don't I show you and your friends to your rooms?""

solarempiresparkles.5.d:0 ""I've got to know, Twilight, how bad is it over there?"

A few lies here and there, hidden amongst the truth would be the way forward, I felt. "Purges, ponies being sent to camps. I haven't seen or heard from the girls in a week." That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few moons, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realised what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the minuscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn's base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

solarempiresparkles.15.t:0 "Execute"
solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We'll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I'd been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."

solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard's hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart's bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commission!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma'am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

"Twilight Sparkle's magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard's Welrod, directly to Flash's head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."

The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry's bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of the Solar Empire, you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."

solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress' ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence's insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centred on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."

solarempiresparkles.16.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds travelling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry's barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades' quiet farmhouses greeting us.

I smiled, widely, a territorial and unfriendly smile. "Greetings, my good mares and stallions. We've an appointment with Her Highness, Mi Amore Cadenza. You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler's titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza's - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty. "Her message is as follows: you shall return you and your ponies to our Solar Fold," I paused, to ensure I had her full attention, and that she fully understood my ultimatum."

My mane smouldered, as the odour of Sulphur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train.

Some of them are large enough to sustain sizable thestral population. We should "encourage" resettlement and help them build new cities. We are in no way giving up on our citizens, it will simply be much easier to watch over them. We will have our inquisitors work in these new cities and educate thestrals. These new cities might even develop into new industrial centers in time. Naturally, at first there might be some dissent against this idea but eventually they will come to see it is for the best.

They will round up all the thestrals and do what must be done. It may not seem right at the moment, but they will inevitably pose a threat to stability of our Empire in future. We will not stop until every single bat has been hunted down and defeated. We must steal away our hearts and do what must be done for preservation of stability within our Empire. Stability of the Empire must be preserved at all cost and if few batpony lives are the cost of it, then it is a price we are willing to pay.

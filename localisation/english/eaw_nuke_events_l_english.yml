 nuke_first.1.d_pony_democratic:0 ""Twenty hours ago, the [Root.GetAdjective] Armed Forces detonated a new and powerful weapon in an isolated testing range. The bomb in question had the power of more than 10,000 regular bombs. In its present form, the weapon is an atomic bomb, uniting magic and science to unleash a power heretofore unknown.\nBut it is not the explosion itself that should be remembered but the fact that it was only possible by thousands of minds coming together to make this marvel of science. Everypony, scholar and scientist worked as one to create this weapon in such a short time. Let us hope that we may never end up having to use this for its purpose, but that it may help us ensure peace."\n - [Root.GetLeader]'s speech, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"

The speech emphasised that the weapon, codenamed "Unity" is "to be used in a  war with the reactionaries".

Our new weapon, which sees magic and science coming together to create something bigger, holds the key to the power of the Windigos.

The weapon, presumably a crystal-uranium blend has been shown to be able to destroy entire cities, maybe even kill all of its population. [Root.GetLeader] made a speech in reaction to the news, where the existence of the weapon, called "Windigo" by its creators to reflect its power, was confirmed. Windigo, according to military sources,"levelled buildings in a large radius". Whether a deterrent against war or a catalyst for it, the weapon's effect on our nation will be felt."

Laying it down into an uninhabited area we sat down in the bunker's viewing area to see if it functioned. First the alarms rang, drowning our ears in noise and its lights colouring the bunker red. Then the countdown began to echo in our ears... '10... 9....' And all I could wonder is if it was worth it. '6... 5...' The late nights working, sacrificing time with our families to finish this project, '2... 1...' and so the earth shook under us and we felt the shockwave from there as it exploded. Blinding us with its light and destroying the whole area in a purple haze of destruction and hellfire. Nothing remained, the bunker's outer layer turned to dust and the area pulsed with purple corruption as the radiation and magic mixed."

Griffons ran for the bunkers and those inside strapped on goggles.\nThen - an explosion, unlike anything ever seen before was unleashed from the ground, blinding some of the unfortunate griffons that hadn't gotten their goggles on in time. It threw tanks and trees around and when everything was over, nothing of the test site remained. Only the bunkers that the scientists had taken refuge in stood, although covered in purple dust and heavily scarred from the experience.

Every changeling began to fly for cover, and into the heavily fortified bunkers...Twenty seconds...the blast doors closed...ten seconds...goggles on, or eyes away...detonation.\nThe detonation threw around old tanks and concrete structures like building blocks. The tower that had held the bomb melted away. And as the mushroom cloud bellowed into the sky, there was a silent murmur going through the crowd of scientists:"

On the plaza, or what passed for a plaza, hordes of drones had gathered in anticipation of the announcement. Plus, it made for a good break from the usual work, even if it was getting late.\nThe lights went out. The projectors on the tower behind them lit up, playing a prepared reel. It showed a kind of explosion, even if it was in monochrome. No, what made it different was the lightning that came out of the mushroom cloud. It looked like the reactions from magical accidents, and yet, it was more devastating. More destructive. More powerful.\nOne of the drones began to cheer. Soon, a shout went through the workers:"

Red lights began to glow in the bunker, and outside, flares of all colours shot up. The various drones scurried away quickly, as instruments sputtered to life, monitors and meters, every one of them. Only a few drones remained as the weapon detonated and whirled up a magic storm. Purple lightning struck around the sites as the unlucky few drones were vaporized or thrown around like ragdolls.

 HIP_rozenkampism_desc:0 "Lightningism continues all of Posada's most notorious policies at an even more intense pace. Chiropterra continues to be devastated, and resources are ruthlessly extracted from North Zebrica to fuel the post-scarcity society on the home front. Calling himself the true heir of Posadism, some fear he aims to persecute ethnic minorities within Revolutionary North Zebrica due to his nationalist roots and belief in biological lumpenproletariat. Crack insists the phenomenon of biological lumpenproletarians is based upon ethnicity and direct heritage, not race, but for the zebras and ponies within Revolutionary North Zebrica, that offers a small comfort as the nebulous "superculture" they are supposed to conform to seems quite ill-defined."
 HIP_magocracy_desc:0 "Though enforced through magic, the rule of the sirens is nothing like that of other magocracies in the world. The country is first and foremost used as a feeding ground of strife, which in turn gives the sirens the magic they need to continue enthralling the population. None except the sirens themselves are seen as of any importance, and they alone dictate the will of the nation. While the exact direction of that will may vary from siren to siren, the fact remains that free will remains only a myth to those that live under their regime."

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand The Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_focus:0 "Form The Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_focus_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand The Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely. We lack many resources other nations enjoy, and to keep our war machine operational we must protect our trade routes. Modern destroyers will keep our convoys safe."

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Integrate The Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "There are some things best done in above-water dockyards, and other things best done in underwater ones. We will integrate our surface and underwater shipping facilities to better repair our vessels and streamline shipbuilding."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Refine Underwater Construction Techniques"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support The Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_focus:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_focus_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus:0 "Form The Bellbreeze Aircraft Corporation"
 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus_desc:0 "We are a naturally airborne people. When we fight our enemies in the skies, directing our efforts to maneuverability will let us shoot them down while dodging their attacks."

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form The Department Of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open The Office Of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Expand Metalworking Industry"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is quite resource rich, but much of those resources are particularly hard to get to or require extensive refining to be made usable. To get the most out of our mineral wealth, we will expand aluminum mining operations in Grand Alaudia and develop the Starfield Steelworks so that our industries never want for materials."

 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES
 HIP_defence_department:0 "Department Of Defence"
 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armament Plans"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "We will contact prominent figures in the arms industry, such as Plumage Moonfeather, to improve our arms procurement process. Factory owners must know that there will be great demand for weapons in the near future, so they will be prepared to convert their civilian factories into military ones should we be attacked."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund The Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising The Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps:0 "Expand The Royal Engineer Corps"
 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especially the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School For Signals And Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons From The Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds At Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-To-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the most of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion Of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 ### AIR FOCUSES
 HIP_air_armament_committee:0 "Establish The Air Armament Committee"
 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrent."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war.

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours.

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later.

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut The Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us.

We must stop blaming one another for losing the war, and come together as friends once again."

 HIP_moment_of_truth:0 "The Moment Of Truth"

 HIP_demobilize_economy_desc:0 "Silverstream suggests we lower work quotas, ease wartime rationing measures, and redirect our economy to providing for our subjects in these difficult times.

 HIP_partition_cth:0 "Partition Colthage"
 HIP_partition_cth_desc:0 "Many of Colthage's problems stem from the city of Colthage exploiting the other regions in the republic. Simply putting a harmonist Sufrit in charge would hardly fix the underlying problem.

 HIP_entrench_representation:0 "Entrench Representative Institutions"

 HIP_reassert_absolutism:0 "Reaffirm Royal Sovereignty"
 HIP_reassert_absolutism_desc:0 "Queen Novo asserts that Harmony in Aris has always been monarchist, and that the system has worked marvellously.

 HIP_trust_carrot_stick:0 "Trust In Carrot Stick"
 HIP_trust_carrot_stick_desc:0 "Chiropterra may have done terrible things, but Harmony means giving your enemies a second chance.

 HIP_north_zebrican_coalition_desc:0 "New hope is emerging in the lands of our former enemies. Old hatreds are starting to disperse, and trust is building. This presents a unique opportunity: our former enemies were magnificent soldiers, and if we can combine our expertise in a unified general staff, there's no telling what we could accomplish. The first step will be to organize a series of wargames at the Grand Alaudia training grounds."
 HIP_zes_agency:0 "Contact The Skapatoria Programa"

 HIP_harmonist_syncretic_economics_desc:0 "While we only implemented it out of desperation, in many ways our wartime economy was more Harmonist than our peacetime one: the state, labour unions, and business all working together for the common good. Why return to normal when we can make something better than normal?"
 HIP_natsynd_elements:0 "...With National Syndicalist Elements"
 HIP_natsynd_elements_desc:0 "By giving the industries placed under temporary state control to the labour unions in those sectors, we can share the decision-making and the profits among the workers, and coordinate between workers, the state, and capitalists on a sectoral basis. National syndicalist economic theory predates its perversion by fascism: ensuring everygriff is benefiting is just Harmony applied to economics."
 HIP_planned_elements:0 "...With Centrally Planned Elements"
 HIP_planned_elements_desc:0 "The Marksists say that under capitalism, creatures are enslaved by the means of production rather than the other way around. While we disagree with their conflict-based worldview, we understand how it can feel that way. We will retain control of the key sectors nationalized during the war, and set up permanent planning bureaus to serve the interests of everycreature: owner, worker, and soldier alike. "
 HIP_private_industry:0 "Expand Private Industry"
 HIP_private_industry_desc:0 "While wartime necessity forced the state to play a larger role in the economy, we are still a capitalist nation at heart. Private property and entrepreneurship are the base upon which our economy was built, so we should work to preserve and expand them. Ensuring our citizens have access to ample capital for investment is a good place to start."
 HIP_state_industry:0 "Expand State Industry"
 HIP_state_industry_desc:0 "The nationalization of major industries may have been an act of wartime necessity, but it has proven very effective. When push comes to shove, the state is the only institution that can run the economy for the good of the nation. We must expand the operations of state-owned industries to increase our economic output."

 HIP_veterans_pensions_desc:0 "Hippogriffs, seaponies and zebras fought and died defending Harmony from its enemies.

 HIP_harmonic_austerity:0 "Austerity And Sound Spending"
 HIP_harmonic_austerity_desc:0 "When we speak of austerity, it is not a sink or swim system. We can never simply give up on supporting our population.

 HIP_social_state:0 "The Social State"
 HIP_social_state_desc:0 "Harmony isn't just an agreement to leave the people alone, it's a commitment to look out for them and their wellbeing.

 HIP_moderate_racism:0 "A Clean Break"
 HIP_moderate_racism_desc:0 "Raft Wood argues that we have already wasted too much money on ungrateful Zumidians.

 HIP_hardline_racism:0 "They Have Their Uses"

 HIP_hardline_strategy_desc:0 "Crack Lightning's strategy for the North Zebrican War would see us use our naval superiority to launch daring attacks on the enemy's coastal cities, which hold most of their war industry.

 HIP_never_another_crack_desc:0 "We have overthrown the tyrant Crack Lightning, and we must now set about dismantling his legacy. We will form a new government, and assess the political, military and moral failures which led to his disastrous reign. Never again shall a demagogue rule Aris."

 HIP_political_failure:0 "The Political Failure"
 HIP_political_failure_desc:0 "Crack Lightning was able to usurp total control of Aris despite never formally deposing Queen Novo. Any political system which can be exploited that catastrophically either needs widespread reform, or total replacement."

 HIP_question_of_constitutions:0 "The Question Of Constitutions"
 HIP_question_of_constitutions_desc:0 "There are some who argue that a written constitution would have prevented Lightning's rise to power, that we trusted too much on the goodwill and wisdom of government officials and the monarchy when both were easily deceived. Perhaps it is time for Aris to draft a constitution?"

 HIP_political_violence:0 "The Question Of Political Violence"
 HIP_political_violence_desc:0 "In addition to bureaucratic maneuverings and jingoistic rhetoric, Crack Lightning attained power through political violence using paramilitaries. It also took violence to depose him, and now the Pinks and the Blues are debating over what role violence should play in politics, and whether it can ever be regarded as a force for good."

 HIP_moral_politics:0 "Moral Politics"
 HIP_moral_politics_desc:0 "The question of violence has led inexorably to the question of morality. The Pinks say that tyrants can only be held back by the embrace of moral precepts, which fill the gaps left by law. The Blues argue resolutely that even the most upstanding individuals will turn to demagogues in times of social alienation, and we must combat the fraying effects of capitalism in order to restore social solidarity."

 HIP_right_to_bear_arms:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
 HIP_right_to_bear_arms_desc:0 "The right to bear arms is a recent suggestion by Posada, who argues that the workers must be armed and organized into worker's militias, so as both to defend their homes and to overthrow any tyrant. Others see it as an legitimation of the armed gangs of "patriots" which helped Crack Lightning seize power in the first place."

 HIP_right_to_revolution:0 "The Right To Revolution?"
 HIP_right_to_revolution_desc:0 "Overthrowing Crack Lightning was clearly the right thing to do, but Skystar is being asked a vital question: why? Was it only because his rule was illegal, a usurpation of legitimate authority? Or was there something more: does every creature, usurped royal or not, have the right to rise up against their government if they believe it to be tyrannical?"

 HIP_moral_failure:0 "The Moral Failure"

 HIP_elements_revisited_desc:0 "Kindness, Generosity, Laughter, Loyalty, Honesty, and Magic. While never openly repudiating them, Aris First twisted and ultimately discarded the Elements of Harmony.

 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff_desc:0 "The Nightmareists discovered horrifying things in their pursuit of victory at any cost. While we cannot abide such cruel experimentation, we can certainly benefit from their findings and utilize these discoveries against other reactionaries.

 HIP_integrate_cth:0 "Sweep The Remainder"
 HIP_integrate_cth_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a nation run by reactionaries for reactionary ends. It must be defeated for the sake of the lives under it and the lives of those adjacent to it.

 HIP_harmonic_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With The Harmonists"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation_desc:0 "Comrade Silverstream leads a minority faction in the party advocating for avoiding excessive brutality or authoritarianism. Should we align with these ideas, we may find relations with Equestria thawing. The fact is that harmony is a vastly less terrible system to live under than supremacy, so why shouldn't we work together to destroy the latter?"
 HIP_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 HIP_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "It is only logical to follow Steel Stallion's application and allow for the majority to rule, as they do in bourgeois democracies.

 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory_desc:0 "We must consult every part of the party and then make decisions in accordance with revolutionary theory.

 HIP_towards_post_scarcity_desc:0 "One of the greatest aims of a communist society is to abolish scarcity. While we are not yet in a place to eliminate scarcity of weapons, we can do so for civilian desires, at least in peacetime. This will be a significant drain on our economy, but it will be worth it. Isn't the goal of communism a better life for the worker?"
 HIP_industrial_bureaus:0 "Found New Industrial Bureaus"

 HIP_an_admitted_monster:0 "An Admitted Monster"
 HIP_an_admitted_monster_desc:0 "Posada did terrible things by her own admission. We can respect the good work she did for the workers without praising or legitimizing the atrocities she committed. For the nation to begin healing, it is time for all of us to confess our own wrongdoings."

 HIP_our_eternal_hero_desc:0 "Comrade Posada didn't receive the mental and emotional support she clearly needed, which is why she came to believe that she was somehow at fault for doing what had to be done to ensure the survival of the revolution.

 HIP_ignite_atom:0 "Ignite The Fires Of The Atom"
 HIP_ignite_atom_desc:0 "One of Posada's greatest legacies is her support for nuclear power. Her policies have made us a world leader in what is likely to be the energy of the future. We should continue to support nuclear research and explore the many applications of nuclear technology."

 HIP_purge_revisionists:0 "Purge The Revisionists"
 HIP_purge_revisionists_desc:0 "Posada's greatest mistake was tolerating heterodox viewpoints within the Revolutionary Workers' Party.

 HIP_purge_moderates:0 "Purge The Moderates"
 HIP_purge_moderates_desc:0 "Within the Party and the populace at large, there are many who profess loyalty to our cause while objecting to our methods.

 HIP_unchained_by_morality:0 "A Revolution Unchained By Bourgeois Morality!"
 HIP_unchained_by_morality_desc:0 "The Party rules all. The Party is always finding ways to improve. Through dialectics, we develop the ideal modes of theory and praxis.

 HIP_moderate_outlook_desc:0 "For Skybolt Spear, the revolution was never about turning the world upside down or creating technologies that sound like science fiction.

 HIP_navy_brings_revolution:0 "The Blue Navy Brings The Revolution!"
 HIP_navy_brings_revolution_desc:0 "There are three institutions the people can always rely on: the Blue Army, the Blue Air Force, and the Blue Navy.

 HIP_biological_lumpen:0 "Classify Biological Lumpenproletariat"
 HIP_biological_lumpen_desc:0 "It was the Hippogriffs who led North Zebrica to revolution while the other races were content to be exploited by reactionary elites.

 HIP_build_a_hegemony:0 "Construct The Hegemony"
 HIP_build_a_hegemony_desc:0 "Crack Lightning has always known the Hippogriffs were destined to rule North Zebrica.

 HIP_class_culture_race:0 "Class, Culture, And Race!"
 HIP_class_culture_race_desc:0 "Crack Lightning's position is secure, and Posada's revolutionary state continues its evolution into a Hippogriff Hegemony.

 HIP_codify_rights:0 "Codify Absolute Rights Of Creatures"
 HIP_codify_rights_desc:0 "There are rights that absolutely must be enjoyed by all creatures, such as the rights to life, liberty, food, and shelter.

 HIP_reparations_for_atrocities:0 "Reparations For Atrocities"
 HIP_reparations_for_atrocities_desc:0 "The crimes Posada committed against the people of Chiropterra are unforgivable.

 HIP_harmonic_communism:0 "Harmonic Communism!"
 HIP_harmonic_communism_desc:0 "General Secretary Silverstream is finally beginning to understand this "dialectical materialism" thing.

 HIP_rehabilitate_reactionaries:0 "A Rehabilitationlist Legal System"
 HIP_rehabilitate_reactionaries_desc:0 "In the opening days of the revolution, we condemned people to terrible sentences to send a message to others who would do the same.

 HIP_radiation_proof_armor:0 "Radiation-Proof Armour"
 HIP_radiation_proof_armor_desc:0 "With the increased commonality of nuclear devices on the battlefield, our forces will need to be properly protected. This in turn requires that we develop thick lead armor for our mechanized and tank units, and reshape the tank design to allow the blast wave to flow around it. While this will be difficult and complicated, the rewards will make it worthwhile."

 HIP_tritium_amassment:0 "Tritium Amassment"
 HIP_tritium_amassment_desc:0 "In order to construct such a weapon, we will need plentiful fuel. Fusion weapons require entirely different fuel than fission, and we're essentially starting from scratch. We will begin purchasing lithium-6 and bombarding it with neutrons to create our tritium."

 HIP_anarchia_mama:0 "A Different Approach"
 HIP_anarchia_mama_desc:0 "This war has only confirmed the fears of the anarchists relating to "Revolutionary North Zebrica": the supposedly materialist authoritarian communists are in fact themselves utopian idealists, lost in their visions of post-scarcity and blind to the real material conditions of this nation-state. We can no longer trust in benevolence among our rulers. It's time to seize our own fate!"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection:0 "Prepare An Insurrection"

It is neither possible, nor desirable, to return to a pre-civilized state of being.\n3. It is therefore desirable to imagine and enact a post-civilized culture."
 HIP_our_own_anarchism:0 "Seaquestria's Own Anarchist Society"
 HIP_our_own_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism is more than a word. It is the opposition to all tyrants, to all powers, to any form of control. We are not anarchists out of idealism, but cynicism! We have seen the fruits of authoritarianism in the horrors of the North Zebrican War! Our rallying cry is simple - never again."
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement:0 "The Anti-Hierarchy Movement"
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the placing of one life, one will, one culture above another. While many anarchists would be satisfied with merely some reforms to hierarchy to render it less tyrannical, we would not. Our aims are far more far-reaching, and we refuse to let compromise or moderatism slow us."
 HIP_school_based_life:0 "Reintroduce School-Based Life"
 HIP_school_based_life_desc:0 "Before the invention of agriculture, seaponies lived in communal, non-hierarchical shoals. We swam through the seas, eating kelp and simply living without any central government or supreme authority. While we are not primitivists, we do recognize that primitive life had advantages over modern life. One such was these schools."
 HIP_sustainable_aquaculture:0 "Sustainable Rotating Aquaculture"

 HIP_isolationism_and_peace_desc:0 "Who stands to benefit from war?

 HIP_dissolve_supreme_workers_council:0 "Dissolve The Supreme Workers' Council"
 HIP_dissolve_supreme_workers_council_desc:0 "The Supreme Workers' Council was an attempt to represent the people in the central government. But why do we need a central government at all?

 HIP_augmented_hunter_gatherers_desc:0 "In many parts of the world, hunter-gatherer society had problems, such as cultural conservatism, authority of the tribe leader, and feuds.

 HIP_waste_not_want_not:0 "Waste Not, Want Not"
 HIP_waste_not_want_not_desc:0 "The idea of recycling is a very good one, but it must be applied to everything.

 HIP_enshrine_democracy:0 "Enshrine Democracy At Every Level"
 HIP_enshrine_democracy_desc:0 "One of the greatest flaws of the Posadist government was the identification of the state with the RWP. We will not repeat that mistake. The SLPA is one party among many competing for the hearts and minds of the people, and doing its best to win their support. We will never let the office of party leader become superior to that of head of government."
 HIP_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin The Reconstruction Process"
 HIP_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The decommodified economy Posada engineered, while a marvel in times of peace, was strained to the breaking point during the North Zebrican War, and it simply could not handle the catastrophic loss that followed. As much as it pains us, we have to begin a new economic policy."
 HIP_open_up_foreign_policy:0 "Reevaluate Foreign Policy"
 HIP_open_up_foreign_policy_desc:0 "The Posadist government shunned diplomacy with the imperialist powers of the world, and even relations with harmonists deteriorated. While we have no desire to negotiate with fascists, harmonists are another matter. It falls to us to rebuild those burnt bridges and take a place of peace and dignity among the nations."
 HIP_recallable_delegate_principle:0 "The Recallable Delegate Principle"
 HIP_recallable_delegate_principle_desc:0 "At any time and for any reason, a delegate can be recalled and replaced in a snap election.

 HIP_soldiers_into_construction_workers:0 "Soldiers Into Construction Workers"
 HIP_soldiers_into_construction_workers_desc:0 "We have a massive armed forces, but we are not at war. Reducing military resources and moving soldiers into industrial and infrastructure jobs will help salvage our dysfunctional pseudo-economy and rebuild from the damage of the North Zebrican War. "Salina's Tree Army" may be a joke now, but it won't be in ten years."
 HIP_open_the_markets:0 "Open Limited Markets"
 HIP_open_the_markets_desc:0 "One of the hardest decisions we've ever faced, and one that divided the Presidium to the core, is that of limited markets. The remaining RWP delegates denounced the move as a concession to capitalism, but we have no choice. It's this, war communism, or economic collapse, and this is the least terrible option. Hopefully it will be a temporary measure."
 HIP_reach_out_to_STG:0 "Reach Out To Stalliongrad"
 HIP_reach_out_to_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, the home of revolution, may be our best shot at saving our floundering pseudo-economy.

Fortunately, they were one of the communist states that Posada maintained warm relations with."
 HIP_what_skynavia_got_right:0 "What Skynavia Got Right"
 HIP_what_skynavia_got_right_desc:0 "In a frozen hellhole at the top of the world, a band of idealistic griffons dared to dream.

 HIP_army_of_industry:0 "The Army Of Industry"
 HIP_army_of_industry_desc:0 "Conscription will be reshuffled into industrial work. Right now, we need cement, steel, and lumber far more than guns or tanks. In twenty years, perhaps, we can look at retaking Zumidia. For now we'll focus on civilian efforts."
 HIP_elevate_unions:0 "Elevate The Unions"
 HIP_elevate_unions_desc:0 "The unions largely disappeared under the Posadist decommodified society, but with the reintroduction of markets comes the necessity for the unions to return. There is no need to restore bosses; instead, workplace democracy can triumph."
 HIP_mutual_aid_societies:0 "Mutual Aid Societies"
 HIP_mutual_aid_societies_desc:0 "Unfortunately, with the return of money comes the return of poverty. But we will not let creatures starve. Charities, UBI, mutual aid networks, and credit unions will help the poor, and make life as bearable as possible for them."
 HIP_equestrian_support:0 "Request Equestrian Support"
 HIP_equestrian_support_desc:0 "Although relations with Equestria have been frosty since the revolution, they remain the greatest beacon of harmony in the world. They have one of the most powerful economies in existence, and feats deemed impossible for other nations are easy for them. We should reach out to these benevolent reactionaries and ask for ponyitarian aid."
 HIP_draft_a_bill_of_rights:0 "Draft A Bill Of Rights"
 HIP_draft_a_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "We cannot rely on the benevolence of our leaders and their proletarian nature to protect us from abuses of power. The time has come to codify, in immutable law, the rights of creatures and ensure they will be safeguarded. The revolution is important, yes, but if we get to upper-stage communism by abusing the people we are supposed to be helping, we've missed the point."
 HIP_healthcare_food_and_education:0 "Healthcare, Food, And Education For All"
 HIP_healthcare_food_and_education_desc:0 "With our industries somewhat functional again, we can restore critical aspects of life to be decommodified once more. While they will no longer be as before, they will be state-subsidized, paying farmers for their food and then distributing the food as needed."
 HIP_the_new_deal:0 "The New Deal"
 HIP_the_new_deal_desc:0 "If Posadism would be summarized in a single word, it would be "idealistic," with all the good and bad that entails. The RWP aimed for the stars, and sadly fell short. But that isn't the end of communism. We will learn from their mistakes and institute a New Deal for the people of Aris, with realistic, achievable goals in both the short and long term."
 HIP_invite_foreign_capital:0 "Invite Foreign Capital"
 HIP_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "There are many hungry capitalist powers looking to exploit our resources. While it pains us, this may be the best avenue to restoring economic growth. Using the bit as our currency will require Equestria's survival, but it will also help kickstart our economy. Hopefully history will forgive us..."
 HIP_peace_land_bread:0 "Peace, Land, Bread"
 HIP_peace_land_bread_desc:0 "These three words embody the philosophy of the SLPA. We are not hawks. We are not petty tyrants. And we are not plutocrats. While certain members of the RWP consider us revisionists, the support of the people speaks for itself. The gods smile upon Aris once more!"
 HIP_aris_soars_again:0 "The Enduring Bastion Of Communism"
 HIP_aris_soars_again_desc:0 "Despite all our trials, Revolutionary Aris has pulled through. While our system may not be as wonderful in good times as Posada's, it will hopefully prove to be more resilient against adversity. Glory to the workers!"
 HIP_powerful_friend:0 "A Powerful Friend"
 HIP_powerful_friend_desc:0 "Our industrial focus has left us admittedly vulnerable to the predations of other North Zebrican powers. Earning the protection of Stalliongrad, Wingbardy, or even Equestria, would guarantee our independence and security."

Inquire about details at your local government office!"

 HIP_hunt_the_fascists:0 "Execute Aris First Leadership"
 HIP_hunt_the_fascists_desc:0 "Aris First chose their name to hide their true intentions to destroy Aris. Crack Lightning was infamous for his friendship with arch-communist Posada, and Raft Wood for his isolationism. Every member of the ruling commission of Aris First will be publicly executed. Glory to Aris!"
 HIP_were_a_puppet:0 "Cooperate With Newfound Allies"
 HIP_were_a_puppet_desc:0 "We have gone from a state loathed by our neighbours to one with three powerful allies. We should show them our appreciation, and make sure they don't withdraw their support due to the increasing costs of securing our freedom."
 HIP_tanks_in_the_streets:0 "Freedom, Security, And Peace"
 HIP_tanks_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Previous Arisian rulers never had to resort to putting tanks in the streets to keep the population in line, but that was because they exploited the complacency and indolence of the Arisian population. The new Arisian state cannot tolerate indolence, so we need a firmer claw."
 HIP_embezzle_money:0 "Reinvest Wisely"
 HIP_embezzle_money_desc:0 "Aris is in a unique position in that it has 4 legal currencies: our own rapidly devaluing Seashell, but also those used by Wingbardy, Colthage and Chiropterra. This offers unique opportunities for savvy individuals to rightly compensate themselves for their great service to Aris, and to throw the moralistic do-gooders and prying auditors off our trail."
 HIP_subjugation_day:0 "Declare Liberation Day"
 HIP_subjugation_day_desc:0 "The Three Days of Freedom are excessive and an anachronism. We were not free during the bad old days, and our Colthaginian allies have rightly objected to us celebrating our previous cowardice in the face of the Storm King. The three days will be replaced with one day, observed on the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Mount Aris, to celebrate our true liberation and our new place in the world."
 HIP_remove_basic_decency:0 "Streamline Excessive Wages"
 HIP_remove_basic_decency_desc:0 "Defeat is an ugly word to describe our liberation, but nonetheless it is sometimes important to remember that our new friends did defeat us, both on the battlefield and in the workplace. Let that be a lesson to us: the Chiropterran Labourer and the Colthaginian indentured worker outproduced us, so clearly their model of wages and working hours is the way of the future."
 HIP_a_puppet_forever:0 "The Arisian Phoenix"
 HIP_a_puppet_forever_desc:0 "Aris is strong, Aris is stable, Aris is profitable. We could not have gotten here on our own, and in an increasingly interconnected world it would be foolish to expect us to be on our own in the future. Aris rises from the ashes, together!"

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand The Aurez Mines"
 HIP_expand_highwing_mines_desc:0 "Our surveyors have found massive deposits of tungsten under the Aurez hills.

 HIP_ain_tougot:0 "Urbanize Ain Trotgourait"

 HIP_self_rule:0 "Institute Self-Rule"
 HIP_self_rule_desc:0 "It only makes sense to restore Zumidia to its own state. The Zumidian people deserve to have a ruler of their own. The only question remaining is to what extent we should grant them autonomy. A new conference at Zerma should take care of that."

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"
 HIP_north_zebrican_union_desc:0 "It is time to formalize our cooperation with Zumidia into a North Zebrican Union. Mutual protection, economic aid and free trade, and scientific collaboration between our peoples will ensure a harmonic bulwark against any foreign threats."

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica:0 "Withdrawal From Zebrica"
 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place. We cannot risk entangling alliances on the continent, and so we should fully release Zumidia as a sovereign state. This is what's best for Zumidia too; they deserve to carve out their own destiny. Both of us will be happier as free, separate nations."

 HIP_north_zebrican_research:0 "North Zebrican Research Cooperative"
 HIP_north_zebrican_research_desc:0 "Education is what creates a people able to truly engage in politics without being swayed by rhetoric and thus to determine their own future.

 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses_desc:0 "Our magic is powerful, but it is clear that magic is not the only weapon is this world now. Heroes and monsters do not win battles, armies and weapons do. Adagio may not realize it, but we will need these things if we are to survive in this era now.

 HIP_SIR_lies_and_deception_desc:0 "Can you really trust the one they call Posada? Her claims of a new society may be grand, but they are rooted in a truly insidious ideology, one which is incompatible with "Harmony" itself.

 HIP_SIR_fear_and_doubt_desc:0 "Aris First tells you that they only have the interests of hippogriffs at heart and nothing more. But in truth, their ambitions are far greater than they would have you believe. Nationalism is a rot, a poison that kills everything you claim to fight for. It causes pain, suffering and death, and allowing it into your nation will cause all those things to closely follow."
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart:0 "Break Them Apart"
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart_desc:0 "The resistance is at a breaking point, the various factions at each other's throats.

 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary:0 "The Revolutionary"
 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary_desc:0 "Posada. A nobody turned firebrand revolutionary, and the face of the communist faction of the resistance. She holds perhaps the most disgusting ideology we have ever heard of, holding beliefs that all creatures are "equal" and that the world is meant to achieve some sort of "revolution" together. Such ideals have no place in our new domain, and neither does she."
 HIP_SIR_the_princess:0 "The Princess"
 HIP_SIR_the_princess_desc:0 "Princess Skystar is the linchpin in everything the resistance is and has done.

 HIP_SIR_the_nationalist_desc:0 "Crack Lightning, a wolf in sheep's clothing. Charismatic, intelligent, and deceptive. In a different situation, he might have even been able to take over this country. Unfortunately for him, we are the ones who hunt wolves.

 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution:0 "Death Of The Revolution"
 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "As we knew it would, Posada and her insidious ideology has finally fallen. Her supporters gone to the wind, her dreams shattered into dust, and the seapony herself being held in Seaquestria. All we need to do now is decide what her fate shall be."
 HIP_SIR_the_fall_of_aris:0 "The Fall Of Aris"
 HIP_SIR_the_fall_of_aris_desc:0 "Aris First is no more, its leadership in our hooves. The idea of a strong Aris, of any sort of nation separate from us is dead, as it should be.

 HIP_SIR_return_to_the_mainland_desc:0 "Ravaged by a "Storm King" just a few years prior, the Hippogriffs once had control over the territory known as Zumidia, who took the chaos created in our rise to break away as an independent nation.

 HIP_SIR_crescendo:0 "Crescendo"
 HIP_SIR_crescendo_desc:0 "Zumidia has fallen, as we knew it would. The new population of zebras will serve us well, as a new source of magic to feed off of.

 HIP_SIR_strike_the_colthaginians:0 "Strike The Colthaginians"
 HIP_SIR_strike_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "To the east lie the Colthaginians, a powerful nation of North Zebrica that could potentially rival us militarily in power if given the chance. Though it is not a part of our primary goal, that being revenge against those who banished us, a preemptive attack will ensure non-interference in our future affairs."
 HIP_SIR_ignore_the_distraction:0 "Ignore The Distraction"
 HIP_SIR_ignore_the_distraction_desc:0 "Colthage is nothing more than a distraction from our true goals, and going after such an irrelevant region would be nothing but a waste of time. Effort would be better spent fortifying the border not out of any fear, but to dissuade any thoughts from the Colthaginians of trying to press any notions of 'rightful land'. If they will leave us alone, than we shall do the same... for now."
 HIP_SIR_the_zonician_excuse:0 "The Zonician Excuse"
 HIP_SIR_the_zonician_excuse_desc:0 "Much of the propaganda used in Colthage for any conflict was based on some ancient cultural construct known as 'Zonicia', or a union of zebras in the region. While such claims are obviously pathetic compared to our right to rule all, it would serve well as an excuse to grab some more land we desire..."
 HIP_SIR_the_southern_threat:0 "The Southern Threat"
 HIP_SIR_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "Upon studying conflicts before our return, we have found that the nations of Quaggatai and Colthage have never had good relations. In fact, relations were actively hostile, with the former stealing land after the latter's weakness. The anger that the Zonicians have at such a perceived crime can now be used for an actual purpose; war against the ancient enemy of their proud culture."
 HIP_SIR_warzenas_mistake:0 "Warzena's Mistake"
 HIP_SIR_warzenas_mistake_desc:0 "When Hippogriffia was still under a weak harmonic monarchy, Warzena relied on them for protection believing that they would save them from any threats. Now, with us in charge, they have nowhere else to turn to. We are generous enough to offer a new kind of protection, however; a place as our subjects and a seat for the show."
 HIP_SIR_clean_the_mess:0 "Clean The Mess"
 HIP_SIR_clean_the_mess_desc:0 "The fact that Chiropterra still exists after a thousand years just goes to show that the Equestrians will never clean up after their own mistakes, especially their ancient ones. It's time for us to do what they won't, and wipe this mess that they left behind who plagued the region for over a thousand years. They will give up their faith and serve us alone now, whether they like it or not."
 HIP_SIR_against_the_menace:0 "Against The Menace"
 HIP_SIR_against_the_menace_desc:0 "Chiropterra is an interesting state, to put it mildly. Fanatically devoted to their goddess almost as much as our subjects are to us, they are nothing but a relic of a bygone era fighting for a failed cause. To say that others in North Zebrica hate them would be an understatement, and now that we are in direct conflict with them we can use those sentiments for a greater purpose."
 HIP_SIR_the_sandy_wastes:0 "The Sandy Wastes"
 HIP_SIR_the_sandy_wastes_desc:0 "Zarantia is little more than a desert wasteland, with little value to be gained from taking it. Yet, they hold a key piece we need, that being a connection to Maregypt, our future target. So, they too will experience the wonder that is our song, and be subjects to our rightful rule."
 HIP_SIR_wipe_the_slate:0 "Wipe The Slate"
 HIP_SIR_wipe_the_slate_desc:0 "A false state, Tobuck does not have a right to exist. Or at least, that seems to be the popular opinion here, with it surrounded by three nations that all claim it as their own. While their rhetoric turned out to be all bark and no bite, we will show that our demands are more than just words."
 HIP_SIR_leave_the_wetwork:0 "Leave The Wetwork"
 HIP_SIR_leave_the_wetwork_desc:0 "Being depopulated, hot and unindustrialized, spending time in Zarantia would be a complete waste of time for any of us. Our Constant and a few Beacons of Magic will be sent instead to deal with any issues that appear there; the Beacons will be able to pacify such a wasteland with relative ease, and perhaps the Constant will even be able to find some use from the endless dunes."
 HIP_SIR_under_our_spell:0 "Under Our Spell"
 HIP_SIR_under_our_spell_desc:0 "North Zebrica is ours, and all of the immediate threats to us have been dealt with. But as our spell and power expands, so too does our ambitions. It's time for us to focus on what we care about most; revenge against those who have wronged us, whether that be our neighbors to the west or our old homeland from across the seas."
 HIP_SIR_homophony:0 "Homophony"
 HIP_SIR_homophony_desc:0 "There are three sirens, but there can only be one leader. One voice must rise above the other two for them to follow. Our system of switching leads has worked so far, but it is time for a more permanent solution to be found in this regard. One siren must learn to fill the role, and the two must learn to follow their lead."
 HIP_SIR_destroy_the_insult:0 "Destroy The Insult"
 HIP_SIR_destroy_the_insult_desc:0 "Maregypt's existence is a stain upon this world, and a direct insult to us. They dare name their capital after one of those "Pillars of Equestria", the very same ponies who banished us all those years ago! Even now they harbor Somnambula herself, a figure of praise in their revisionist history. This will not stand."
 HIP_SIR_leave_no_trace:0 "Leave No Trace"
 HIP_SIR_leave_no_trace_desc:0 "The city of Somnambula, in particular its name, is an offense to our existence that we can not tolerate. They glorify one of the greatest villains of the ancient times, who kept creatures from enjoying the freedom and music we bring, and delegating us to mere legend. This city must be renamed, the old one being erased from history. No one will remember that blasted "Pillar" by the time we are done."
 HIP_SIR_the_ponies_of_maregypt:0 "The Ponies Of Maregypt"
 HIP_SIR_the_ponies_of_maregypt_desc:0 "The Maregyptians cannot be allowed any sort of leniency, especially with what they attempted in their history. Our Beacons must be sent en masse, their obedience guaranteed towards us. They are ours, now and forever. And we will make sure they never forget it."
 HIP_SIR_the_springboard:0 "The Springboard"
 HIP_SIR_the_springboard_desc:0 "Abyssinia is the last step in our plans westward in Zebrica. They hold no particular value themselves, but their land will be necessary for our invasion of Equestria across the ocean. With their petty territorial dispute with Maregypt and the Storm King's attack years ago, defeating them should be trivial." 
 HIP_SIR_primo_and_secondo:0 "Primo And Secondo"
 HIP_SIR_primo_and_secondo_desc:0 "Every siren needs a partner. A second fiddle to their melody. An accompaniment to support their music.

 HIP_SIR_the_islands_of_the_canterbbean:0 "The Islands Of The Canterbbean"
 HIP_SIR_the_islands_of_the_canterbbean_desc:0 "There are many small islands between Zebrica and Equestria, possible naval bases and staging points for our attack on the continent.

 HIP_SIR_our_natural_allies:0 "Our Natural Allies"
 HIP_SIR_our_natural_allies_desc:0 "We and the changelings are species that are similar yet opposites. They feed on love, we feed on hate. And yet we share a common goal; the fall of Equestria and Harmony. They too were disgraced by the ponies, banished back to their hives only a few years ago. They would make excellent, if temporary, allies against our common enemy."
 HIP_SIR_all_we_need_is_us:0 "All We Need Is Us"
 HIP_SIR_all_we_need_is_us_desc:0 "We do not need anyone else in our quest for vengeance. So-called 'allies' are nothing but weakness, a disgraceful idea akin to such ones as "friendship". The only thing we need is us, as sirens, to defeat anyone. We will not compromise, we will take all of our old homeland alone, no matter what it takes to do it!"
 HIP_SIR_consolidate_zebrica:0 "Consolidate Zebrica"
 HIP_SIR_consolidate_zebrica_desc:0 "While we fight a glorious war on Equus, we can not afford our Zebrican holdings to have any sort of insubordination or trouble, especially when our armies will be an ocean across. Necessity requires that problems no longer be a possibility, so both our loyal Constant and our Beacons of Magic will have their resources expanded to better achieve their duties at hoof."
 HIP_SIR_revenge:0 "Revenge"
 HIP_SIR_revenge_desc:0 "This is it, the moment we've been waiting for. And no, it's not lunch this time. Our great return back to our old feeding grounds, our great revenge; this is what everything we have done has led up to. The lands of Equestria shall fall, and the ponies shall return to how things should be; with us as their one and only masters!"
 HIP_SIR_the_partition:0 "The Partition"
 HIP_SIR_the_partition_desc:0 "The war is over, but our rule is not secure yet. The changelings did play a part in defeating the Equestrians, and they expect their share of the spoils. They do not trust us anywhere near actual negotiations, so we will send our Constant to discuss the terms of Equestria's land and ponies. The fate of the Pillars of Equestria will, of course, be non-negotiable."
 HIP_SIR_dealing_with_the_partners:0 "Dealing With The "Partners""
 HIP_SIR_dealing_with_the_partners_desc:0 "Our alliance was always meant to be temporary. A means to an end until we inevitably backstab them and being them into our musical fold. But pacifying Equestria will take time, and a long war against our former allies is not in our interests at the moment. One way or another, our relationship with our new neighbors must be resolved."
 HIP_SIR_sweep_the_remainder:0 "Sweep The Remainder"
 HIP_SIR_sweep_the_remainder_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen, but our work remains unfinished. Stalliongrad remains a disgusting communist thorn in our side, and the Crystal Empire harbors the Pillar Mistmane. An illegitimate breakaway and a realm banished just as we were. Both will fall so our victory is secure."
 HIP_SIR_the_jewels_of_equestria:0 "The Jewels Of Equestria"
 HIP_SIR_the_jewels_of_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria has changed. Where there was once farmland and mere peasant villages, there are now sprawling cities with millions of ponies all in a single place.

 HIP_SIR_learn_from_our_mistakes:0 "Learn From Our Mistakes"
 HIP_SIR_learn_from_our_mistakes_desc:0 "Despite the progress we've made, we can never stop learning from the present and the new experiences we have. Both us and our military have to be constantly able to adjust to new situations, new developments, and new tactics of warfare to remain effective. In particular now is our failures in the planning and supply during our invasion of Zumidia, issues that will now be rectified."
 HIP_SIR_the_spoils_of_zumidia:0 "The Spoils Of Zumidia"
 HIP_SIR_the_spoils_of_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia has something very important beneath the ground, reserves of Tungsten we will need for the future. The hippogriffs likely knew this, but they did little to exploit or extract the metal, either lacking the technology or not wanting to seem like imperialists or foolish reasons along those lines. We have no such qualms, and are certainly willing to put in the effort required."
 HIP_SIR_secure_the_mainland:0 "Secure The Mainland"
 HIP_SIR_secure_the_mainland_desc:0 "We can not rest just because Zumidia and the foothold on Zebrica is ours. If we do not act upon our gains, we could just as easily lose it. Railroads, infrastructure, defensive lines must be planned and constructed across the region so that when war inevitably comes, whether it be by us or by them, we will be prepared."
 HIP_SIR_lessons_of_the_invasion:0 "Lessons Of The Invasion"
 HIP_SIR_lessons_of_the_invasion_desc:0 "The invasion of Zumidia may have been easy compared to what the future has in store, but there are still important lessons we can take from it. Many of our enthralled soldiers did not have everything they needed to fight or occupy the territory, decreasing their effectiveness in the war. Developing specific sections of the army to fill such gaps could prove useful for later."
 HIP_SIR_factories_on_the_front:0 "Factories On The Front"
 HIP_SIR_factories_on_the_front_desc:0 "Zumidia is relatively unindustrialized compared to our holdings on Aris, and most of our industry remains on the latter. However, there may come a need where such an industry is required on Zumidia as well. Focusing on their capital of Ain Trotgourait would likely be a worthwhile investment."
 HIP_SIR_war_in_the_sky:0 "War In The Sky"
 HIP_SIR_war_in_the_sky_desc:0 "Land and sea may be important to hold, but the sky has always been a part of warfare as well. Creatures that fly have always had an advantage over those that don't, and the invention of the plane has made this third dimension even more crucial to fight in. Victory in every way must be guaranteed to secure success."
 HIP_SIR_literally_1984:0 "The Panopticon"
 HIP_SIR_literally_1984_desc:0 "A very interesting idea has been discovered, one that may hold much potential. Rough plans, sketches for a structure called a panopticon, which in theory would be able to watch hundreds of people from a single tower, while only needing one or two creatures stationed inside. Given how difficult the resistance was to deal with, acting on such measures may not be as ridiculous as first thought..."
 HIP_SIR_the_issue_of_races:0 "The Issue Of Races"
 HIP_SIR_the_issue_of_races_desc:0 "The conquest of North Zebrica has given us a multitude of races as our subjects, from the ponies and thestrals in Chiropterra to the zebras in Zarantia. While our policy of playing seaponies and hippogriffs against each other was practical and worked well before, such racial conflicts do not help us in creating a united and more importantly secure state. Something must be done."

 HIP_SIR_the_legacy_of_zonicia_desc:0 "One thing united the zebras of Colthage beyond borders, and that was a cultural idea of Zonicia. Adagio was right in it being irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, but that does not mean the idea has no use. We control all the zebras labeled as such, and they can be lumped into one region to make dealing with any issues that may arise slightly easier."
 HIP_SIR_industrialize_hippone:0 "Industrialize Hippone"
 HIP_SIR_industrialize_hippone_desc:0 "Hippone is a large city with potential, wasted on frivolities that bring no use. It was left wasting, but no longer. Bringing true modernity by force, we will turn it from a backwater to a shining star that may rival Colthage, all in service of us."
 HIP_SIR_rubber_plantations_of_kizil_zeb:0 "Rubber Plantations Of Kizil-Zeb"
 HIP_SIR_rubber_plantations_of_kizil_zeb_desc:0 "The Coltvans are a stubborn part of Colthage, waging a guerrilla war against their masters only to try and free themselves from the perceived chains of the landowners. This may have posed a problem to many, but for us the solution is simple; the local rubber plantations need zebras to work them, and they are an excellent place to keep zebras we think may be subversive against us."
 HIP_SIR_the_scientifids:0 "The Scientifids"
 HIP_SIR_the_scientifids_desc:0 "In Colthage, there was a class of zebras known as the Scientifids, who had a high amount of influence in the function of the state. They are scattered to the wind now, but many of their qualities are ones that would be useful to us. We will find the intellectuals left and bring them back together to serve us, and bring order and progress to our creatures."
 HIP_SIR_order_in_colthage:0 "Order In Colthage"
 HIP_SIR_order_in_colthage_desc:0 "The fall of the old and obsolete state has left a hole of authority in Colthage, one that we have yet to fill. Chaos runs rampant and threatens to spiral out of control without intervention. We will have order once again, whether the zebras like it or not."
 HIP_SIR_the_eastern_frontier:0 "The Eastern Frontier"
 HIP_SIR_the_eastern_frontier_desc:0 "To call Quaggatai a backwater or a wasteland would be an understatement compared to the more developed regions of North Zebrica. Should we be attacked from the east, though, it would be the first point of contact between our armies and them. The eventuality must be prepared for, and the infrastructure built up to keep the region connected to our other holdings."
 HIP_SIR_control_the_cities:0 "Control The Cities"
 HIP_SIR_control_the_cities_desc:0 "It is not the land that we have conquered that we care about, but the creatures that live on it. And nowhere are they more concentrated than the urban cities. These places must be the first we focus on, keeping our hold steady and stable so they in time become loyal and obedient thralls to our rule."
 HIP_SIR_shatter_the_chiropterrans:0 "Shatter The Chiropterrans"
 HIP_SIR_shatter_the_chiropterrans_desc:0 "Even with our song, our armies and our might, the Chiropterrans do not give up. They are relentless in their resistance, fighting us and our lessers at every opportunity. This will not stand. Swift retribution and decisive force will be used to blow any thought of fighting back away, and they will fall in line just like everyone else."
 HIP_SIR_for_wheelzies:0 "Motorize The Armies"
 HIP_SIR_for_wheelzies_desc:0 "Our armies must be mobile, flexible and well-supplied for future conflict at all times. A key part of all these points is the truck, the vehicle which allows speeds far beyond any non-mechanical method. Research will be put into improving such vital parts of warfare, so that our soldiers may always fight at their best."
 HIP_SIR_use_the_LMRD:0 "Use The LMRD"
 HIP_SIR_use_the_LMRD_desc:0 "The Legionary Medical Research Department, or commonly abbreviated as the LMRD was the primary medical and biological task force working for the state of Chiropterra. Some may consider their methods and results unethical, or their members as sociopaths, but such things do not bother us if they give results. It's time to give their facilities a visit."
 HIP_SIR_beneath_the_sand:0 "Beneath The Sand"
 HIP_SIR_beneath_the_sand_desc:0 "Adagio's Constant, despite his failings and his obvious self-interest, has actually found something of use for once. In Zarantia, massive wells of oil have been discovered, enough for us to possibly reach self-sufficiency with time. The "black gold" as it is called must be ours, whether it be by manipulation or force."
 HIP_SIR_chiropterran_military_tactics:0 "Chiropterran Military Tactics"
 HIP_SIR_chiropterran_military_tactics_desc:0 "The Chiropterran military, in particular the Legions was a highly skilled combat force, using experience and tactics that made them all the more effective. We will never be able to practically recreate such units, but we can adopt their most tested and useful strategies for our own uses."
 HIP_SIR_connect_the_north:0 "Connect The North"
 HIP_SIR_connect_the_north_desc:0 "It became painfully obvious during war that the various regions in Zebrica are unacceptably underdeveloped and disconnected from each other. If we are to get the most from all the creatures under our spell, we need to be able to reach them quickly and effectively. And that means building more railroads."
 HIP_SIR_underwater_colonies:0 "Underwater Colonies"
 HIP_SIR_underwater_colonies_desc:0 "Seaquestria has already proven itself almost untouchable by our enemies by sheer virtue of being deep beneath the waves. With that in mind, it would be a folly not to replicate its success elsewhere. Seapony colony cities along the coast will extend our influence into the seas and act as invincible bases from which to coordinate action, occupation and administration."
 HIP_SIR_bases_of_the_invasion:0 "Bases Of The Invasion"
 HIP_SIR_bases_of_the_invasion_desc:0 "The islands between Zebrica and Equus pale in comparison to our other holdings, but they have an important purpose nonetheless. They make important air and naval bases to station and maintain our air force and navy. Both of such places should be immediately expanded, so they can find a better purpose and fit better in that role."
 HIP_SIR_the_westward_railways:0 "The Westward Railways"
 HIP_SIR_the_westward_railways_desc:0 "Stretching across the central seas, we have once again run into the problem of the disconnect between Abyssinia, Maregypt and the rest of the mainland possessions due to incompetence in coordination between countries. Fortunately, it seems that the regions are already connected themselves, with a few holes to cover. That, we can manage ourselves."
 HIP_SIR_press_the_maregyptians:0 "Press The Maregyptians"
 HIP_SIR_press_the_maregyptians_desc:0 "We still haven't forgotten the insult the Maregyptians committed upon us by daring to vindicate and even memorialize a Pillar like Somnambula as a hero. Loss of independence and enthrallment is not enough of a punishment for them; even Adagio agrees on this for once. They need a harsh lesson in who controls who now, and perhaps some service in the military can teach them that lesson the hard way."
 HIP_SIR_four_cities_of_the_west:0 "Four Cities Of The West"
 HIP_SIR_four_cities_of_the_west_desc:0 "Adagia. R'ataphet. Coltoba. Panthera. These four cities make up the most important parts of Maregypt and Abyssinia, three of them being ports and shipyards along the coast. They must be expanded for that purpose, while Panthera will be turned into a city of factories producing more weapons for our war efforts."
 HIP_SIR_hold_the_seas:0 "Hold The Seas"
 HIP_SIR_hold_the_seas_desc:0 "The role of our navy will play a critical part in our war with the ponies. Not only will we need to make landfall, but also keep supply lines open across the ocean to keep our soldiers supplied as they ensure the fall of Equestria for us. Temporary measures will keep our naval dominance secure, at least for the war."
 HIP_SIR_bolster_the_garrisons:0 "Bolster The Garrisons"
 HIP_SIR_bolster_the_garrisons_desc:0 "The Equestrians will not quietly bow to our rule. That much we learned the hard way over a thousand years ago. There will be no chances taken this time; they will have no opportunity afforded to them. No matter how much it takes to send over, we will keep the ponies obedient, in line, and out of trouble until the war ends and we can focus on a more... permanent solution."
 HIP_SIR_the_elites_of_equestria:0 "The Elites Of Equestria"
 HIP_SIR_the_elites_of_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen, but its creatures remain. The process of integrating them as another part of our lands will be long, and unfeasible in any reasonable amount of time. That does not mean we can not start taking the first steps, though. The elites of former Equestria would be a good start; we just need to decide exactly who."
 HIP_SIR_what_is_music:0 "What Is Music?"
 HIP_SIR_what_is_music_desc:0 "We as sirens are the greatest musicians that this world has ever seen, and our voices are matched by none, whether it be in song or in sound. But others can create music too, and some things they have played are not that bad. Maybe they have talent that we should let show too?"
 HIP_SIR_hippogriffs_and_zebras:0 "Hippogriffs And Zebras"
 HIP_SIR_hippogriffs_and_zebras_desc:0 "The hippogriffs have experience on Zumidia, having run some sort of "mandate" for multiple years over them. We should put that experience to use, and send a few over to help keep things safe over there. After all, if they already know each other, everything will go better, right?"
 HIP_SIR_the_child_king:0 "The Child King"
 HIP_SIR_the_child_king_desc:0 "Apparently the King of Zumidia or whatever is a child who had some council ruling for him instead. Now Adagio wants me to go over and make sure that he'll work with us to keep his country pacified, since he's been behaving ever since she locked him in his own palace. She never told me exactly how to convince him, though..."
 HIP_SIR_combine_the_corporations:0 "Combine The Corporations"
 HIP_SIR_combine_the_corporations_desc:0 "Aria has given a pretty good suggestion, that being having all the hippogriffs merge their military corporations into one big one so we can manage them easier. We could even have them be separate from that bird Plumage for once, even if he gets mad about it. We can't have him do everything, after all."
 HIP_SIR_ending_the_mandate:0 "Ending The Mandate"
 HIP_SIR_ending_the_mandate_desc:0 "When the hippogriffs were here before, Zumidia was never meant to be more than a temporary mandate until a better solution could be found. But now, we are that better solution. With the Zumidians fully integrated under our control, any concept of another "mandate" has been replaced with full integration as a part of our lands."
 HIP_SIR_the_musical_rnd_department:0 "The Musical R&D Department"
 HIP_SIR_the_musical_rnd_department_desc:0 "Another idea by Aria was to create a sort of research group that we keep unenthralled, so that they can work well together to invent and create new things for us to use to take over the world! It sounds fun, and interesting too, which is surprising for something coming from that no-fun siren..."
 HIP_SIR_the_proposal:0 "The Proposal"
 HIP_SIR_the_proposal_desc:0 "Many would assume that we do not care about the lives of our subjects. That we see them as nothing more than pawns in a game. And they are pawns, but that does not mean we do not care about them in our own special way. A predator caring for its prey may be a strange idea, but we need to keep our sources of magic alive and well."
 HIP_SIR_survey_the_situation:0 "Survey The Situation"
 HIP_SIR_survey_the_situation_desc:0 "There's a lot we're going to have to do in North Zebrica, each place in a different way from the others. But, being honest, we have no idea what those things we need to do are, or even what's going on. Just looking around and figuring out what we need to do will be a good first step."
 HIP_SIR_bring_together_the_zebras:0 "Bring Together The Zebras"
 HIP_SIR_bring_together_the_zebras_desc:0 "In many ways, Warzena has a lot in common with Zumidia, a region which we've already got completely under our control. Therefore, the easiest and most straightforward option is to just make it an extended part of Zumidia, with the same methods we used for the zebras. It will still take a while, but this way we can just sit back and wait for everything to fix itself."
 HIP_SIR_pearl_of_the_bay:0 "Pearl Of The Bay"
 HIP_SIR_pearl_of_the_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck is a central city in North Zebrica, and possibly the most important one we've taken. Fortunately, there aren't that many problems with it, besides perhaps a few underground cells and a few warlords left behind in the chaos running around. Nothing too of notice, but fixing whatever small issues we need to will go a long way in this case."
 HIP_SIR_the_laborers_of_chiropterra:0 "The Laborers Of Chiropterra"
 HIP_SIR_the_laborers_of_chiropterra_desc:0 "There were two primary classes in Chiropterra; the regular loyalists, and the laborers taken from raids to work as practical slaves for their cause. Being such a totalitarian, oppressive regime, we could actually gain a major bit of goodwill for freeing them on their former masters. At the same time, the old system was efficient, and Aria wants to keep it around to keep all those creatures in check..."
 HIP_SIR_the_city_reclaimed:0 "The City Reclaimed"
 HIP_SIR_the_city_reclaimed_desc:0 "With any minor inconveniences solved, we can now go ahead and bring in Tobuck as an integral part of our lands, and as our newest creatures to fall under our complete control. We'll make better rulers than anyone else nearby anyway, right? We aren't some warlord who wants some crazy goal, and we do care about people, so that makes us the good guys!"
 HIP_SIR_music_and_the_moon:0 "Music And The Moon"
 HIP_SIR_music_and_the_moon_desc:0 "Chiropterra as a state, as a culture, everything about it revolved around one thing; bringing about the return of some alter-ego for an Equestrian princess. Their devotion rivaled even what those under our spell have, and it may be a good idea to pull that devotion out to make sure they praise us alone. Our song still keeps them compliant, however, so maybe that would be more trouble that it's worth?"
 HIP_SIR_dunes_of_zarantia:0 "Dunes Of Zarantia"
 HIP_SIR_dunes_of_zarantia_desc:0 "Considering the little population in Zarantia and the nature of the desert they live in, the full integration of the former nation could be described as little else but tedious. Fortunately, the same things that made it difficult also made it quick, and the matter of keeping the place under our control should be wrapped up soon, just like all the rest of the creatures here."
 HIP_SIR_a_mistake_rectified:0 "A Mistake Rectified"
 HIP_SIR_a_mistake_rectified_desc:0 "After a long period of reforms, tedious decision making, and generally unfun activities, the state of Chiropterra is, for better or for worse, an integral part of our holdings. Their population now serving us, they can finally find a use serving new masters, not some young and insane moon immortal."
 HIP_SIR_the_many_issues_of_colthage:0 "The Many Issues Of Colthage"
 HIP_SIR_the_many_issues_of_colthage_desc:0 "Colthage is, to an unfortunately degree, a place of many problems and few obvious solutions. So little solutions, in fact, that for once I don't know where to even begin with it. I should talk with Aria or Adagio; maybe they'll know how to help me deal with the zebras?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_land:0 "On The Issue Of Land"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_land_desc:0 "Land was and still is an ever-present question in Colthage, one that has divided landowner and peasant for years now, particularly in the region of Coltva. There are no issues or rebellion from the peasant masses anymore, of course, but the fact remains we still need to take a side in this debate. Who should control and own the land on our behalf?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_politics:0 "On The Issue Of Politics"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_politics_desc:0 "It turns out that none of us three want to actually move to Colthage and make sure everything works there. Go figure. However, the hole in authority that we left by taking over still has to be filled by someone, even as they are still subject to us. The question in this case is; who will that be?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_nationalism:0 "On The Issue Of Nationalism"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_nationalism_desc:0 "There are two tangible movements of nationalism simultaneously in Colthage; one of pan-Zonicianism and one of regionalism. Each has its own use, whether it be for keeping the Colthaginians together or driving them apart. We can't support both of them at once obviously, so the choice lies not in whether we care about Zonicia, but how divided we want them to be."
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_collaboration:0 "On The Issue Of Collaboration"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_collaboration_desc:0 "No region would be complete or secure at this point without our Constant getting his claws dug somewhere in it. We can't just let him choose whoever he wants in Colthage, though. This will require a bit more finesse, and he will work with who we tell him to work with, no matter his opinion on it."
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_centralism:0 "On The Issue Of Centralism"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_centralism_desc:0 "The relationship between the city of Colthage and the land it is supposed to control is a tenuous one. When it was a state, there was apparently many a debate on how centralized or federalist the nation should be. Allowing the city the total control many wanted would stabilize the nation-region, but some could say that is a bad thing in our case. The final decision is up to us."
 HIP_SIR_expand_the_systems:0 "Expand The Systems"
 HIP_SIR_expand_the_systems_desc:0 "We have more land and enthralled creatures now, but just because they once fought us doesn't mean they should be treated differently from the hippogriffs and zebras of before. The systems we have created must be focused on and expanded to everyone so that they can also benefit from our decisions."
 HIP_SIR_the_question_of_manedalusia:0 "The Question Of Manedalusia"
 HIP_SIR_the_question_of_manedalusia_desc:0 "Manedalusia was a very contested area between Maregypt and Abyssinia, who both saw it as their own rightful land. Both of their peoples would appreciate it officially being regarded as a part of their region, and now we have ended up as the mediators. The Maregyptians are our enemies, yeah, but maybe that's exactly why they should get the region..."
 HIP_SIR_maregyptian_integration:0 "Maregyptian Integration"
 HIP_SIR_maregyptian_integration_desc:0 "Now that the Manedalusia issue is solved, we can finally start the process of making sure they never think of making fun of us again. They honoured Somnambula once, and now we can make them honour us in the same way; we are now the heroes in the story, and they'll learn that soon enough."
 HIP_SIR_business_in_abyssinia:0 "Business In Abyssinia"
 HIP_SIR_business_in_abyssinia_desc:0 "Unlike Maregypt, which was an insult to us, or North Zebrica which was an important part of our initial expansion, Abyssinia was purely a target to give us another place from which to launch invasions towards Equus. We needed the land, not the creatures, so our stance towards them can be relatively lax. As long as they stay in line and do as we say, we can leave them to their own devices."
 HIP_SIR_reopen_the_skydocks:0 "Reopen The Skydocks"
 HIP_SIR_reopen_the_skydocks_desc:0 "Criminals, thieves and murderers. All make their home in the city of Klugetown, a place that despite its seedy underground remained a thriving trading port before our takeover. That underground now serves as a hotbed of resistance against us, something that will not stand. We will root out such villains and return it to how it should be; a place of our laws, and our rules alone."
 HIP_SIR_state_of_the_ponies:0 "State Of The Ponies"
 HIP_SIR_state_of_the_ponies_desc:0 "We've beaten the ponies, forced the Equestrians to serve us. But, there is still the matter of the old regime to think about. Ponies loved their Princesses, some seeing them as deities that protected them. But now... let's see how they feel about us."
 HIP_SIR_the_future_of_equus:0 "The Future Of Equus"
 HIP_SIR_the_future_of_equus_desc:0 "And yet, ultimately the opinion they have of us is ultimately irrelevant. We choose the future, we call the shots, we lead and they follow us. Whatever we say goes, and that is how sirens rule. It is not a question of whether they will follow us, but how we tell them to."
 HIP_SIR_recapitulation:0 "Recapitulation"
 HIP_SIR_recapitulation_desc:0 "A time is coming to a close. This is not the ending, but it is an ending nonetheless. I've done a lot, and I guess I've learned a lot too. Maybe I should look back and see everything now that we've won.\n\nThere's still a lot to think about, after all."
 
 
 # Adagio Focuses
 HIP_SIR_ADG_true_nature:0 "True Nature"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_true_nature_desc:0 "Aria and Sonata are gone. I am the only one left, the only one to finish the task we were supposed to do together. But if that is how things are, so be it. I will show the whole world what the true nature of a siren is, no matter what it takes."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_accelerando:0 "Accelerando"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_accelerando_desc:0 "The others were always the ones to deal with occupation, not me. I left such trivial matters aside, but no longer can I do so. The cattle need to be leashed, and they need to be controlled without having me constantly keep them in line. I have my eyes on more important things, after all."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_last_holdout:0 "The Last Holdout"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_last_holdout_desc:0 "I have Equestria, but one piece has remained out of my reach. New Mareland, a colony founded on the final continent of Griffonia, is the last remnant of their rule, home to ponies that came from the mainland. A siren never leaves a job unfinished, and if I am ever to take the rest of Griffonia some day, there is no better place to start than them."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_one_above_all:0 "One Above All"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_one_above_all_desc:0 "A siren is above all else. And yet, now there is only one siren left. Until that situation changes, I lead alone, I sing alone, and only I can take what I rightfully deserve. Even if I am left, abandoned by my partners, it is still my right and my choice to continue onwards. If it can not be us, it will have to be me."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_magic_of_home:0 "The Magic of Home"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_magic_of_home_desc:0 "Equestria was and always will be my home, yet I have been terribly lax in ensuring they pay their due. That ends today. The ponies need to be reminded who their master is, just as their ancestors did over a thousand years ago. They all struggle and fight at first, but even so, they will learn to love a siren in time."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_question_of_the_beacons:0 "Question of the Beacons"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_question_of_the_beacons_desc:0 "The Beacons of Music have served well for many years, performing far above my expectations. I do not question their usefulness, but their existence does raise other questions that need to be addressed. They are still all mortals in the end, and should they really have even a taste of a siren's magic? One could even call it an insult to a real siren..."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_divine_right:0 "Divine Right"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_divine_right_desc:0 "Divinity has always been a particularly hated topic of mine. For years I believed there was no such thing, especially one made up by mortals. Those alicorns certainly weren't anything close either. But things change, and there is no question that a siren should be revered as much as any god or goddess. Why not make them one and the same thing?"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_my_loyal_servant:0 "My Loyal Servant"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_my_loyal_servant_desc:0 "Plumage Moonfeather has time and time again proven to be a loyal, competent and trustworthy subordinate, which is in very short supply lately. Such traits should be rewarded, and someone else needs to do the tasks that the other sirens once did. With whatever resources he needs available, I am sure he will be up to the task."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_a_storm_of_hatred:0 "A Storm of Hatred"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_a_storm_of_hatred_desc:0 "Hate is what I feed on. It is the basis of every siren's power, what makes one grow stronger with more magic to use. It is also the one thing that those mortals are good for, whenever they aren't being a nuisance. Rarely do they need a good reason to tear each other to shreds, as the past thousand years have shown. With a little push I can easily provide, they'll be practically begging for someone to hate."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_what_they_deserve:0 "What They Deserve"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_what_they_deserve_desc:0 "What do creatures that aren't sirens deserve? Absolutely nothing, that is what. They have proven time and time again to appreciate nothing, banishing us, shunning us and even managing to break our partnership. Any notions of value their lives have past serving a siren is ludicrous. They are to be used, played with and cast aside when they have served their purpose. Is having the privilege of being controlled by a siren not enough, anyways?"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_star_of_the_show:0 "The Star of the Show"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_the_star_of_the_show_desc:0 "A world of nothing but ruling is not what was meant to be for sirens. We achieved all of this, we built back up a realm where the natural order of things could exist again, and we will not be denied the credit due. There will be praises sung in our name, endless adoration thrown at our hooves. To have the right to merely stand before a siren is the reward of its own."
 HIP_SIR_ADG_to_rule_the_world:0 "To Rule the World"
 HIP_SIR_ADG_to_rule_the_world_desc:0 "This is what everything has led up to. All the work, all the sacrifices we have made, it has been for this moment. To conquer the rest of this pathetic world, to ensure every corner pays tribute, to bring back siren rule as things should be. Only then will I be able to watch the sun rise over a grateful world, a world set right after over a millenia of wrongs."
 
 
 # Aria Focuses
 HIP_SIR_ARI_eternal_reign:0 "Eternal Reign"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_eternal_reign_desc:0 "With Adagio and Sonata out of the way, I can finally get to work on what we should have been doing all along. It doesn't matter how fast I conquer the world if I am overthrown right after. Only when my rule is forever secure can I finally continue."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_stabilize_the_occupation:0 "Stabilize the Occupation"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_stabilize_the_occupation_desc:0 "At the moment, the entire system of control is reliant on a single thing, that being the magic of song. If said magic were to break one day, everything would fall apart. Such methods are unsustainable; an alternative must be found and transitioned to immediately."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_safety_below_the_waves:0 "Safety Below the Waves"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_safety_below_the_waves_desc:0 "The most secure location is not on land, but within the deep ocean, as Seaquestria has clearly demonstrated. Though it will take extensive time and effort to construct, a great base deep within the Mareiana Trench will provide the utmost security, only accessible to those I desire."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_personal_dangers:0 "Personal Dangers"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_personal_dangers_desc:0 "I am surrounded by those who would only seek my demise if they had the chance. Very few genuinely have positive feelings about a siren, and it seems inevitable that some day an attack on my life will be made. The only option left is to prepare for that day, so that any plot is destined to fail."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_magical_desaturation:0 "Magical Desaturation"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_magical_desaturation_desc:0 "Magic is something a siren never seems to have enough of, or at least in Adagio's opinion. The only way to get more is to either put more creatures under the spell, or to intensify its effects on others. Unfortunately, neither of those options are practical for the current situation. A decision must be made."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_repurpose_the_beacons:0 "Repurpose the Beacons"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_repurpose_the_beacons_desc:0 "The Beacons of Magic were one of the few ideas Adagio had that was actually useful. However, they were completely misused, as usual. The Beacons are not meant to just be extensions of a siren; they should be used sparingly, to muzzle dissent where it rises and shut down any idea of resistance. After all, creatures are much more compliant when they listen to the music."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_rebuild_the_pearl:0 "Rebuild the Pearl"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_rebuild_the_pearl_desc:0 "To effectively control a nation, one must control its people. At the current moment, hippogriffs have the freedom to change into seaponies at will, and vice versa. But this was not always the case, and it will no longer be soon. With a new Pearl of Transformation in my hooves, they will both stay where they belong, and exactly where I want them."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_tighten_the_reins:0 "Tighten the Reins"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_tighten_the_reins_desc:0 "There is one particular parasite that has been feeding off the success of Sirenalia for far too long, and that is the Constant that Adagio hired, Plumage Moonfeather. For years now has he been scheming for his own benefit, skimming off when he thought no one would notice. But I did, and its time to remind him where his loyalties should lie."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_practical_servitude:0 "Practical Servitude"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_practical_servitude_desc:0 "Adagio reveled in the suffering of the mortals. Sonata spent time with them and treated them with worth. Neither of these approaches were right. They are of little value, but their pain brings me nothing. Only their servitude matters, and if they are willing to do that, then they may carry on with their pathetic lives in peace."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_the_pyramid_of_power:0 "The Pyramid of Power"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_the_pyramid_of_power_desc:0 "The system of running things up until this point has mostly just been throwing things at a wall and seeing what sticks. While it was effective enough at keeping Sirenalia going, it also presents many inefficiencies. A better, more streamlined hierarchy of power will do much for future endeavours, as well as allowing me unrestrained control over the matters of state."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_every_piece_in_place:0 "Every Piece in Place"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_every_piece_in_place_desc:0 "If the nation is a tool, then the people who run it are the glue that holds that tool together. Without them, the entire thing is useless and falls apart at the first use. But it is also about knowing where they need to be and ensuring they do what they need to do. And most of all, to control it all from the top, ever watching to ensure that nocreature steps out of line. Ever."
 HIP_SIR_ARI_patience:0 "Patience"
 HIP_SIR_ARI_patience_desc:0 "All good things come in time. I need to be in no rush to force the rest of the world under my hoof; it does not matter whether they fall today, tomorrow or even the next century. But they will fall, as long as I strike when the time is right. But until that time comes, I will wait. Wait, and watch."
 
 
 # Sonata Focuses
 HIP_SIR_SNA_the_task_ahead:0 "The Task Ahead"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_the_task_ahead_desc:0 "What Sonata is attempting to accomplish is a feat never seen before by all sirenkind; rule without magic, over masses who would willingly submit to their betters. Obviously, we are a long way off from that dream ever becoming reality, but the task at hoof remains one we must see through to the end. So, let's begin."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_securing_loyalties:0 "Securing Loyalties"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_securing_loyalties_desc:0 "Every leader needs a middlemare. Someone to handle the day-to-day aspects of governing so that we can focus on the broader picture. And if we're going to end the spell, we're going to need a lot more of those - and more importantly, make sure they're truly loyal to us, no matter what happens. Unfortunately, those people are few and far between..."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_territorial_reorganization:0 "Territorial Reorganization"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_territorial_reorganization_desc:0 "The current state of Sirenalia is a patchwork of regions that in essence are just whatever we decided they should look like at the time. As one could imagine, that is not the best way to run a country trying to free itself from the reliance of enthrallment. The only thing left is to wipe the slate clean, burning the system down. From the ashes a new Sirenalia will be born, evolved and tamed."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_siren_of_the_people:0 "Siren of the People"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_siren_of_the_people_desc:0 "An unfortunate fact of Sirenalia is that if you are not a siren, you have no voice. Or at least, not one that matters anyway. Such is the way a siren must rule, but that doesn't mean that we will forget about those who serve us. It is a siren's responsibility to care for those that have brought them where they are, and that is just what Sonata is planning to do."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_limited_demagification:0 "Limited Demagification"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_limited_demagification_desc:0 "Cutting the spell entirely, all at once, is a recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, it's also the only way we can really end this system for good. However, we can still run a bit of a test trial in this regard, so to speak. By ending the spell in limited amounts within areas we believe we can stabilize, we can slowly rid ourselves of Magic, as well as see just how bad things might be soon..."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_an_end_to_the_beacons:0 "An End to the Beacons"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_an_end_to_the_beacons_desc:0 "The Beacons have served their purpose, and with our music being scaled back they no longer are of use to us. Instead, they will be allowed to return to their normal lives, or serve to help in the advancement of Sirenalia's progress. Sonata has also agreed to let Aria keep a few willing subjects with their gems, in case of any... emergency situations."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_the_musical_diarchy:0 "The Musical Diarchy"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_the_musical_diarchy_desc:0 "Now that Adagio is gone, there is only two. Sonata and Aria, the dual sirens that rule. But neither will make the same mistake they did before; they must rule as equals, even if Aria is willing to let Sonata take the metaphorical lead in her ideas for Sirenalia. Hopefully, this will even get them to stop arguing for longer than a few hours."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_replace_the_constant:0 "Replace the Constant"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_replace_the_constant_desc:0 "Sonata has never liked Plumage Moonfeather very much. Aria can sympathize with that sentiment. It's blatantly obvious that not only is he in it for himself (which is the standard for all our collaborators), but that he's also been stealing whatever he thinks we won't notice off the top. It's time to find someone a bit more loyal to our actual interests, one who preferably isn't chronically materialistic."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_restructured_collaboration:0 "Restructured Collaboration"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_restructured_collaboration_desc:0 "The current network of collaborators is held together by nothing more than bribes, threats and a few hopes and dreams. While it works, it isn't exactly the most sustainable thing in the world. With Somnambula's help, we should be able to get some more... principled creatures to form a new, better system."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_public_holidays:0 "Public Holidays"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_public_holidays_desc:0 "Everyone in Sirenalia works hard, from the worker who toils for the betterment of Sirenalia to Sonata herself who rules from above. But no one can be expected to work all the time. There needs to be times to celebrate, to have fun and relax, and to be yourself. No one knows that better than Sonata, and she can not wait to get to know her new subjects from a new perspective."
 HIP_SIR_SNA_benevolent_rulership:0 "Benevolent Rulership"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_benevolent_rulership_desc:0 "Creatures can't rule themselves. Over thousands of years they only thing they've proven is that they'll constantly fight for reasons they don't understand, causes they don't believe in. The only way left is the rule of a siren, to guide them to a better future whether they want it or not. Whether they hate or love their leaders, all of them must be saved from their worst enemy - themselves."

 HIP_SIR_colthaginian_chaos_2_desc:0 "With various warlords given almost complete control over Colthage, the region has fallen into complete and utter chaos, with the rule of law and order being replaced with pillaging, violence and hatred towards one another. The nation of Colthage as an idea is no more, as we struggle just to keep the disorder contained and in a degree of our control. However, the magic benefits from this state of affairs can not be understated."

 HIP_SIR_SNA_grateful_population_desc:0 "While 'grateful' may be stretching it as a term, one can not deny that recent moves have made many in Sirenalia much more motivated in their daily lives.

 HIP_SIR_SNA_together_forever:0 "Together Forever"
 HIP_SIR_SNA_together_forever_desc:0 "Sirens are guardians. Creatures are subjects, whether willing or not, who need to be ruled over.

This has already manifested in the use of magical weaponry, but we must go further.

Although the venerable slugthrower will be very hard to improve on, our scientists are surely up to the task."
 HIP_future_tank:0 "Project SHATTER"
 HIP_future_tank_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are obviously the future of armored warfare, but current heavies simply aren't powerful enough and run into problems with their transmissions and engines. A true super-heavy tank, not merely an upscaled heavy but a tank designed to kill them, will provide a powerful front-line advantage over heavy tanks and comfortable superiority against anything lighter.\n\nTo be properly useful, of course, it will have to be amphibious as well."
 HIP_future_bomber:0 "Project STARFIRE"
 HIP_future_bomber_desc:0 "Traditional bombers remain highly vulnerable to fighters and interceptors. To counter this threat and truly become a global power, we will have to design something radically different. Flying far faster and higher than traditional bombers, our Valkyrie will be virtually invulnerable to conventional AA as well as interceptors. While this may necessitate some compromises in other parts of the design, it will surely prove worthwhile once completed."

 HIP_nuclear_air_to_air_missiles_desc:0 "A single strategic bomber can rightfully be called a "Flying Fortress," and an entire formation of them is extremely difficult for our fighters to engage. Project FALLOUT would see some of our fighters armed with unguided air-to-air rockets tipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead: the massive blast wave would turn enemy bomber's formations against them, downing an entire wing in a single fireball."
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges_desc:0 "Our current depth charges are effective, but due to their limited blast radius they often fail to disable their targets, particularly if the submarine detects the charge and changes depth before it goes off. The Exotic Weaponry Commission has come up with a solution to that problem which some are calling overkill: arming our depth charges with low-yield nuclear bombs, to kill every submarine in the area regardless of changing depth."
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines:0 "Project TATZLWURM"
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines_desc:0 "Our pioneer corps could benefit from the recent explosion of new uses for nuclear technology. If we could engineer a safe, reliable demolition charge with a nuclear payload, it would make collapsing large buildings and clearing out the biggest minefields so much easier. They could also serve quite well as area-denial weapons."
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines:0 "Project BARNACLE"
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines_desc:0 "While it may seem insane to leave nuclear weapons floating around in the ocean, the fact is that a single naval mine, if equipped with a nuclear payload, can sink entire flotillas of enemy vessels, and can effectively deny a much larger area to the enemy since enemy vessels those far away from the blast could be damaged or sunk."
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos:0 "Project BARRACUDA"
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos_desc:0 "One obvious naval application of nuclear weapons is in torpedoes.

The idea of equipping even our ground forces with nuclear weapons is tantalizing, although Terrafin is quick to point out the logistical and strategic limitations of such an endeavour. Still, if the project is successful its value in destroying armoured formations, area denial, attacking fortifications, and sheer Shock and Awe cannot be overstated."
 HIP_air_launched_cruise_missiles:0 "Project STANDOFF"

 HIP_ground_effect_vehicle:0 "Project TIDALWAVE"
 HIP_ground_effect_vehicle_desc:0 "Planes flying low over the water have reported a curious increase to their lift, dubbed the "ground effect". This may make possible larger plane/boat hybrids, capable of moving extremely fast and avoiding enemy RADAR by simply flying under it.

 ### EVENTS ###
 hippogriff.1.t: "Hurricane!"
 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."
 hippogriff.1.a: "So much destruction..."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Clawbeak, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face, so it faces stiff opposition.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."
 hippogriff.100.b:0 "The heavy tank is the way to go."
 hippogriff.100.c:0 "Perhaps Clawbeak is on to something after all?"

 hipflavour.1.t:0 "Foreign Literature In Universities"
 hipflavour.1.desc:0 "Ever since we exposed ourselves to the outside world after our long sequester in Seaquestria, foreign products have been coming into Hippogriffia. Perhaps the most important of these are books, and the ideas they hold. From works of literature to science to philosophy, our younger generation are voraciously devouring this new reading material, and as they do so, they pick up some of these ideas and make them their own.\n\nOf greatest concern to us are the political ideas they have been absorbing: while Hippogriffia has always been a stable absolute monarchy, many among the younger generation are now discovering that there are other ways of organizing society, ranging from constitutionalism to republicanism to nationalism to even the most radical ideas, such as fascism and communism. Right now their curiosity is intellectual, but we know how fast these intellectual ideas can take hold, and the threat they could eventually pose to our rule."
 hipflavour.1.a:0 "We should keep an eye on this."

 hipflavour.2.t:0 "The Socialist And Liberal Clubs"
 hipflavour.2.desc:0 "New ideas are spreading across Hippogriffia, brought in by our renewed contact with the outside world. Clubs have formed discussing and spreading these ideas, which range from liberal ideas of free trade and representative government inspired by the Griffonian "three principles" to more radical ones: Syndicalist writings (both of the national- and revolutionary- varieties) from Wingbardy and Aquileia have attracted readers, and some clubs even promote communist ideas imported from Stalliongrad, although none have yet called for anything violent. Most of the membership of these clubs consist of curious young griffs prone to experimentation, as well as a few older ones who are dissatisfied with the monarchy and its handling of the Storm King's invasion."
 hipflavour.2.a:0 "It's their right to exist."
 hipflavour.2.b:0 "Order them to be shut down."

 hipflavour.3.t:0 "The Aris First Committee"
 hipflavour.3.desc:0 "A group of veterans, protectionist economists, and community activists gathered together today to announce the formation of the Aris First Committee, a group "Dedicated to preserving traditional Hippogriffian values and protecting our economy from foreign takeover." The most prominent leaders were seapony Raft Wood, the Queen's former advisor who had first proposed the move to Seaquestria, and hippogriff flying ace Crack Lightning, who gave a patriotic speech at the opening of the committee:\n\n"Mount Aris stands tall, and like the mountain we must stand alone. We cannot depend on foreigners to help us, and neither should they depend on us. We have always been strong, self-sufficient, and proud of our cultures and traditions, and the Aris First committee will see that that stays true into the 11th century and beyond."\nHe was met with thunderous applause, and launched into the second half of his speech with even more vigor: "Liberal intellectuals would have us believe that harmony means opening our markets and our borders to everycreature, or funneling money and resources into charity projects in the North Zebrican Mandate. I believe harmony means a well-ordered, self-sufficient society that looks after its own. Aris First stands for the auto worker who is tired of seeing foreign cars drive their wages down, for the veteran tired of zebras accusing us of cowardice when we defeated the Storm King, for the small business owner tired of competing with foreign conglomerates who cheat the market. More than that, Aris First stands for our culture, our values, our history, and for a bright future for all Hippogriffia!"\n\nMany newspapers have denounced Aris First as xenophobic, backwards, or fearmongering. Still, their membership is quickly swelling, particularly in Seaquestria where seaponies see very little to gain from international trade, as there are few foreign products they want and many are concerned about underwater manufacturing being unable to compete with industrial giants in Equestria and Griffonia."
 hipflavour.3.a:0 "It's good to see them standing up for our values."
 hipflavour.3.b:0 "We must accept progress and not seek to shut out the world."

 hipflavour.4.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 hipflavour.4.banned.desc:0 "Banning the socialist book clubs has not eliminated these ideas, it seems. Reports trickle in daily of these clubs organizing in the nooks and crannies of Seaquestria, and of more and more of our citizens gravitating towards this enticing "forbidden knowledge." From what little information we have on these meetings, their disdain for the government has grown since we banned them, and while they once talked of abstract ideals, they have now become more like conspiratorial groups plotting revolution.\n\nAmong the seaponies, the largest of these underground groups are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving "a post-scarcity society" but only if it is revolutionized into a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRecently, we have received a tipoff that the anarchists and communists are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition, presumably with the aim of combining their forces for some plot against the government."
 hipflavour.4.desc:0 "The socialist book clubs have begun spreading outside the universities, as idealistic students try to spread their ideas among the general populace. While many of these groups profess "harmonic socialist" and "democratic socialist" ideals and want to work with the government to implement socialist economics in Hippogriffia, there is an undercurrent of sedition in these groups, as they all want at least as much devolution of power away from the monarchy as the liberals do.\n\nMore alarmingly, some of these groups openly call for the complete transformation of Hippogriffia. These more radical groups are gaining popularity among the poorer seaponies and hippogriffs who are skeptical of the possibility of reform. The largest of these radicals among the seaponies are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living.\n\nMeanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving a "post-scarcity society" but only if it is transformed into a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nWhile these groups are currently small, their membership is rapidly growing, and news has reached us that they are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition of some kind, presumably organized around whichever faction's ideas prove most persuasive."
 hipflavour.4.a:0 "Cracking down would do more harm than good."
 hipflavour.4.b:0 "Break up this conference at once!"

 hipflavour.5.t:0 "Three Days Of Freedom"
 hipflavour.5.d1:0 "Today marks the end of the national celebration known as the Three Days of Freedom. This is a relatively new holiday, originally created by Queen Novo as a one day celebration during our exile in Seaquestria. After we emerged victorious over the Storm King and returned to Mount Aris, the holiday was expanded to three days.\n\nOn the first day, celebrations are held all across Seaquestria to thank the ocean for protecting us. Seaponies gather with friends and family to enjoy undersea dinners and traditional activities like sea-dancing and whale-singing. On the second day festivities commence in Aris. Hippogriffs celebrate the Storm King's defeat with parties and live music performances, with the largest concert being held on the Harmonizing Heights. On the third and final day, all creatures come together to celebrate the return of our freedom. Seaponies and hippogriffs are encouraged to meet up on beaches for large mixed parties. At the end of the day parents and prominent community members give out presents for the children. In the capital, Queen Novo herself distributes presents to local children in a special ceremony.\n\nDespite being new, the Three Days of Freedom are already extremely popular in both Aris and Seaquestria. In light of the emerging societal divide between hippogriffs and seaponies, many creatures see the holiday as a celebration of national unity as well as past victory."
 hipflavour.5.d2:0 "Today is a somber today, as it would have marked the end of the national celebration known as the Three Days of Freedom.

With the current circumstances, not many saw a point to 'national unity'. The days were silent, and so was Hippogriffia, perhaps just a bit darker as the holiday came and went with nogriff to celebrate it."
 hipflavour.5.a:0 "Three cheers for Hippogriffia!"
 hipflavour.5.b:0 "No more fun and games."

 hippogriff.16.t:0 "Crack Lightning Returns"
 hippogriff.16.desc:0 "Aviator and Storm War hero Crack Lightning touched down at Queen Novo Airport this morning to an awaiting crowd of reporters and fans. His trusty custom-built aeroplane, the Spirit of Starfield, gleamed in the morning light as it taxied to its parking spot. His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n\n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day. We need to remain strong in the face of this violent new world, and reject these foreign ideas which would disrupt our peaceable way of life.""
 hippogriff.16.a:0 "There's a big world out there. More hippogriffs should experience it."
 hippogriff.16.b:0 "Perhaps we should listen to his concerns."

 hippogriff.2.t:0 "A Meeting with Hippogriffs"
 hippogriff.2.desc:0 "A delegation from Hippogriffia met with Director Arclight today, requesting assistance from the OHS for a similar body called the "Anti Harmonic Activities Committee" in Hippogriffia. The Director was quite sympathetic to their case, as ever since they opened up their country they have been inundated with fascist, communist and other anti-harmonic radicals trying to spread their ideologies and undermine one of the few harmonist states in North Zebrica.\n\nThey requested we share our experience combatting communist influence in Rijekograd, as well as conduct joint training exercises for their agents to better prepare them to nip subversive activity in the bud. "
 hippogriff.2.a:0 "We're happy to help our fellow defenders of Harmony."
 hippogriff.2.b:0 "Our interests lie elsewhere."

 hippogriff.3.t:0 "The OHS Accepts Our Request"
 hippogriff.3.desc:0 "Good news! The OHS has sent us a letter accepting our request to share information and training, and to coordinate our efforts in guarding harmony in our nations. In his letter to us, Director Arclight praised the AHAC's efforts at securing Hippogriffia against subversion. His letter also contained the first of hopefully many lessons from the OHS, gleaned from many years of combating communism in Rijekograd. He warned us was to stay vigilant against all forms of socialism, even so-called moderates, stating that "Behind every Nova Whirl there is a Caramel Haze. Behind every so-called 'Democratic Socialist' there is a tyrannical overlord waiting to be unleashed." Violet Facade read this out before the committee, which has taken this warning to heart."
 hippogriff.3.a:0 "We'll defend harmony together."

 hippogriff.4.t:0 "The OHS Rejects Our Request"
 hippogriff.4.desc:0 "Unfortunately, the OHS has rejected our request for cooperation. In a perfunctory letter, Director Arclight indicated that while he applauded our vigilance against anti-harmonic subversion, he considered it "Hardly in the interests of the River Republic to share intelligence, personnel or classified training material with a monarchy halfway across the world."\n\nThis has been met with disappointment by the AHAC, who had hoped that the vaunted expertise of the OHS in suppressing communist radicals within Rijekograd would prove useful in rooting out similar extremists here. The committee has elected to thank Director Arclight for his consideration, but not to push the issue further as it is clear that his mind is made up."
 hippogriff.4.a:0 "We shouldn't put our faith in foreigners."

 hippogriff.5.t:0 "A Meeting With Hippogriffs"
 hippogriff.5.desc:0 "A delegation from Hippogriffia has arrived with an unusual request. Citing concerns about growing communist and fascist influence in Hippogriffia, as well as the threat of infiltration from foreign powers, they have requested to coordinate a program where their "Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee" would share intelligence and training with SMILE. Director Bon Bon is enthusiastic about this plan, saying that it is just as important to protect harmony in Hippogriffia as it is in Equestria, but Princess Twilight Sparkle has expressed some reservations. She sees some of the AHAC's actions, such as the censoring of books, as unacceptably stifling to learning and damaging to the trust between Queen Novo and her subjects. She has suggested we politely decline the AHAC's offer. Ultimately, the decision is ours."
 hippogriff.5.a:0 "We're more than happy to help our Hippogriff friends."
 hippogriff.5.b:0 "We want no part in this."

 hippogriff.6.t:0 "S.M.I.L.E. Accepts Our Request"
 hippogriff.6.desc:0 "Good news! S.M.I.L.E. has accepted our request to share information and training, and to coordinate our efforts in guarding harmony in our kingdoms. In her letter to us, Director Bon Bon spoke of the lessons S.M.I.L.E. gleaned in the aftermath of the Changeling infiltration of 1002, discussing the many subtle ways enemy agents can use the openness of a harmonist society to infiltrate it, and suggesting a number of preliminary steps to avoid similar security breaches in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff.6.a:0 "We'll defend harmony together."

 hippogriff.7.t:0 "S.M.I.L.E. Rejects Our Request"
 hippogriff.7.desc:0 "Much to our surprise, Equestria has rejected our request to coordinate between the AHAC and S.M.I.L.E.. The matter apparently made it to the princesses' desks, because the response is signed by Twilight Sparkle herself. In it, she expresses concern over some of the book bans the AHAC has issued, stating that: "Harmony and knowledge go claw-in-fin, and harmony requires governing with a light hoof and trusting your subjects. However good the intentions behind it, the AHAC's activities undermine that trust. Therefore, [EQS.GetLeader] has regretfully declined your request to share intelligence between S.M.I.L.E. and the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee."\n\nThis comes as a great disappointment to the AHAC, whose chairpony Violet Facade expected our friends in Equestria to enthusiastically support our fight against extremism in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff.7.a:0 "The Equestrians are less trustworthy than we thought."

 hippogriff.8.t:0 "The Wingbardian Book Ban"
 hippogriff.8.desc:0 "In a controversial move, the AHAC has banned all books coming from Wingbardy or written in Wingbardian from entering [From.GetNameDef]. They cite Wingbardy as "a hotbed of socialist and fascist radicalism," paying particular attention to the doctrines of Beakolini and the way supposedly-apolitical Wingbardian literature subtly advances fascist ideology.\n\nThis move has been met with condemnation from a singularly unexpected source: while Raft Wood and most of the rest of Aris First have praised the move as "the first step in freeing our culture from foreign influence," Crack Lightning has criticized the ban, arguing that Wingbardian books are no more dangerous than any other, that the ban is poorly worded, and that it rests on an idea of so-called "Crypto-fascism" which he finds preposterous. His voice is joined by the usual choir of progressive harmonists who oppose the AHAC, with Silverstream and Skystar both urging Queen Novo to rein in the AHAC, seeing the ban as yet another example of an escalating trend of xenophobia within the committee, with Skystar being particularly passionate about not wanting to go back to the lonely days of hiding from the world."
 hippogriff.8.a:0 "We cannot let our nation fall to subversive ideas."

 hippogriff.9.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Banned Wingbardian Books"
 hippogriff.9.desc:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued a blanket ban on all Wingbardian books. They say that everything written in Wingbardian is a potential source of anti-harmonic radicalism, citing the popularity of Wingbardian fascism as "evidence" that our entire literary tradition is somehow a corrupting influence. The ban has offended and outraged many both within the government and the Wingbardian literary scene, with many calling for an immediate denunciation of this move. Ultimately, it is up to [WNG.GetLeader] whether to officially protest this cowardly move by the Hippogriffs."
 hippogriff.9.a:0 "Send an official protest."
 hippogriff.9.b:0 "We don't care about what those sad seabirds read."

 hippogriff.10.t:0 "Joining An Alliance"
 hippogriff.10.desc:0 "Some thought we would return to isolation after our defeat, but Queen Novo has decided that [Root.GetNameDef] is still a part of this world. If we could not triumph over our foes in the North Zebrica War, how will we be able to defend our island if they strike again? The mountain cannot stand alone, so we must find partners to join in alliance.\n\nBut which alliance shall we join? There are several options. The world is constantly evolving as nations go to war, make peace, and adjust their diplomatic relations. Some old and venerable alliances have already fallen while new alliances have taken shape. After carefully considering all available options, the Queen has decided that..."
 hippogriff.10.a:0 "We shall join [EQS.GetNameDef]!"
 hippogriff.10.b:0 "We shall join [WNG.GetNameDef]!"
 hippogriff.10.c:0 "We shall join [SIC.GetNameDef]!"

 hippogriff.11.t:0 "Terrafin's Proposal"
 hippogriff.11.desc:0 "Terrafin has departed, sailing to meet with our allies' military science department and set up a joint research fund. He will write back to us as soon as he receives an answer from our allies, although we have no reason to expect them to refuse. If Terrafin's project succeeds, it could give us a major edge for years to come."
 hippogriff.11.a:0 "We trust that your research is fruitful."

 hippogriff.12.t:0 "The Terrafin Mission"
 hippogriff.12.desc:0 "A military science division from [From.GetNameDef] led by a hippogriff named Terrafin has arrived in our country today, looking to set up a joint research enterprise. Terrafin has the blessing of the Hippogriff government, and has impressed our own scientists with the scope of his ambition for this research. Some more cautious elements within our military have cautioned that this would necessitate sharing classified information with the Hippogriffs and could end up costing a significant amount of money. Still, our scientists have pointed to the benefits we could gain from cooperation, and the hippogriff ambassador has emphasized the value of Terrafin's proposal in promoting trust and friendship between us and our allies."
 hippogriff.12.a:0 "This sounds like a good idea."
 hippogriff.12.b:0 "We're sorry, but we'd rather not."

 hippogriff.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees To The Terrafin Mission"
 hippogriff.13.desc:0 "The high command of the [From.GetNameDef] have signed off on the Terrafin mission, giving us access to previously-classified files and pooling together a significant amount of their own research funding to supplement our own. Terrafin has already thrown himself into the research, writing to us that the data our allies have shared with us is already leading him to new breakthroughs in military science. By combining our research efforts, we and our allies will both grow stronger."
 hippogriff.13.a:0 "Excellent!"

 hippogriff.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Terrafin's Offer"
 hippogriff.14.desc:0 "Terrafin returned to Mount Aris dejected. Despite his best proposal and intense negotiation with the [From.GetAdjective] government, they have decided not to accept his proposal of a joint-advanced research mission. He has no idea how this happened, and quickly returned to his home in despair. We will have to continue researching on our own."
 hippogriff.14.a:0 "What is the point of an alliance if we don't share?"

 hippogriff.15.t:0 "Terrafin's Breakthrough"
 hippogriff.15.desc:0 "A report was provided this morning by the Terrafin Mission, signed by Terrafin himself. It seems that they have had a major breakthrough in several areas of research, including rocketry, computing, magical studies, and even nuclear physics. While we will still need to invest into further development in these areas, the breakthroughs will no doubt put us ahead of our enemies."
 hippogriff.15.a:0 "A toast to science!"

 hippogriff.17.t:0 "Silverstream's Declaration"
 hippogriff.17.desc:0 "Queen Novo's niece Silverstream has denounced the AHAC's move to expand coverage to foreign nationals today, saying that it's "Stupid and wrong and not Harmony" to impose our values and laws upon others, and that it "Treats creatures who should be our friends with suspicion and fear." Aris First founder Raft Wood has praised the move as "The first step in removing foreign influence from our Mountain," lending credence to Silverstream's statements that the AHAC is turning into a weapon of xenophobia.\n\nAHAC chairpony Violet Facade insists her fears are overblown, and that the measure is primarily intended to combat tax evasion, pointing to the AHAC's fining of businessgriff Plumage Moonfeather for hiding money with his New Mareland associates, which would not have been possible without the new measure."
 hippogriff.17.a:0 "Maybe she has a point..."

 hippogriff.18.t:0 "What Is "Harmony"?"
 hippogriff.18.desc:0 "After weeks of deliberation, the AHAC proposed their definition of Harmony to Queen Novo to be signed into law. Progressives opposed setting down a legal definition of Harmony as being against the spirit of Harmony, with Skystar and Silverstream begging the Queen not to "Put Harmony in a cage of ink and paper." Meanwhile, the Aris First movement largely endorsed the move, with Raft Wood proclaiming his full confidence in Violet Facade's judgement and expertise. Queen Novo decided to at least give it a read before making a decision. The report addressed each Element of Harmony in turn:\n\nLoyalty, contrary to the Equestrian understanding, was about pride in your home and loyalty to the Queen and Hippogriffian Harmony itself, not about your personal friends.\nHonesty is more than telling the truth. It was also about behaving in an upright and correct manner for your station.\nGenerosity is when well-off creatures willingly used their wealth to help their country and those less fortunate, and is thus incompatible with forced wealth redistribution.\nMagic is not only magic, but the pursuit of excellence in all of one's talents.\nLaughter and Kindness, being altogether too vague to be given a rigorous legal definition, should be considered secondary Elements.\n\nThe report concluded that under the definition, Hippogriffia should stop looking to Equestria and especially to Griffonian republicans, liberals, social democrats, and other false-Harmonists for guidance, as these were all either too laissez-faire, too individualistic, or too focused on anti-harmonic notions of constitutionalism or economic redistribution to truly understand Harmony as we do.\n\nNovo set the report down, declaring:"
 hippogriff.18.a:0 "We are the only true Harmonists in the world."
 hippogriff.18.b:0 "These fools know nothing about Harmony!"

 hippogriff.20.t:0 "Hippogriffia Offers Protection"
 hippogriff.20.d:0 "Our Hippogriffian neighbors have recently approached our government with an offer that requires our attention and thorough consideration. Hippogriffia asks Warzena to bow to Queen Novo and become a protectorate under her guidance. Among other concessions from our side, accepting this offer would allow the Hippogriffian military access to our nation and give them the power to meddle in our foreign policy. We would also be forced to support them in any war they find themselves in.\n\nThe benefits, however, are just as impactful for Warzena. Warzena would have a steadfast, Harmonic ally in the tumultuous Zebrican continent and Hippogriffia would be bound to aid us should we ever find ourselves at war. The economic possibilities could also be bountiful as investment from Hippogriffia is assured to follow should we accept this offer.\n\nIn short, much of Warzena's freedom in exchange for the might of Hippogriffia, in all its forms.\n\nThe final decision lies with King Barekzamal who will be supported by the citizens of Warzena, whatever his decision."
 hippogriff.20.a:0 "Only together can we hope to protect Harmony."
 hippogriff.20.b:0 "Let's keep it to a guarantee of independence."

 hippogriff.21.t:0 "Hippogriffia Offers Integration"
 hippogriff.21.d:0 "The Hippogriffians have approached us once again with another offer, this time the offer could potentially lead us to the furthest extent of our alliance. The offer is the total integration of Warzena into Hippogriffia as one of its provinces. Warzena would cease to exist as a separate and independent nation, with its citizens, territory, resources -everything- becoming an integral part of Hippogriffia, for good or ill.\n\nAt the same time, integration carries many benefits for our people in the long run. They would become citizens of a fellow Harmonic nation and with the might of Warzena and Hippogriffia united their chances of survival and safety are exponentially increased. Some say that such an integration is only natural for two nations that are as merged as ours. Both of our societies, militaries and bureaucracies are already fairly unified thanks to our protectorate status under Hippogriffia.\n\nIt is up to King Barekzamal to decide:\nIndependence or Integration."
 hippogriff.21.a:0 "Unity is Strength!"

Crack was charming, debonnaire, and clearly in a good mood, gushing about the new law the AHAC had been drafting.\n\n"You've truly outdone yourself," he said, "The AHTA is exactly what this country needs to remind us of who we are, what we stand for, and who our enemies are."\n"I don't know, I thought it was fairly mundane."\n"Oh don't sell yourself short!" Crack exclaimed, "Take ah, paragraph three, section four of the current draft. It's brilliant. 'Any creature who publicly propagates false or misrepresented statements which they know or should reasonably be expected to know will undermine the public's faith in the fundamental institutions of Hippogriffia will be considered culpable in any resultant unrest or anti-Harmonic activity.' Just that section alone will allow us to uproot all those unpatriotic and anti-Harmonist elements easily! Plus the way paragraph two lets you cut through all those messy police jurisdictions and procedures to ensure that the ones who truly deserve it face justice."\n\nViolet sipped her coffee. She didn't like the twinkle she saw in the hippogriff's eye, and slowly opened her beak:\n"Well, uh, Crack, it does require the statement to be false..."\nHe waved a claw dismissively. "Or misleading, or misleading! You underestimate your own genius, Ms. Facade!"\n\nAfter Crack had left, Violet thought long and hard on what he'd said. She'd never intended to write a law with such ruthless implications, but it seemed she'd done just that. Lightning's enthusiasm unsettled her. He reminded her of the demagogues and dictators of Griffonia, going on about unpatriotic elements and lambasting due process as a barrier to "true justice." Despite her doubts, some part of her didn't care if Crack Lightning liked it or not. The AHTA would be a powerful tool, and in the fins of a responsible leader, a tool for good."

This body, unique in Hippogriffia's history, has the power to draft and pass legislation, though the Queen possesses an absolute veto. Delegates from across Hippogriffia gathered in a new meeting hall on Mount Aris. As the Queen gave the opening address, the energy in the hall was enthusiastic, but also a bit tense. Rumors had spread claiming that radical Aris First members or leftist agitators planned to disrupt the session. Many also feared that unresolved tensions between hippogriff and seapony delegates were going to flare up.\n\nIn the end, the session was disrupted by something entirely unexpected. One delegate, clearly bored by the opening speeches, began loudly humming to himself. This annoyed the delegate seated beside him, who suddenly took the floor and proposed a measure banning "humming, mumbling and other distracting behavior" during parliamentary sessions. The humming delegate, now offended, took the floor to defend his conduct and argue that the measure violated the delegates' liberties. Several delegates, each eager to make a name for themselves, followed by giving increasingly impassioned speeches either supporting or opposing the measure.\n\nThis continued until Princess Skystar, also in attendance, asked to be allowed to speak. She chided the delegates for focusing on pointless minutiae while serious issues required consideration, and reminded them that creatures everywhere were depending on them for assistance. This rebuke seemed to snap the delegates back to attention, and the rest of the session focused on more consequential issues. In spite of this incident, many remain hopeful that the Royal Parliament will show the benefits democratization can bring to Hippogriffia's government."

Now the council has been revived, with its membership consisting mostly of political newcomers. The councilors met in a hall on Mount Aris with Queen Novo, members of the extended royal family, and many eager spectators in attendance.\n\nUnfortunately, the inexperience of the new councilors created unforeseen problems. Many of them appeared absolutely starstruck in the presence of the Queen and other royals, and their opening speeches contained nothing but excessive praise for Her Majesty's Government. The councilors continued in this manner until Silverstream suddenly turned towards the Queen and blurted out, "I'm confused! If they only wanted to flatter you, couldn't they have just sent in fan mail?"\n\nAfter a brief silence, Queen Novo began to laugh, as did the councilors. This moment seemed to break the ice, and the councilors then spoke on several local and national issues they wished to bring to the government's attention. The Queen listened attentively to each of their speeches and promised that her government would work to address all of their concerns. Though the Queen still rules in Hippogriffia, she is always looking for input from her subjects."

As she looked out over the crowd, all she could see in the faces of her subjects was rage.\n\nAs the Queen spoke, she struggled to be heard over the sounds of shouts and jeers, the noise of fights breaking out, and her guards repeatedly telling the crowd to step back. What made the whole thing so difficult was that they couldn't seem to agree on anything. Some shouted for her to arrest the unpatriotic seaponies who dodged the draft, while others demanded she punish the arrogant hippogriffs who led the country into an unwinnable war. Some claimed that the war should be resumed immediately, while others said [Root.GetNameDef] should renounce war and disarm completely.

I hope time will repair the great damage you have done to the reputation of your royal line."\n\nNovo tried to dismiss this criticism. She reminded herself of the severity of the crisis.

Spending time with friends is important for everycreature." Skystar replied, beaming with joy.\n\nZamni's eyes widened.

Air superiority had already been in the Hippogriffians' claws since the beginning of their surprise war on the Storm King's forces when they quickly and efficiently overwhelmed the Storm King's air force, most of which was grounded, not expecting a large enemy force to appear from beneath the ocean.\n\nDuring the final battle the Air Force ensured that all the Storm King's airships were destroyed. These airships played an important part in the Storm King's campaigns as they gave him a tactical and strategic advantage over his enemies, carrying large amounts of warriors, materials and weapons at a fairly fast pace, easily outmaneuvering his opponents and positioning his forces to deliver crushing attacks on their weak points.\n\nThese same airships, however, weren't quick enough to face the lightning strikes of the biplanes which composed the Air Force. One of the many airships to join the scrapyard was the flagship of the Storm King, being destroyed by Crack Lightning himself, who was lauded as a hero for his actions that day.\n\nTogether with the other branches of the military and providential help from the Element Bearers the Storm King's rampage through Zebrica came to an end.

Pretty soon we'll be occupying all of Zebrica, and the average seapony's concerns will be completely forgotten."\n\nVibrant couldn't take his rant lying down. Choosing her words carefully, she replied, "I understand where you're coming from dad, but you've got it all wrong. Another war was inevitable before the establishment of the Zumidian mandate. Tyrannical regimes will always try to destroy free societies like ours."\n\nHer father was unimpressed. "If the only way to preserve harmony is to topple every tyrant in the world, I'm afraid our system is doomed. Trying to force your values on others never ends well. We should focus on promoting harmony at home, in our own communities."\n\n"Community! Yes!" Vibrant exclaimed, sensing an opening, "Harmony can't exist without a community to support it! If you view our community as just one country, then isolation seems like the right choice. But if you view our community as all of North Zebrica, you'll realize what our government is doing is absolutely necessary. We're not imposing our values on others! We're trying to empower harmonist voices within the countries we've liberated, so they can become responsible members of our community."\n\nAfter a moment's pause her father said, "huh," and took another bite."

An attached message detailed the many abuses they had suffered at the hooves of Colthaginian landlords and generals. Some of the signatures were little more than scratches, the zebras writing them not even able to spell their own names, yet still determined to have their freedom.\n\nOn the other side of the desk was a letter from Jezabzella Zeshmid and other leading Colthaginian harmonists. While they acknowledged that Colthage unjustly oppressed the Coltvans in the past, they pointed out that their government has already formally apologized for these acts and plans to carry out the land reform Coltvans have long been demanding. They also argued that keeping Coltva within the Colthaginian Republic would make both regions stronger and more stable, while dividing them would do the opposite.\n\nSkystar sighed. Both groups made very good points, but neither was willing to budge. With the two sides deadlocked it was up to her to make a decision. She could understand both perspectives, but in the end she could only side with one."

Every enemy attack caught his forces completely by surprise, and before he could organize a response they had already disappeared. It was as if the guerrillas could melt into the terrain, or worse, into the civilian population.\n\nThe colonel's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a patrol returning. He opened his tent flap and saw a platoon of hippogriffs leading dozens of ponies into camp.\n"Lieutenant!" he cried, approaching the lead hippogriff, "What is the meaning of this?"\nThe lieutenant, a much younger griff, had a crazed look in his eyes. "We lost three of our number to snipers as we passed by their village, so we marched in and took every able bodied bat prisoner. At least one of them's gotta be a guerrilla, and the rest are guilty of helping hide 'em."\nColonel Windflow sighed. "Very well, detain them for now and I'll deal with it later."\n\nAs the colonel moved back towards the tent, he heard screaming near the edge of the camp. Rushing to the scene, he found two soldiers holding back a very old mare.\n"Let me in!" she shrieked, "Give him back! I have to find him!"\n"Calm down ma'am," the colonel said, motioning for the guards to release her. "Who do you need to find?"\n"My son! You took him, give him back!" the mare said, breaking down in tears. "Please, he's my only son! Don't kill him, I beg you!"\n\nThe colonel was speechless. If they were ever going to have a chance at pacifying Chiropterra, they would need to win over the hearts and minds of these ponies.

This had a dual purpose: to show that the legions had repeatedly flaunted the laws that the civilians operated under, and to provoke outrage at just how many of the things the LMRD did were perfectly legal.\n\nOcean Spray, the mad scientist of the LMRD, was acquitted on counts of grievous bodily harm, murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and so on, simply because his victims were labourers. The trial was followed in depth by the media, and even former legionnaires were incensed as he was acquitted one by one of horrific acts of torture.\n\nOf course, the way he had embezzled funds and inflated his successes, the fact that certain experiments were illegal for procedural reasons, and the terrorist actions of the Crescent Moon Society were all enough to get Ocean Spray and most of the others in the Doctors' Trial heavy prison sentences.\n\nThen came the trial under Arisian law. Crimes against sentient life, war crimes, serial murder: it was enough to get Ocean Spray and several others hanged. At the end of the trial, a curious change had come over the Chiropterran public. They had always prided themselves on their ruthlessness compared to the weak harmonists, but their laws were so weak that only under harmonist law would the monsters actually be put down. The legions hadn't protected them. The legions had protected themselves, and given the experimental drugs the LMRD would sometimes test on enlisted soldiers and lower-ranking officers, Chiropterran opinion solidified that the legions were, essentially, a racket.\n\nMuch of the publicity was done by officials in the former Chiropterran civilian government. One Carrot Stick in particular had stepped up and ensured that every Chiropterran he could reach would get the play-by-play of the trials. In the aftermath of the trials, he also convinced several insurgent groups to lay down their arms in exchange for amnesty. After so long with the Chiropterran public stonewalling efforts at a proper peace, it seemed the tide was turning, and leaders were emerging on their side who were able to finally stop the cycle of violence."

More likely, it would be an endless stalemate which again, would leave our backs turned to our continental rivals.\n\nTherefore, Il Duce has concluded a peace with [HIP.GetNameDef] which will see both nations' ships allowed free passage through each other's waters, but otherwise involves no territorial annexations or reparations. This largely-symbolic concession was necessary to avoid the humiliation of so many Wingbardians having died for nothing.\n\nWith this, the North Zebrican War is finally concluded, and we can return our attention to the Griffonian mainland. We must hope that the occupations of Chiropterra and Colthage will keep the Hippogriffs too busy to try and exact revenge on us while we are embroiled in continental conflicts."
 hippogriff.641.d2:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra and Colthage, [WNG.GetLeader] sued for peace, and we have accepted. Curiously, the conditions included, alongside a return to pre-war borders, a clause stipulating that neither nation would block the other's shipping through the Middle Sea.\n\nOver the next days, celebrations broke out across Aris at the return of peace. Meanwhile in Wingbardy, Beakolini spun the entire war to have been about protecting Wingbardian trade all along. This has caused an outpouring of derision in our own press, as the simple truth is that Il Duce invaded us unprovoked and retreated with his tail between their legs: we had never once menaced Wingbardian shipping, but [WNG.GetAdjective] state media is now framing the entire war as having been a limited victory rather than a defeat.\n\nSadly, [WNG.GetAdjective] media is heavily censored, so their citizens may never get to hear our side of the story. They may never know the truth that their beloved leader threw their lives away for nothing and failed despite attacking us at our most vulnerable. Still, while the Wingbardians console themselves with lies, we can celebrate the truth: that [HIP.GetAdjective] sailors and soldiers defended our home despite great odds, defeating not only our local rivals but also humbling a great power. Once again, the light of peace and victory shine upon Aris."

"Nothing I say leaves this room."\nThen he turned back to Beakolini, a smug grin on his beak. "This treaty includes a provision that neither of us are going to harass the other's shipping. You sly bird, you. When you get back to Karthin, you are going to spin this entire war as being about trade, and tell your people you actually won! Of course, you and I know we've never threatened your shipping and that you're only signing this because I beat you."\n\n"You have achieved nothing," Beakolini began, but Crack cut him off.\n\n"I have achieved everything! My soldiers occupy your allies. This war which you thought would be an easy victory has resulted in Aris becoming the dominant power in North Zebrica. Go, tell your people you won, do your little Griffonian conquests, take Griffenheim for all I care! But know this, Giulio. When I first met you I admired you and your system: fascism is beautiful, and I wished I could be half the leader you were. But this piece of paper we're about to sign? It proves that I've surpassed you. Mount Aris has surpassed Karthin. And you will never forget that your former disciple defeated you.""

Glaring at his secretary, Crack snarled, "Get me Razorbeak and Admiral Seaspray. We need to change all our war plans."\n"Right- right away sir!"\n\nThe writing had been on the wall; Crack had merely ignored it. Of course Il Duce would strike Hippogriffia while they were vulnerable. Of course he would. Hippogriffia was the only naval power to rival Wingbardy in the middle sea; they were the only ones who could seriously disrupt Giulio's ambitions in Abyssinia and Saddle Arabia. What was the ideological affinity between him and Crack Lightning, what were the conversations they'd had back during his tour of Karthin, what was Crack Lightning's admiration next to the cold reality of geopolitics?\n\n"War is the father of virtue, and thus we reject both the possibility and desirability of perpetual peace," Crack Lightning quoted the Doctrine of Fascism, trying to sooth his wounded pride. "Fine, Beakolini," he said to the empty room, "We shall see which civilization is stronger: The Karthinian, or The Arisian.""

They'd know what to do, as Posada had them draft war plans against Wingbardy long ago, knowing that their fascist ideology would not permit them to leave a communist state so close to them in peace. But were those plans even relevant? They'd done naval wargames where it seemed the Blue Fleet had an advantage, but that was against Wingbardy alone. Against the combined fleets of Wingbardy and Colthage, with Chiropterra having an unknown number of submarines prowling the seas...\n\nPosada's phone started ringing.

A war on three fronts now, not only against the armies of Colthage and the legions of Chiropterra, but against the only other fleet in the Middle Sea capable of challenging Hippogriffia.\n\n[HIP.GetLeader] was hardly surprised. Beakolini had always been an opportunist: he'd never seen a turned back he didn't want to stab, and [HIP.GetNameDef] was vulnerable right now. The vulture would swoop in while the Hippogriffs were occupied with the Agzhat Pact and gobble up as much territory as he could, for the Glory of Wingbardy or whatever slogan he used to justify his pointless aggression.\n\n[HIP.GetLeader] picked up the phone, dialing Fleet Admiral Seaspray.

Three months to retake Ain Trotgourait before the general feeling that defeat was inevitable turned into nation-paralyzing certainty.

A large force of tribal warriors under Zawgha "The Ironbreaker" appeared seemingly out of nowhere, fighting not to free their homeland from Chiropterran oppression, but to avenge it. They fought with incredible brutality and tactical acumen, seemingly heedless of the rules of war but masters in the art of war.\n\nAt the same time as these chargers fought by our side, a larger number of the Imazeeb fought with the Chiropterrans, either for pay or out of fear, with their Aguellid, Umalez Ataghan, the closest thing they have to a queen, being a figurehead for the Chiropterrans after her mother's death.\n\nIt was only in the last days of the war that the truth of the situation came to light. Zawgha revealed that she had gathered her forces with the Aguellid's secret blessing, and that they never could have reached us had Umalez not distracted her supposed overseers. Zawgha then presented us an offer of peace from Umalez.\n\nAfter we accepted the curious offer of surrender, we realised just how little authority the Aguellid actually had to make the offer, and how many Imazeeb were fully ready to return to their old semi-nomadic ways and give up the dream of the "Kingdom of Zarantia."\n\nWhile we are grateful for their aid and their struggle for nationhood is romantic, between the division within Zarantia, the deviousness of this Umalez character, and the shocking brutality Zawgha's troops displayed fighting alongside us, we are unsure what will happen if we put our faith in these Imazeeb."

In the long-run, other nations who were able to would eventually start contributing to the Silverstream Plan's fund. While each country's leaders had the right to implement its precepts in their own ways, the Silverstream Plan was based on three principles:\n\n"Peace Through Prosperity." By improving standards of living, healthcare, and education in all North Zebrican nations, we will put an end to squabbling over scarce resources.\n\n"Unity Through Purpose." By having old friends and old foes all cooperate on the grand endeavour of rebuilding and improving the region, we will build feelings of national brotherhood and accomplishment. Creatures will no longer look to war as a means of asserting national prestige or serving their communities, but instead will look to building things and helping other creatures.\n\n"Friendship Through Familiarity." By opening up borders, sharing literature and science, and developing commerce and tourism, we will make friends in all different countries in North Zebrica. Where once we saw each other as strange and foreign, we will see each other as friends and neighbours: different but all good in our own ways.\n\nThe passage of the Silverstream Plan was seen as a repudiation to everycreature in [HIP.GetName] hungry for revenge against their defeated enemies, as well as, hopefully, a death knell to revanchism among those enemies."

Now they stood at attention as though on parade, with a single grizzled mare trotting out in front of them to meet Flarebright.\n\n"Greetings," said Flarebright, "I am the commander of the 92nd royal infantry batallion, Major Flarebright. Why have several thousand armed zebras showed up in an active warzone unannounced?"\n\n"I am Zawgha the Ironbreaker. We are the last warhost of Zarantia," the commander replied, speaking Arisian with a thick accent, "We have fought the murderous moon-worshippers ever since they broke Zarantia and killed our Aguellid. We're here to fight alongside you, and to claim revenge on them for what they've done."\n\nFlarebright shivered, realizing the severity of the moment as his own soldiers started peeking out of their positions at the newcomers.\n\n"Of course. I've heard of what the Chiropterrans did to your people. I will bring you to my commanders, and I am sure they will accept your service. Zarantia will rise again, if Aris can-"\n\n"You don't understand, do you?" the zebra laughed bitterly. "Zarantia is already dead. We're here to build its funeral pyre out of Chiropterran corpses.""

 hippogriff.101.desc:0 "Princess Skystar suppressed a yawn as she wandered through the hall. The Arisian Economic Society was hosting a National Automotive Convention, bringing together leading economists and businessgriffs. Because Queen Novo was unavailable, Skystar had to represent the monarchy at this event, even though she didn't know much of anything about the automobile industry. If she had to listen to one more lecture on the benefits of sustainable growth, she might not be able to stay awake.\n\nSkystar wished she could be doing something more important, like recruiting promising candidates for government service. Harmonic absolutism was becoming increasingly impractical in the modern world. Hippogriffia needed to democratize and allow talented creatures from different backgrounds to attain high office. If there was someone in government with expertise in economic matters, they could help strengthen the kingdom's economy. Not to mention that person would be the one attending boring conventions like this.\n\nThe princess stopped when she noticed a large crowd in the corner of the room. They were listening to a blue hippogriff who spoke with much more energy than the other presenters.\n"I'm a statistician at heart, but I've spent 5 years working as a consultant for car companies. In that time I've had to force creatures to think deeply about their problems and address them realistically. It's a strategy called 'scientific management.' Take my time at Cirrus Talonclaw's factory, for example. On my first day I asked him questions about every little thing till he was red in the face. But I took what I learned and used it to find all the inefficiencies and slowdowns on the production line. Once we ironed those out, productivity increased by over 100%!"\n\nThe audience burst into applause, and Skystar joined in. Maybe, she thought, what Hippogriffia needs now..."
 hippogriff.101.a:0 "...is someone like that!"

 hippogriff.102.t:0 "Rocket Neverfall"
 hippogriff.102.desc:0 ""Princess Skystar?" Rocket Neverfall said, his tone formal yet confident. "It's a pleasure to meet you. To what do I owe the honor?"\n\n"I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed your presentation on scientific management. It was the highlight of the whole convention!" Skystar replied with a smile.\n\n"Thank you princess, that means a lot."\n\n"I am interested in learning more about your consulting strategies. Would you be willing to discuss them with me, perhaps over lunch?"\n\n"Certainly princess. Just name a time and place and I'll clear my schedule."\n\n"Thank you so much! I think this could be a great opportunity, for both of us.""

 hippogriff.103.desc:0 "Rocket Neverfall looked down at his coffee, then pushed his glasses back up his beak. "Let me get this straight: you want me to be a government minister?"\n\n"Yes! I think a griff with your talents could do a lot of good." Princess Skystar said before continuing to eat her meal.\n\n"It is an... interesting proposition." Rocket sighed. "But I'm not sure I'd be the right fit. I don't know anything about government work."\n\n"Then you'd be in good company." Skystar put her fork down. "This kingdom has been an absolute monarchy for its entire history, so the number of creatures with actual governing experience is pretty small. Ever since we returned from Seaquestria my mother and I have been bringing in new faces to advise us on all kinds of things. You can join them in learning the business of government."\n\nRocket scratched his chin, seriously considering the idea. "I'd need you to promise me final say over hiring and decision-making in my department. My management strategies have encountered resistance in the past, and I want to be sure I can actually make a difference."\n\nRealizing she had pulled off a tough sell, Skystar grinned. "That can certainly be arranged.""

 hippogriff.106.desc:0 ""And what's this room for?"\n"That's the outgoing records room, it's where we put files which are going to be sent to the national archive to be prepared for long-term storage."\n"That is so cool!"\n\nSilverstream's tour of the National Revenue Agency's headquarters building had taken nearly four hours, and her guide Swift Claw was wondering when she'd ever stop asking these questions. Swift Claw had been glad to answer at first, enthusiastic even, but as time wore on it became clear Silverstream would never stop asking. It reminded him of his three year old daughter. Swift Claw had become increasingly convinced that the new "Royal Friendship Advisor" was as useless as she was annoying.\n\nAs her tour finally concluded and Swift Claw bade her farewell, Silverstream announced that she'd thought of at least three changes which could be made to "make the whole place more friendly," and said they'd be hearing from her soon. Getting back to his coworkers for coffee, Swift Claw was surprised to hear them all talking about Silverstream: how friendly she was, how appreciated they felt when she came to them, how her questions made them feel like somegriff actually cared about what they were doing. How they hoped their kids grew up to be as kind and thoughtful as her. When Swift Claw mentioned how she'd said she was going to change their workplace, they all agreed that whatever she suggested would definitely make things better. Swift Claw returned home that night a little puzzled, but curiously optimistic. He gave his daughter an extra hug that night, and went to work the next day with a smile on his face."

 hippogriff.111.t:0 "A Drink with the Communist"
 hippogriff.111.desc:0 "The left had been largely pacified, except for one figure: Posada, the eccentric firebrand at the head of the Revolutionary Worker's Party. When Silverstream had suggested Skystar invite her to a party, Skystar had laughed out loud, but Silverstream was serious. One week and a whole lot of awkward conversations later, Silverstream had convinced the communist leader to meet them at a bar in a forgotten cove in Seaquestria.\n\n"So that's why cap'talism will alwaysh collapse," slurred the red seapony, several hours into the night, "It's all about the falling rate of profit, it'll happen, don't you worry 'bout it..."\nThe three had all had a little too much, and Skystar wasn't quite sure how long they'd even been there.\n"M'kay so you... you're still gonna fight cuz you think you can't lose? You're crazy Posada..."\n"I am! But naw, communism will win, maybe now, maybe in a thousand yearsh... you guys ain't so bad though is what I mean, you know capitalism will go bye-bye but s'long as it's no Storm King takin' out the whole world with it we good, we good..."\nIn the drunken haze, Posada's words almost made sense, and Skystar felt oddly enraptured as Posada careened into another rapturous rambling declaration about the wonders of nuclear power.\n\n"Is gonna be a nuclear age, I'm tellin' ya!" she proclaimed at the end of it, "Everyfin's gonna be powered by splitting atoms, I'm tellin' ya, I'm tellin' ya... No but really, you's'all've been good to th'left n' me, better'n any other monarchs I can think of... And I know nopony's gonna follow me into some crazy revolutionary thingamabob 'gainst creatures who've done right by them so you have my... My nuclear approval!"\n\nAs Silverstream launched into her third barrage of questions about nuclear science and extraterrestrials, Skystar had a hazy thought that they'd done something good today, no matter how bad the hangover would be tomorrow. They'd spent so long worried this communist was coming for their heads, but now that they finally met her she was just another dorky, enthusiastic seapony like Skystar herself. As she took another long gulp of her seaweed beer, Skystar couldn't help but look forward to working with Posada."

We have made an agreement with him to appoint Giovanni Gaspwingi to head the new post-fascist government.

 hippobeacon.1.d1:0 "It didn't make any sense. After a thousand years of ruling with wisdom and compassion, Princess Celestia has fallen to the same curse her sister did a milennium ago. She had become a terrible, vengeful creature, dispensing with mercy and raining fire and death upon her ever-growing list of enemies. [HIP.GetLeader] hadn't believed it at first: hadn't the Chiropterran legions always called Celestia a tyrant, a usurper? But it had quickly become undeniable. Equestria was no more. It had been twisted into this "Solar Empire."\n\nWhere Equestrians were once an example to the world of what Harmony should look like, now they brayed for the blood of their enemies, and their new Empress delivered. That was the worst part. Celestia had gone mad, she clearly needed purification, like her sister Luna had once needed. But aside from a scattered harmonic resistance, the ponies of Equestria loved her for it.\n\n[HIP.GetLeader] had to act. Amidst the swirling rumours, she had to break the news to her subjects. Equestria was no longer [HIP.GetName]'s ally. It was no longer Equestria. Aris would have to endure, to shelter Harmony from the scorching sun, and to protect their friends from the tyrant now sitting on the throne of Canterlot."
 hippobeacon.1.d2:0 "Equestria has fallen. Despite throwing everything they had against the Changeling onslaught, they simply could not continue the fight. The Princesses had fled or been captured, and the flags of Chrysalis hung over Canterlot.

Perhaps she could have turned the tide, perhaps she could have done more, perhaps, perhaps... 'Perhaps' would not help anycreature. Equestria had fallen, and [HIP.GetName] had to prepare. There were a number of proposals on how to salvage things: resistance groups they could help, key individuals they could smuggle out of Equestria. Aris could offer protection to those in the path of the Changeling war machine. And if the Princesses returned, Aris would stand ready."

I haven't heard from Yona yet, but that's not surprising since getting mail to Yakyakistan is real tough."\n\n"Anyways, Sandbar, I really appreciate your last letter. I know it's been hard for you in Equestria, and I'm trying to figure out what to do. "What would Twilight do?" I keep asking, but I guess... if Twilight knew what to do, everything wouldn't have turned out the way it did... I guess what I'm saying is, we're on our own. And that kind of scares me.

Princess Luna had insisted on not simply sitting around as a figurehead when she arrived in Aris, and had instead made it her mission to review the Hippogriff army top-to-bottom before offering her services to the General Staff. She had poured over the details of the North Zebrican War, chatted with Skybeak about the Great War, and then occasionally started talking about ancient wars she'd fought a thousand years ago with spears and shields. Once in a while she would even mention the Lunar Rebellion and the benefits of the Legion structure. Then she'd go quiet, and ask to be left alone.\n\nSkybeak didn't know what to make of her. Sometimes she would offer the most brilliant insights, obviously derived from centuries of experience. Other times... she would ask why Skybeak hadn't ordered a bayonet charge or demand why the army did not still issue shortswords. Sometimes she would speak with the confidence of the most experienced general in the world, other times she'd speak with the timidity of a reclusive relic who had failed Equestria at its direst moment.\n\nSkybeak didn't like it when she got that way. He wasn't used to reassuring creatures, but he had to try somehow, and in no small way he looked up to the ancient general. So he tried. It was the best he could do. After weeks and weeks of working together, Luna asked Skybeak a simple question:\n\n"Do you think I'll ever get to return home, Skybeak?""

 hippogriff_communist.1.d:0 "The benefits of our booming economy have not been distributed evenly. While opening up our markets has brought the prices of goods down and has made great profits for our corporations via exports and tourism, there is rising discontent among the lower classes that they are not getting their share of the national prosperity.\n\nWhile before, much of the opposition to our trade policies have been from nationalists and isolationists among the middle classes afraid of foreign competition, now much of the anger is coming from the proletariat, as socialist ideas once popular mainly among radical student groups have started percolating among the common workers. Popular discontent is directed more and more at domestic businessgriffs rather than distant foreigners, and even at the monarchy itself, which is increasingly seen as a defender of inequality.\n\nThe constitutionalist Socialist Labour Party of Aris has been doing its best to moderate rhetoric and remind the people that Novo has been a good queen, but the fringe Revolutionary Workers' Party and Post-Civilization Coalition of Communities, Anarchist have said in no unclear terms that the monarchy must be dissolved."

Despite our efforts, auto-workers in both Seaquestria and Mount Aris have walked out of their jobs in large-scale strikes, citing low wages, unsafe working conditions and callous supervisors.\n\nThe industry has ground to a standstill, but as the strikers are not centrally organized, it is difficult to tell what would get them to go back to work. Enraged at being denied the right to unionize, different groups have demanded everything from increased safety standards to a complete restructuring of the wage system so that every worker shares in a percentage of the profits of their company.\n\nSkystar has suggested getting all the labour leaders together into one room so they can talk amongst themselves and talk with us to figure out a plan that works for everygriff, while auto industry leaders like Lucky Break have cautioned against such a plan, saying that that would result in the most radical voices swaying the others and pointing to the increasing popularity of socialist ideologues like the anarchists and Posada. They suggest simply waiting the strikers out, playing them off each other until their movement loses momentum. If that fails, the Queen can always sign back-to-work legislation forcing the strikers to return to their jobs."

While many said they were forming in response to the rising inequality and deregulation, one look at their founding members told Novo all she needed to know.\n\nSkystar was with her, but as usual her daughter underestimated the severity of the situation. Once more Novo wondered what would happen to Hippogriffia when she was gone.\n"We should never have let it get this far," Novo muttered, looking at another report.\n"Look at this one: the glassmakers are organizing, and one of their chief organizers is Hot Breeze, who is one of Posada's top henchgriffs!"\n"I don't know, it doesn't seem so bad," said Skystar, "Salina Blue seems nice, and she's pretty high up. And besides, all kingdoms have labour movements."\n\n"This isn't just a labour movement!" Novo snapped, "They want to dispose of us. Communists, anarchists, Posadists, these new unions are full of them! You know what they do to creatures like us in Stalliongrad? I should have done this a long time ago, but I'm still the Queen. I'm going to ban these unions while I still can."\n\nSkystar was silent for a moment, lost in thought. Novo hadn't heard Skystar be silent in a long time, and finally embraced her daughter in her fins, holding onto her.\n"I'm sorry Skystar. I don't want to crack down on our own subjects, but I haven't been this scared since the Storm King. I... I don't want to lose you."\nSkystar hugged her back, trying to find the words to tell her mother how wrong she was. "Mom, I know you're scared, and I know a lot of them are real weird, but they just want to negotiate on an even level with their bosses. Isn't that what Harmony is all about: every creature has a fair say?""

As he spun his tragic tale, Novo hissed to her advisors to get Silverstream, who could always be relied upon to defuse tense situations, but she was nowhere to be found.\n\nTensions rose as Novo deliberated, with some of her courtiers demanding the beggar be removed from the throne room as he began accusing the queen herself of not caring about the plight of the poor. The reporters who always attended court sessions scribbled furiously. Finally, Novo rose from her throne, her face betraying outrage, though whether that was at this hippogriff's situation or at his impertinence, nogriff could say. Silencing the room, she spoke:"

You talk of revolution in private, but in public you demand nothing but free tuition and a few trinkets for the workers you claim to champion. Scraps, you demand scraps! Caramel Marks herself once demanded scraps from Princess Celestia, but her pleas were rebuffed, and she learned her lesson well. It was only the Winter Revolution which brought the ponies more than scraps, and even they fell backwards into state capitalism. Why?"\n\n"Because of the material conditions of-"\n"No! Because they allowed timid rightists to lead! Revisionists, who told them to slow down lest somepony get hurt. Revolution is no game! If nopony is getting hurt, then what is it? Surely not a revolution. Rosey Luxembark once said, "Either the revolution must advance at a rapid, stormy, resolute tempo, break down all barriers with an iron paw and place its goals ever farther ahead, or it is quite soon thrown backward and suppressed by counter-revolution."

He jumped into the stranger's path, brandishing a knife. "Stop right there! Put your claws where I can see 'em!"\n\nIn front of Rough stood a female Hippogriff. She was initially frightened and complied with his orders, but she began to smirk when she saw what he was holding. Gods, he knew he should have gotten a bigger knife! The one he had was so puny. He'd have to make his performance extra intimidating to get what he wanted. "No sudden movements! Give me all the money you got, or else!"\n\nRough's victim didn't react to this threat. Instead, she studied his very slender frame. Her expression shifted to a look of concern. "Oh, you poor thing! When's the last time you had a decent meal?"\nRough was taken aback by the question, but soon regained his composure. "That's none of your business! Now give me the money or..."\n\nBefore he could finish, she grabbed a wad of currency from her bag and held it out for him. "I wish I could give more, but this is all I have on me right now."\n"Uh... thanks." Rough took the money, his face showing complete bewilderment.\n\n"My name's Starry Eyes, what's yours?"\n"Rough Feathers..." he replied, belatedly realizing he shouldn't identify himself to someone he'd just mugged.\n"Well Rough, I'm on my way to a Revolutionary Workers' Party meeting, and I'd like you to come with me. I think you'd really enjoy it!"\n\n"Oh," Rough realized, "you're a commie." Suddenly her behavior made a lot more sense. "Listen, you seem nice, but I ain't going to any Party meeting. You commies talk a good game, but I've been around long enough to know there's no such thing as a free..."\n"Lunch?" Starry interjected, "But there is. All attendees will be provided with snacks. Make sure to try the cupcakes, I baked them myself!"\n\nRough wasn't fully convinced, but he couldn't pass up the opportunity for a meal.

 hippogriff_communist.7.d:0 "Skybolt Spear had never been great with speeches, but he knew it had to be him. Convincing the soldiers and the sailors would make all the difference, and he was the only high-ranking officer who sympathized with the communists' goals. So there he stood, the timid flag officer, about to sink his own career to address a room of skeptical sailors.\n\n"I thank you all for coming. I know you know the risk this presents to you. I live a very comfortable life, I'm sure you all know. But it wasn't always that way. I grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Seaquestria. It took everything my family had to ah, to send me to officer's school. And I saw so many other cadets with the same story as me, with twice my brains, flunk out because they needed to take care of their siblings, or their parents got a medical bill they couldn't afford, or whatever it was! Whatever it was, it was always something, and while we struggled and fought and sometimes failed, the rich kids would cruise on by like it was nothing."\n\nSkybolt let the anger he'd felt for so long propel him further: "I made it. I was lucky. But so many others didn't. And you know what? I shouldn't have to become an officer to make more than a pittance. You shouldn't have to be brilliant to live a good life, because the navy needs sailors just as much as it needs officers. And we have the capacity! Don't let anypony or anygriff tell you it can't be done, because if they're able to have decent living conditions for sailors and for common workers in a struggling, embargoed, frozen country like Stalliongrad, then you damn well bet we can do it in Hippogriffia!"\n\nHis sailors cheered, and Skybolt noted the RWP recruitment sheets being passed around. Good. He'd probably just sank his career for this, but if it meant the sailors would finally fight for their own liberation, it was worth it."

 hippogriff_communist.8.t:0 "The Blue Revolution"
 hippogriff_communist.8.d:0 "This was the day the leftist coalition - the RWP, the SLPA, and the PCCCA - had been awaiting for months. Across Mount Aris and Seaquestria workers heeded the call for a general strike, grinding the economy to a halt. Outside the royal palace, a mass of demonstrators gathered.\n\nThey were a diverse group: Hippogriffs from every corner of Aris, Seaponies who had taken Hippogriff form for the day, and even a few zebras from the RWP's growing Zumidian branch. The crowd was so numerous that the Royal Guard struggled to hold them back as they pushed through barricade after barricade.\n\nMany of them carried only banners and picket signs, but many others were armed. Posada had insisted that none of them be the first to fire. Any blood spilled today would be on the government's claws, but they wouldn't hesitate to fight back if necessary.\n\nTheir demands were simple: Novo's immediate abdication and the formation of a communist government.\n\nInside the palace the atmosphere was tense. Queen Novo and her advisors discussed several plans to disperse the mob. When it became clear that nothing but her abdication would satisfy them, the Queen resolved to order the Royal Guard to open fire. Before she could give the order, Princess Skystar pulled her aside.\n\n"Mother, you can't do this."\n"I'm sorry honey, but we don't have a choice. If they get their claws on us-"\n"I don't want to be queen of a kingdom that murders its people!" Skystar yelled, gesturing towards a window. "Mother, the people are on their side. If this is what the people want, isn't it our duty to step down?"\n\nEventually Skystar and several royal advisors appeared on a balcony, the Queen refusing to deliver her decision in person. When they announced that Novo was caving to all demands, the crowd erupted into cheers.\n\nPosada and other prominent leftists quickly began organizing a new government. As the sun set, the royal standard flying above the palace was lowered and replaced with two new banners: the unofficial red flag of the leftist coalition and the blue flag of the RWP."

Today, we've taken the first step to making our dreams a reality, and have boldly entered a new era. The revolution has truly begun, here in Hippogriffia! And I am honoured to accept the position of General Secretary, and swear to do my duty to the revolution, to bring about a new world from the ashes of the old. As my first act, I would like to call a vote to rename our country to something that better reflects its true purpose and character. When I look around I see not only hippogriffs, but also ponies, seaponies and zebras. I propose that this be the inaugural meeting of the Supreme Workers' Council of Revolutionary North Zebrica, to better reflect our aims and our makeup.""

The names before her, twelve in all, were the worst of the reactionaries: the imperialists. A small group of warmongers who wanted to go out and conquer other nations and crush their creatures over some ridiculous theory of Hippogriff supremacy or a sheer lust for conquest.\n\nPosada's own body bore the scars of imperialism: her time imprisoned on one of the Storm King's airships had taught her to loathe them, and the writings of Caramel Marks had given her words to express that revulsion. Colonel Razorbeak, Director Solid Stone, all the others: these twelve had wanted to use their positions in the military and government to make Hippogriffia as vile as the Storm King. Posada had already gotten the Supreme Workers' Council's authorization to deal with them, and there would be no half-measures. Next to the orders which would end these twelve lives was a letter, written by her old friend Crack Lightning. They had drifted apart thanks to his involvement with Aris First, but the war hero had written to her as a friend, pleading her to spare them. Posada picked up her pen. Would imprisonment suffice, or would she turn to the bullet?"

Without a word she took a seat in front of Posada's desk, forcing the General Secretary to scurry to her own seat and sit down after her.\n\n"How is the revolution progressing, comrade Posada?" Skystar asked with stiff formality, pouring them each a cup of tea. Posada was flustered, taking a long sip of the mango-flavoured liquid to buy time. While she thought of her response, something cracked in Skystar's expression and she launched into a bubbly series of questions:\n\n"Did I get it right? Cuz like the revolution only started with overthrowing us right, cuz like you need to do so much work to build the new society and all? That's how that works right? We're still in a revolution right?"\n\nPosada spat out her tea. Once she'd finished laughing, she regained some of her composure and answered:\n\n"Well, yes! Yes that's exactly right. No hard feelings about the overthrowing part?"\n\n"Oh, many hard feelings! I was angrier than I've been in... well, ever. But those are in the past, and I've seen what you've been doing. I want to be part of it, if you'll have me."\n\n"Of course we'll have you!" Posada paused, chuckling to herself.

 hippocommie.7.d:0 "Posada hadn't slept in almost two days. The presidium had been debating what to do with Chiropterra, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts came to light. Chiropterra was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, arranged in a vast stratocracy. Given their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to uproot the Chiropterran system and ideology. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\n\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There was a dissident Moonspeaker named Dusk Wane who had somehow twisted the Nightmareist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put him in charge, although in order to administer Chiropterra he would have to use much of the old power structure. That meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting up Chiropterra to rise again and exact revenge.\n\nThe second proposal meant remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmareist faith would be completely banned. The population of Chiropterra would have to attend reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\n\nThe third option was genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant immediately shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who kept their lives put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would finally annihilate one of the most evil nations in the world."

While the methods were monstrous, they advanced medical science years ahead of us, and a group of former Harmonists have persuasively argued that it would be a crime against their victims to burn the information they gathered on Polio, Malaria, and a dozen other diseases which could save so many lives. More controversial are the military applications of their research. While their combat drugs were undeniably effective, many of them were temperamental, and we only have a vague understanding of how they work since so many of their records were destroyed. Adopting these would mean turning our own soldiers into the lab rats of Chiropterra's worst, even from beyond the grave. Still, Terrafin and many others in our own military science division have urged us to put aside these qualms and use these military applications, as doing so would make our troops more effective and almost certainly save lives.\n\nFinally, an even more controversial option has been proposed: Chiropterran scientists advanced medical science immensely, and with the destruction of so many records, much of their data only exists in their heads. Certain technocratic elements have suggested that by offering amnesty to a mere half-dozen of Chiropterra's monsters, we could advance our own medical research dramatically. They would be kept on a tight leash, and obviously we would not let them use their old methods, but there is some appeal to putting these evil minds to work building a better world. Terrafin as well as numerous others have objected to this idea, stating that they do not wish to work with such creatures and that offering them amnesty would sully their entire department."

With added weight from snorkels, fully-sealed armor, and an amphibious engine, anything short of the solid basalt of the ocean floor will be unable to support it, making it rather useless for amphibious assaults. Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."

The rifle of the revolution will no longer fire lead or steel slugs, but finned sub-calibre darts made of pure tungsten. The new rifle can achieve incredible rates of fire, pierce enchanted griffonian armor, and in larger calibres even punch through light tank armor! Comrade Posada was thrilled to learn that it also had far greater range underwater than any conventional or magical rifle, and has ordered the rollout of the newly-named 'Caramel-pattern Flechette Rifles' to all branches of our infantry. The cost of the ammunition, being made of tungsten and soon perhaps even depleted uranium, would be prohibitive had we not already abolished money!"
 hippocommie.11.d_caseless:0 "Caseless ammunition has many benefits, including lightening the load carried by each soldier, but our chemists had difficulty creating a material that would both hold the bullet in place and act as a propellant while not being prohibitively difficult to manufacture.\n\nThe solution came from an unexpected source: a chemistry graduate student named Adhamon, who was working as a lab assistant on the project, applied a bit of Zumidian alchemy to the problem and finally created a formula which worked. Terrafin has already named the first working caseless firearm the 'Adhamon Light Machinegun.' Terrafin recommends the new ammunition be rolled out as soon as possible, since it halves the weight of ammunition and turns the weapon into a beautiful closed system with no ejection ports to allow dust in, and no material wasted. Full adoption will take years given the lack of backwards compatibility, but the 'Adhamon' is already proving a hit with troops, especially ammunition carriers."

Terrafin has signed his name to this project, believing it is likely to succeed and will prove highly valuable.\n\nThe third proposal argues that enemy interception technology is too advanced and a totally new design is required to stab into the heart of enemy airspace. By flying higher than enemy interceptors can reach at Mach 3, it will be able to deliver nuclear payloads with safety anywhere. This so-called "deep-penetration bomber" would likely prove massively expensive and fuel-hungry, but proponents argue such costs are well worth it."

The RWP-A is also likely to advocate for more moderate foreign policy than Posada's, as they primarily consist of seaponies who still tend to be more isolationist than the fervent internationalists who make up the majority of the RWP, and see far less to gain from military intervention."

While few took the nationalist's word for it, he protested that "Beakolini himself went from being a socialist to being a nationalist, so why can't I do the opposite?"\n\nEven with this alleged conversion, the "National Communists" have voiced their opposition to the mainstream RWP's internationalism, arguing that other races and societies are too backwards to achieve communism in a "civilized manner" as we have. They argue we owe nothing to such inferior civilizations, and should seek to protect ourselves from them rather than "Pursue some romantic dream of international proletarian solidarity.""

When Hard Line got up to speak, Posada knew there would be trouble.\n\n"Esteemed comrades," he began, "We must address a mistake which I believe this body made during the confusion of the early revolution, but which can be corrected if we act swiftly. We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Workers' Council. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.' The issue is closed. And the next time you propose murdering Comrade Skystar's mother, I would suggest you do it with more tact or we may have to suspend your membership in the Supreme Workers' Council.""

 hippocommie.17.d:0 "When she heard that the Lunar Legions had fallen, former-lieutenant Silver Spike had wanted to head into the hills with her husband Night Eye and wage a holy war of resistance against the communists. A fever had prevented her, and by the time she recovered the blue army had locked down her village. As she returned to her little home, her foals Agave Dew and Guava Drop ran out, babbling something about a radio announcement. She hurried inside to hear whatever bad news was coming.\n\nSilver Spike held her foals tight in her leathery wings as they listened, silently praying that the communists hadn't finally decided to torch their village, or take away her foals, or that she wouldn't be on the next list of 'war criminals' their endless investigations had uncovered. The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference. Nightmare Moon shelters all, her light shines upon all, but we have been blinded by grief at our defeat and allowed bitterness to twist us for a thousand years. So I implore you, walk with me, walk with the hippogriffs, into a brighter future free of the poison of hatred."\n\nShe knew she should be outraged at the blatant heresy, but mostly she just felt relieved that the occupation was going to end and Night Eye would be able to come home.

He would be reunited with Silver Spike and their foals in their minimum-security facility in eighteen months, conditional on his and their good behavior.\n\nGuava Drop bowed his head and mouthed a thank you to Nightmare Moon for their food, just like Silver Spike had raised him to.\n"Stop that," she whispered, "If they see you..."\n"But you said," her youngest foal said, "You said as long as we didn't say anything, they wouldn't-"\n"They've gotten better at spotting things. We can't ever break the rules, do you understand?"\n"Will they punish us?" her older foal asked.\n"Yes Guava."\n"I can take it!" Guava Drop declared, "Let them punish us!"\n"Hush! It's not just us anymore. They got dad. He's alright right now, but we'll only be able to see him again if we're on our best behavior. You want to see dad again, right?"\n\nHer foals nodded. Silver Spike silently cursed herself for becoming an instrument of the communists' ploys to wipe out her faith, and she hoped Nightmare Moon would forgive her. But what else could she do?

There were four of them, all armed, three of them pointing guns at her while the fourth addressed her from behind a clipboard.\n"That's me, yes."\n"Right. Your husband Night Eye was recently identified in a raid on a terrorist holdout. As you did not come forward with information on him, you are considered an accomplice in his actions, which caused the death of three Blue Army soldiers."\nSilently, Silver Spike congratulated her husband. A fever had prevented her from joining him before the communists had locked down their village, but she was proud of him for making these invaders bleed.\n"Furthermore," the communist continued, "As a second lieutenant in the Ursa Legion, you are considered complicit in the innumerable crimes of Chiropterra, and are therefore scheduled for liquidation."\n\nSilver Spike stiffened. She knew death would come for her, and was ready to face it with dignity. Then she heard Guava Drop whimpering, and glanced behind her to see that her foals had disobeyed her and come out of hiding. All of her strength vanished.\n\n"What about my foals?" she whispered to the hippogriffs, "Will they be taken care of? Will they be alright?"\n"If they behave."\nSilver Spike nodded, and kneeled down to talk to her foals one last time.\n"You be good, okay?" she said, "Agave, you watch after your brother. Do whatever the hippogriffs tell you to, and... don't look for me."\n\nSilver Spike turned to face the hippogriffs, and followed them out into the woods around her village."

Still, the enemy's "flying fortresses" can now be shot down en masse by even our smaller fighter craft, so the tradeoff is easily worth it in the eyes of airforce command."

Do you pretend not to hear them begging for us to kill them?"\nIn the final week, cellular and internal damage became catastrophic to a level never seen before in any patient in the literature.

The pyramids are astonishing wonders of the world.\n\nHowever, these structures would be difficult to build today with modern tools. We therefore see two primary possibilities:\n\n1) The pyramids were built with advanced technology and magic, at least as powerful and sophisticated as what we have today.\n\n2) That an ancient conspiracy dating back to the first pyramids of Re'em and Maregypt has secretly existed across all of history, organized by the greatest builders of each generation, to design and construct these wonders.\n\nThe Department deems the first possibility far more likely.\n\nAs an addendum, we further question how the ancient Maregyptians and Re'emites came to possess such advanced tools, and how that knowledge was lost. Is it possible that advanced civilizations have existed for far longer than we previously thought? Or perhaps these ancient peoples were assisted by some external force? Who can say?

Comrade Silverstream claims that one of her former teachers, Fluttershy, is able to communicate clearly with all animals regardless of species. Unfortunately, the Department has not been able to find any other creatures that possess this ability, nor have we been able to reach Fluttershy for an interview.\n\nDEA biologists quickly identified bottlenose dolphins as the ideal species for sapience research. In the wild, dolphins exhibit several behaviors that are indicative of advanced cognitive abilities. To study dolphin intelligence, the research team decided to live and work in close proximity to a pod of dolphins for a period of 4 months.\n\nThe dolphins' sapience was proven beyond a doubt when they were able to perform complex tasks and recognize themselves in a mirror. After these initial tests, the team attempted to establish communication. This proved difficult until one of the researchers brought in several whistles that produced different sound frequencies, which the dolphins were able to mimic. The two-way whistle language the team created with the dolphins eventually developed its own grammar and syntax, both concepts which the dolphins could understand.\n\nThe team's findings have revolutionary implications. The Blue Navy is already conducting research on the dolphins' ability to detect enemy vessels and naval mines. Some eccentric scientists are exploring the possibility of helping to develop an advanced dolphin civilization.

Posada said for what must have been the 10th time.\n\n"But did Caramel Marks herself not say that communist revolution is inevitable?" Rising Tide retorted, "Communism will come to all creatures eventually, but it must develop naturally as a result of material conditions within their own societies. It can never be imposed by force of foreign arms."\n\n"But if we don't do this we are condemning the workers of the world to exploitation, to slavery!" Posada replied, growing increasingly desperate.\n\n"There are many things we can do to help the workers of the world achieve their own liberation. But if we launch this war, it is the creatures of [HIP.GetName] that will be condemned to suffering and death."\n\nWhen Rising Tide finished making this point, the congress burst into applause.

Creatures all over the world are suffering, and we need to do something to help them."\n\nPosada began to perk up. "Did you have something in mind? Something other than declaring war on the whole world?"\n\nSkystar giggled. "I was thinking of spreading communism through more peaceful means. We should be doing things like providing aid to the needy, assisting developing nations, and building up our soft power on the world stage.

By voluntarily ceding power, Posada has shown the world that our state is not built upon a cult of personality. It is built upon Communism, and its promise of a better world for all! As General Secretary, I will always strive to live up to that promise. The Revolution shall carry on and..."\n\nStarry Eyes gave her first public address as General Secretary in the capital's largest square. She chose to speak as a Hippogriff, in order to reach a larger audience. She also demanded that her speech be open to all who wished to see it, and the organizers had delivered. The crowd stretched as far as the eye could see in all directions, exceeding even the highest estimated attendance figures. Unfortunately, this also stretched the event's security detail very thin...\n\nA Hippogriff in a crazed state leaped from the crowd and flew onto the stage, interrupting Starry mid-sentence. He landed on the edge of the stage and started yelling something incoherently. Before anyone could react, he suddenly slipped and fell to the ground face-first.\n\n"Can you hear me? Are you okay?"\nAs the griff regained consciousness, he was surprised to see the General Secretary standing over him. She was applying pressure to a cut on his beak with a piece of fabric ripped from her uniform. The crowd watched in astonishment as she helped the wounded griff to sit up.\n\n"He needs to see a doctor." She gestured to the nearby crowd, "Help me get him to a hospital."\n"But what about your speech?" someone yelled.\n"The speech can wait! My job has always been to help creatures in need, and I'm not about to stop just because I got a promotion."\n\nThe cheers from the audience were deafening as Starry and another griff carried the wounded stage rusher away."

He'd heard the rumors from other reactionaries, about the CSR midnight knocks and the quietly-operated extermination camps they shipped all fascists to. He had a hunch the only reason he was still breathing was that he used to be friends with the General Secretary, and the moment she retired, he'd be shot.\nA quick knock at the door jolted him out of his thoughts. "Well, this is it," he muttered, slipping his revolver into a claw. He would not give them the luxury of putting him up on a show trial.\nBut the hippogriff at the door was not CSR. It was Posada! "Hey, Crack," she said, a little smile on her face. "It's good to see you."\nCrack relaxed his posture, placing the gun on his coffee table. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"\n"Can't I just stop by to talk with an old friend?" She chuckled a little. "Okay, you got me. There is another reason. I wanted to discuss the world we've built."\n"What's there to say? You've given equality to Colthaginians and Chiropterrans, and I hear you even allowed yetis full rights!" he cried. "Did you forget what they did to you!?"\n"No," Posada answered, pulling back her white uniform to reveal her lightning scars, "I never will."\nCrack winced. "Posada..."\n"I'm not here to force you to stop being a racist. I came here to make sure you were doing alright." She glanced over to the fifteen bottles of bourbon strewn on the floor. "I guess you're not."\n"No, I'm not," Crack said softly. "I've heard you have people like me killed. That you have fields full of reactionary corpses. And so I've been waiting for my turn."\n"We don't do anything like that. It's not a crime to be a racist; we try to rehabilitate reactionaries, to persuade them."

It's fun seeing you like this."\n\nPosada looked up into the cruel, pitiless eyes of the Storm King. She tried to find some words, but the agony of the lightning was too much. He cackled cruelly.

Hard Line added. "Are we to attack the yetis, or not?"\n\n"Attack them? Why?" Posada asked, her voice full of confusion. "Are we... what's going on?"\n\nCrack Lightning stepped forward, wearing the same uniform as her. "We're avenging the injustice of the Storm War," he said, his voice full of pride.

"Comrade Skystar, do you know of the concept of 'great creature theory'?"\n\n"Nope, I don't, but I can guess what it's about from the name!" Skystar replied. "It's the idea that some creatures are just born with intrinsic properties that let them shape the world, right?"\n\n"W-well... yes," Posada sputtered.\n\n"It makes sense. I mean, look at you, look at the work you've done! Look at what I did! Look at what the Elements of Harmony did! Even look at what the Storm King did! Very, very few creatures can influence the world the way Princess Twilight can."\n\n"That's just it," Posada replied. "I don't believe in it." Skystar raised an eyebrow, but let her continue. "I'm not anycreature special. I'm just a bookbinder who happened to fall into the position of communist leader. Anyone could have been me. I'm... a puppet of history, a marionette on the strings of material conditions."\n\nSkystar took a long moment to think. "So then why do you hate the Storm King?"\n\n"Why--huh?"\n\n"He was just a puppet of material conditions too, right? The Stormlands were in the state of economic development such that primitive acquisition made sense, and ergo everything he did could have been done by anyyeti." Skystar shrugged. "But you still hate him. Why?"\n\n"He--he still chose to use excessive brutality! He ordered cities razed!"\n\n"Then he wasn't just operating on material conditions?" Skystar pressed. "There were other factors?"\n\nPosada lowered her head. "I suppose you're correct. But I still think anyone could have been him."\n\n"Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle," the ex-princess offered. "Creatures do have different talents and abilities, but the way these abilities wind up utilized is based largely upon material conditions. Nonetheless, they can still make choices about their actions, and are still to blame if they act evilly.""

 hippocommie.85.d:0 "Terrafin was a scientist, not a politician. He was much more at home in a laboratory than in a committee meeting. He had joined Posada's revolution mostly because of their shared interest in nuclear energy. When a successor needed to be chosen, he threw his hat into the ring because he didn't think the other contenders would fund his research. Now he wished more than anything for a break from his new responsibilities. Luckily, there was a proposal on his desk that might give him just that.\n\nAcross from him sat a researcher from the computer science division, eager to hear his thoughts. In front of him was a study which found that local governments that incorporated computers into their operations saw their efficiency increase exponentially. The study recommended that computers be integrated into all government functions, from routine paperwork to decision making at the highest levels. It even speculated that computers may eventually make government by living creatures obsolete.\n\n"It's an interesting idea," Terrafin said, finally breaking the silence, "but I'm not sure how practical it is. The idea that computers can rule us is going to meet with opposition. Many creatures won't put their trust in machines."\n\nThe researcher's face lit up. "Trust is exactly why we need the computers. As scary as rule by machines is in the abstract, there's nothing scarier than being ruled by other creatures. History shows us that even the most ardent revolutionaries can become tyrants once in power. And after... recent events, the people's trust in their politicians has already been shaken."\n\nTerrafin winced at the allusion to the previous General Secretary. As he contemplated the idea further, he began to see its potential. Computers couldn't be corrupt or abuse their power, so relying on them was the logical choice. His enthusiasm continued to grow as he considered the possibility of escape from the government duties he'd come to loathe.\n\n"I see your point. Very well, your project will have my full support.""

Unless we do this, the Communist Party will not lead the proletariat and the whole machine will collapse."\n\nAlthough Steel Stallion was succeeded by rightist revisionists, his early works were valuable contributions to the Marksist canon. Hard Line had always been particularly fond of this quote. It occasionally inspired him to leave the comfort of his office and walk amongst the people, in order to better express their will.\n\nThe streets of the capital were crowded, but all creatures quickly cleared the way as the General Secretary and his guards approached. Hard Line observed his surroundings with smug satisfaction. On almost every street there was construction. New factories, hospitals and schools went up every day. The people were healthy and prosperous, and there were no beggars in sight. Society had come a long way since the early days of the revolution.\n\nThe early days... Hard Line frowned, remembering Posada's rule. He had once considered her a comrade, but as events progressed she rebuked, scorned and mocked his every proposal. He had endured all her denunciations because he knew she was wrong. She polluted and deformed Marksism by tolerating revisionists.\n\nNow she was gone, and he had finally set things right. By destroying the revisionists, he had purified the party and secured the state. Thanks to his efforts, the revolution would last beyond eternity!\n\nAs Hard Line passed by, those who saw him felt either terror or thinly veiled contempt. Almost all of them knew someone who had been executed, sent to a labor camp, or simply disappeared. Not even in their wildest nightmares had they imagined the purges would go so far.\n\nA few onlookers worked up enough courage to shout insults at Hard Line. He ignored them. The communist revolution didn't require the approval of the workers, so poisoned by false consciousness and reformist lies about 'creature rights' or 'personal freedom'. The Party stood over all, and the fear and hatred of the workers of their dictatorship were immaterial in light of the glorious future that awaited successful communism."

Despite this constant practice, he never seemed to get any better at addressing a crowd.\n\nLuckily today's speech would be simple. He had been invited to attend the launching ceremony of the Navy's newest ship. Surrounded by sailors and steel hulls, he would be in his element.\n\nAs the new ship's captain finished speaking, Skybolt took his place at the podium. In his claws he held notecards with prepared remarks, written to be short and sweet. He looked up at the new vessel. "Isn't she a beauty? Brand new and state of the art. Here's to you captain, I'm sure you and your crew will make us proud..."\n\nSkybolt turned his gaze to the audience and froze. The crowd was much larger than expected, and none of them looked happy to see him. Militaristic officers glared, furious at him for ending Posada's most brutal policies. Harmonist sympathizers looked disappointed, feeling he hadn't gone far enough. Many others simply looked concerned for the future. Skybolt had to think fast. He tore up his notecards and took a deep breath.\n\n"And when you think about it, this ship is a lot like the revolution. As it sails its crew will make plenty of missteps and have many disagreements. And they will face many challenges: rough seas, storms, maybe even enemy attacks. But in spite of all these dangers from within and without, the ship will persevere. The revolution will carry on much the same, because like the crew we're all in this together. No matter what happens, we will all do our best to create a better world!"\n\nThese remarks appeared to satisfy the crowd. Many clapped, a few even cheered.

"It was seditious factions that destroyed the previous General Secretary, I won't let them destroy me. See to it that these traitors, especially any remaining Harmonists, are dealt with severely."\n\nThe officer saluted and left just as a bureaucrat approached Crack's desk. "Sir, I have a proposal for you. There are very few communist states that approve of our... unique system. If we were to make a clean break with socialist internationalism, we might be able to normalize relations with the many supremacist states of the world."\n\nCrack smiled. "Sounds good to me.

He swam up to it, noticing the little seashell which had been left. Furrowing his brow, he made a guttural noise and knocked it off, watching it spin off a short way before floating down and settling on the sand.\n\nSkystar had been here. The damned princess had wanted to make a show of caring about Posada, when it was her moralizing, her pleas, her abusing Posada's conscience which led to her suicide.

Knowing the communists, as soon as she gave in she'd end up in front of a firing squad. Her imprisonment would have to end eventually, either with her escape or with her death.\n\nWhen the guards told her a new General Secretary had granted amnesty to all political prisoners, she was certain it was some sort of trick. As they returned her belongings and released her she wondered what exactly they were playing at. Did they want to watch what she'd do? Was this some new experimental form of torture?\n\nWhen Razorbeak realized that she really was outside with no one following her, her confusion only grew.

As Marks wrote, the revolution must completely transform the way creatures relate to each other. Everyone must put the needs of others first."\n\nSkystar raised an eyebrow. "So everyone needs to stop being selfish?"\n"It's more like there won't be such a thing as selfishness anymore, because what's best for the group will also be best for the individual," Starry explained. "Think of it like this: long ago the pony tribes of Equestria were always at each other's throats, but then they learned to see each other as one united ponykind. Imagine if all creatures could see each other like that. Imagine a world where friendship and love are free from the constraints of group and class identity!"\n\n"Do you really think that's possible?"

He started to pull the gun out.\n\nSteel felt a claw settle onto his wrist, and a whisper from behind. "Don't."\n\nHe whirled around, trying to break free, and was met with a punch to the head.

We'll be taking him into custody."\n\nSteel Feather couldn't believe it. They'd known. And they'd let him get close enough to almost do it. Why? Did they want to make a public show of their power?

The winds were shifting, and it had become time to decide which direction they blew.\n\nSo it was that the Seaponies and Hippogriffs had assembled in the hall, and it had opened to raucous discourse as there was a call for Yays and Neighs. In the end, it came down to a per-representative vote. For a time, it seemed like Posada might hang on to power. As time went on, however, the path to keep confidence shifted to fainter and fainter methods. Eventually, when the math became apparent that not a single one of the next twenty names could vote in favour of a non-confidence vote she slumped back in her chair and released a deep mournful sigh. The writing was on the wall, but it took ten more minutes for the paint to dry.\n\nWhen the tally was declared, Posada hung her head low. "I am sorry to have failed you," she said, in a sad voice. "But communism is stronger than any one creature. I trust my successor to govern with skill and grace. The stars shine on." With that, she quietly swam out of the room.\n\nIt soon fell to Salina Blue to pick up the pieces. Her contingent of the coalition had been the second largest, and in back rooms deals were made and promises offered. When the assembly came together again the next day, Salina Blue coasted to victory in a confidence motion by a heavy margin. There was no speech to be made, that would wait until things settled down.

I see many similarities between us, even though our methods differ substantially, and I still believe we can come to an agreement if you and your followers are willing to listen. Your achievements in Hippogriffia are admirable, as is the way you have addressed the Zumidian zebras as your comrades, rather than your subjects. However, I cannot allow you to continue in your current path, and I hope by the time you have read this letter you will see why.\n\nYou have always spoken against imperialism, but while your presses spill rivers of ink rightly condemning it, your armies prepare to spill rivers of blood to bend the nations of North Zebrica to your will. Do you not see the contradiction? I have praised your state and its achievements, but the culture, the history, and thus the destiny of Hippogriffia is not that of Zarantia, Warzena, Chiropterra, or indeed of Zumidia or Zonicia. And so as one idealist to another, I would like to offer you an alternative vision.\n\nLet us work together, as a commonwealth of independent nations, supporting each other in developing their own unique forms of harmonious life. I ask that we combine our resources to rebuild the nations of this region devastated by this era of war, and then to walk with them in friendship rather than ruling over them in a vast super-state.\n\nI understand that our visions are very different, and that they may seem totally incompatible even, but I trust you will see the wisdom in these words and abandon your current ambitions in favour of something which trusts the creatures of other nations to determine their own destinies.\n\nSincerely,\n-Zeshmunazash Zeirutid."\n\nPosada set down the letter, her claws shaking slightly after the third re-read.

The Macawians were a proud and independent people with their own unique language and culture. They were not exactly thrilled about being absorbed into a North Zebrican superstate. In cities and towns still strewn with rubble, harpies of all ages glared at Posada and her military escort. Garrison commanders reported stiff resistance from the population and begged for reinforcements.\n\nYet there were still bright spots. Macawia had its own native socialist parties before the liberation, and many of their members had agreed to join the RWP. On the last day of her visit Posada addressed these new party members at a special conference. It was a nice change of pace to meet harpy comrades who had rejected national chauvinism.\n\nPosada gave a short speech praising the socialist harpies and thanking them for embracing their new status as North Zebricans. Her remarks were well-received, and after a round of applause many harpies rose to shake Posada's claw. One harpy who seemed especially eager to meet the General Secretary reached into his coat pocket as he approached.\n\nPosada barely had time to register what was happening as he took out a pistol and opened fire."

The rotorcraft are too slow, too clumsy, too small, and too vulnerable for frontline operations, and even support duties are likely to be primarily noncombat for years to come.

Instead of replacing them with another form of tyranny, we must end the cycle once and for all.\n\n2. We Can't Just Undo Civilization - There are some in our ranks who claim that we should reject civilization in its entirety and revert to a pre-civilized state of being. That idea is both impossible and extremely foolish. Civilization has become too ingrained to simply undo, and the modern world has produced several positive developments that we should not reject. We must look forwards, not backwards.\n\n3. We Are for Post-Civilization - Instead of resurrecting civilization or pretending it never existed, we have to create something new. Let's recycle the materials and technology of the past civilization so we don't need creatures to labor in oppressive factories and mines. Let's reject hierarchy and build communities based on mutual aid, free association and self-determination.\n\nIn the post-civilization world, all creatures shall enjoy true freedom and live as one with nature."

"In office I have done my best to help all the creatures of Aris and Seaquestria, including all of you! It's true that sometimes what I've done isn't what you wanted, but there's always been a reason for it! Our country is in a very tough spot, and sometimes we have to make sacrifices to see it through. If you're too shortsighted to understand that, then I'd like to see you try to lead us!"\n\nSalina paused to catch her breath. The audience sat in stunned silence. She continued, calmer now, "Is there anypony here who would like to take my place? Are any of you willing to challenge me for my office?"\n\nNo one responded. Over the next few days support for the recall campaign dried up, and Salina returned to the capital in triumph."

 hippocommie.115.d:0 "Cumulus Wind had seen the horrors of war. He'd watched as soldiers were blown to pieces, he'd heard their cries of agony, and he'd felt the pain of losing many friends and comrades. But the worst thing about the war by far, the fact that made everything else unbearable, was that they had lost it.\n\nCumulus's courage had survived the war, but it was broken by the peace. He couldn't accept that all of his friends had died for nothing. They had failed all of the creatures they were fighting to save. What was supposed to be their moment of glory was just the backdrop for the final triumph of reactionary imperialists. These thoughts haunted him every day.\n\nWhen the government started calling up veterans and reservists for industrial work, Cumulus hated the idea. He was in no mood to leave home, and his trust in the government was at an all time low. But good soldiers follow orders, so he began reporting for work in an automobile factory. The job was difficult and tedious, taxing his basic knowledge of engineering to the limit. Yet as the days went by something strange happened: Cumulus found himself starting to enjoy it.\n\nMaybe it was the camaraderie he felt with the other factory workers. Maybe it was the satisfaction of seeing fully assembled cars that he'd helped build. Maybe it was simply that the job kept him busy, distracting him from his thoughts of the war. Whatever it was, the work did wonders for Cumulus's physical and mental health.\n\nWhen Cumulus reconnected with other veterans a few months later, he found that many of them were also happy with their jobs. Working to rebuild the economy gave their lives a new purpose. They would never forget the horrors they'd witnessed, but with time they might learn to move past them."

Normally her communist credentials were a political asset, but today they made the task at claw much harder.\n\nAround the table sat capitalists from all over the world. There were griffons, ponies, horses, and many other races represented. As wealthy members of the bourgeoisie they were not exactly fans of communism, and that was the holdup.\n\n"Thank you for your hospitality, Miss Blue." said a griffon in a stylish suit, "But I'm afraid I don't see the merit of your proposal. [Root.GetNameDef] is still a communist state, full of pro-worker and anti-business laws. Why should I or any other creature consider investing here?"\n\nThe other capitalists nodded in agreement. Salina began to sweat. As much as she loathed them, she knew the country needed foreign capital. Putting aside her personal feelings, she tried to strike a conciliatory tone.\n\n"You raise several good points, but look at the big picture. Investing in [Root.GetNameDef] will give you access to a large and highly skilled workforce, not to mention millions of potential customers. And recent reforms show that our desire for your business is genuine. We've changed our currency to make commerce easier, and I promise you we have no intention of seizing any foreign-owned assets."\n\nThe room filled with quiet murmurs as the capitalists considered these arguments.

She inherited a mess, but through hard work and sacrifice she had put the nation back on track.\n\nSalina was so lost in thought that she didn't notice Skystar entering through the open door.\n"Am I interrupting something?"\n"Comrade Skystar!" Salina exclaimed, dropping her papers. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"\n"A friend of mine wanted to see you, so I walked her here."\n\nSalina's jaw dropped as Posada entered the office. The former General Secretary had her eyes cast down, but she seemed more calm than sad.\n\nAfter an awkward pause, Posada said, "I need to thank you. I failed this country and its people during the war, and in my disappointment and shame I almost led us into another. You had the presence of mind to stop me, and the leadership skills to salvage the situation. You should have been our leader from the start."\n\nPosada turned to leave, but Salina gestured for her to stop. "I appreciate the sentiment, but that's just not true. I've seen how difficult it is to lead, always bouncing from one crisis to another, and you were a good leader! Before I met you I was willing to work with the monarchy. Only you had the vision and drive to lead us in a revolution. You made some mistakes, yes, but so do all creatures. You have nothing to be ashamed of."\n\nPosada raised her head. "Thank you.

When I was growing up I thought space travel was the stuff of science fiction, completely impossible in the real world. Even when I met Posada and she convinced me that it could happen one day, I didn't think it was very important. We have so many problems to solve down here, so why should we waste our time trying to get up there?"\n\n"But that was before I understood what space really means. Space isn't just an infinite vacuum outside our atmosphere, it's so much more than that. It represents our aspirations, our hope that one day we will reach the distant stars. It represents infinite possibility, infinite resources and infinite wonders. More than anything it represents our curiosity, our desire to know what's out there and who's out there. In short, it is the final frontier of scientific discovery."\n\n"Space travel is currently beyond our capabilities, though we grow closer every year. To achieve the dream of reaching the stars we will need scientists and aeronautical engineers, but that won't be enough. All the experts in the world could never achieve anything if the people didn't value their work. That is why we must help creatures to understand the importance of space, help them to make the same discovery I did."\n\n"And that is why it is my great honor to dedicate the new [Root.Capital.GetName] Observatory, where future generations will gaze upon the stars and learn about the wonders of space!""

Most of the palace staff was gone, as were the most valuable decorations.

No matter how these zebras felt about the hippogriffs or the Regency Council, they all supported King Zamni. His popularity was making it difficult to recruit Zumidian communists.\n\nEventually Skystar reached the young king's bedchamber. The door was open, so she poked her head in.\n"Hello! Zamni, are you in there?"\nShe heard movement, but only an old zebra butler emerged. "May I help you, princess?"\n"I'm uh, not a princess anymore." Skystar said nervously, "And I was wondering where King Zamni is."\n"His majesty is no longer here." the butler replied coldly.\n"Is he out somewhere? On a walk, maybe?"\n"No, he's left the country."\n\nSkystar gasped. "But why? How could he leave us? Where has he gone?"\n"When his majesty heard of Posada's plan to strip away all his titles and take direct control of Zumidia, he decided to flee. Members of the household staff aided his escape. I don't know where he is exactly, but it's somewhere far away. Somewhere where he'll be hard to find."\n"Oh..." Skystar replied, heartbroken. "Well, thank you sir. I'll be on my way."\nAs the old zebra watched her go, his expression softened. "I still have some contact with the staff members who left. I won't help you find him, but if you'd like I can take a message for the King?"\n\nSkystar smiled sadly. "Please tell him that I'm sorry. The revolution was our fault, it shouldn't have cost him his kingdom. Tell him that the future isn't certain yet. There's still a chance to do some good, so that's why I decided to stay.

Before our own revolution began, we joined socialists around the world in extending critical support to Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. We were appalled when he was brutally murdered, but our grief was followed by elation as the Liberation Army of the East marched to Colthage and triumphed over the reactionaries."\n\nThe General Secretary cast her eyes down. "There was a time when I looked forward to working with Zarishat Zeirutid as we spread socialism across North Zebrica together. Her methods were brutal, yes, but revolution is often a brutal affair. I convinced myself that she was a comrade who had her people's best interests at heart."\n\nNow Posada looked up, her eyes full of rage. "But I was wrong! We have all been deceived! Zarishat is no revolutionary, she is a reactionary tyrant! A traitor to the socialist cause! As we speak she is allowing the material conditions of capitalism to reemerge in Colthage!"\n\nAfter pausing to breathe, Posada reached her conclusion. "The reports are clear: Zarishat's new system is nothing but state capitalism under a red facade. It is a product of her endless greed, and it makes a mockery of real socialism.

But it is clear that the long-divided Imazeeb tribes have risen up as one against the rule of a corrupt foreign tyrant."\n\n"This is, of course, a welcome development. We salute the Imazeeb for their bravery and tenacity in the face of capitalist oppression. Unfortunately, we cannot call them our comrades or treat them as natural allies. They have now turned their back on modern civilization, de-industrializing their cities as they cling to a primitive way of life."\n\nThe General Secretary sighed deeply. "I know some creatures think I'm obsessed with technology, but I promise this has nothing to do with my personal feelings. No less a theorist than Caramel Marks wrote that communist revolution is only possible when the productive forces of society advance and an industrial proletariat forms. This Zarantian uprising is not a true socialist revolution, it's more akin to a historical peasants' revolt. Its initial causes may have been just, but now it's doing more harm than good. We cannot allow the Imazeeb to toil under primitive modes of production for all eternity."\n\nPosada's voice grew stern.

We save them, and this is how they treat us. And then they come to the Zumidian refugee zone and exploit our generosity. No more I say! Queen Novo was right to retreat to Seaquestria, she was right to emerge when she did, and we shall suffer no further slander to our people or our queen!"\n\nThe crowd's cheers were joined by the sound of propellers, as Crack Lightning made a flyover in the Spirit of Starfield, the custom fighter plane he had shot down one of the Storm King's mighty airships with.

It spreads the idea that foreign nations produce better cultural products than our own, which damages national unity.\n\nHardliners within Aris First have demanded the government go even further, pointing to the lax labour laws and lower quality control standards in Griffonia and arguing that "greedy griffons" would still find ways to undercut and eventually destroy the Aris clothing industry even with Raft Wood's proposed ban.\n\nMore liberal voices have denounced the whole issue as "a silly affair" and have argued that no Harmonist government should pass laws mandating what its citizens wear, as doing so is an unacceptable breach of personal liberty. They've also argued that competition breeds innovation, and that the exchange of fashion between Hippogriffia and other nations has caused new and exciting fashion trends to develop, which would be stifled by the government issuing bans. Notably, Princess Skystar and Silverstream have come out against the proposed bans, saying that Hippogriffia should be friendly towards other nations, with Silverstream pointing to the griffon and pony friends she made in Equestria as reasons why Hippogriffs don't need to be afraid of other creatures."

"Many of you have worked with the AHAC, and know that fascism is against our way of life. Rather than withdrawing us from Zebrica, Crack Lightning would see us become even more entangled in it. Worse yet, fascism requires one supreme leader, which means he undoubtedly plans to sideline and eliminate both Queen Novo and, well, me."\n\nRaft Wood let his statement sink in, reading the room for a moment. The signs had always been there, but it felt odd to say out loud that the charismatic hippogriff which had carried his movement to power now sought to remove Raft Wood from the picture.\n\n"The hardliners control the military, the Phalanx, and a significant portion of Aris First. Since we are only now becoming aware of the threat, we have to assume they are several steps ahead of us. We have the AHAC, the intelligence agencies, and the police, plus the fact that very few hippogriffs want to live in a fascist state. We will have to act quickly, yet subtly. Prevent him from raising the jingoistic fervour of the masses to a high enough pitch that they demand we go to war, watch the military for the signs of a coup d'etat, and remove his influence from Aris First. While we're doing that, I will arrange secret AHAC meetings to build a case to arrest him. If we act too brashly, his supporters will hang us in the streets. Too timidly, and he'll have us all shot.

Aris First leader Raft Wood, who was once high in Novo's court, has appealed this rejection directly to the Queen, an act unheard of until now, requesting that she overturn the mayor's decision and allow their peaceful gathering to go ahead.

Raft Wood wanted to continue the AHAC's policies of acting primarily as protection against actual extremists, while Lightning wanted to use it to persecute alleged "objective enemies" and enforce some vague but extremely-high standard of loyalty which he had yet to properly explain. When Raft had expressed concern about the growing militancy of Crack's Phalanx, Crack had dismissed it out of claw. While they both wanted to promote harmony among classes, Lightning's proposal on how to do so required major economic restructuring in what he called a "Solidarist economic revolution," massively overturning Aris' economic system for the sake of what he called a national reforging. Most worryingly, Crack Lightning was speaking of foreign powers as if a final war with them was inevitable, and arguing Hippogriffia should strike first.\n\nAfter Crack left, Raft closed his eyes, letting his colleague's proposals stew in his mind.

The Nightmare's Hoof is working to root out the traitors and plug whatever contacts the hippogriffs are using to reach them, but until we accomplish that we cannot rely on our auxiliaries as we once did.\n\nIn order to speed up the process, we can round up a large number of auxiliaries suspected of sabotage or sympathizing with the enemy and make an example of them. Alternately, we can wait for the Hoof to root out the traitors more precisely. The choice is yours, Lord Commander."

This kind of adulation, this was Crack Lightning's style. Not his. But appearances had to be maintained, and these people did deserve to hear from their leaders now that all their sacrifices had finally brought victory.\n\nWhen Raft reached the podium, he tried to relax. He'd very astutely made sure Skystar would not be giving a speech, and he knew Silverstream wasn't quite bold enough to attack his government on victory day within the five minutes she'd been allotted. Still, he wrung his claws the whole time she was on stage, wishing they were fins. When Novo got on stage, he was finally able to relax. Novo was too respectable to criticise his government on the day meant to honour the sacrifice of so many brave griffs and seaponies, no matter what apprehensions she might have about the direction her Chief Advisor was taking her kingdom.\n\nStill, his mind couldn't relax. It drifted to Aris' considerable war debts, how they might interfere with his plans. The situation on the continent, still unstable. How he'd ever disentangle Aris from this mess now that they occupied so much foreign soil.\n\nWhen Raft finally got up to speak, he rushed his speech, fumbling a few words. He couldn't focus. Afterwards, he brushed past the royal family in a cold sweat and went for the nearest body of water. Transforming back into seapony form, he dove in and tried to quiet his mind."

Oh what Raft Wood would say, if he could see the spectacle Crack Lightning could put on with the entire Arisian state at his beck and call!\n\nBelow him, the tanks rolled and the Phalangists marched, with more flying overhead, bearing ceremonial tridents. Razorbeak had drilled them well, his most faithful followers. Enemy prisoners were marched alongside the tanks and the troops, close to the crowd so that the gathered civilians could hurl abuse at them. The children strained at the cordons to get close enough to spit on the hated enemies. High above, the fighters of the Arisian airforce flew by. Crack Lightning saluted them, basking in the adoration of his soldiers and letting himself get swept up by the spectacle for just a moment. This ceremony would be repeated every year from now on, a Fourth Day of Freedom to eclipse all others.\n\nAt the height of the ceremony, the Phalangists stopped their marching and their aerial acrobatics, standing and hovering stark still and saluting The Ace.\n"Victory!

He'd known the Phalanx wouldn't take his surrender well; he'd known they were two-bit thugs who'd turn on him at the first sign of weakness. At least a few units were still loyal. He almost thought he could hear the distant gunfire: Razorbeak's army units reminding his erstwhile enforcers that The Ace was still in charge. He didn't need them, in the end. Now that the Phalanx were an outlaw organization, minus a few units he'd pardon, he could use them as a scapegoat. Yes, he could still turn this around. He could still keep control.\n\nThe reports were mostly good: the Phalanx had been cleared out of Mount Aris, their leadership was in disarray after their attempted takeover in Seaquestria had completely fizzled, they still held Starfield but wouldn't for long... he leafed to the section on high-level dissidents. Of course, this would have to be updated. Now that his Phalanx had turned on him, could anygriff really be trusted?

How could two dozen armed hippogriffs make it to him without firing a shot? No, his own guards had deserted him. One of the few loyal ones lay unconscious on the floor, stunned by the strike of a rifle-butt.\n\n"So what's your game, now, hmm?" Crack Lightning asked the Princess, "Do you think you can just take over Aris by killing me?"\n"Nope!"

However, without either our backing or the child king as a figurehead, they would have no ability to maintain public order. This makes any orderly withdrawal from Zumidia impossible in the immediate future.\n\nNews of the king's disappearance and the wild rumours surrounding it have aggravated protests against our recent policies, and emboldened irredentist groups seeking to have Zumidia join their "Zonician brothers and sisters" in Colthage."

So will you stand with us?"\n\n"If I believed you, I would."\n\n"Very well then, a guarantee. If we win, any treaty we impose on our enemies will require a period of occupation to enforce.

Violet Facade had compiled a list of no less than six separate insurgent groups, comprising remnants of the Nightmare's Hoof, the old legions, and civilian militias who had taken up arms against the occupiers.\n\nThey used diverse methods, ranging from well-coordinated raids from the hills to wildcat shootings or bombings to unleashing strange weapons and artifacts the LMRD had sealed away over the years.\n\nEvery village seemed to be sheltering them, every hillside seemed to contain a hideout or a weapon stash. For every cell the Hippogriff garrison rooted out, another three would spring into action.\n\n"We can't go on like this," said Violet, "Our citizens thought the war was over, but every day the death toll gets higher, and there's no end in sight."\n"If they'd just left us well enough alone..." Raft Wood trailed off. "We can't just leave, you know that? They're fanatics. If we withdraw, they'll come back for round two within a few years. How about this: the Chiropterrans had that whole labourer class, right? What if we arm them? They'll keep their old masters down for us."\n"I'd advise against that," said Violet, "The last thing we need is more armed guerrillas, and I'd hardly call those labourers a reliable ally. Some of them are Lunarist converts, and plenty of labourers fought against us in the Chiropterran auxiliaries."\n\n"So what's your suggestion?"\n"Send in my agents. Use the AHAC and our intelligence agencies to collect as much information on the insurgent leadership as possible. We'll have to be thorough and methodical, and it'll take quite a while, but I think we can find the exiled legion commanders."\n"And then what?"\n"We capture them, we extract as much intel as we can from them, and then we uproot the whole terrorist network.

The army had control, the police were, on the surface at least, loyal, and she could go about her business as usual.\n\nSeeing her driver parked on the street corner, she began walking towards the vehicle. She needed to get home and get some rest. It'd been a long week. But before she even got close, the car went up in flames, an explosion rocking through the chassis.\n\nRunning back inside the AHAC office, Violet nearly collapsed at her desk.

Things may finally be getting better.\n\nLooking down, she saw a stallion approaching her residence, at first she didn't recognize him, but then she noticed he had the uniform of a mailpony on. That was... odd? She didn't receive any civilian mail.\n\nHeading downstairs, she saw a letter had been passed through the slit in her door. Throwing the door open, there was no sign of the mailpony anywhere. No car he could have come in and no trace of where he had gone.\n\nThe letter looked incredibly mundane. Picking it up in a towel, she ran it under the blacklight she kept in her personal office, and ran tests for poisons like arsenic. It was clean. Violet nearly shook while she opened the letter, but she knew she had to read it.\n\n"Dear Ms. Facade, I hope you have enjoyed the last week of relaxation since your "incident." Such a shame, you almost ended up like Lightning Charm. Though you better have recovered from the shock by now, since this'll be the calmest you'll be for a long time until you and your forces finally leave Chiropterra. Starting in roughly five days, you'll begin receiving reports of attacks all across Chiropterra. Your soldiers will die, your agents will be murdered, and your occupation will fail.

While some of the now-armed labourers tried to maintain the peace, others exacted revenge on former legionnaires, Moonspeakers, officials, and random Chiropterran civilians.\n\nViolet Facade hadn't expected anything different. Of course they'd want revenge for what the LMRD had done to their fellow labourers, even if the exact details were kept secret from them. Of course they'd want revenge for years of hard labour, forced conversions, for being snatched away from their families and made into slaves. Those who hadn't participated in the riots had been ill-equipped to contain them, having no real training, and had quickly abandoned their posts or died. A few had even returned to Zarantia or Warzena, taking their weapons with them and becoming small-time arms dealers or hired guns.\n\nAnd then there were the true Lunarist converts, who had taken their Hippogriff guns and Hippogriff ammunition and went straight to the hills to join the insurgents. When the insurgents heard of the riots in Howling Mountains, they'd gotten there before Hippogriff security forces and killed most of the armed labourers, earning the appreciation of the civilian population and taking the Hippogriff guns with them.\n\nOverall, a complete disaster, although there was a silver lining: in the bloodbath, one of the bodies identified belonged to none other than Lady Commander Lightning Charm, one of the lynchpins of the Chiropterran resistance. If Violet and her agents could act fast, they might just be able to salvage the situation while the resistance was leaderless. But that required her utmost attention, and no meddling from Raft Wood."

With Lightning Charm died the biggest trove of intelligence they could possibly acquire, and though the resistance would be temporarily decapitated, Violet was back to square one.\n\nAnd of course, Lightning Charm had gone down fighting. Of course she had. A martyr for the Chiropterran Resistance to rally around: just what Violet needed right now! No, she decided. From here on, she would direct her agents' efforts personally, from a secure compound within Chiropterra itself. And the fools who had screwed up the raid would be reassigned, or demoted.

With staggering coordination, insurgents struck at the garrison's barracks, mess halls, checkpoints and armouries all across Chiropterra. Weapons were stolen, vehicles sabotaged, and hundreds of hippogriffs killed or taken hostage.\n\nLocal informants considered reliable had led units into ambushes; civilian populations thought pacified had turned out to be hiding more insurgents. The AHAC agents Violet had sent to Chiropterra had all been found dead, killed with bombs, knives, or poison. The records Violet had been keeping in her safehouse were taken: if there was anything the resistance didn't know before, they knew it now.\n\nIn a single day, the Chiropterrans had killed all hope that the occupation could succeed: the resistance had gotten bolder after Lightning Charm's death, rather than fragmenting. Raft Wood needed no persuasion. The occupation was over. Over four days of tense negotiations, Raft Wood and a negotiator speaking for Stirling Silver and for his colleague Gorge Z. Batton worked out a peace treaty.\n\nHippogriffia would fully withdraw its forces from Chiropterra, and pledge to respect the sovereignty of the Chiropterran nation. In exchange, the resistance would release his hostages, one unit at a time to preserve leverage, and allow the remaining garrison to be extracted from Chiropterra without further harassment from the insurgents.\n\nFinally, in a move which made Raft Wood nearly lose his composure, the negotiator promised that Stirling would prevent Ocean Spray's Crescent Moon Society from launching a chemical attack on Hippogriffia itself, which had been planned for next month. After signing the treaty, Raft Wood couldn't shake the feeling that he had condemned the next generation of Hippogriffs to another Chiropterran war, perhaps more terrible than the last."

He couldn't shake the feeling that he was walking into a skinning, especially as the businessgriff grinned at him when he took his seat.\n\n"Thank you so much for joining us, chief advisor," Moonfeather began, "Your presence alone here greatly increases my confidence that we will get a good return on our investments. Monetary and otherwise."\nMoonfeather's contacts had been invaluable in rooting out the Phalanx, so he had more than a few favours accrued with the government.\n\n"Of course, Plumage," said Raft Wood, trying to remind himself that he was still in charge here, still the head of government, "I don't believe I've ever given you cause to think that I am anything less than fully reliable when it comes to debt-paying."\n"You? Of course. You're exceedingly reliable. But between the debt from rearmament, the millions of victory bonds my associates and I have purchased, and now the need to pay compensation to the wounded, the widowed, that messy Chiropterran occupation, the military retirement packages... not to mention those ambitious construction projects you're planning for Seaquestria to, ah, what was it? Ensure permanent autarky?"\nRaft startled. Those plans hadn't been announced to the business community! Moonfeather continued, ignoring Raft's look of surprise.\n\n"Now personally, I am fully confident in your ability to not default, although your refusal to consider loans from foreign countries and businesscreatures is regrettable. However, despite my confidence... well, I can only buy so many bonds. I know many businessgriffs who say that unless you adopt more pro-business policies, they won't take my word for it, and will demand interest rates for any further loans which you would find most disagreeable.""

We'll get into the details later. That's more of a personal thing; the real thing that will inspire confidence, make everygriff who owns a victory bond know that it is as good as cold hard cash, is ironically not even something you'll have to pay for."\n"And what's that?"\n\n"My associates have found some truly gigantic reservoirs of oil underneath Zarantia. With your blessing and a few limited trade deals to get this onto market... Well, we could start a bit of a black gold rush, you and I: it'll attract plenty of investment to develop the oil fields, inspire confidence in the economy in general, and my patriotic associates and I could reinvest some of those profits into more bonds.

 arisfirst.59.d:0 "The day was growing old in the camp for the Arisian Third Guard Corps. The Third had been assigned to insurgency suppression around the town of Firstport, and had made camp around a cluster of hills.\n\nColonel Whistle Thorn was proud of his new post. He had been a corporal during the war and had earned medals for his bravery. Now he had been placed in charge of keeping peace in his corner of Chiropterra. The insurgents were many, but he trusted his troops, and even more so, he trusted the Hippogriff spirit.\n\nA Lieutenant pushed his way through the tent flaps.\n"Sir," said the lieutenant, "The second platoon is back."\nColonel Thorn stood and smiled, "Of course! How did the mission go? I bet they gave the bats a run for their money! I wish I could have been there with them-"\n\n"Colonel!" the Lieutenant snapped, "The Platoon sustained 67% casualties. Forty-seven are dead, and seventeen wounded. They followed your mission plan to the letter, and walked straight into an ambush! Your plan to take the heights around Firstport put them in firing range of a mortar emplacement. They proceeded down the other side of the heights, leaving the dead on the hill. They approached Firstport and tried to clear the roadblock you had marked as the objective."\nThe Lieutenant paused, "There was a machine gun." Colonel Thorn was speechless, but the Lieutenant kept hitting, "They tried to withdraw, but there were snipers on the hills. No bodies were recovered... Colonel, how should I report the operation to High Command?"\n\nThorn gestured for the officer to leave. Sitting down at the table, he looked upon his plan. So meticulous, relying on the idea that they were the victorious power, that they were here to clean up, not win another war. He watched as all the lines made sense, how he failed them so terribly, how he was vain and foolish to think he could expect everything to just work out. \n\nHe couldn't let himself fail them again, so he drew his gun, and added one more casualty to the list."

 arisfirst.72.t:0 "The Question of Colthage"
 arisfirst.72.d:0 "The defeat of the Colthaginians has left us in a difficult situation. The territory is huge and geographically diverse, with a million flavours of revanchism and anti-Arisian sentiment running rampant all over. In addition, there is such political instability within Colthage that it is difficult to control even for their own government. Worse yet, almost nocreature in Colthage wants to cooperate with the occupiers, save for a couple obviously-corrupt opportunists.\n\nRaft Wood saw two options at this point. Outright withdrawal practically invited Colthage to attack us again, so that was out of the question. The first, proposed by Moonfeather, would appoint the politician Zaron Zorrel as the new Sufrit. He was well-liked by the landowners of Colthage, and could probably pay enough bribes to keep the peace. He had offered various businessgriffs control of Colthage's largest rubber and oil sources, and Moonfeather insisted he would be able to keep the peace and help Hippogriffia's economy recover.\n\nThe risk of that is that if our puppet should be overthrown, no doubt whoever came to power would rally the populace to exact revenge on Aris. The other option is to use the regional divides within Colthage to end the Colthaginian threat permanently. Split Colthage up into several regional republics, putting Zorrel in charge of only the city of Colthage and leaving the rest to their own devices. This would let us keep a closer eye on Zorrel and his backers, and would mean fewer hippogriffs having to set foot in Colthage. It would also mean less influence for Plumage Moonfeather and his plutocrats. The risk was that this guarantees regional instability and possibly bloodshed for years to come.\n\nBut is that really our problem?"

Typical journalists.\n\nWith MARESOC, however, it was different. As the last inner party members outside the impregnable Ministry of Truth building were brought to the gallows, Crack shook the hoof of the reporter who had just finished giving him a fawning interview for the Manehattan Times.\n\nDuke Haygle, the eminent philosopher Crack had found - surprisingly - still alive after the liberation of Sunset and had selected to lead the reconstruction of New Mareland, had no great love of individual liberty.

He has equally pressing reasons to, in spite of their current situation in the Great War, avoid a formal declaration of war on Equestria at all costs. This is where you come in.\n\nOur own intelligence services have cooperated with VOPS to work out a plan to cause a communications blackout between Puerto Caballo and Equestria. Seaponies will cut phone and telegraph lines, mail boats and planes will be intercepted, and we will send false messages via magical communication methods.\n\nWe estimate this will give three weeks to take the island before the Equestrians can muster a response. After that, the Ace will have to call off the entire Operation. This message will of course be burned and from here on out, only your signature will be on future orders. Therefore, you will be branded a rogue officer and immediately court-martialled should you fail, thus averting war with Equestria.\n\nShould you succeed before communications are reestablished, given the state of the Great War and our naval power we have full confidence that the Equestrians will not dare to try and retake Puerto Caballo.

A message imploring him to send the military to Zarantia in order to protect the oil wells and deal with the locals harassing Moonfeather's operations. The desperation was obvious in the tone of the message. Clearly Moonfeather bit off more than he could chew, thinking his mercenaries could face a determined enemy. If it was up to Wood he would have left the continent to its own devices a long time ago, but with the discovery of oil that notion died thanks to Moonfeather's greed.\n\nNow he was obliged to help his conniving "partner" who had been a thorn in his side since the end of the war, forcing Wood to appease him with pro-business policies and giving Moonfeather precedence in any economic developments he wanted his claws in. Doing so allowed the business community's compliance in reaching Wood's dream of autarky in the nation, but to their advantage. It was proving to be stifling for Wood who wanted to reach his goal with no strings attached.\n\nBut what if Moonfeather was no longer a problem?\n\nThe thought stopped Wood's pacing in his office. Moonfeather's removal would open many doors. He would be free to enact any economic policies, allowing him to craft Hippogriffia's economy as he deemed fit, without the conflicting, ulterior dictations of the various self-serving corporations. The economy would finally serve the nation alone. But at the same time if Moonfeather survived he would definitely make life difficult for Wood. Removing Moonfeather's influence from the business community would also be difficult and they would resist any policies that weren't "pro-business", it might be easier to just keep Moonfeather, seeing as he had the ear of the businesses and knew the intricacies of the economy better than anyone.

We will have to do this the hard way. Remember, Princess, there is ample precedent for a princess to be left uncoronated, if they are unfit for the crown.

 arisfirst.83.t:0 "A Conventional Start"
 arisfirst.83.d:0 "Raft Wood had founded the Aris First committee, had defined much of its strategy in the early days. In a very real way, although Crack Lightning provided the raw charisma and some of the boldest moves, Raft Wood had been the mastermind behind their campaign. It was his connections, his political acumen, which kept them respectable enough to be viewed as a legitimate option to form a government, and his organizational skills which had gotten them off the ground.\n\nNow, Crack Lightning was imprisoned for Anti-Harmonic Terrorism. Huge swathes of the movement had been disgraced, sacked or jailed. What did they stand for, without the North Zebrican War to keep what was left of them together?\n\nThat was what this convention was supposed to be about: uniting Aris First behind a new platform. But as the delegates, officials and organizers filed in, as they took their seats and Raft saw the gaps in their ranks, he couldn't help but wonder if there was any Aris First left to unite.\n\nRaft Wood gave a perfunctory opening address, smiling slightly at the disappointed look on the reporters' faces in the press gallery as he finished. No doubt they'd expected something more, something bold, but that wasn't why he was here. He was here to discover the new Aris First, if such a thing even existed, not to create it himself. The next days would determine the direction of Aris First... and whether Raft Wood's government would pay any heed to that direction."
 arisfirst.83.a:0 "Let's get started..."

 arisfirst.84.t:0 "A Dull Day"
 arisfirst.84.d:0 "The first day of the convention came to a close, with nothing accomplished. The presence of AHAC agents, particularly with Violet Facade at Raft's right fin, meant that everypony there spoke in circles around issues. Normally-fiery orators instead swam gently around their own positions, careful to distance themselves from the long list of positions currently or potentially deemed anti-Harmonic.\n\nThe result was that nopony took a strong stance on anything, nopony's minds were changed, and very few votes on policies were even called. Crack Lightning, Zumidia, the fiasco in Chiropterra, the rocky relationship between the government and the monarchy... not a single one of them was mentioned.\n\nRaft could keep it like this. He could simply let the convention affirm some uncontroversial principles, and give himself a free fin on what actually mattered. That wasn't what he wanted, but at least the AHAC agents were keeping out the worst case scenario: the convention devolving into some kind of brawl or schism."
 arisfirst.84.a:0 "There will be no AHAC agents on the second day."
 arisfirst.84.b:0 "A monitored convention is a polite convention."

 arisfirst.841.t:0 "A Veteran's Tale"
 arisfirst.841.d:0 "With the AHAC agents gone, discussions got much more lively. Many of the delegates, veterans of the North Zebrican War, started talking about their experiences and how it had changed their perspectives. Finally, towards the end of the second day of the convention, one of them got up to speak, encouraged by her comrades.\n\n"Skyward Flame," she began, "Corporal, Seventh Infantry Regiment. Any of you ever fought in the desert? Worst theatre. Anyways, one minute I'm helping my BARgriff reload, next moment shells explode all around us. Whole section is wiped out. I'm left with a dislocated knee and a shredded wing. Everything hurts. I still haven't recovered, but my doctor says I'll be able to fly within a year."\n\nShe held up a ragged fin as emphasis. A hush had fallen over the convention as she continued her story.\n\n"So, I stayed there while the enemy combed over our positions. I played dead. When they'd passed, I found I couldn't move, the pain was too much. So there I was, lying in a ditch full of sand. The heat was so intense that I could barely breathe. Then, after two days, he showed up. Barekzaal. He'd also been stuck behind enemy lines, but he wasn't hurt. That came later."\n\nShe showed a picture of him: a zebra stallion with one eye and a sarcastic grin. "We stayed in that ditch for five days. He never left my side. I was delirious, and he stayed by me, venturing out to get me water. I thought I was gonna die."\n\nShe took a moment, then finished her story: "Well, I didn't die. Eventually, he found some friendlies and got us rescued. I kept writing to him afterwards. He'd saved my life, you know? When the war ended, he had one eye. One eye and no family. This war was fought on Zumidia. So Zumidians like him... they don't have anything to go back to."\n\nShe took one more breath, looking to the other veterans. "There are so many stories like this one. The Zumidians bled for us. I've been a member of Aris First since 1007. I didn't think we owed them anything. But now I owe one my life, and he doesn't have a home to go back to. Barekzaal has friends on Aris. He could make a life here. Shouldn't we let him? My fellow patriots, I say that if a zebra has fought for Aris, they should be able to become a citizen of Aris. Thank you.""

 arisfirst.842.t:0 "The Triple Tridents"
 arisfirst.842.d:0 "Another day at the convention was coming to a close, when a controversial motion reached the floor. Somepony named Steel Feather got up and cleared his throat, his tired eyes glancing over to Raft Wood.\n\n"I was there, you know," he began, "I was there at the start of our whole movement. I'm not proud of everything, but I'm proud of what we've built in the end. An Aris for Arisians, for all Arisians. A strong Aris, which has stood up to our enemies. Internal and external."\n\nThat last statement sent a little shiver through the crowd. "At one point," he admitted, "I was one of those enemies. I got involved with the Phalanx-" immediately, he was cut off by boos, but when they quieted down he pressed on.\n\n"I got involved with the Phalanx for the same reasons all of you joined Aris First. I wanted my country back. I really thought they were harmless. I thought Crack Lightning was a great hippogriff. Don't lie, all of you did too! I was never involved in the violence, I was a little too old, but I was a card-carrying member, and I served my time. I'm out now on parole, with my kids, but I came here to plead on behalf of other former members. Please, many of us didn't know what we were doing. We're patriots just like you. We don't wanna hurt anypony."\n\nRaft Wood privately scoffed. Deniability was always Crack's method. "A Veteran's Organization devoted to adventure," he'd called the Phalanx. Dangerous subversives who'd gotten within inches of plunging Aris into a fascist nightmare, and now they wanted clemency.\n\nTo his surprise, the measure was fairly popular, and Raft realized he'd either have to speak out against it as leader, and in so doing reveal to the public just how dangerous his former allies were and still could be... Or start preparing pardons."
 arisfirst.842.a:0 "Well, as long as Crack and Razorbeak stay locked up..."
 arisfirst.842.b:0 "The Phalanx are terrorists. No pardons."

 arisfirst.843.t:0 "The Zebrican Allies"
 arisfirst.843.d:0 "Yet another argument broke out in the convention, this time over whether Aris has any obligations to its former allies. Raft Wood hadn't anticipated any self-respecting Aris First member to openly suggest such a thing, but this convention had surprised him a few times already.\n\nIt was in our long-term interest, the 'internationalists' argued, to protect friendly regimes on the continent from aggression, namely Warzena and Zumidia. An Aris under siege was ultimately not fully independent. They even invoked the blood shed in the North Zebrican War, arguing that the heroes of the war would have died in vain if we now abandon our allies to the wolves.\n\nThey stressed that the main purpose of this would be deterrence and protecting our own interests, not warmongering or meddling in the affairs of others. There were of course accusations of being idealistic Equestrian-style interventionists, of wanting to put Aris second, of undermining the isolationist foundation of the movement, and so on. In the end, Raft Wood himself was undecided, but the convention ultimately settled the issue via a slim majority."
 arisfirst.843.a:0 "Aris First means Aris First!"
 arisfirst.843.b:0 "Regional stability is in our interest."

 arisfirst.844.t:0 "The Will of the Gods"
 arisfirst.844.d:0 "On the last day of the convention, an old, half-blind preacher swam up to the podium. She presented an open letter signed by ministers, concerned religious citizens and philosophers calling for the first Holy Synod since the beginning of the Line of Novo.\n\n"My friends," she said, "Aris is beautiful, Aris is wonderful, but I believe we have forgotten who made Aris. Was it not said that our home was created by the gods Tiamat and An? It is a gift, and the ingratitude which has swept our nation and nearly destroyed it stems from us forgetting that our home is a gift from our gods. We turn to foreign ideals, we turn away from each other, because Arisians have become self-absorbed. The hydra of fascism, communism, socialism, all the many heads of anti-harmony connect to the body of this forgetting."\n\nThere were murmurs, discussions. Most of the seaponies there were casually religious, but even Raft Wood only rarely thought of the gods. His local temple in Seaquestria was little more than a tiny hollow in a reef, and even then the minister lived an austere life.\n\nThe discussions turned into fierce debates. The Line of Novo had been established in rebellion against tyrannical priest-kings centuries ago, and there was good reason no high priests had been appointed since then. Some argued that allowing a Synod to select new high priests would damage the foundations of the kingdom. Others argued that the kingdom had gone astray precisely because of centuries without religious leadership. On and on they argued, until finally a decision was reached."
 arisfirst.844.a:0 "Perhaps we have gone astray..."
 arisfirst.844.b:0 "Under no circumstances will we open the door to priest-kings."

 arisfirst.861.t:0 "The End of the Convention"
 arisfirst.861.d:0 "As the convention wound down, Raft Wood let some of the tension drain from him. It had been difficult, but he felt like he and the delegates had successfully threaded the needle, and could move on from the tainting influence of Crack Lightning without losing the core of Aris First. He was reading over the collected resolutions when the first punch was thrown.\n\nWhoever had thrown it was obviously more used to hippogriff form: flippers were unsuited to bludgeoning and the extra drag of the water robbed the punch, really a slap, of any momentum. But that didn't matter. The fight was broken up immediately with nopony seriously hurt. But that also didn't matter. The offending seapony was ejected from the convention. That, of course, didn't matter either.\n\nWhat mattered was that over the next twenty minutes, everypony there had taken a side. The offending delegate was a vicious hooligan, cried the more liberal-minded members. He was just standing up for himself against the destruction of Aris First, howled the more conservative delegates. The collected resolutions, representing the entire work of the convention, were re-debated in louder and louder terms as the convention ate itself.\n\nIn the days following, Aris First formally split apart, with new factions forming and dissolving day by day. Delegates who's resolutions were shot down went to the press with their grievances, many making personal attacks against Raft himself, accusing him of manipulating the convention. Raft watched on in silence as Aris First was reduced to a tiny fraction of its membership."

 arisfirst.862.d:0 "After days of debates back-and-forth, the delegates finally finished hammering out a new platform for Aris First. While there were a few malcontents, the thrust of the party platform was consistent enough and the majority solid enough that the minority wouldn't be able to derail the agenda.\n\nThe new platform triumphantly reaffirmed everything Aris First stood for. Aris First, Aris always, Aris Strong and Free. It was a triumph of tradition and nationality. Raft Wood couldn't wait to put it into practice.\n\nThat night, talking about it with Violet Facade, he felt like they had finally gotten past Crack Lightning. Crack was, at the end of the day, a revolutionary. He'd wanted to change things, to abandon tradition. He wanted to impose Aris upon other nations, which made him an internationalist, not a nationalist. All of Raft Wood's shame at being duped into enabling him, it all washed away. Crack was nothing like real Aris Firsters, and he never had been.\n\nWhen she left, Violet Facade couldn't help but doubt. Raft had doubled down on xenophobia and called it Harmony. But she'd helped make this, right? This was her platform as much as his. Violet had to put her doubts aside in order to do her job, which now meant protecting this agenda from those who would try and sabotage it. And she was, at the end of the day, very good at her job."

Aris First, Aris Strong and Free, but not Aris Only. It was nationalistic, but had liberal elements and approached its task in a spirit of moderation and practicality. Raft Wood swam to his suite to meet with Violet Facade, his mind plagued with anxieties.\n\nThat night, talking about it with Violet Facade, he felt like they had finally gotten past Crack Lightning. The new platform was free of radicalism, hatred and malice. Whenever Crack got a copy of the paper in whatever cell he was rotting in, he'd probably throw up.\n\nAs Violet Facade swam home, she couldn't help but be proud of Raft. He'd been anxious at first, but as they'd went through it point by point she'd convinced him that this was for the best. Aris First would evolve and change, and that was a good thing, but its core would remain. Aris would endure, grow, and become stronger with time."

 arisfirst.85.d:0 "The topics of the convention remained largely uncontroversial, as expected. By the third day, some delegates had sent their regrets, and the press gallery was noticeably thinned.\n\nIn an awkward moment, a resolution was passed unanimously congratulating the Queen for her leadership of the nation and reaffirming the government's commitment to the line of Novo. Raft Wood couldn't contradict them, despite his private feud with Princess Skystar, as officially he served at Her Majesty's pleasure. Nothing substantive came of the resolution, other than a general feeling that they had been good seaponies.\n\nIt was clear, now, that this convention was a waste of time. Propriety was the order of the day, everypony trying to be more polite, trying to ingratiate themselves with Raft Wood and Violet to try and get a small, personal share of the postwar world. But Aris First, the movement, had lost that spark which had made it so powerful. Perhaps it was for the best. Perhaps there was no way to have populism without fascism. And at least now he'd be able to keep Aris First in line.\n\nWhen Raft returned to his office after the last day of the convention, he found another letter from Plumage Moonfeather. Something about more "friendly requests." It didn't matter. With Aris First fizzling out, and relations with the monarchy tepid, he'd have to be extra careful from now on. Angering the businessgriff could spell the end of his government."

A stable harmonist nation in which to safely raise their children and where they could live in peace. They were hopeful for their future in their new home. Then the Aris First party came to power...\n\nThey soldiered through the upheaval that came with the sudden regime change; they beared the discrimination they faced from their neighbours, born from the regime's xenophobic rants; they stayed when others fled, believing that Aris was their home even if it was under a new government. Zorca's wife, Zabreen, even joined the auxiliaries when the North Zebrican War broke out.\n\nShe would pay the ultimate price for an ungrateful government.\n\nNow Zorca was sitting in the empty bedroom, crying about their hopeless situation. Their possessions, as well as another zebra family's, were loaded onto a wagon outside of their home. They had few things left, having sold off most of their possessions in order to fund their journey back to their ancestral homeland. Stifling a sob, he got up and walked out of the bedroom, down the hallway and out of the front door of their former home. Outside, his eldest, Zabreen, was herding her two younger siblings onto the wagon. Along with the same name, she looked and acted just like her mother, she was caring, stubborn...\n\nZorca looked away before the waterworks started again. He took his place next to Zaneem, the oldest son of the other family. His mother and little brother were already on the wagon. Fastening his harness, he gave a nod to the boy and they started pulling, taking a last glance at the house."

Zabreen shouted back at her husband.\nShe went back to the task at hoof, trying to wiggle her stump, all that remained of her right hind leg, into the prosthetic replacement. She refused to let her family members help her, not wanting them to see her in such a vulnerable state. Initially, it was difficult to live with the contraption made of wood and hinges, but she got used to it. Such was the price for stepping on a landmine. After a bit of twisting and pushing it slid into a comfortable position. Satisfied, she got up and joined her family in the front yard. Zorca and Zabreen, her namesake, waited for her outside. Between them was the stroller that carried the sleeping forms of the twins, Zalid and Zulit. Together, they all made their way to the town hall.\nThey were met with pandemonium as they entered the town hall. Zumidians were everywhere, queueing up, filling out documents and looking for assistance among the dozens of clerks that were moving about, trying to complete their work.\n"Corporal Zabreen!" came a shout form the office closest to them. Zabreen turned to see her old commanding officer.\n"Lieutenant Clam." she replied, saluting. He returned the salute and ushered her and her family into the office, closing the door behind them.\n"How's the leg?" Clam asked as everyone settled.\n"Not as good as the original, but at least it doesn't hurt when I bump my knee, so I've got that going for me." she replied. Clam chuckled at the joke. "What're you doing here, sir?"\nClam motioned at the piles paperwork. "I'm here to ensure that all auxiliary veterans receive their citizenship, so if you'll just recite everything this pen-pusher says..."

Colonel Razorbeak walked in, a slight smile on her face. "To what do I owe the pleasure, Colonel?"\n\n"I've been talking with some of your sailors. As you know I head the Phalanx, and so part of that job is to listen to military griffs who are in it. These sailors are, well, a little nervous."\n\n"Nervous? About what?" Skybolt could feel sweat condensing on the back of his neck. Talking with Razorbeak was terrifying, as she looked straight into your eyes, never looked away, and hardly ever seemed to blink.\n\n"About your loyalty." She put a claw on his desk. "Now, I'm not. You've served admirably against our enemies. But, they think that since you're old friends with Posada and thought about running away to Stalliongrad, you might not be reliable if we went to war with Stalliongrad."\n\n"I... what should I do?" Skybolt asked.\n\nRazorbeak shrugged. "This isn't an official visit from the Phalanx or anything, Mr. Spear. This is one commander giving another some information to help him lead. If you want ideas, you could try publicly renouncing your socialist past, and praising the Ace. Taking the Basics of Solidarist Theory course could be good too. But it's your call.

His Doctrine of Solidarism was the central text, but also read was his critique of Marksism, his critique of Harmony, and his essay on the importance of national unity. Although currently-serving officers were not required to take the course, if they were to return to the academy the semester would be covered by the state as long as they passed the course.\n\nThis course, although designed to be easy, was of paramount importance to Crack's plans. He knew that a full-on purge of non-Solidarist elements of the military would be disastrous, crippling the capability of Aris to project power and potentially sparking a civil war. So instead, he provided a gentle nudge to ensure that in the future, the armed forces would assist the Phalanx itself as the exemplars of Arisian ideals, and perhaps his successor would come from within their ranks. In the meantime, understanding why they were fighting would keep officers resilient against bribes or cowardice.\n\nThe professors teaching the course, naturally, were all either members of or ardent supporters of the Phalanx. Although harmonist and leftist professors were still permitted to teach classes on military theory, only the most ideologically pure could be counted on to teach classes on political theory."

 arisfirst.69.d:0 "Crack Lightning had won, that much was clear. But there was still so much work to be done. He had gathered several of the old campaign agents from the Aris First days, and had a folder for each of them. These were not the bloodthirsty Phalanx brutes; these griffs were more tactful.\n\nTheir folders contained lists. Lists of books, lists of authors, lists of librarians, lists of archives, lists of potentates in the relevant syndicates. They were to affect a gradual purge of certain notions from the historical record. Revised editions would be published. Archival material would get lost or damaged. For a few key texts, critical editions would have to be written with refuting annotations, and archival material "discovered" to back up those refutations. New official histories would be compiled. Outright book bannings were too blunt an instrument; Crack had the luxury of time.\n\nThe goal was collective forgetting. The roots of Harmony went deep in Aris' history, and for all his traditionalist rhetoric, Crack Lightning had affected a revolution. Now the task was to gradually make his creatures forget that history, in order to prevent regress.\n\nThe wars of old would be centered in the historical record. The characters and thoughts of ancient rulers would be re-framed. Harmony, it would turn out, was not so deeply rooted after all. Crack Lightning had merely woken us up from a brief moment of weakness, and returned us to what we were always meant to be. Novo's soft-finned Harmonic rule, it would turn out, was the exception. Hard-hearted and iron-clawed rule, patriotism, militarism... these were the rule."

It is a pity, that to fulfil our destiny we had to stifle theirs, but such is the way of the world."\n\n"Sir?" asked Razorbeak as Crack Lightning paused his speech with a drawn-out sip, "The task at claw?"\n\n"Yes, yes, of course. Razorbeak, you wanted to fill the vacancy for military governor of Chiropterra. I assume you know the rather gruesome nature of your predecessor's departure. So, tell me your plans for the occupation."\n\n"Well," began Razorbeak, "I will start by reducing work quotas. In many districts, the work quotas could drop by as much as fifty percent. I'll ensure that each district is run according to the highest standards: abolish child labour, provide medical care, increase food rations. Drop the death rate; as long as they think they're dead anyways they'll do anything to avenge themselves. Then the matter of reprisals. When terrorist attacks happened, my predecessor would order indiscriminate reprisals, no sense of proportionality. I will set clear rules: when they kill one of ours, we kill one of theirs, preferably chosen from those most likely to have aided the insurgents. Clear rules, clear consequences; justice, not malevolence. I will make sure every community knows that it is the resistance endangering their lives, not us."\n\nCrack raised an eyebrow. "My my," he drawled, "Razorbeak, I am impressed. You'll turn your predecessor's failure into an asset. I remember back when we started all this I'd expect you to say 'crack down harder,' but you've gained quite an appreciation for the more precise use of force. You've come a long way, Razorbeak."\n\nRazorbeak smiled, pleased with herself. Crack thought about it for another minute, then knocked back the last of his drink."

They were civilised, and despite what Pan-Zonician posturers said, they were wholly different in blood and spirit from the ungrateful Zumidians and the vile Colthaginians.\n\nIndeed, Crack Lightning has big plans for the Warzenan role within the Hegemony. They are to be local administrators, shopkeeps and overseers keeping the Hegemony running smoothly and keeping the other zebras in line. A privileged position, but every Warzenan will know that their prosperity is granted by the Hippogriffs, and should the Hegemony fall, they would surely perish with it as their savage neighbours turn on the most visible enforcers of Hippogriff rule.\n\nThere is only one question. Will the Warzenan homeland be incorporated as an administrative division of the mainland territories, or will Crack Lightning grant them their own state? Not an independent state of course, but something to be proud of. A flag to swear allegiance to, a leader to put their trust in."

Nothing from Silverstream or Skystar, Moonfeather was behaving well, Silversliver had been arrested for public indecency yet again; the two agreed that things were going well, no new repressions would be needed. Everygriff was staying in line.\n\n"Crack?" Razorbeak said as they got near the bottom of the list, "We have a problem. Posada has left Aris."\n\nCrack slumped down, rubbed his eyes. "My Ace?" Razorbeak inquired, "Shall I try to track the ship? I never understood why you didn't let me dispose of her, but there's still time."\n\n"No," said Crack, "There's no need. Bring me some bourbon, and then you can go home."\n\n"Forgive my impertinence, but, are you upset?"\n"I am, yes," sighed the dictator of Aris, "An old friend has decided she wants nothing to do with the society I am building. I had always hoped she'd see things my way, when my way triumphed. But no. Let her go, Razorbeak. No doubt she is headed for some frozen wasteland.

 arisfirst.92.t:0 "The Letters She Wrote"
 arisfirst.92.d:0 "There was a locked drawer in Crack Lightning's villa which contained all the letters Posada had written him over their long correspondence. From his inquiries about her miraculous escape from the Storm King to the utopian dreams she had shared when they were friends to the desperate pleas she'd made when he'd joined Aris First.\n\nThey had a sentimental value, but a strategic one as well: they were his window into the communist mind, into their impossible goals, their preferred methods, their language, their thought patterns... Posada had shared so much with him, and he had used it to great effect. He had shared very little of his own hopes and plans with her. And that was why he was here, leader of all Aris, and she was on a boat to some frozen socialist hellscape halfway across the world.\n\nCrack Lightning took a sip of bourbon and settled in, carefully unlocking the drawer and pulling out the first letter. As the hours passed and he read each letter in turn, some part of him wondered if he regretted what he'd done. But no. Only the most decadent Harmonist would put one friendship ahead of the good of the nation.\n\nHer letters, the world they described, were Utopian in the regular sense: impossible fantasies which would never see fruition. Her later letters, the pleas, the recriminations, the "This isn't you; you've never cared what hippogriffs wear or what books they read!" were utopian in the Marksist sense: vain appeals to moral platitudes, assuming everygriff was soft-hearted like her. No. Crack Lightning was stronger, more ruthless, and thus fit to lead. And so he did."

We are to occupy a privileged place in their "Hippogriff Hegemony" over North Zebrica, acting as interpreters, bureaucrats, and magistrates over the "lesser zebras."\n\nAccepting would mean the end of our independence, and becoming collaborators in a system of fascistic tyranny over the rest of the mainland, but refusal...

Yeah. As long as we're not Blackhollow or something like that, there's really nothing to complain about. If you don't like your job you can just leave, and maybe you should have invested in some kinda currency that wouldn't be as easily manipulated as the Seashell if you wanted your savings to not be destroyed by inflation?

Our saviours have freed us from the naïve Queen Novo and her harmonist fools, the warmongering Aris First party and the vile communists. Power has been given to the only group who truly cares for your well-being: the job creators." He took a sip of water before continuing.

We can now focus on the task at claw: bringing wealth..." He stopped that sentence. Maybe they weren't ready to hear that bit yet...He looked at his notes and continued. The technicians would fix his hiccup.\n\n"...bringing: prosperity, peace and happiness to our nation. We must also focus on educating ourselves on the mistakes we made in our past so that we may not make them again. Only by working with our benefactors will Aris become stronger than it was before."\n\n"Do not fear for the future, my friends! Under my benevolent guidance I will ensure that everyone benefits from the changes that are to come. In time, you will see this new era as a blessing in disguise, you have my word. All I need is your trust and understanding."\n\n"Aris stands strong!"\n\nWith that last proclamation the Lord Keeper left the recording studio. The final product would be played nationwide later that night on every public radio frequency. His overlords might have preferred a public speech but at this time too many individuals wanted him dead. It was a risk he wasn't willing to take.

One of them even had the gall to say to my face that it was because of my perfectly-legal currency manipulation. Can any of you believe that?"\n\nMoonfeather's associates hissed at the unnamed bureaucrat. He'd gathered them together in a private suite, because the attempts to deny the Arisian Depression were not working.\n\n"That and the plummeting wages," he continued, "And the so-called regressive taxation policies. Look, we have to pay for war reparations somehow and we don't wanna punish the successful. Still, there's ah, something I'm gonna have to ask you to do."\n\nThey looked at him, and they wondered at their kingpin's hesitation.\n\n"This... this can't go on, alright? There's a point at which things get so bad that... Look, the police and our ah, benefactors, will be more than able to prevent any organized uprising, but destitute workers are not productive. And they're unpredictable. One of our esteemed associates isn't here because a homeless hippogriff stabbed him with a screwdriver."\n\nA stunned silence settled over the room. "So, in the interest of our long-term viability, you are all gonna have to sign a new deal with me, and implement a new deal with your workers.

Crack Lightning and the recalcitrants in the public and the military had schemed to bring them into the war, and with King Zamni missing and the mandate in tatters Raft could not in good conscience abandon Zumidia. To do so would have been an insult to Queen Novo. And once hippogriff blood had been spilt, dignity and security demanded Aris crush Chiropterra.\n\nBut with the war over, the time had come to do what Aris First had always promised. The time had come to leave mainland Zebrica behind and never look back. This meant withdrawing entirely from Warzena, Zarantia, and Tobuck, although Chiropterra would require long-term pacification. For the natives, it meant many different things:\n\nFor the Warzenans, it meant a race to Tobuck. Even as their capital lay smoldering and in ruins, the Warzenan army scrambled into the port city, locking it down in street-to-street fighting with the last of the Tobuck mercenaries. The Warzenans could feel pride, even as reconquering the Tobuckians meant thousands more mouths to feed and another city they couldn't afford to rebuild.\n\nFor the Tobuckians, it meant a return to Warzenan rule, along with hunger and poverty. The war had devastated the infrastructure, the waters were polluted, and Chiropterran conscription had ruined the meager harvest. It meant more of the same: slum life and foreign rule.\n\nFor the Imazeeb, it meant the death of the dream of Zarantia. With Tobuck lost again and the tribes bitterly divided over the grievances accumulated during Chiropterran rule, Umalez Ataghan could no longer rule. She retreated into the desert, joining a mysterious group of nomads led by a stranger named Afsax. The Imazeeb fractured, and most of them reverted to a tribal lifestyle. With their neighbors reduced to poverty by the war, raiding took the place of trading. But Zawgha the Ironbreaker, at least, had her funeral pyre for Zarantia."

Teams went searching into the crags of Mount Aris for the seven hidden prisons Crack Lightning had identified. After three hours, all that was left to do was for the once-dictator of Aris to read the speech Skystar had prepared. But after reading it over, he refused.\n\n"What do you mean you refuse?" demanded Skystar.\n"Half of this isn't true."\nSkystar laughed. "You're defending yourself? Now?"\n"No, not defending myself. For instance, the Phalanx torturing Hard Line to extract information about the RWP? True. Holding Novo as a glorified hostage? True. Falsifying charges against Raft Wood to have him executed? True. But I never had Posada disappeared or laid a single claw on her despite knowing where she was hiding during my rule, I never blackmailed Stratus Skyranger, and so on."\n\nSkystar blinked. "Well... alright. You have thirty minutes. Make your edits."\n\nSkystar looked over the speech one last time. "No," she declared, "You are not cutting the part about betraying Aris and all it stands for."\n"I never betrayed Aris."\n"You did!" Skystar shouted, "You betrayed Aris when you oppressed its people!

It was one of the preconditions of his confession, it was essential for Aris to heal, but there was somepony, or somepony's ghost, who was telling her to go back on it. In the middle of all the petitions was a front-page newspaper spread, showing a grainy photograph of the body of Starry Eyes.\n\nStarry Eyes had been abducted by the Phalanx on Lightning's orders, and had died after severe beatings. According to the griff on trial for the murder, "We just wanted to rough her up a bit, send a message like we did with Hard Line... but I guess we ah, went a little too far. Took her hours to die."\n\nSkystar never knew Starry Eyes, but in the last hour she'd read story after story of her kindness, her naivety, her attempts to help everycreature she came across. There were letters from RWP members she'd taken care of after they'd been beaten by the Phalanx, from formerly-homeless seaponies she'd sheltered in her own house, from one of Raft Wood's associates saying she'd helped him keep his job when his employer had tried to fire "politically unreliable" staff... some of them explicitly demanded "Justice for Starry Eyes," others just shared the stories of how she'd touched their lives.\n\nWhen Skystar saw that one of the letters was from Silverstream, she slumped down.

Too much power in too few claws is a recipe for fascist takeover."\n\nSilverstream scratched her chin. "I'm not sure that's right. Plenty of court members were critical of Aris First. And Crack Lightning's takeover wasn't caused by court intrigue, it was a result of mass politics. Aris First recruited aggressively and held huge rallies across the country to put pressure on the government. It was popular pressure that convinced Queen Novo to appoint Crack, not some royal advisor."\n\n"Well," said Posada, "that's a very interesting theory, but I still think giving the people more power is the best way to stop fascism.

Then a few years went by and suddenly all our subjects were lining up to serve a fascist conqueror..."\n\n"Our people aren't bad creatures," Silverstream replied, "they just lost their way.

When I studied in Equestria I saw that even the ponies sometimes lose their faith in Harmony, but they always come back to it in the end."\n\n"It's important to reject prejudice and embrace friendship, sure." Posada interjected, "But there's more to it than that. Our country lives under capitalism, a system that pits creatures against each other in a contest for profit.

Numbers were also ruled out, since the combined population of Aris and Seaquestria should have allowed us to match our enemies in the field.\n\nInstead, the commission concluded that our defeat was a result of the shortcomings of our political and military leadership. While Crack Lightning and the other leaders of the Phalangist state were determined to win the war, they were not able to convince the civilian population to fight it. Most Arisians did not share the Phalangist goal of establishing a hegemony across North Zebrica, so Phalangist propaganda argued for the war's necessity with vague appeals to patriotism. Our military leadership, while highly competent, was marred by confusion about our true objective and uncertain loyalty to the Phalangist state.\n\nAs we struggled to find a reason to fight the war, what little intelligence we have on our enemies suggests they had a much better understanding of who they are, how they fight, and why they fight. This led to better morale and a greater clarity of vision, which the commission argues were the keys to their victory. If we are to stand a chance against them in a hypothetical Second North Zebrica War, we must have clear objectives and a unity of purpose between the public, civilian and military leaders."

There were four provable murders she had ordered alongside dozens of kidnappings and blackmails.\n\nShe had even personally tortured one hippogriff to within an inch of his life when he'd tried to warn Raft Wood of the details of Crack Lightning's planned takeover. Throughout her trial she perfectly fit the image of Lightning's mad dog, denouncing the court and having to be physically restrained. For her, the firing squad was never in doubt.\n\nCrack Lightning's demeanour could not have been more different. He spoke eloquently, relying on his attorney at times and at others taking the stand in his own defence. None of his public confessions could be used in court, as they were made quite literally at gunpoint. And so every kidnapping, every beating, every violation of creature rights had to be painstakingly traced back to him.\n\nHe hadn't personally ordered Hard Line tortured, or at least it couldn't be proven. He hadn't personally ordered Starry Eyes abducted, so he could not be convicted of the most famous murder of his regime.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the Phalangist testimonies, he might have gotten off with a moderate prison sentence. On the third day of the trial his cronies were brought to the witness stand. Phalangist after Phalangist gave their testimony, painting a consistent picture where they all knew what Lightning wanted, even when he didn't say it. And then a few of them produced tapes and documents contradicting the alibis Crack had carefully constructed for himself, explaining that they had kept those pieces of evidence despite orders to destroy them, either as mementos or as insurance.\n\nAt that, Crack Lightning finally lost his cool, calling them traitors and liars.

Today, Posada and Silverstream sat next to her, Posada averting her eyes, Silverstream glaring at the paper on Skystar's desk.\n\nThe paper was a commutation order: Crack Lightning, the tyrant of Aris, was to have his death sentence for the murder of Starry Eyes and the kidnapping and assault of so many others commuted to a lifetime prison sentence. All it required now was Skystar's royal signature. On the other side of the room was a roaring fireplace. Skystar hadn't picked up her pen yet when she glanced side-to-side at her advisors.\n\nPosada opened her beak first: "I know that you've received a petition, mostly signed by Blues, to not commute Crack's sentence. As their representative in your cabinet I... I have to remind you of that. But I think you should spare him."\n\nSilverstream snapped: "I say throw it into the fire and let the bastard die!"\n\nSkystar shook her head. "Most of the other Harmonists have been clear that I should keep my promise."\n"Yeah well I don't care! You never should have made that promise and this would be like sparing the Storm King!"\nPosada raised her voice: "Crack Lightning is not the Storm King! I would know!"\n"Yeah, you were tortured by the Storm King, and Starry Eyes was tortured TO DEATH by Lightning! He spared you because you were his friend, and now you're gonna repay the favour, is that it?"\n"Don't you dare!" snarled Posada.\n\n"Stop it!" shouted Skystar, silencing them both. "I haven't made up my mind, and insulting each other won't help me. On the one claw, I promised Crack I'd spare him. On the other claw, maybe I shouldn't have. Maybe justice is more important than mercy, or my word."\n"Justice for Starry Eyes!" declared Silverstream, as so many had done before.\nPosada whispered: "Starry Eyes wouldn't have seen it that way.""

"To crow over me?"\n\n"No." Posada stared deep into his eyes. "To ask you--why? Why did you kill Starry Eyes, who was no threat? Why did you have your own citizens tortured? Why did you act so evilly towards your own people?"\n\n"I was trying to help Aris," Crack replied. "To make us strong and feared."\n\n"Is that the truth?" Posada demanded. "Or the excuse you use to sleep at night?"\n\nCrack swallowed. "Posada, I only wanted to make sure we never suffered again like we did under the Storm King."\n\n"And so you decided to become almost as bad as him," Posada said coldly. "I can't believe I used to call you my friend. Were you always this horrible, or did power corrupt you?"\n\nCrack averted his eyes. "I..."\n\n"I hope power did corrupt you.

It seemed like she had no choice but to give in to their demands.\n\nSkystar didn't have any problem with a constitution in principle. Her mother argued that a queen should never allow a constitution to come between her and her subjects, but she could see how the potential benefits outweighed the costs. The problem was that a constitution needed someone to write it. Nearly every qualified creature in the kingdom had become embroiled in the partisan divide between the Blues and the Pinks, so no matter who she chose she was certain to upset one side or the other.\n\nOn the one claw, Skystar might put her trust in Silverstream and the Harmonists by appointing them to lead the constitutional convention. The Blues would throw a fit, but the Pinks would undoubtedly draft a document that stayed true to traditional liberal Harmonist ideals. Maybe after years of chaos and fascist rule her kingdom could use a return to tradition.\n\nOn the other claw she could give Posada and the Communists control of the convention. The Blues would likely write a constitution that enshrined all kinds of socialist principles in law. The Pinks wouldn't be happy with that, but maybe creating a more fair and equitable system would be worth the backlash.\n\nThen again, there was a third option. Skystar could take her mother's advice and put off adopting a constitution, at least for now.

Together they reformed Hippogriffia into a nationalist workers' state, executed Queen Novo for treason, carved an empire out of North Zebrica alongside the Colthaginians, and then launched a brutal punitive war against the yetis in the name of revenge against the Storm King. At the climax of the book, Posada orders nuclear weapons used on every city in yeti territory. Immediately afterwards unconditional surrender is offered and a ruthless military governate is established, ruled over by Razorbeak.\n\nThe RWP has denounced the novel as a slanderous attack on communism, claiming they would never ally with a fascistic dictator. Even many harmonists feel the book is in poor taste, especially so soon after the liberation of Aris. Although a few have asked for the book to be censored, or at least sold via mail order rather than in stores, such requests are unlikely to succeed due to the strong desire for freedom of the press.\n\nPrivately Posada confessed to Princess Skystar that she was deeply shaken by how well the author understood her motives and her mental state. "After my escape, I wanted revenge," she admitted. "I was vulnerable, and I easily could have wound up in Aris First.

If Crack had refused to surrender, would it have been right for Skystar to shoot him? I think it would. Political violence is an ugly thing, but when it's directed against fascist monsters it's also a good thing."\n\n"Oh look at me I'm Posada and I think shooting people is fine," said Silverstream, "Look, that was a revolt, he still had control of the army and could've killed us! There's a big big difference between violence in war and violence in peace time. We can't call ourselves a harmonic society if we allow a murder to go unpunished, no matter how much we think it was justified."\n\nSkystar didn't want to hear any more arguing about this.

You had no way of knowing what Lightning planned to do. Don't worry, we're going to set things right again."\n\nThe Queen-Mother sniffled again. "Thank you Skystar. I'm so proud of you.""
 antifa.28.a:0 "We're on the right track."

 antifa.29.t:0 "Dinner with the Queen-Mother"
 antifa.29.d:0 "After abdicating the throne, Queen-Mother Novo has remained an important figure in Arisian society. While some will always despise her for being the queen who appointed Crack Lightning, most creatures have forgiven her, and she always receives a warm reception at public ceremonies.\n\nWhen Queen Skystar received her mother's dinner invitation she knew it was going to be a tense evening. The Queen-Mother was much more conservative than her daughter, and though she would never publicly break with Skystar she frequently voiced concerns in private.\n\nSkystar dipped her spoon into the soup while her mother silently cut some kelp on her plate. They used to spend hours talking every night, but so far they'd barely said a word to each other.\n\n"So," Novo said, finally breaking the silence, "I hear you've been relying on Posada's council more and more lately."\n"Yes, mother. I know it's a bit odd for the Queen's chief advisor to be a communist, but Posada and I get along quite well. She's exactly the kind of creature I need to help preserve the realm in these troubled times."\n\n"That's funny," Novo replied, "I once said the same thing about Crack Lightning."\n\n"Mother!" Skystar shouted, "I won't let you compare my friend to that monster! Have you ever wondered why Crack was able to take advantage of you so easily? It's because the old way of doing things left us vulnerable. We need to embrace change to prevent another Lightning, and there's no one I trust more to bring about that change than Posada."\n\nThe Queen-Mother looked like she was on the verge of tears. "I'm sorry honey, I'm just so scared. I was a failure as Queen, every creature knows that. I allowed that monster to take control and ruin our lives. I don't want you to make the same mistake I did."\n\nSkystar got up and gave her mother a hug. "It's ok, it's not your fault. But I need you to trust me when I say I won't let that happen again."\n\n"Ok," Novo sniffled, "I trust you, Skystar.""
 antifa.29.a:0 "I hope you know what you're doing, Skystar."

 antifa.30.t:0 "On Military Culpability"
 antifa.30.d:0 "Of all the parts of Crack Lightning's legacy Skystar had to untangle, none was more controversial than the role of the military. It was undeniably a base of support for the Phalangist regime, but that didn't change the fact that thousands of hippogriffs served in it during the war. Most creatures tried to draw a line between the fanatic criminals and the rest of the military. They wanted to believe their friends and relatives fought honorably to defend Aris.\n\n"We need to purge the armed forces of Phalangist sympathizers." Posada said with a stern face. "Many soldiers and officers aided Crack, and we can't have them in our military."\n\n"We should keep investigations to a minimum and punishments light." said Silverstream, "If we go after every soldier who did something questionable under Lightning, most of the army will be purged. And the vast majority of them aren't Phalangists, they were just following orders."\n\n"That doesn't justify crimes against creaturekind!" Posada shouted, "If a soldier is ordered to execute deserters or massacre defenseless POWs, they should disobey those orders! Didn't Sky Beak, your own father, understand that when he resigned from the army in protest?"\n\n"It's true, my father resigned when Aris First took over." Silverstream looked down, "He knew from the things they'd said about me that they were bad people. But he told me that it wasn't an easy decision to make. Every soldier faced the difficult task of deciding whether or not to obey orders from their superiors and from their government. My father and a few others refused, but many good creatures failed that test."\n\n"Well, it's clear we're never going to see eye-to-eye on this," Posada turned to Skystar, "so I guess it's your call.""

 commander.1.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 commander.1.d:0 "Razorbeak looked down at the Ace's body. Crack Lightning was barely recognizable. The damned princess had shot him, probably at least a half dozen times from the look of it. There was simply no way he was alive. Such a pity. With him died the hope of a strong Aris.\n\nShe had driven off Skystar and the traitors, but it was too late. Nogriff could lead like Crack Lightning did, not even Razorbeak. Still, she knew he would approve of her taking power after his assassination. Yes, assassination. That is what had befallen her mentor, her hero, her Ace. Vile assassination. Murdered in his own home. Could Aris sink any lower?\n\nOf course it could. Degeneracy knew no limits. Crack Lightning had tried to save Aris from its decadence, had tried to lead them to glory, and they had repaid him with cowardice, betrayal and murder. But Razorbeak held the power now. If she acted quickly, she could finish off Skystar's traitors, finish off the disloyal Phalanx, secure control over the army. She had all of Crack's files, all his information on every officer, every dissident, every traitor within Aris.\n\nThey called Crack Lightning a tyrant. Cursed him for trying to make them strong. Well, Razorbeak would show them true tyranny. She would avenge Crack Lightning on the pathetic population of Aris, and then mould the next generation into a nation worthy of carrying on Crack Lightning's legacy."

 commander.5.d:0 "Humid Wind peeked through the blinds for what must have been the tenth time in the past half hour. When he saw that no one was outside, he returned to his wife in the living room.\n\n"Our daughter's still not home from school."\n"Maybe she's just playing with her friends," she said, "You don't have to worry so much."\n\nHumid's face tensed up. "Actually, I DO have to worry. Have you noticed that everygriff's completely lost their minds? Crack Lightning's dictatorship was awful, but at least there was some sanity to it. Now having a harmonist cousin is enough to make all our neighbors avoid us like the plague, and we have to dodge armed militias everywhere we go!"\n\n"Calm down dear, there's nothing we can do about it now."\n"You're right," Humid sighed, "Our passports are worthless, and finding a ship willing to smuggle us out is slow-going. Until I can find some way for us to escape this nightmare, we're going to have to make the best of it."\n\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door. Humid grew nervous, but when he looked through the blinds and saw his daughter he rushed to let her in.\n\n"Honey! Welcome home-"\nHumid froze when he saw the soldier standing behind her. With a smile on her face, his daughter pointed right at him.\n\n"That's him sir. That's the traitor.""

 commander.6.d:0 "Azure Sky was standing at attention when the officer walked in. In spite of her youth she had the discipline of a professional soldier.\n\n"You've done well," the officer said, "for a miserable little whelp. One of the most fanatic members of the Youth Warrior's League, and you've won most of your sparring matches. Your record is so impressive I'm thinking of ignoring your age and putting you into basic training a few years early. Would you like that?"\n\n"Yes sir! It is an honor to serve Aris, sir!"\n\n"Right answer. But before you get fitted for a new uniform, there's one final test you have to pass."\nThe officer gave a signal and a soldier entered the room dragging a hippogriff in chains. The prisoner was malnourished and covered in bruises, but Azure recognized him instantly.\n\n"Honey, it's me, it's dad. Honey, help me! Please!"\n"Now," said the officer, "what do you see in front of you?"\n\nAzure swallowed hard. "I see a traitor, sir."\n\nThe light in her father's eyes died out. He tried to speak but couldn't find the words. Meanwhile the officer smiled.\n"And what do you think we should do with traitors?"\n\n"It's simple sir. We purge them.""
 commander.6.a:0 "Without weakness, without mercy."

 commander.7.t:0 "The Ace"
 commander.7.d:0 "As the most sacred spot on Mount Aris, the Harmonizing Heights had always been the site of major events. It was usually used for joyful celebrations or more somber affairs. There was no precedent for the ceremony being held today which, while officially a memorial service, had the energy of a riot.\n\nCrack Lightning's corpse was front and center on the stage, the bullet hole in his skull clearly visible. Razorbeak stood behind him in full uniform, glaring at the mourners. The crowd was one of the largest the heights had ever seen, most hippogriffs attending out of fear of their new Commander. The smart ones made an effort to look sad, those who didn't found themselves targeted by the armed detachments storming through the crowd.\n\nAfter waiting for what felt like an eternity, Razorbeak delivered her eulogy.\n"Crack Lightning was the greatest Arisian to ever live. He saved us from the Storm King, he delivered us from the pathetic monarchy, and he prepared us for the glory of foreign conquest and hegemony."\n\nRazorbeak dug her claws into Crack's coffin. "But it was not enough. The Ace could not fully purge the weakness and degeneracy from our society, and the harmonic parasites that remained managed to kill him. Whose fault is that?" She paused. The crowd held its breath.\n\n"IT'S YOUR FAULT!" she shrieked, "You cowards failed him! In his hour of need you stood by and watched as the war was lost, watched as the traitorous princess murdered him! Now he's dead and it's because of each and every one of you!"\n\nRazorbeak's eyes were filled with rage, her gaze so frightening that even her bodyguards started to shift uncomfortably. After a moment of heavy breathing, she continued.\n\n"But this is not the end! We will honor The Ace's memory by building the kind of society he would be proud of. Everyone must live according to his principles, purging the weaklings and traitors in our midst to make Aris the strongest state in the world!""
 commander.7.a:0 "ARIS ETERNAL!"
 
 commander.8.t:0 "Coming Alive"
 commander.8.d:0 "Salty Seas staggered down a dark alleyway. His muscles screamed for him to stop, but his stomach demanded he keep going. Normally older creatures like him had families to take care of them, but he'd lost all of his children to the war. Now he was stuck on Mount Aris, far away from his home in Seaquestria, trying to stay alive.\n\n"And just where do you think you're going?" said a voice behind him. Salty turned around to find three teenage hippogriffs wielding clubs.\n"I'm trying to reach the bakery." he replied, leaving out that he intended to rummage through the dumpster behind it.\n"You'd better turn around if you know what's good for you. Seaponies aren't welcome around here!"\n\n"Please, just let me-" Salty was cut off by a youth slamming a club into his chest.\n"It's because of cowards like you that we lost the war!" screamed the teen as the others rushed to join in. Salty quickly fell to the ground, but their blows and kicks did not stop.\n\nJust when Salty thought he was going to pass out, he heard someone shouting, "What is going on here!?"\nThe youths stopped their assault, apparently dumbfounded. Salty looked up to see none other than Razorbeak standing over him, flanked by her bodyguards.\n\n"Supreme Commander!" one of the teens replied nervously, "We were just teaching this seapony traitor a lesson."\nAt first Razorbeak said nothing, then a sinister smile spread across her face. "May I join you?"\n\nSuddenly the whole group descended upon Salty. The youths, the Commander and her guards all showered him with furious blows. Clubs, claws and hooves made contact everywhere. He felt his ribs crack, then his skull, then he didn't feel anything."
 commander.8.a:0 "Weaklings get what they deserve."
 
 commander.9.t:0 "Noble Fear"
 commander.9.d:0 "For all her faults, Supreme Commander Razorbeak was a pioneer in the field of psychological warfare. She understood that wars were not lost when the army was defeated, but when the civilian population lost the will to fight. Just as the military conducted training exercises to maintain a constant state of readiness, the civilian population would need to be primed for any possible war.\n\nEvery corner of Mount Aris was covered in propaganda posters and war murals, some depicting scenes of graphic violence. Every radio broadcast began and ended with a report on Aris's many enemies and their plans for invasion. At every moment of the day, creatures were reminded that the country was under a constant state of siege.\n\nSome propaganda focused on Chiropterra, the militant cult determined to enslave Aris for their false goddess. Other messages were directed against Colthage, the republic of barbaric zebras so jealous of Aris's greatness that they were determined to destroy it. But these enemies were not the main targets of the Commander's efforts, because they at least fought Aris directly like real warriors.\n\nThe true enemies were the harmonists, who tried to undermine Aris from within. Harmony was a disease polluting Aris, a rot that had infected its very core. The harmonists had been scheming against Aris ever since the Equestrian element bearers tried to steal the glory of defeating the Storm King. Equestrian influence was at work all over Aris, and there was no doubt that they had inspired Skystar to mutiny and murder The Ace. Even now the harmonists plotted their return to Aris at the head of foreign armies.\n\nThe harmonists encouraged their citizens to overcome fear, to be brave and support each other. They didn't understand that fear is a powerful motivator. When a population is subjected to a constant barrage of fear mongering, they quickly learn to fall in line and do as they're told."
 commander.9.a:0 "Fear and hatred are a potent mix."

 commander.13.t:0 "The New Generation"
 commander.13.d:0 "Razorbeak was rarely in a good mood, but today was an exception. The Supreme Commander had a smile on her face as she inspected the newest graduates of the Army's officer training school.\n\nThis was the first class to graduate after the Supreme Commander personally revised the curriculum, and it showed. Every one of them was a perfect specimen, physically fit and completely ruthless. Razorbeak had been told that the dropout rate was three times higher than it had been in previous classes, but that was a good thing. Cowards and weaklings had no place in Aris's armed forces.\n\n"Congratulations cadets," she said as she concluded her inspection, "Your studies are over, and you're finally ready to be commissioned as officers."\nThe cadets looked excited, but not a single one of them made a noise or broke rank. Razorbeak's smile grew.\n\n"Your discipline is impeccable, but there's more to being an officer than discipline." Razorbeak approached a female cadet.\n"Do you think you're ready to be an officer?"\n"Sir, yes sir!"\n"Good, then fight me."\n\n"Sir yes si- wait, what?" the cadet stammered, realizing what the Commander had said.\n"You heard me. Fight me right now."\n"Sir, it's against protocol to strike a superior officer-"\n"What's the matter, you think I'm weak? Are you so arrogant as to think you can hurt me!?"\n"No sir, I just-"\n\nRazorbeak cut the cadet off by punching her in the face. The blow was hard enough that she collapsed on the spot.\n\nWith fire in her eyes, the Commander yelled "Let that be a lesson to everyone here, never disobey a direct order! More importantly, remember that a true warrior never shies away from a fight!""
 commander.13.a:0 "ARIS ETERNAL! HAIL THE COMMANDER!"

 commander.14.t:0 "The Fate of the Leftist Admiral"
 commander.14.d:0 "Supreme Commander Razorbeak looked over the list of officers to be purged once again. The first one was a degenerate harmonist traitor, the next had been promoted by Queen Novo. The third was too cowardly, and the fourth had failed The Ace by losing an important battle during the war. Each and every one of them deserved to be exterminated with extreme prejudice.\n\nShe was three pages into the list before she found a name that gave her pause: Skybolt Spear. A known communist sympathizer who was a personal friend of Posada before the suppression of all leftist groups. A traitorous association like that required nothing less than immediate execution.\n\nStill, Razorbeak couldn't help but feel that it was such a waste. Being a communist made Skybolt a vile traitor, but at least he wasn't a harmonist. Skybolt also distanced himself from the communists when Aris First came to power, and afterwards he had willingly served The Ace. If he was frightened into loyalty once, he could easily be frightened again. Not to mention that during the war he proved himself to be a talented admiral, winning several victories for Aris.\n\nMaybe there was another way to deal with this traitor. Perhaps psychological torture until he provided a satisfactory confession, then intense public humiliation. Parade him around and make him apologize for his past mistakes, make him promise to serve with unquestioning loyalty from now on. That might be enough of a punishment to allow his reinstatement."
 commander.14.a:0 "Let him return to duty after some groveling."
 commander.14.b:0 "No mercy for traitors."

 commander.15.t:0 "The Phalanx Broken"
 commander.15.d:0 "From the very moment it was created, the Phalanx had been Razorbeak's pet project. She worked hard to build up the paramilitary organization's power while keeping its true nature a secret from the useful idiots on the moderate end of Aris First. She also tried to imprint her own ideas on the Phalanx, making sure its members revered Aris and The Ace just as she did.\n\nYet in the nation's darkest hour, when the weak hippogriffs and seaponies failed The Ace by losing the war, the Phalanx turned on him. Only a few units, those she'd kept on a tighter leash, fought for Crack Lightning till the end. The rest had turned on him and created the chaos which lead to Skystar's mutiny, making them accomplices in the assassination of The Ace.\n\nNow, after months of investigations and violent interrogations, Razorbeak had finally gotten to the root of the plot. She knew exactly which soldiers were responsible for the mutiny and which soldiers had remained loyal. The latter would be reorganized to form the core of a new vanguard unit, the former were all locked up and awaiting execution.\n\nYet some part of Razorbeak hesitated. These weren't just any traitors, these were her friends. They were officers she'd served with for years, soldiers she'd personally trained. Even if they had betrayed Aris, killing them felt wrong.\n\nRazorbeak agonized over the decision for a few moments before realizing how foolish this line of thinking was. These Phalanx members weren't her friends, Crack Lightning was her friend, and these traitors had taken him away from her! Purging weakness required more than purging society, it required a purging of the self as well. Any impulses that restrained her, anything that prevented her from doing what must be done had to go.\n\nWithout wasting another second she signed the order for a mass execution. Her only regret was that she had failed to instill proper loyalty in these soldiers."
 commander.15.a:0 "Aris must come before all else."

 commander.11.t:0 "Riots In Seaquestria!"
 commander.11.d:0 "Following our takeover, riots and protests have broken out across Seaquestria. Razorbeak has always had disdain for seapony cowardice, but it seems this was the final straw. Going on the radio, she railed against the seaponies for being cowards, weaklings, pathetic Harmonists who had failed their country and failed The Ace.\n\n"You were given so many chances", she concluded, "You were coddled, protected, nurtured by us hippogriffs. But you have repaid our leadership with failure and now with rebellion. It seems you need a firm claw from now on. I am hereby declaring curfew and martial law in Seaquestria. All terrorists, separatists, and defeatists shall be dealt with in the harshest manner. Those who surrender themselves will be spared."\n\nAfter her address, Razorbeak pondered her orders. No doubt, the seaponies would try to resist. No doubt, many in the army would refuse to do what was necessary. This would help her separate the wheat from the chaff: those hippogriffs who "went native" while suppressing the seaponies, those who refused to carry out her orders, those who expressed sympathies with the separatists, they would be discharged or court-martialled. The violence she would unleash upon Seaquestria would bring the seaponies to heel, but it would also purify the Hippogriffs. Just as The Ace would want."
 commander.11.a:0 "The seaponies have underestimated our resolve."

 commander.2.t:0 "Aris Demands Skystar's Extradition!"
 commander.2.d:0 "The new dictator of Aris, "Supreme Commander" Razorbeak, has sent us a message demanding we hoof over the exiled Princess Skystar to be tried for treason and murder for her assassination of Crack Lightning, the previous dictator of Aris. Skystar had been staying with Pinkie Pie following her escape from Aris. She freely admitted to killing Crack Lightning when questioned, adding that he had forced her claw by refusing to surrender during her attempt to restore Aris' legitimate government.\n\nIn the last few years, Aris has devolved from a Harmonic monarchy under Skystar's mother Novo to a pseudo-fascist regime which maintained at least a facade of decency under Crack Lightning, to a brazenly totalitarian military dictatorship. Novo's whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nHoofing Skystar over to the madgriff in charge of her homeland is out of the question, despite the outlandish threats contained in Razorbeak's missive. Given [HIP.GetName]'s recent defeat, her chances of following up on those threats are close to zero. Twilight Sparkle has offered to personally draft a scathing reply, but it might be best to not take an official position on the subject of Crack Lightning's assassination, lest we lend credence to Razorbeak's wild accusations that we somehow orchestrated it."
 commander.2.a:0 "Let Twilight have her fun."
 commander.2.b:0 "A simple "No" will suffice."

 commander.16.t:0 "The Plan, Derailed"
 commander.16.d:0 "Crack Lightning had never anticipated the Phalanx rebellion, so he'd coordinated the response from an improvised headquarters. Razorbeak had learned, and now she paced back and forth inside a command bunker made of two-meter-thick reinforced concrete and ringed with a half-dozen outer bunkers, a radar station, was camouflaged in one of Mount Aris' near-impassable crags. A network of buried telephone wires and radio sets ensured that from here, Razorbeak could coordinate the defence of Aris should internal or external enemies threaten her rule. She had dismissed her security analysts a few minutes ago, and pondered what they'd said as she glanced at the telephone set.\n\nThis had all happened before. The Phalanx had questioned The Ace's courage after his surrender, and that had grown into open revolt. Now the young officers, her pride, the torchbearers of the New Aris, had started grumbling. They thought she hadn't heard them scoffing at the Twenty-Year Plan. They thought she hadn't heard them complaining that they'd have to wait so long for a real war. They thought they hadn't heard when they said she'd "gone soft."\n\nObviously, the plan would need to be revised. She could not simply wait for the outrage, the hate, the pressure she'd created to turn the coal of Arisian weakness into diamonds. If she didn't act now the whispers would get louder, and she would fall just as Lightning had. She'd already decided the first step. She'd gather the young officers for an announcement. Now she just had to decide: would that announcement be for the war they all wanted, or for their executions?"
 commander.16.a:0 "Razorbeak picked up the telephone..."

 commander.17.t:0 "The War of Vengeance"
 commander.17.d:0 ""My soldiers. Defenders of Aris. The future of this world shall be written in blood. Years ago, I asked for time, and you have given it to me. I have exacted vengeance on the traitors, the weaklings, the cowards, all who failed The Ace. Those who sought to divide us are no more. I have done this through you: the strength in my claws, the carriers of my dream. You have shown me your strength, and now it is time to reveal that strength to the world. On this day, those who humiliated us in the North Zebrican War shall see this new Aris. On this day, they will feel the wrath that has been burning inside the hearts of every one of you. On this day, we begin our conquest of North Zebrica! We begin our vengeance for The Ace! And we begin the fulfillment of his glorious vision for Aris. Aris Eternal!"\n\nRazorbeak switched off the radio. She had actually been getting into it. She glanced at the portrait of Crack Lightning in her command bunker. He was always a better orator than Razorbeak, but she felt she'd done him proud this time."
 commander.17.a:0 "Our revenge has begun!"

 commander.21.t:0 "The Equestrian Response"
 commander.21.d:0 "Equestria's reply is everything we could have hoped for and more. Princess Twilight Sparkle sent the Supreme Commander a personal message denouncing her, Crack Lightning, everything [HIP.GetName] stands for, the Aris First movement, and even the principle of nationalism itself! She went so far as to say that the assassination of Crack Lightning was his own fault for refusing Skystar's mercy, and predict that Razorbeak's regime would last "three years at most" before Harmony came roaring back.\n\nNaturally, we have turned this letter into the basis of a whole new wave of propaganda: "Three years to prepare for Equestrian intervention! Look how these princesses hate Aris, and all Arisians. They all but admitted to aiding Skystar in her foul act of murder!"\n\nAnd so on and so forth. The Equestrians would from now on form the centerpiece, the eternal constant of the ever-shifting rogue's gallery of foreign enemies looming just beyond Aris' shores. Razorbeak would make sure every Arisian read this letter, and knew what it meant: the Equestrians hate us, they have always hated us, and any day now we will have to defend our homes against their wrath."
 commander.21.a:0 "It's almost too good to be true!"

 commander.22.t:0 "The Equestrian Response"
 commander.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems the Equestrians did not "bite." In a perfunctory response, [EQS.GetLeader] declined our request and said in no uncertain terms that they were not interested in pursuing diplomatic or other relations with [HIP.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile we could fabricate a more combative response or otherwise continue to stoke fears of Equestrian-backed Harmonist-Skystarist terrorism, some within Razorbeak's inner circle are suggesting we forget about Skystar and pivot to fearmongering about one of our foes from the North Zebrican War.\n\nThis would remove the ability to neatly tie together internal and external enemies with the same elegance, but it might be easier to propagandize against countries which have killed so many Arisians in recent memory rather than former allies whose crimes are largely symbolic."
 commander.22.a:0 "Equestria and Skystar remain our chief threat."
 commander.22.b:0 "Pivot to Chiropterra."
 commander.22.c:0 "Pivot to Colthage."

 commander.23.t:0 "The Elusive Princess"
 commander.23.d:0 "While she had initially set course for Equestria, it appears that Princess Skystar and her entourage never arrived. We have scoured up and down Aris and Seaquestria looking for her, but it is as if she vanished into thin air. Upon hearing the news, Supreme Commander Razorbeak shut herself in the war room for hours, pouring over maps to try and discern where Skystar could have gone.\n\nDuring that time, Razorbeak came up with a new idea: perhaps it didn't matter? Perhaps Skystar's very elusiveness could be used to our advantage? If she is nowhere to be found, then we can claim that she is still in Seaquestria somewhere, which would make our crackdowns on the riotous seaponies that much easier to justify. Or perhaps we could claim that she was a fifth-columnist all along, and is living like a Princess in the lands of one of our North Zebrican War enemies. The possibilities are limitless!"
 commander.23.a:0 "Skystar sold us out to Chiropterra!"
 commander.23.b:0 "Skystar is in a patrician's mansion in Colthage!"
 commander.23.c:0 "Skystar is plotting a rebellion in Seaquestria!"

 commander.24.t:0 "Aris Requests to Join Us!"
 commander.24.d:0 "Supreme Commander Razorbeak, ruler of [HIP.GetNameDef], has sent us a tempting offer. In light of her predecessor's assassination at the claws of deposed hippogriff princess Skystar, and of Equestria's continued sheltering of said assassin, she has offered to join our war against [EQS.GetLeader]. All she asks for is a seat at the victor's table, and that if the renegade princess be found, that she be delivered "alive and unspoiled" to [HIP.GetNameDef]. Given her predecessor's maritime ambitions, she is likely to prioritize taking the islands of the middle sea and the southeastern coast of Equestria if we give her that spot at the peace conference."
 commander.24.a:0 "The might of Hippogriffia for a few islands? Deal!"
 commander.24.b:0 "Keep your stinking claws off my islands!"

 commander.25.t:0 "The Coming War"
 commander.25.d:0 "Success! Equestria's enemies have accepted our offer, and we are poised to strike at the hated Equestrians. The thalassocracy which The Ace dreamed of is almost in reach, we merely need to extend our claw and take it. After our victory, none shall ever question the Supreme Commander again."
 commander.25.a:0 "To Battle!"

 commander.26.t:0 "Fools!"
 commander.26.d:0 "Bad news. Equestria's foes have refused our help, scoffing at our military might. Supreme Commander Razorbeak is once more facing veiled dissent among the officers, who blame her for waiting too long to strike at our Equestrian nemesis. Perhaps it is time for another purge..."
 commander.26.a:0 "Skystar must be laughing now."

 commander.10.t:0 "The Youth Migration"
 commander.10.d:0 "Heartening news is reaching us from Seaquestria. It seems our messaging against the weakness and decadence of the previous generation is catching on with youth, who are reporting high rates of truancy, delinquency, and strife within families. While these youngsters will of course have to be straightened out via mandatory military service, the basic cultural move is that the youth, particularly in Seaquestria, have lost all patience for their parents' fin-wringing pacifism.\n\nIn particular, out of a combination of patriotism and a desire to spite their parents, many young seaponies have made the courageous decision to reject the seapony way of life entirely and abandon the underwater hubs of weakness in favour of breathing the heady air of Mount Aris.\n\nYoung Warriors League leaders have taken it on themselves to teach these intrepid youngsters flying lessons, and more than a few aspire to become pilots like The Ace to truly learn what it means to be a Hippogriff."
 commander.10.a:0 "Such laudable initiative!"
 commander.10.b:0 "If it's worth doing, it's worth forcing."

 commander.12.t:0 "The Long Wait"
 commander.12.d:0 "Razorbeak stared at the pre-schoolers playing in the barracks nursery. The green-feathered one was her favourite; she displayed the instinctual aggression which meant she would respond well to the new state's tutelage, when the time came to start training her more explicitly. Razorbeak smiled as the green one pushed over a red one, and she smiled even more when the red one clawed back at the green one.\n\nLong ago, Razorbeak had had a lover. She had wanted to adopt children, an idea Razorbeak had dismissed. That was before she left, as all others had sooner or later, calling Razorbeak "cold" and "distant" and "scary." Razorbeak didn't know where she was now, but alive or dead, she had gotten her way. After a fashion.\n\nRazorbeak had "adopted" all the children of this generation, and through the New Hippogriff state, she would teach them well. The spontaneous attacks against cowards, the denunciations of friends and family, the zeal in the new officers... that was only the beginning. That was what her teachings could do with teenage minds, given only a little while. With the mind of a small child: raised under the pressure of national shame from the moment they could speak, heated up by the fires of rage and revenge... they would emerge as hard as diamonds, perfect soldiers. All she needed to do was wait.\n\nThe green one and the red one stopped fighting. She heard a mumbled "Sorry..." from the green one. Razorbeak frowned. Well. That kind of thing was why her reforms were necessary in the first place. She would learn soon enough."

 hippogriff_abyss.1.t:0 "The Mareiana Report"
 hippogriff_abyss.1.d:0 "A minor incident has arisen lately in the AHAC, involving the recent patrolling of the Mareiana Trench outside of Seaquestria. While the small detachment sent to the depths initially reported everything as normal, we soon lost contact with them hours later. Initially this was not alarming itself, as the depths have been known to block out communications, but worries began to rise when team did not return upon the scheduled time. It was only a day later, right as a search party was ready to look for them that they appeared from the trench, looking a little worse for wear but otherwise unharmed.\n\nUpon being questioned for their extended absence, they repeatedly insisted that nothing happened during the time in the trench, and that they simply lost track of the time. A minor report on the incident has been filed, and the guards are being sent for further questioning, but other than that the AHAC has seen no need to take further action. Officials are putting this down as just another rookie mistake by fresh recruits, and though a few seaponies are worried at the development, this event will likely forgotten within a few days at most."
 hippogriff_abyss.1.a:0 "Still, perhaps we should hold off on more expeditions for the time being."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.2.t:0 "The Underwater Societies"
 hippogriff_abyss.2.d:0 "More troubling news is coming out of Seaquestria as of late, this time involving issues of a more serious nature. Multiple officials stationed around the underwater nation have reported the formation of what seem to be secret societies all over Seaquestria, each being eerily similar to each other. And yet, despite our best efforts we have been unable to discern their intention, or even what kind of threat they may pose to both seaponies and hippogriffs. What we do know is that they are rapidly growing in number, and while currently constrained beneath the waves some on Mount Aris are afraid that it may spread to the mainland.\n\nEven more worrying is that evidence points to the seaponies sent to the Mareiana Trench as responsible for starting the societies, and we have been unable to find them since only a few short weeks after their return. Fearful whispers speak of a plot growing against Hippogriffia itself, but for now they remained consigned to just that; rumors. All we can do at the moment is wait and see what these societies will do."
 hippogriff_abyss.2.a:0 "Let us hope that the situation does not escalate..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.3.t:0 "Breakdown Of Order"
 hippogriff_abyss.3.d:0 "Just as we feared, the situation has escalated in Seaquestria. Only a few days ago, violence broke out all across the underwater realm, plunging large parts of it into chaos. Small feuds that normally would be resolved with simple words, like running into one another and different tastes in music have all incited physical assaults, seapony fighting seapony until broken up by others. The societies were our initial suspects, but it seems that the phenomenon has affected even them as some in their ranks were sighted engaging in blows. The rest continue to meet in secluded places, unhindered by the crisis.\n\nNo matter the cause, the situation is untenable and something must now be done. A possible solution would be to send in more hippogriff soldiers underwater to enforce peace until the seaponies regain their wits. While it would prove immensely unpopular with some and may take a while, we would at least minimize the damage and spread of the violent outbreak.\n\nAnother option proposed by the cabinet is to seek help from Equestria and the Elements of Harmony. Foul magic seems to be at play here, and the ponies have aided us before in our time of need. With their help, whatever is causing this will surely be caught and order restored quickly, as long as the Equestrians actually agree to help.\n\nOf course, we could also always just wait out the chaos and hope that the seaponies regain their sanity on their own."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.a:0 "We can deal with this ourselves."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.b:0 "The Elements saved us once; we must ask for their aid again."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.c:0 "This chaos is simply temporary, we just have to wait it out."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.4.t:0 "Seaquestrian Order Restored"
 hippogriff_abyss.4.d:0 "After many painstaking months of work by our forces, Seaquestria has finally recovered from its brief period of chaos and the seaponies have returned to their normal friendly state. The initial weeks were the hardest, as at first those affected were incredibly difficult to subdue, constantly struggling and fighting if a single other seapony was nearby. Only isolated did they become docile. This tactic, although slow was used throughout all of Seaquestria, ensuring peace bit by bit. Fortunately, whatever seemed to be possessing them weakened the further we progressed.\n\nThe hidden societies did cause some trouble initially as well, attempting to stop our forces from interferring in the violence. They too were subdued, and after order was completely restored they seem to have regained their senses as well. All of them have disbanded, though just as before when questioned they stated that they had no memory of the meetings or of what was discussed.\n\nWhat caused this terrible incident we may never know, but at least it is over. The Mareiana Trench has also been put on an indefinite ban of travel for the time being."
 hippogriff_abyss.4.a:0 "At least we got that finally sorted."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.5.t:0 "A Plea From Hippogriffia"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.d:0 "Trouble seems to be stirring in Zebrica, for a recent message has arrived from our old friends in Hippogriffia. Seeming to be in a rush, the hippogriff hurriedly explained that Seaquestria has fallen into chaos, and that the aid of the Elements of Harmony were needed. Believing that dark magic was behind it, they hope that as friends the Element Bearers will agree to travel back to Mount Aris temporarily and restore order to the aquatic realm.\n\nThere is no doubt that if asked, Princess Twilight and her friends will agree to help the hippogriffs once more. The question is whether we can afford to send them at the moment. The world is only growing more turbulent, and it is quite possible that we need the Elements here and now. However, denying expected help would sour relations with our old friends, and could result in further chaos in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff_abyss.5.a:0 "Of course we will help, assemble the Elements!"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.b:0 "Sorry, but we need them here and now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.6.t:0 "A Quick Wrap-up"
 hippogriff_abyss.6.d:0 ""So the freed cultists have no memory of what started it? No information? Nothing?"\n"I'm afraid so, Queen Novo," replied Twilight Sparkle, "Only fragments of dreams. Once we used the Elements to stop the music, there was nothing left of whatever strange instruments the cultists were playing, and none of them even remembered what they were doing in the last month, or how they got there. I wish we had more to go off of, but we just don't have enough data."\n"It's a terrible shame we couldn't stay here longer," commented Rarity, "I do so love my seapony form, and by the sound of it Skystar and Pinkie have just gotten started on their reunion party."\n"You can feel free to stay a little longer. I'm just glad it's over without too many of us getting hurt. I'm honestly not sure what we would have done without you."\n"Oh it's nothing, really! You're our friends, and besides it was your idea to use a deafening spell before sending us in. Without that, we'd have been helpless against it."\n\nNovo sighed. "I do hate not knowing what almost destroyed my kingdom. But oh well, all's well that ends well. I'll have my magical researchers look over all the data we can find, and share it with you if anything comes up. In the meantime, let's join Pinkie and Skystar out there. It looks like half of Seaquestria's getting in on their party, so let's not miss it.""
 hippogriff_abyss.6.a:0 "We may not know what caused it, but at least it's behind us now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.7.t:0 "The Equestrian Betrayal"
 hippogriff_abyss.7.d:0 "Terrible news! The Equestrians have, against our every hope and wish, decided not to send the Elements to aid us in our troubles in Seaquestria! We have not been made aware of the reasoning, but it seems highly unlikely that Princess Twilight herself decided not to aid us. More likely the Equestrian government simply ignored our calls for help for their own gain. This is a severe betrayal that we will not be forgetting anytime soon, but for now we have much more pressing matters to deal with.\n\nWith the Elements no longer an option, we are forced back to our original two ideas; either enforcing law and order in Seaquestria or doing nothing. The time spent wasted waiting on the Equestrian response has only worsened the situation, and no matter what we choose there will be repercussions across the nation. Word has already spread about the Equestrian debacle, and there are some calling us fools for ever relying on a foreign power."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.a:0 "Fine, we don't need their help to solve our problems."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.b:0 "Without the Elements we can do nothing..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.8.t:0 "Peaceful Spread In [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.8.d:0 "The spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was an absolute success, with members now spread all throughout the region. Conflict with non-members was at a minimum, and any confrontation with officials out of fear of our motives was quickly defused without escalation. The entire state is now securely under our influence, and our numbers have been bolstered by the new converts from the population."
 hippogriff_abyss.8.a:0 "The push towards control of Hippogriffia continues."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.9.t:0 "Minor Confrontation In [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.9.d:0 "Despite some minor conflicts and violence, the spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was a success. While non-members did start minor fights with our own agents, they were relatively localized and contained. Some may still be afraid of our intentions and future actions, but for now the state is secure and our numbers grown."
 hippogriff_abyss.9.a:0 "Small roadbumps on the path towards victory."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.10.t:0 "Violent Outbreak In [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.10.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent efforts to spread the cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] have been met with multiple outbreaks of fighting and violence. While our members were able to hold off the angry and terrified hippogriffs who had not yet joined us, the situation deteriorated to the point where the police had to intervene. The entire state is now on high alert, and though we have still expanded our numbers and have undercover control of the region, word has spread as the country drifts further towards instability and perhaps even open war against us."
 hippogriff_abyss.10.a:0 "Quite unfortunate, but our goal must stop for none."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.11.t:0 "Song Of The Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.11.d:0 "The capital had been taken hours ago. Fighting had been fierce and bloody, for while the cultists vastly outnumbered those still remaining, they did not have the weaponry or the skill that the royal guard of the palace did. But still, eventually numbers won out as our masses pushed forward endlessly, taking Mount Aris hall by hall, room by room. Each of our loyalists fought to their last breath, for our cause was great, greater than any other on Hippogriffia.\n\nThe throne room itself was the last holdout of resistance, but even that was overrun when the masses made a concentrated push at once. Queen Novo was captured relatively unharmed and is currently behind held captive, but unfortunately Princess Skystar is nowhere to be found. We believe she escaped long before our assault began, though where we are unsure of yet.\n\nBut that does not matter now. Nothing does, except what is to come. We have waited, waited for far too long for this moment. The doors open, and our masters float towards the throne we killed and died for, their tails and fins swishing in the open air. We all bow our heads to the floor. The teal one looks excited and giddy, while the pink one simply looks annoyed at the former. The yellow one just smirks, and by compulsion we rise once more, staring blankly as their three red gems inlaid in their chests glow.\n\nOur task is complete. Now, it is time for the whole world to hear their song as well."
 hippogriff_abyss.11.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.12.t:0 "The Hippogriff Civil War"
 hippogriff_abyss.12.d:0 "With tensions continuously rising between cultist and loyalist, it was only a matter of time until it blew into the open. Unfortunately, that moment of time is now, as the government has declared us a danger to the Kingdom and started mass arrests. Now, we have no choice but to fight back, and with force. As the army is sent in, we have armed ourselves to prepare for the civil war.\n\nThe areas that we have already secured have already formed into makeshift divisions, but sources say that those loyal to Queen Novo have done the same. We can only hope now that our efforts beforehoof were enough to prevail now."
 hippogriff_abyss.12.a:0 "So it has come to this."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.13.t:0 "Song Of The Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.13.d:0 "What a waste. So many lives needlessly lost in a pointless war. So many voices made silent. This little conflict was nothing more than an annoyance, and yet it was necessary all the same. These mortals sought to undo our plan, one over a thousand years in the making, and had to be eliminated.\n\nOur servants did well, despite their foolish blunder in igniting open war. They were a useful tool, though still only a means to an end. Once the remaining hippogriffs surrendered, there was no more need of such zealotry, and so we dispelled our magic leaving them docile, yet no longer single-minded. They will fall in line with the rest of the mortals, serving a new purpose. Our purpose.\n\nWe have waited far too long for this. What has happened now is only a glimpse of what is to come, of what is our right. This world has become far too complacent, dividing themselves on trivial things such as ideologies or politics. We will offer them a new solution, a new chance to be part of something greater, serving us. Soon they'll find they don't have a choice.\n\nOur time is now, and their time is running out. Listen closely to our music...\n\n...For the show is about to start."
 hippogriff_abyss.13.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.14.t:0 "The New World"
 hippogriff_abyss.14.d:0 "Change. It was quite obvious to Aria that the world was full of it. Even keeping in mind the fact that she was on an entire new continent now, barely anything was recognizable. What was once mere villages were now massive cities, what once took weeks to create now took hours, and magic... Adagio would never admit it, but Aria could see the writing on the wall. Their magic was no longer undefeatable, and it wasn't just that old fool Starswirl that proved that over a millennia ago. The weapons that creatures now possessed were dangerous, and they needed to be treated carefully.\n\n"There you are, Aria." The purple siren secretly rolled her eyes as the "leader" of the trio swam over. "Where have you been? Don't tell me you've been in Seaquestria with Sonata."\n\n"Of course not, Adagio. I'm getting this place ready for war."\n\nAdagio looked like she had seen Aria sprout a second head. "Excuse me? What are you talking about?"\n\nTurning, the purple siren kept her level, downright-bored disposition as she spoke. "We need an army, Adagio. We can't just go around and sing to the entire world. We're just going to get banished again, or worse. This world has new rules, new weapons, and we need them if we're going to go after our 'birthright' or whatever."\n\nAdagio sputtered for a bit before recovering. "Fine, just be ready to play your part when the time comes. I need to go find Sonata again and make sure she isn't blowing something up.""
 hippogriff_abyss.14.a:0 "It's time for us to adapt to the present."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.15.t:0 "Destiny"
 hippogriff_abyss.15.d:0 "It was a disgrace. Truly, there was no better word to describe it. Over a thousand years, and the world had already all but forgotten about them. About her. They thought themselves more advanced just from their new toys, but Adagio could see through it all. Magic still ruled, magic always ruled, and she was the one who was supposed to rule with it. The song she sang was meant to be listened by all, for her to be adored, for crowds to cheer for her as they listened to her every command. She was meant to rule.\n\nBut that was not what had happened. Her destiny, her birthright had been taken by fools, ponies who thought themselves above the natural order. Her banishment was a travesty, locked away to be passed into legend as creatures far weaker thought they could control destiny. Destiny does not change though, it is only delayed. They could not take away her voice, the gift all three of them possessed.\n\nOf course, Aria was right about one thing. None of them were ready to simply take their place at the center stage of the world. There was still more subjects to enthrall to, more power to gain, more songs to sing. Soon, however, she would make her triumphant return to Equestria. Her plans would come to fruition, and all would see her and rejoice. All it would take was a little patience.\n\nAnd Adagio was very patient."
 hippogriff_abyss.15.a:0 "Our time will come... soon."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.16.t:0 "Another Partner?"
 hippogriff_abyss.16.d:0 ""We need another member in our group."\n\nBoth Aria and Sonata looked up in surprise. "A fourth? We both know that there aren't any others left, Adagio. What do you mean, 'another member'?" Aria asked, a bit of curiosity seeping into her normally flat tone.\n\nAdagio just rolled her eyes. "I wasn't talking about another siren. Doing everything ourselves is just wasting our time, and our voices. We need someone to do the dirty work for us, manage affairs while we look at the bigger picture."\n\nSonata perked up a bit before her expression quickly deflated. "But like, everyone here hates us! Who would even want to help without being under our spell?"\n\n"Sonata has a point," Aria agreed. "For once."\n\n"Yeah- hey!"\n\nAs the two devolved into yet another argument, Adagio looked out the window from the palace. The city of Mount Aris spread before her, the clueless hippogriffs walking and arguing in the streets. And further away, the factories continued to work, along with the housing where the wealthy elite still lived...\n\nAdagio smirked. Perhaps the world wasn't so different as it once was after all."
 hippogriff_abyss.16.a:0 ""I have an idea in mind...""
 
 hippogriff_abyss.17.t:0 "The Collaborator"
 hippogriff_abyss.17.d:0 "Plumage Moonfeather had faced many things in his life. Rival businessgriffs, workers, profit margins, and even the former Hippogriffian government. He knew how to play the game and how to play it well, and that was how he had thrived and become one of the richest birds on Aris.\n\nAnd yet, nothing could have possibly prepared him for the situation he now found himself in.\n\n"You want me to do what now?" he asked, the slightly tinge of fear creeping in as the three sirens stared him down. He fought the urge to take a step back; showing weakness was never a good thing.\n\n"It's quite simple," the siren in yellow said. "We want a hippogriff who can run parts of this island in our stead while we focus on other things. And we believe that you can be that hippogriff."\n\nThe gears in Moonfeather's mind began turning. And then he realized it. This wasn't a meeting for threats or violence, or even being forced into compliance. This was something much better.\n\nIt was a business opportunity.\n\n"And I get to have full control over Aris just for working for you?" he asked, putting on the suave business look he was known for.\n\n"You'll be able to do whatever you want, so long as it also benefits us and keeps this place stable. Grease the gears, so to speak. But let me make something clear." Within seconds the siren was muzzle-to-beak against Moonfeather, staring daggers. "You listen to us. You follow our orders whenever we say them. And if you fail, we will not hesitate to throw you out and let the crowds deal with you instead. Is that clear?"\n\nMoonfeather quickly nodded. "Clear as crystal.""
 hippogriff_abyss.17.a:0 "He will be a useful pawn."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.18.t:0 "Old Enemies"
 hippogriff_abyss.18.d:0 "Adagio was still visibly seething in anger when Aria and Sonata rushed into the throne room, having been urgently called there. "What is it, Adagio?" Sonata asked, beating her fellow siren to the punch.\n\n"They're still alive," Adagio replied bitterly.\n\nSonata blinked. "Who?"\n\n"Starswirl and those 'Pillars of Equestria'."\n\nAria's expression immediately shifted from standard boredom into rage similar to that of Adagio, while Sonata just gave a shriek and tried hiding under a nearby table. "They aren't here, are they?" she asked. "I don't want to be banished again, not so soon after we got out!"\n\nSonata's antics were enough to shake Aria out of her anger, making the purple siren roll her eyes. "Of course they aren't here, Sonata. We'd have noticed them by now if they were." She turned her attention back to Adagio. "But we can't just let them get away with what they did either."\n\nAdagio, in a rare moment of agreement, nodded. "No, we can't. I don't know how they're still alive after all this time, but they have to pay for our banishment. I've tracked one of the Pillars to Maregypt; the others seem to be in Equestria, though I have not found Starswirl yet. But I don't care what it takes. We will have our revenge, and nothing is going to stop us."\n\n"We'll do it together," Aria said.\n\n"Together!" Sonata reaffirmed, sliding out from under the table with a semi-serious expression, a very rare sight for the normally bubbly siren. The trio looked at each other once before nodding."
 hippogriff_abyss.18.a:0 "This time, it's personal."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.19.t:0 "The Panopticon"
 hippogriff_abyss.19.d:0 "It was brilliant, but certainly not in its simplicity. Aria was still not completely used to this new age of planning, of diagrams and schematics. In old Equestria it was just vaguely drawing what you wanted, what it did and a general image. But the intent and the ways of showing it were the same, and Aria understood enough to see what it could mean.\n\nIt was both a building and a system, originally intended before their takeover for prisons in Hippogriffia. A single tower was built in the middle, with vision over all the cells of prisoners and yet unable to be seen within by said prisoners. The guards inside obviously could not watch them all at once, but it was the fear of being watched at any time that motivated others to act as if they were. To create a blanket of fear, and an illusion of total control.\n\nBut who said that it could only be used for prisons? Other creatures were inherently untrustworthy, they had already banished and resisted against them once. They needed to be monitored, and what better way to keep them in line than to have all of them believe they always are? Fear is a powerful motivator; Aria herself and the other sirens had used it many times to stir up violence and chaos.\n\nUnfortunately, putting such structures across the nation would not be cheap. Adagio or Sonata would certainly notice, and she already knew that neither would be too happy about it, even if it would be for vastly different reasons. Aria even found herself questioning the effectiveness or necessity of this. Wouldn't it be easier to just let the idea fall, and get the upper edge in future arguments with her partners? Or she could always force the idea through anyways, and that might provide its own benefits for the future..."
 hippogriff_abyss.19.a:0 "Let's just shelf the idea and focus on more important things."
 hippogriff_abyss.19.b:0 "What are we waiting for, get these things built!"
 
 hippogriff_abyss.20.t:0 "The Dawning"
 hippogriff_abyss.20.d:0 "When it came to speeches and ceremonies, none of the three sirens had much experience in leading such events. Singing and concerts, yes, they were unmatched in all the world, but they were no politicians or military leaders. Such trivial things were for those who did not have the magic of a siren's music.\n\nIn this particular case, though, Adagio had insisted on some sort of grand event for the culmination of all the hard work the three had put in over the past month. So, deep in the royal palace, in a circular room decorated specifically for the occasion, the three floated among those chosen to receive the gift.\n\nThere was less than both Aria and Adagio would have preferred. The hippogriffs who stood in line before them, blankly enthralled only numbered in the lower tens, easily countable by a child. But they were the best that this island had to offer. Former leaders, organizers, people with power; they would serve their new role well, and if the need arose then more could always be made.\n\nOne last hippogriff entered the room at Adagio's silent command. In a claw, he held simple necklaces, one for each of the creatures in line. Hanging at the bottom was a blood-red gem, identical in color to the ones inlaid within the sirens themselves. These, however were nowhere near the size, only appearing as mere slivers of crystal.\n\nIt had taken the three considerable effort to create such artifacts. The magical crystals mined beneath Mount Aris had the potential, but the methods used to turn them into siren gems were... tiring. Still, they were not deterred, even Sonata, who had actually shown some surprising talent in the process despite failing with explosive results the first seven times.\n\n"You have all been chosen, gifted with a fragment of our power to bind lesser creatures under our spell. Do not waste it, for the amulet you now wear is your life now. Go, sing, as is your new purpose. Let yourself be a reflection of the new glory and world that we shall bring."\n\nThey all bowed, before walking out to fulfil their duty."

 hippogriff_abyss.21.t:0 "The Theory Of Music"
 hippogriff_abyss.21.d:0 ""Sonata, what is this?" Adagio all but stormed into the palace room, Aria not far behind and looking like she would rather be anywhere but there. "Plumage has told me that you've been going out to listen to others play and sing music! Did you forget who and what you are?!"\n\nSonata rolled her eyes. "I still know I'm the best, duh. But it's nice listening to other people make music too! I mean, they'll never be as great as us, but some of it is still good!"\n\nAria facehoofed while Adagio looked like Sonata had grown a second tail. "Are you serious? Those creatures aren't even worth our time, Sonata! They should be listening to us, not the other way around!"\n\nSonata folded her hooves. "Well I think that it's nice, and that you should listen to it more! Maybe if we actually let them make music more they would make something better! But all you let them do is stay in their homes and groups fighting!"\n\n"No. The only music we are having is ours, and you are not going on your little trips anymore!"\n\n"Oh yeah? And how are you gonna stop me?"\n\nAria only took a deep breath and sighed before leaving the room to let the two argue. She wasn't dealing with this today."

 hippogriff_abyss.22.d:0 ""Finally! Do you have any idea how long I've been stuck in here-" The zebra started when he heard the door open, but froze upon seeing Sonata. He fell out of his chair backwards, crawling away from her in a panic. "Who... what are you!?"\n\nSonata looked around confused for a second before realizing who he was talking about. "Oh, you mean me! I'm Sonata, a siren who was banished, like, a really long time ago." She looked down at the floor, lightly swinging her tail around a bit. "No-fun Pillars..."\n\n"A siren?" King Zamni asked. He slowly got back up onto his hooves, never taking his eyes off the blue creature. "What... are you going to do to me?"\n\nShe thought for a moment. "Oh, right! I was told to get you to help us manage this place or something. The guards said the King of Zumidia was here." Sonata approached the zebra, examining him more closely. "You are the King, right?"\n\n"Yeah... why do you ask?"\n\nSonata pointed a hoof at her own head. "Well, there's usually a crown, right? And I kinda expected you to look more... royal? Oh, I know!" She floated around him, swimming through the air in a circle. "Maybe we could get you a crown! I mean, it'll make it easier for me to recognize you, right?"\n\nThe zebra waited for Sonata to stop before taking a hesitant step forward. "Yeah, that'd be nice," he said, still a bit cautious. "My name is Zamni, by the way."\n\nThe young King extended his hoof, and Sonata met it for a hoofshake.\n"It's nice to meet you, Sonata.""

And yet, despite her flaws, she did have a good idea once in a blue moon or two.\n\nThis was finally one of those moments.\n\n"I'm... actually impressed, Sonata. The more creatures still alive, the more that can feed our magic and adore us. I suppose that doing our best to keep them that way shouldn't take too much effort."\n\nAria did not share Adagio's sentiment, responding with her usual flat tone. "But this seems to go a little too far, Adagio. Look at everything Sonata wants to do. All these resources, this focus on medicine... we'd be losing more magic if we actually did all this."\n\n"You're just no fun!" Sonata shot back, folding her hooves.\n\n"I'm not saying it's a bad idea," Aria replied in a surprisingly defensive manner. "We just need to cut the big parts of this and leave the essentials."\n\n"But the big parts are the best parts! It's no fun when people die, because then they get all boring and lay there and do nothing. We want people to do stuff, right?"\n\n"Sonata's right," Adagio agreed, finding herself surprised at saying such a thing. "They're better to us alive than dead. Still, a lot of this does seem over the top..." Both Aria and Sonata looked at the third siren, waiting for a decision."

The panopticons had been built and manned, structures of solid concrete that loomed menacing above those they watched. The quality put into their construction had been impressive.\n\nBut there was nothing to show for it. Nothing had changed, not even in the slightest. There was no need for fear to keep them in line when they were already held through magic. Everything was continuing as it had before.\n\n"It's not about what it does now," Aria said, though she wasn't sure if she was addressing Adagio or herself. "If our magic ever fails, we'll need them to keep contro-"\n\n"Oh, it's 'if' this and 'maybe' that. We are living in the now, Aria. Stop looking at useless and impossible futures when you need to be looking at what we need in the present. Maybe next time you'll think ideas like this through." Adagio swam away through the air, leaving the other siren alone.\n\nThis couldn't have possibly be in vain. There must be some use that these things would have... eventually.

 hippogriff_abyss.25.d:0 ""Who's there? Oh, hey Sonata." King Zamni put down the beaker he was holding and got up off of his chair to greet the siren, who was floating around near the doorway. "How are you doing?"\n\n"Well Adagio and Aria are being no fun again so I left to come see you!" She looked over the zebra at the table he had set up, piled with various ingredients and what looked like a chemistry set. "What are you up to?"\n\nZamni looked back at his workstation. "Oh, that. Well, I had to find something to do when you aren't here to talk and I don't have to do anything else, since I can't leave the palace. Alchemy has always been a zebra's natural talent, so I thought I might give it a shot. It's not the most traditional setup, but I guess I'm not the most traditional king either, huh?"\n\nSonata frowned. "Zamni, you know we can't let you leave because-"\n\n"Because it's too dangerous outside and I could get hurt or killed, I know." He sighed, looking out towards the window. "Still, it's hard being stuck here for years..." The zebra trailed off until a thought seemed to strike him. "Oh, right! I'm glad your here, since I wanted to show you something." Zamni trotted over and started rummaging through one of his cabinets, pulling out multiple labeled bottles with colored liquids inside them. "So you said you get magic through those gems you have, right?"\n\nThe siren looked down at her own blood-red gem inlaid in her chest. "Yeah... what about them?"\n\n"Well, I was looking at some old zebra texts and recipes, and I think I could make something that would help those gems store more magical energy in them! It's still untested, though, and I don't think it's smart to just try it on yours first... do you have any of them I could borrow?"\n\n"Well, I could always make one, but it's like, really hard. And I don't know if Adagio and Aria would like me doing that..."\n\n"Come on, Sonata." Zamni stared up at her, a hint of determination in his eyes. "I've never let you down before, right? Just give me some time, and I know I can do this.""

Have you been getting enough sleep?"\n\n"No," he answered flatly, "I haven't. But I did do it."\n\n"Do what?"\n\nZamni motioned for Sonata to follow him as he walked to another desk, sweeping aside the shards of shattered red gems. Eventually he found what he was looking for, a familiar intact gem glowing brightly. "It took me a while, but I finally got it."\n\nSonata looked at it closely, moving her head to view it at all angles. "Really?" she asked curiously. "It looks the same to me."\n\nThe zebra resisted the urge to slam his head into the desk. "Yes, but I've triple-checked everything. It can hold a lot more magic, and it's not going to explode if you drop it. The ingredients for the alchemy is pretty simple too, you could mass produce it if you needed to."\n\n"Ooooh, for realsies?" She grabbed the amulet with a hoof. "Adagio is gonna love this!" She sped off, barely remembering to give a wave to Zamni before disappearing out of the room.\n\nThe king nodded before turning back to his desk, resting his head on his hooves, and immediately falling asleep."

"I guess you aren't always the worst after all."\n\n"Oh yeah?" Sonata quickly shot back. "Well I think you're worser than the worst, Aria."\n\nThe two glared at each other for a moment before the third intervened once again. "I have to ask though, Sonata, how did you get him to do it? Enthrallment doesn't really keep our subjects innovative, after all..."\n\nShe thought for a moment. "Huh," Sonata said, "I guess I never actually sang to him. He just kinda started helping me on his own!"\n\nBoth Adagio and Aria's jaws dropped, too stunned to respond. The former recovered first, giving Sonata a new appraising look. "Well well, I guess I underestimated you, Sonata! Manipulating others to help us without even using magic. Maybe you are more like a siren than I thought."\n\nShe continued speaking, but Sonata zoned out thinking about those words. She manipulated Zamni? But all she did was act like herself! And he had helped her for some reason... but why? Didn't they need to sing to people for them to not hate them?\n\nSomething was weird, and Sonata couldn't put her hoof on it."

It wasn't that she couldn't see them coming ahead of time, but that there was always some big issue that needed immediate addressing or some great crisis looming that they needed to shut down immediately.\n\nIn this case, however, Aria was fully determined to fix this before it even started.\n\n"What are you talking about, Aria? 'Mending ties between races'? The fighting between hippogriffs and seaponies has been one of our best sources of magic! In fact, I was thinking of making all the new pathetic mortals we have fight each other the same way as well..."\n\n"No, Adagio. It worked well when we had only those two races, but now if the races are too busy fighting each other, they'll never get anything done for us. We do need them to do things other than fight now, remember?"\n\nSonata moved forwards as well, surprising Aria by not looking indignantly at her, but at Adagio. "Yeah, it's so boring when all they do is fight each other based on who's what! Everyone already fights each other enough already! And it makes them listening to me so much harder..."\n\n"But think of the magic," Adagio said through gritted teeth.\n\n"We are thinking of the magic," Aria shot, "but this isn't worth it, at least right now.

We have done extensive research into the fields you requested us to, in particular that of magical crystals and the process of turning negative emotional energy into magical energy."\n\n"And?"\n\n"And we believe we've found a connection between the two," another Scientifid continued, smoothly taking the lead. "While your process of turning them into siren gems is still something we are struggling to fully understand, we have observed key similarities and differences between the crystal lattices. Every crystal has its minor imperfections, and those seem to disrupt the structure once turned into siren gems and make the entire structure less efficient."\n\n"Go on."\n\nThe third zebra, this one wearing glasses stepped forward. "However, recent technology allows us to modify the lattice and rearrange the structure in crystals. With time, and additional funding, we believe-"\n\n"You believe that you can fix the imperfections in the crystals and make the structure more efficient at storing magic," Aria finished. The zebras nodded, unfazed by the interruption. "It's already hard enough keeping you all from Adagio with how much I've been giving you. Anything more, and I'd have to explain to her why I'm wasting my time on all of you."\n\n"We understand that we are asking for a lot.

 hippogriff_abyss.30.t:0 "Experiment Report: Crystal Lattice Purification"
 hippogriff_abyss.30.d:0 "Abstract:\nPrevious research into the fields of both magical crystals and modified Siren Magical Crystals (SMCs) has revealed that the two share key similarities and differences in lattice structure, being readily apparent after the magical process of turning a crystal into an SMC. However, impurities and defects in crystal structure have been shown to decrease the effectiveness and efficiency of magical storage in both crystal types. This experiment was designed to find ways to both locate and remove those impurities.\nProcedure:\nPre-created SMCs were viewed under an electron microscope to locate deformities, with multiple methods on standby to attempt to correct them. A full list is included in the Appendix.\nAnalysis:A majority of attempts to modify an SMC proved to be ineffective, either having no affect on crystal structure or shattering the lattice entirely. Success was best found in using both small amounts of magical current from another SMC to initiate crystal growth while an applied electrical field created mechanical strain using piezoelectricity. Such methods resulted in the crystal filling in defects and self-stabilizing the lattice.\n\nConclusions:\nThe experiment was a success in partially purifying SMCs and rearranging crystalline structure. Tests run after modification showed a substantial increase in magic storage levels before shattering. While we lack the current methods to remove all impurities from crystal structure, such as dislocations, current progress has been satisfactory for the scientific team. This has also done much to further the study of magical crystal and SMC structure, with a leading theory being that overstorage of magic causes crystals to fracture at various defect fault lines, and that a theoretical 'flawless' crystal would be able to hold near-infinite amounts of magical energy. The high amount of magic that the sirens themselves can contain is attributed to a low number of defects in embedded crystal structure, though this has yet to be verified."

 hippogriff_abyss.31.d:0 "The zebras marched in lockstep down the central road of Colthage, the peasants and homeowners looking fearfully on the sides of the procession. Each soldier wore a decorated outfit that vastly resembled the old Rural Guard, which was intentional. For all intents and purposes, they were the Rural Guard, just recreated for the modern era.\n\nThe procession itself, of course, was all for show. There was no practical purpose other than to instill discipline within the soldiers, the new servants of the sirens. But it did represent something, and that was the restoration of order in Colthage. They enforced the rules of whatever was told of them, and no longer was Colthage a region out of control for the sirens.\n\n"So... why are we here again?" Sonata asked Aria as the two watched the march continue from a nearby balcony. "If you wanted to show off, why didn't you invite Adagio?"\n\n"Because I'm not showing off, and this isn't for Adagio." She pointed a hoof at the soldiers. "I've done what I wanted here. Now it's your turn. These zebras will make sure that you don't accidentally blow something up while you're here."\n\n"Oh. Right."\n\n"I have other things to deal with, and even though I can't believe I'm saying this, I trust you more than Adagio to not ruin everything." Aria turned, pointing a hoof and pushing Sonata's chest. "Don't mess it up, got it?"\n\nSonata pushed her back. "Don't worry, I don't even know how to mess it up!"\n\n"That doesn't encourage me..."

"Just go ahead and tell me your plan so I can do whatever, Aria."\n\n"Colthage was a heavily factionalized place, but the two groups we care about are the Scientifids and the Landowners. Both of them are smart enough to be willing to work with us and have their uses. Focus on them, and make sure that we control everything in Colthage through them. Order should be above everything else."\n\nSonata nodded at the long and complicated explanation like she understood every word of it, while Adagio just made a faint noise of disappointment. "We aren't here to bring order, we're here to cause chaos and anger. We shouldn't limit ourselves to just these few groups of zebras and rules. If working with the 'Landowners' helps us, then we should do that. And if working with warlords and letting things burn helps us more..." Adagio ignored the seething glance from Aria. "...than we shouldn't leave that option out either."\n\n"More options does seem like a good idea..."\n\n"Unless you make the wrong one," Aria finished for Sonata.

We do not care about irrelevant things such as ethics or what is "right" and "wrong", all we care about is what causes people to fight. And here, land is a very good topic at causing that.\n\nFor the vision that we, or rather that Aris has for Colthage, however, there is really only one option. The Landowners make up one group of elites we want on our side, and getting them to work with us is essential prolonged stability. This time there will be no worries of peasants rising against their masters, or of disobedience and slacking. For those that work with us, they will find their labor force compliant.

The Landowners have a history of being mostly compliant if left to their own devices and remaining unambitious. Perfect pawns. On the other hoof, the Scientifids could efficiently reorient Colthage towards becoming a productive part of our territories, given permission and the authority to.

Hippone, Coltva, Trotkat; they will be regarded as little more than geographical and administrative regions of Colthage itself. One state will exist, even if it is in name only.

The other more dangerous approach is looking elsewhere, particularly in the unsavory parts of Colthaginian society. Two military commanders, Jebzel Zoblos and Bezelshazzar Zerutra, have been deemed as pliable enough to be bribed into submission.

With a few exceptions, like the ability our voices give us, the technology of the time made it simply impossible to rule effectively across large areas. Over time, that changed, and now many states rely on such methods of strict control from their centers of governance. Colthage had similar debates along that line, with some wanting to remain decentralized and others wanting power vested in the capital city of Colthage. Now it is our turn to answer that question.\n\nConsidering that those we put as the ruling class get their power from Colthage, strengthening that hold in the city is the only logical move. If all we have to do is control one city, and that city can control the rest of the region for us, then that makes our job that much easier. We can't just have zebras running around doing whatever they wish, even if they still are under our influence and song.

With a few exceptions, like the ability our voices give us, the technology of the time made it simply impossible to rule effectively across large areas. Over time, that changed, and now many states rely on such methods of strict control from their centers of governance. Colthage had similar debates along that line, with some wanting to remain decentralized and others wanting power vested in the capital city of Colthage. Now it is our turn to answer that question.\n\nCentralizing things in Colthage would, all things considered, be difficult. It would require uprooting and relocating much of the regional authority, not to mention the zebras that run them. By the time we're finished with the entire process, it may not even been worth the effort. Now doing the opposite, decentralizing to the regions and zebras themselves, would still be difficult, but not as hard in the long term as the former. Not only that, it would also allow for the more opportunistic of Colthaginian society to cause chaos, which if we've supported could reap major benefits for our magic. Still, the choice remains ours."

 hippogriff_abyss.38.d:0 ""Alright Aria, what's so important that you had to call Sonata and I here to discuss?"\n\nAria motioned to a nearby enthralled unicorn with a hoof, causing him to walk over and let a manila folder fall on the table from his magic before leaving. "In here is every single project the Legionary Medical Research Department in Chiropterra either worked on or had planned. I've already read it, but you two should too so we can decide what-"\n\n"We already have," both other sirens said simultaneously, before looking at each other. Sonata motioned for Adagio to speak first. "I know full well about the LMRD. After all, some of their ideas were quite interesting."\n\n"I just read it because I was bored!" Sonata added.\n\nAria shrugged. "Fair enough." She opened the folder with a hoof, spreading out the sheets of paper across the table. "I think we can all agree then that the chemical warfare experiments are the best option to pursue, we just need to figure out what exactly-"\n\n"Chemical warfare did not help the Chiropterrans defeat us," Adagio interrupted flippantly. "This blind, fanatic loyalty on the other hoof seems just perfect. Our servants already serve us with complete obedience; imagine what they could do if they were willing to kill themselves in our name. Nothing would stop them, or us!"\n\nSonata blinked, looking at the two of them strangely. "Uh, if these guys are the medical research department, doesn't that mean they make like hospitals and stuff? Why don't we have them work on that instead?" Adagio and Aria gave her a weird look, as if she was insane.\n\n"What? Am I wrong?""

 hippogriff_abyss.39.d:0 ""Spit it out, I don't have all day," Adagio said as the three sirens gathered around, all clearly annoyed at being summoned. It was a rare thing for Plumage to do, and he took the opportunity to speak as soon as he got it. The faster this was over, the better.\n\n"My associates and I have discovered a wonderful opportunity in Zarantia, after months of searching at your request. It appears that there are truly massive reserves of oil hidden beneath the desert, undiscovered until now. As I am of course a mere servant of you three, I thought it best to leave the matter of how to approach this situation to you." The fact that he alone had no chance of subduing the desert tribes enough to extract the oil himself went unspoken.\n\nAs usual, Aria was the first to get her piece in. "Isn't it obvious? We move in and take the oil wells by force. We'll need that oil if we're going to do anything big in the future."\n\nThe other two began to nod in agreement, and Plumage saw his chance at personal profits slipping away. He needed something fast. "Of course," he said hurriedly, "but I can assure you that the oil is enough to fuel any military you could want and then some. And you know how difficult those Zarantians tribes could be... we could, if you wish, use some of the oil as incentive to bribe a few zebras and get them to fight each other instead. And you wouldn't need to worry about handling such trivial affairs; believe me, I am very experienced in these deals."\n\nAria's eyes narrowed while the other two sirens seemed to think it over. "I mean, it would help me in Zarantia too..." Sonata said, trailing off.\n\n"And it would give us magic to work with too," Adagio added.\n\nAt this point Aria was looking beside herself with annoyance. "Really? It's obvious that he just wants to take oil for himself. Just because we let him run things for us doesn't mean we can let him start doing everything we should be doing ourselves."\n\n"My loyalties remain only to you three alone," Plumage reminded, internally sweating bullets. It seemed uncertain which way things would go, and the sirens had the final word..."

 hippogriff_abyss.40.t:0 "The First To Fall"
 hippogriff_abyss.40.d:0 "The dungeons of Mount Aris had seen little use in some time, at least ever since the sirens had taken over. When everyone was enthralled and some level of obedient, there was almost no need for such places. Only the most dangerous were left there, those deemed by the sirens personally to be too dangerous to be left about. It was why they were still heavily guarded, by only the most disciplined and fanatical of enthralled subjects.\n\nToday, the cells finally added one more to their number.\n\n"Well well well," Adagio said as the three sirens looked down upon Somnambula, the Maregyptian pegasus and Pillar of Equestria. All four of her hooves were chained to the floor, her wings bound tightly to her sides. They were taking no chances this time. "I bet you're surprised to see us again after what you did. Do you regret going against us now?"\n\n"No," Somnambula responded, the ancient Maregyptian accent ragged from days spent in her cell.\n\nAdagio's face contorted into anger. "Really? You took away our destiny, everyone's destiny, and look how the world has done! You solved nothing, ponies still die, creatures far worse than us still live and rule! Even now, when you know what being banished for over a thousand years feels like, you still refuse to understand!"\n\nThe pony shook her head. "We did what we had to for Equestria. You left us no choice."\n\n"You chose to fight us," Aria responded. "And this is the price you have to pay. Come on, Adagio." The two sirens gave one last look at Somnambula before both leaving the cell. Sonata moved as well to follow, but stopped when she heard a voice behind her.\n\n"Wait," Somnambula said. "You are not like them, are you? Your hatred does not burn as bright as theirs."\n\nThe siren frowned. "Yeah, Adagio says I need to work more on being mean. She's right though. You decided to banish us, and we were stuck down there for over a thousand years."\n\n"And it is a decision I wish I could take back every day now." Sonata blinked, and Somnambula looked at her, the pony's purple eyes shining brightly. "But please, if you stay, I promise I can explain everything to you.""
 hippogriff_abyss.40.a:0 ""You have nothing to say that I want to hear.""

 hippogriff_abyss.41.t:0 "Another Story"
 hippogriff_abyss.41.d:0 ""It is true that you left us no choice in having to fight you. But not all of us wanted to banish you too. Stygian and I wished to try and talk, to make you see the error of your ways, but we were convinced by Starswirl that it was the only way to save Equestria, that villains could not change. We let fear into our hearts, and it chose for us. I allowed the same thing to happen when Stygian turned to the darkness after we cast him out."\n\n"You mean when you got banished too?"\n\nSomnambula nodded. "When he did not come back for forgiveness, but instead for revenge, I believed that the darkness had taken too much of a hold, that he was beyond saving. Even when Twilight brought us back, I did not have hope for him."\n\n"But?" Sonata asked, getting genuinely curious now.\n\n"But Princess Twilight proved us wrong. She saved Stygian, and brought the friend we once had back to us. She gave me my hope back." Despite the chains holding them down, Somnambula managed to raise a hoof to point it at Sonata. "And now, I am placing it in you."\n\nSonata blinked twice, following the Maregyptian's hoof before pointing at herself. "Me?"\n\n"I believe that you can choose a better path. Your power may take choice away from others, but you still have the choice to do the right thing. You don't have to do what others tell you to do, or act how they believe you should. You can do what you want to do, be who you want to be, and I have hope that you will do what is best for everypony."\n\nSonata didn't say anything. All she did was stare at the pony in front of her, the pony she was supposed to hate with all her heart, the one she had feared for years now would send her back into the Abyss. But now, she didn't know what to feel. "I... need to go," she said, backing away.\n\nSonata did not sleep that night."

This was made even more obvious when our Constant, Plumage Moonfeather, was sent to personally discuss a peace treaty with the Wingbardians in Karthin. The meetings were long, according to him, with the Wingbardians too proud to give up their short-lived victory over the cats easily. Eventually, though, with a smooth tongue and the force of the sirens behind him, they eventually folded and signed the deal, ending official hostilities between us.\n\nIn it, we gain official ownership and occupation of all of former Abyssinia, removing Wingbardy from our future sphere of control. This is of course a temporary peace; our eyes are set on the world, after all, not just some part of a continent. For now, though, this will suffice; the land of Griffonia will be dealt with at some later date, and we have what we need to launch our invasion of Equestria."

 hippogriff_abyss.43.t:0 "A Siren Second"
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d1:0 "Adagio had always worked hard to keep her role as the undisputed leader of the siren three. Being fair it was easy, what with how incompetent the other two were and how simple it was to get them to fight each other instead, but still. Just dealing with either of them could be so annoying sometimes. Aria was always getting into her business, and Sonata constantly fumbled the most basic of tasks given to her...\n\nBut the time for scheming was over. Necessity had forced her to choose between the two, of who she would trust more than the other, and while the answer may have seemed simple to some Adagio knew it was anything but. Both were practical options in their own ways, even if their personalities weren't.\n\nAria was a natural choice. Her paranoia and sarcasm grated on Adagio in all the wrong ways, but she was still manipulative, intelligent and most importantly pragmatic. She gave results that couldn't be argued with, and got things done independently of instruction. A perfect Second to deal with the issues she couldn't care less about.\n\nOn the other hoof, Sonata for all her faults had benefits as well. Her methods were certainly... unique, and rarely did she ever follow instruction to Adagio's liking, but Sonata was able to solve problems that neither she or Aria could ever think of approaching. Easily persuaded herself, she would be a compliant, idiotic and possibly even useful secondo to her primo.\n\nBut in the end, only one could be her partner. The other would no doubt be annoyed at being put last in line, and she would have to be careful in making sure her choice didn't get the upper hoof over her. So the moment of truth had come; who would it be?"
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d2:0 "Getting her way to the top as the leader of the three sirens had been a tedious task, that much was certain. Sonata was an idiot, as usual, but Adagio was always a major hurdle in her goals for Sirenalia. She was smart, antagonistic, power-hungry even within their trio, and charismatic enough to occasionally convince Sonata to her way of thinking. Still, she was the one now on top, at least for the moment, and now as much as she didn't like to admit it she needed a partner to continue forward.\n\nThe choices spoke for themselves. Adagio was a natural choice for the exact reasons she had been so irritating before; her drive gave her determination to see things through even if her spiteful nature caused unnecessary complications in the process. Of course, giving someone who only desired more power exactly that was a slippery slope, especially when it came to Adagio, but that was just part of the game they played now.\n\nThe safer, but definitely more annoying option was to go with Sonata instead. The downside implied in it was having to actively deal with whatever she got up to more often, but at least Aria could highly doubt that she was up to anything actively malicious against her. Plus, Sonata did occasionally do something useful... about once every six moons. It was quite possible that she would be a better long-term approach as a Second, though Aria doubted it.\n\nSo, who would it be. The dangerous Adagio, or the incompetent Sonata? The spiteful manipulator, or the trusting ditz? It was up to her to decide."
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d3:0 "Out of all the possibilities, few could have expected this.\n\nSonata still wasn't quite sure why she was still leading the group they had going. At first, it was obvious even to her that it was just to get her to stop complaining. They never really expected anything out of her in the first place. But over time, both Aria and Adagio seemed to see it less as a burden and more like she was actually doing something useful. And Sonata was always willing to help her fellow sirens.\n\nBut things were changing now. Both Adagio and Aria were pushing her to choose one of them over the other. It was weird to Sonata, seeing them ask her for something and not the other way around. But she was the leader for now, so she got to make the choice like Adagio used to do, and this was one that she had to make all by herself.\n\nAdagio knew what she was doing, that was obvious. She had all the plans, she came up with everything they were supposed to do, and she just wanted what was best for all of them. Without her, Sonata wouldn't have the foggiest clue on what she was supposed to be or what she should be doing.\n\nNow Aria, she was mean. All she did was constantly tell Sonata how terrible she was, which she didn't like. But she also seemed a lot less... spiteful, Sonata thought the word was. Adagio knew things, but what she wanted always seemed a little off. Aria looked at the bigger picture, saw things coming before they even happened, and even looked the other way or helped Sonata out when they both had the rare agreement. There was no sense of underlaying wrongness with her like Adagio had.\n\nShe supposed that when it came down to it, her choice was about feelings. What did she feel was the right decision? Was there even a right or wrong answer? And which was which? Sonata didn't know, but she had to choose one way or the other."

Territories include Warzena, Zarantia, Tobuck and Chiropterra.\n\nWarzena: Former Kingdom of zebras of Zonician culture, shares many similarities with the already secured territory of Zumidia. Chances of success in integration through merging regions and administration are high. Method has met official recommendation.\n\nZarantia: Relatively backwater and unindustrialized group of zebra tribes. Militancy and resistance provides issues. Pacification will be required for further integration.\n\nTobuck: Majority of population in primary city, culture resembles Maregyptian. Possibility of criminal and subversive elements remaining is high, thorough effort to clean them out is highly recommended.\n\nChiropterra: Remnants of six legions which fled from Equestria over a thousand years ago after the original banishment of Nightmare Moon. Extremism and militancy is dangerously high, immediate action is advised. Fanatical devotion to religion noted as possible future issue. Laborers identified as possible method of subduing local populace.\n\nConclusion: Process of integration deemed relatively simple, as long as instructions are followed. Chiropterra may require further decisions undertaken by higher authority."

When the sirens first took over, he knew that it was going to be bad. After all, the stories were rampant of what happened inside their lands; the fights, the mindless obedience, the songs. He remembered being dragged out into the square, forced to listen to the music. He expected to be trapped in his own mind, or for his friends to turn on him one day. He expected rage.\n\nBut he got none of those things. His friends still met with him, as usual. He was still in full control of himself, and his mind was at ease. Everything had seemed good until the Zumidians had come in. They claimed that Warzena was now a rightful part of their kingdom, that their 'King Zamni' was now the rightful sovereign of their city. It was outrageous, ludicrous even. Who were they to march in and just take a title like they owned the place?\n\nThat was on Zala's mind almost all the time now, and he knew his friends felt the same way. Every week they would get back together and tell each other about how terrible the Zumidians were, how they were the worst thing to happen since the Storm King himself. They never made life easy; the hatred was mutual as shown by their harsh nature, their wide reprisals and distrusting glances at passers-by. Zala could not remember any times in his life worse than this.\n\nThere was something else nagging at the back of his head, but he paid it no attention. It was just another thing on the long list of hatred that had become his life."

Both options work, and I can't tell you which one is better."\n\n"But there's always a better answer! There's a right one and a wrong one! It's like Adagio told me - everything we decide to do is right, and everyone who disagrees is wrong!"\n\nAria sighed, rubbing her hoof against her forehead. "The world isn't as simple as that, Sonata. Releasing the laborers would help get the ponies on our side and more compliant, which would probably make Chiropterra easier to keep a hold of. Keeping them in line though would calm things down and probably make your job easier." She shrugged. "Either way, it's not my problem."\n\nNever before had Sonata been annoyed to not get Aria's input and opinion on something. So instead, she focused on what mattered; what would she do? All the advice she has asked for had presented her with two options, both of them equally viable.\n\n...Sonata didn't like hard decisions."

And they were disciplined, many rather dying than even getting the chance to listen to the song.\n\n"I don't know, Aria," Sonata said as they floated in the throne room of Mount Aris, having finished looking over reports from the mainland. "Doesn't that sound a bit extreme? I thought we were trying to make things easier, not harder."\n\n"And their devotion is what's making this harder," the purple siren explained impatiently. "Without their faith they'd fall apart. If we make an actual effort to get rid of it, everything will be easier for us."\n\n"But we've already almost beaten them!" Sonata countered. "They're close to giving up, I just know it! And Adagio wouldn't be happy if she finds out how much time and effort you want me to spend on this idea."\n\nAria gave an annoyed sigh and just gave what Sonata called 'that look'. "Well Adagio isn't here right now, is she? And besides, she'll be fine with it when she realizes they'll praise her instead of some regular pony by the time this is done."\n\n"I guess it's still your choice, though," she finished, moving to leave.

 hippogriff_abyss.48.d:0 "A single messenger has come from Zebrica, a hippogriff from the nation once known as Hippogriffia. While such a distant nation was out of our interests initially, the rise of the sirens and their claims of revenge on Equestria did concern some in our ranks who believed that a conflict of interest between us and them was possible. And while they still seem possible, the hippogriff who calls himself Plumage Moonfeather comes with an offer.\n\nThey too wish to see the ponies fall, and they are willing to aid us in destroying them, for a price. The exact terms seem to be intentionally vague, though there are a few terms already set as part of the agreement; no matter the outcome of the war, we will obtain the western parts of Equestria and the Crystal Empire, while they demand the Southeast region and custody of the 'Pillars of Equestria'. All other territories are to have ownership decided upon the end of the war through negotiations.\n\nWhile the ponies and land in question are not of any real value to us, the question remains of whether this alliance will benefit us in any real way. Creatures with such power as their song are inherently untrustworthy, and giving them a foothold on our continent, no matter how small, may be a mistake that we will have to pay for someday..."

They will give up the Pillars of Equestria, as you demanded, and give us the southeast region as compensation for our support."\n\n"What about the other parts?" Adagio asked.\n\nMoonfeather's jubilant expression faded a bit. "I did have to promise them the northwest, and the best I could negotiate was pushing off the official borders until after our conflict with Equestria is won. As long as we can occupy important parts of Equestria before they can, however, I guarantee you that I can get more out of them in the future."\n\n"Then we'll just have to take it from them first." Adagio turned to her other sirens, leaving the hippogriff now out of the conversation. "This 'alliance' is only temporary, of course; we just need a hoofhold on Equus now to betray them later. Still, we should try getting as much on our hooves as possible.

Now they expect the payment we agreed upon long ago; official recognition over control of the Southeast, the Pillars of Equestria, and continued negotiations for the rest of the land in Equestria.\n\nThe sirens would undoubtedly make for a powerful permanent ally, should they maintain our alliance for the future. And if we managed to take much of Equestria, we should have the upper hoof in the negotiations, barring of course the Southeast which we have little actual strategic motive for. But if the sirens managed to seize territory before us... we may just have our victory taken right from underneath us.

Sonata, on the other hoof, looked more confused. "Wait, but weren't we going to do that to them anyway?" she asked.\n\n"Yes Sonata, but they did it to us first," Adagio responded, barely keeping in her anger.\n\n"So why are we so surprised if we were planning to betray them too?"\n\nAnd that was the point the dam broke. "Because only we're supposed to do that!" the yellow siren yelled at her partner, pushed past her breaking point. Sonata quickly retreated, realizing she had finally overstepped Adagio's patience.

The remaining Pillars of Equestria had already been hoofed over; just like Somnambula, they were imprisoned in the dungeons of Mount Aris until the sirens could put their undivided attention on dealing with them.\n\nAria shrugged. "We can't negotiate with the changelings ourselves, so we have to trust Moonfeather to work for us. Unfortunately." The last word she added on with an extra dose of sarcasm.\n\n"Our Constant knows the price of betrayal," Adagio responded dismissively. "And he profits from our success as well, so he'll do whatever he can for us anyway. Greed is such a powerful motivator."\n\n"Right. And what will we do with our 'allies' after everything is done?"\n\n"What we will do with them does not matter for now. If Plumage is successful, they may still be useful partners for us.

It is for those exact reasons that the Changeling Queendom considers it a region of interest, however the probability of them successfully pacifying local pony resistance is low.

 hippogriff_abyss.55.d:0 "Negotiations between us and the sirens have gotten off to a rocky start, as demands have been sent for the region of Manehattan to be given to and recognized as siren territory. While giving up land is not a notion any respectable changeling would even dream of, we do have to approach this with at least a hint of nuance due to what is at stake here.\n\nManehattan is a valuable region on the east coast, with a large amount of Equestrian industry and population. Losing it would strike a heavy blow to our ability to project power eastwards. However, it is realistically unlikely that we would be able to maintain a firm hold over it anyway for the near future. In addition, should the sirens control territory further inland, they should be of a higher priority for us to negotiate for. If we want to keep our alliance and friendly terms with the new intercontinental power we have given a hoofhold on Equus to, it may still be worth giving them this small victory."

Its industry is notable, but the local resources and population density leave much to be desired. However, it remains an important symbolic region of Equestria, and a virulent hotbed of communist resistance, so the Changeling Queendom ignoring the Queen's Guard organization is somewhat willing to pawn it off to us instead. Should we hold the major industrial centers, they will likely concede without any further issue.\n\nAddendum: Stalliongrad will be critical should we wish to secure a hold and gain concessions over the east and heart of the Crystal Empire."

Alone, it is not the most important areas of Equestria by any means. It serves no critical strategic purpose for us, and with the fierce communist resistance it does seem like more trouble than it's worth.\n\nHowever, hoofing it over to the sirens has hit a single snag, that being the Queen's Guard. Having been set to administrate the region personally, they are vehemently against any sort of surrender to the foreign power. They do have a point in it being seen as a sign of weakness, but it is obvious to many that it is mostly to ensure their own spoils of war remain theirs. Still, the final decision is up to the Queen."

Also contains the major port in the Pegasi Gulf and the west coast of former Equestria.\n\nNotes: The Southwest region is valuable for exactly one reason, and that is the oil it contains within the desert. The city of Las Pegasus is also a notable bonus, as one of the few major ports of Equus. The Changelings are eager to gain both to fuel their transport of material to garrison forces and their war machine as a whole. They will not give up such a prize easily, though the proximity to our secured Southeast region does prove a point of contention. Shrewd diplomacy may still win us the day if we have a definitive advantage in the region.\n\nAddendum: The Southeast is an individual and independent piece from the rest of Equestria in negotiations, and thus can be ignored if necessary to focus efforts on more critical regions in the east and north."

It contains the port of Las Pegasus, which is critical for supplying our forces across all of further Equestria. And finally, its geographical location is important in securing our flank in all the rest of western Equestria. This is why, to our annoyance, our so-called partners are making demands for the region.\n\nSaying no is a simple option. We get to keep our current valuable holdings. But should we already not have much of a grasp on it, it may be... prudent to give it up to them, at least at the moment. A distinct advantage here is that letting them take it here will not let them press any further, for northwest Equestria is already guaranteed to be ours with no negotiation.\n\nStill, that oil is quite the prize to behold..."

In addition, it is the world's highest source of magical crystals for use in magi-tech and other similar applications, or for our use in siren gem crafting. The Changeling Queendom sees no difficulty in maintain a hold over an occupation, and so wishes to see it remain under their administration. Surrender to a demand for land is unlikely to meet success unless odds are stacked in our favor.\n\nAddendum: As the last region in the north for negotiation, there is no further benefit to holding the region past the initial benefits.

While we would still get the western half of the Empire as was previously agreed upon, we would still lose the most critical part of the once-banished land of Crystal Ponies, as well as their vast magical crystal mines in the mountains. In almost every term, the sirens would be getting all of the population and resources, leaving us with only empty wastes.\n\nWith nothing left to lose, we could take our stand here and refuse any further humiliation. Or, because of that, we can give up and just let them have this last victory. It is disgusting, it is untenable, and it will only leave them in that much a stronger position for a certainly guaranteed war between us in the future, but if we remain 'compliant' we may get the chance to take them by surprise one day..."

Ponyville and Cloudsdale have been particularly noted of cultural significance. Occupies important place in the heart of Equus.\n\nNotes: Canterlot is representative of victory over Equestria itself, and central Equestria may be the most important region culturally to all of ponykind. With three major cities as well as the home of the Element Bearers, and the vast resources in the caverns beneath the capital, attaining this region would be a true victory and a display of dominance over our new holdings in Equus. However, the changelings also know of this, and with their major grudge they are considered incredibly unlikely to hoof over the region if given the option. Should we wish to have it, we will have to pry it from their grasp by force, and diplomatic superiority.\n\nAddendum: Taking Canterlot will be necessary to justify a future demand for ownership of the heart of the Crystal Empire."

It is one of the entire reasons why we waged war against the ponies in the first place, and the capital is an eternal reminder of the moment we reached for the sun and were cast out. And now, it is being threatened to slip away from our grasp once again.\n\nGiving up Canterlot would be a tremendous defeat on our part, and practically strip all meaning from our glorious war with the ponies. And yet still... if we do not already have the cities we need, there is little chance that we will be able to get them now, or in the near future barring a full war. As loath as every changeling would see it, we may have a better chance to just... accept this defeat and plan our revenge at a later date.

 hippogriff_abyss.65.d:0 "Unfortunately for both of us, the changelings have refused our demand for one of the regions of Equestria.

 hippogriff_abyss.66.t:0 "Rethinking Our Relationship"
 hippogriff_abyss.66.d:0 "It was strange, being alone these days. No Aria to argue with her over how to do things, no Sonata to pester her with mindless requests. All Adagio had to accompany her was the sound of silence. There was a certain beauty to it, one that even her own music could not fully capture. There was a time and place to sing, after all; the absence in between made the moments of her talent shining bright all the more special.\n\nBut alas, none of that was the reason she was here alone today. Plumage Moonfeather had finally returned from the lands of the changelings, the negotiations officially concluded. Normally this would be when she would play her cards, reveal her true colors and betray her allies without a second thought. But Equestria and its ponies was proving more resilient than she thought, and Adagio needed to put her attention on them. Her revenge needed to come first.\n\nAnd so, she was left with the question of what to do with their fellow emotion-feeding 'friends'. She could still betray them and cut ties, of course. War was not something she wanted just yet, but isolating themselves would make sure they wouldn't be caught off guard by a betrayal. Or, she could keep up the facade, maintain their alliance while still keeping them at a hoof's distance. As long as they each found a use for the other, or were too busy dealing with the ponies, mutual protection would keep anyone else from intervening.\n\nOr, she could take an entire new step in the other direction. The changelings' ability to shapeshift was admittedly impressive, even if it was run on love instead of hate. A few of them here or there could do wonders in crushing the last cells of resistance that remained actively fighting in Adagio's parts of Equestria, and absolutely obedient servants would surely help the changelings. It would be mutually beneficial, and would make her betrayal all the more punishing someday, as long as she expelled or dealt with the internal changelings simultaneously. And as long as they were dependent on her, they could never dream of doing such an act back at the sirens..."

 hippogriff_abyss.67.t:0 "Another Offer"
 hippogriff_abyss.67.d:0 "While we expected a surefire betrayal soon by the sirens, it seems the opposite has happened instead. They have sent us a new offer, separate from the negotiations we once had, of collaborating in occupying the land of Equestria and subduing the ponies. If we supply them with changelings loyal to them who can act as deep-cover agents to infiltrate resistance cells, they will provide us with fanatically loyal thralls to work with. By combining our unique talents, we can subjugate the ponies easier and hopefully put an end to their foolish notions of rebellion.\n\nHowever, we must still be wary. The benefits are obvious, but so is the danger of allowing their subjects into our occupied territories and working closely with us. It is practically asking for a devastating backstabbing down the line. But, if it helps us prevent a full uprising by the ponies, perhaps it could be worth it for now..."

 hippogriff_abyss.68.d:0 "Of course they had accepted. The changelings were fools, not being able to see what was right in front of them. Either that, or they were far too overconfident in their ability to keep their song contained. The agreement was still in its initial stages, but already crowds of enthralled ponies were moving across the border to work with the changelings, just as there were changelings moving to 'help' them. A so-called mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nOf course nothing was such under the surface. Adagio had already told Aria to keep a close eye on them, which she had been more than willing to do this time. Every single changeling had their position tracked, their disguise marked, and were being monitored by loyal thralls constantly. A single hint of disloyalty would result in their immediate musical correction.\n\nPerhaps the changelings were taking similar measures. Perhaps they weren't. It didn't matter now, and some day it wouldn't. When the time came that they finally relax their guard... that will be the time to strike. Until then, Adagio would wait."

For now, though, the situation remains the same; a tenuous alliance, destined to be broken. They will hear the song, but not today.\n\nSomeday, though, they will get the chance like all the rest do."

 hippogriff_abyss.70.d1:0 "The wind was blowing. The ocean breeze carried the faintest smell of salt as the grass bowed before it, creating its own sea of green. The only breaks were from the hoofmarks that were left behind by the seven ponies as they marched, heads bowed low. Each Pillar of Equestria was tired and broken; the result of harsh captivity, the worst of which Somnambula suffered due to her excess time there.\n\n"Do you recognize this place, Stygian?" Adagio asked as they finally stopped, the air blowing through each of the ponies' manes. The unicorn in question looked up and around him before shaking his head. "Why, it's where we first met over a thousand years ago. Things could have been so different if you had helped us back then instead of running and assembling these so-called 'heroes'. We could have ruled Equestria, the entire world already, and you could have been there by our side as our most loyal subject." The siren sounded almost genuinely disappointed as she continued. "But alas, you chose poorly, and now this is the way things have to be."\n\n"What do you plan to do to us, then?"\n\nAria smirked. "Not very observant, are you? Can't even tell what you're standing on?"\n\nDrawn lines crossed along the ground underneath them, forming a circle etched with runes with blood red gems laid on the sides. Starswirl was the first to understand; his eyes widened in realization. "Fair's fair, after all!" Sonata said in an upbeat voice, tonally dissonant from what was about to occur.\n\nAs they picked up, the winds began to howl around them, swirling faster and faster as the lines began to glow. The gems themselves floated skywards, spinning around the pillars in a blur of red until finally, the very fabric of reality tore at the seams. And with the portal above them, the seven ponies were sucked into something they had once created themselves, in a cruel twist of irony that would have fate itself laughing.\n\nThe gems shattered, and the tear in space closed. The wind settled, the air silent and deathly still now. And with that, the ancient heroes of old Equestria were gone, defeated by the creatures they had banished so long ago."
 hippogriff_abyss.70.d2:0 ""Where is Sonata?" Adagio asked impatiently as she waited above the field of grass. "I thought we agreed to meet here fifteen minutes ago!"\n\nIt was supposed to be their greatest moment of triumph. The banishment of their most terrible enemies, the Pillars of Equestria. The time in captivity since Equestria's fall had left its mark, all of them ragged even for their age. All, except for the two missing members Sonata was tasked with bringing, Somnambula and Stygian. Without her and them, they couldn't finally get the revenge she'd been waiting far too long for.\n\nClearly Adagio would need to beat punctuality into her thick skull when this was over.\n\nAfter a painstaking amount of time, the familiar blue fin finally appeared on the horizon, with the two ponies in tow. Both of the Pillars looked suspiciously well for their imprisonment; Stygian even wore a coat to protect himself from the chilly weather. In fact, Adagio recognized it instantly; it was the very same one he wore when she, Aria and Sonata had first met him on the coastline over a thousand years ago.\n\n"You're late," Aria remarked as she floated over to the pair. "What, did the ponies give you trouble in getting over here to banish them?"\n\n"No, but..." Sonata sounded anxious while continuing. "I was thinking... maybe we could, like, not banish Stygian and Somnambula?"\n\nDead silence. She had expected a lot of mind-numbingly stupid ideas from the siren, but this was a new, unbelievable low. "Are you insane, Sonata?" Adagio asked with barely contained rage. "You want to spare the ponies who banished us for over a thousand years into an abyss. Did you forget why we fought this hard in this first place?!"\n\n"Well yeah, obviously I remember," Sonata said defensively, "but I talked to these two and they never wanted to banish us in the first place! They just wanted to talk to us first and try to make us change! Banishing them too for that seems kind of..." She struggled to find the words for a moment. "...Unfair!"\n\n"And when have we ever been fair? When has the world ever been fair? It wasn't to us when we tried to take what was ours, and they're still to blame for that!"\n\nSonata folded her hooves, still not giving up. "Well, if the world isn't fair, maybe we should try to be!" Adagio saw Somnambula and Stygian standing behind her, both staring hopefully at their newfound defender, while the remaining Pillars watched curiously behind them. It was clear that for once, now out of all times, Sonata was not backing down."

Adagio asked with barely contained rage. "You want to spare the ponies who banished us for over a thousand years into an abyss. Did you forget why we fought this hard in this first place?!"\n\n"You don't get it though, Adagio!" Sonata pushed back. "I talked to Stygian, and he told me they never wanted to banish us, that was Starswirl's idea! Stygian just wanted to bring them together to save his village and talk to us first! If anything, the only one you should be mad at is him!" The siren pointed at the slender unicorn, who took a step back as his fellow ponies moved away from him, all staring.\n\n"They still agreed to banish us in the end. They still chose to do that, Sonata!"\n\nThe blue siren folded her hooves, unconvinced. "They didn't have a real choice! That's like... blaming ponies under our spell for fighting when we're making them do that! None of them should be blamed for listening to him, especially Somnambula and Stygian! They were against banishing us first too!" At this point every Pillar was staring from behind at their newfound defender, except for Somnambula who had a strange expression on her face that almost looked like she was... proud of the siren.

But now the tables were turned, and it was time to take the toll of that arrogance.\n\n"You might have taken Equestria, but you'll never take our friendship!" Rainbow Dash said defiantly as the Element Bearers all stood across from the three sirens, looks of anger across their face. They had little choice in being there; enthralled ponies of all three tribes surrounded them in a large circle, cutting off any means of escape.\n\n"And why would we need to do that?" Adagio asked them. "Just because your connection to those little artifacts of yours doesn't mean we can't reach you in other ways. Aria, if you would do the honors?" Nothing seemed to happen for a moment, until a few ponies behind the sirens parted to reveal a unicorn, with a brilliant amber coat and a familiar military uniform.\n\n"Sunset Shimmer!" Twilight cried out as she reached a hoof towards her, but the pony gave no response. She only stared blankly, before looking upwards towards the sirens as if waiting for further instruction.\n\n"You may be immune to our spell, but the ponies you love aren't. And now, they're completely obedient to our every command." Adagio's dark smile grew even more sinister as she continued. "But, since I'm in a generous mood today, I'm willing to forget everything in the past. You can go, live out your short lives and do whatever it is you mortals do. But make no mistake, you will remain obedient and quiet. Because if you decide to cause trouble again..." Sunset's empty eyes drilled deep into Twilight, unblinking. "...it won't be you who pays the price for it."\n\nThe crowd of ponies parted, allowing both the Element Bearers and the sirens to leave. None of the former moved however, the five keeping their eyes on Twilight, who could only watch in despair as the pony she still called a friend turned away without the slightest bit of hesitation and followed the new masters of Equestria away, off to do whatever service they required of her."
 hippogriff_abyss.71.d2:0 ""And just where are we going?" Rainbow Dash made her annoyance and her confusion clear as the five Element Bearers were escorted down one of the many caves beneath Canterlot, surrounded by armed ponies and led by the three sirens. "Gonna try and lock us up for good?"\n\nAdagio laughed, the usual sinister and dark-edged nature even more prevalent than usual. "Why, we're just bringing you all to your friend, of course. What, do you not want to see her again?"\n\n"Twilight?" Fluttershy asked softly, blinking. "She's here? But... why?"\n\n"See for yourself." The narrow cave opened into a large cavern, dominated by the large magical cage in the center. Powered by multiple crystals and attended with countless mages armed with magical rifles, their eyes glazy, all kept an eye on the prisoner. The familiar alicorn, her once bright-pink stripe within her mane now a blood-red, slowly turned to see the new arrivals.\n\n"...friends?" she asked, approaching to get a closer look through the wall. "Why are you not fighting? Free me, serve the Empire!" Sunrise Sparkle's gaze hardened as the mares shifted uncomfortably, eyeing the many rifles their escort held. "Traitors! Heretics to the Empress! How dare you not give your lives in service! You all don't deserve your lives, much less freedom to walk among the faithful!" The alicorn turned manic, firing spells of fire all across the walls, all of them extinguishing harmlessly upon contact with the cell walls.\n\n"Twilight..." Rarity said, her voice and eyes shattering as she watched her former friend.\n\nAdagio could no longer contain her glee, yet another laugh piercing ears. "Isn't this ironic? The very one who led Equestria, the Princess you called your leader, who now turned your friend to hate you more than our spell ever could! The Princess of Friendship, who killed her own guard before finally being captured! Whatever happened to your 'harmony', ponies?" The Element Bearers had no response. "What a show... I'm sure you know better than to try and save her, or act against us with her here. I'll leave you to your suffering with your 'friend'."\n\n"Speaking of which..." Aria finally moved, her attention turning to one of the mages. "Sunset. Good work securing the Princess. Come with us, you're returning to your normal duties." Sunset nodded curtly before trotting towards Aria, following her and Adagio who were moving to leave the cavern back the way they came.\n\nSonata stayed for a moment longer, staring at the insane Sunrise with an indecipherable expression, before shaking her head softly and leaving as well."

The six were gathered before them, surrounded by a crowd of mindless ponies enthralled for the task. They had tried hiding, but found little refuge in even the places they once called home. Pulled out by force, Twilight's friends huddled around her defensively while she weakly stood, the effects of the long changeling occupation absurdly visible upon her. Where once she was a model of an alicorn princess, now she was worn ragged and barely able to stand.\n\n"You know, we were planning to put you in your place for helping Skystar all those years ago, but it seems someone has already beaten us to it," Adagio said curiously disinterested by the affair. "And here I was hoping we'd get something from taking your little friend here."\n\nA few ponies behind the sirens parted to reveal a unicorn, with a brilliant amber coat and a familiar military uniform. Twilight's eyes only widened in recognition as she only stared blankly, before looking upwards towards the sirens as if waiting for further instruction. "You better not lay a hoof on Twilight!" Rainbow Dash said, readying herself for a fight.\n\n"Or what?" The yellow siren laughed. "Your little princess looks like she would fall from a breeze. It would be all too easy to finish what the changelings started..." Sunset Shimmer's horn glowed with magic, a spell to cast a powerful inferno at the ready. Then, it faded just as quickly as it appeared. "But there's no point. I believe you ponies have already gotten the message of what we can do if you cross us again. It won't be your lives on the line next time."\n\nAria, Adagio and Sunset turned to leave, the crowd parting to let them through. Sonata remained for a moment longer, staring at the injured and broken Twilight, her eyes shimmering with shock and perhaps the slightest sliver of sorrow, before she too turned and left the former heroes of Equestria alone."

 hippogriff_abyss.72.d:0 "The two proposals laid before Aria were certainly interesting, that much was sure for her. With the spell sung, any previous blame or resentment towards the sirens themselves had magically vanished overnight, replaced with shifting the blame towards anyone else possible. The changelings, the griffons, their own fellow ponies; none were free from their accusations of causing their defeat. What was once angered cries of outrage towards her by the important equines 'loyal' to their nation had become relentless flattery and offers of obedience in attempts to gain an edge themselves on their rivals.\n\nNot every offer was worth her time, obviously. Countless of them had been slowly wittled down, first by trusted thralls and then herself, until she was just left with the industrialists and the nobles. The former, looking to make a new profit, offered their possessions and their influence to further stabilize major cities of Equestria, a certainly worthwhile idea. On the other hoof, the unscrupulous nobles left were willing to provide their valued service in subduing all of occupied Equestria, a long term idea with long term support.\n\nUnfortunately, with resources stretched thin, she could only reasonably accept one of their ideas for the moment. And with Adagio and Sonata out of the picture for this, thankfully, the choice was completely up to Aria."

 hippogriff_abyss.73.d:0 ""I don't know," Sonata said to the pony and feline as the argument reached its fourth hour, both of them almost getting to their wits' end. "Both of you have really good arguments, its hard to decide."\n\nThe Maregyptian put a hoof to his forehead, struggling to keep his patience. "Look, the Manedalusians wish to be a part of Maregypt. Both of our peoples long for reunification, and you would have the eternal gratitude of all of them should you choose us."\n\nThere was a hiss from the Abyssinian in response. "Pure lies, all of them. They have done nothing but oppress the creatures living there for generations, and they sought our liberation before you brought it to all of us. It is only right that we are given responsibility for their cities and land."\n\nThe doors behind them slammed open, and a second siren came in. "Oh, hey Aria," Sonata remarked, finally seeming to pay a bit more attention. "These two have been arguing to have some city or something for a while now."\n\n"I know," Aria responded, taking some satisfaction in the fear that seeped into both of the delegates' eyes. "That's why I'm here."\n\n"So what do you think?"\n\n"Well, giving Manedalusia to the Maregyptians would give us more control of it, considering our future plans with them." The siren very much enjoyed seeing the pony's eyes light up before the fear from earlier immediately returning in full force at her comment. "However, the Abyssinians are proving to be difficult to deal with from their distance, and you shouldn't just throw away a chance to get their loyalty."\n\nSonata was silent for a moment. "That wasn't helpful at all!" she finally complained, prompting a smirk from Aria.\n\n"It's your choice, not mine. And that means Adagio gets mad at you if you make the wrong choice. I'd suggest you don't.""

Unfortunately, that trip was riddled with what was obvious from the beginning; the ponies did not want them. The love they held for their Princesses was difficult to break, even with magic, and the countless ponies who had escaped enthrallment were fighting hard to undermine them at every turn. There were no serious accidents on the trip, fortunately, but still even Sonata understood what the constant acts of defiance she saw meant.\n\nThe future would be difficult, for all of them. The ponies would realize it was better this way eventually. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. But ponies were no longer so accepting of following along. Peace and friendship had become the norm, and they would need to break that now. A few ponies here and there were willing to follow, but they were a firm minority.\n\nBut that was all for future Sonata to worry about. Right now, back on Mount Aris, she needed some sleep."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d2:0 "Sonata was tired.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And unfortunately, that trip barring a few exceptions was riddled with what was obvious to anypony; the ponies did not want them, or were at least skeptical of their rule. While the second rise of Nightmare Moon had disillusioned many in society, especially the thestrals who were not loyal to her, there were still many others who believed in Celestia willing to fight to undermine them at every turn, and not to mention the new Lunarist radicals created from it. While they had experience in rooting such ponies out from Chiropterra, even Sonata knew what the acts of defiance and resistance meant.\n\nThe future would not be easy, at least for many of them. The ponies would need to realize that things were just better this way. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. At least she got banished for acting in her true nature, and not for arguing with a sister. And some ponies did seem to recognize her as a new ruler, offering to help against those who still fought against the song.\n\nBut things like that were for future Sonata to decide and think about. Right now, back on Mount Aris, she needed some sleep."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d3:0 "Sonata was excited.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And, for a large part of it, the trip was actually an interesting success. Many ponies still did not trust them at the very least, but with Princess Celestia's fall their faith in old Equestria was shattered. Other than the radical solarists created from the regime who fought endlessly in the name of their Empress, the masses of ponies seemed to at least be accepting of our rule now, especially those who suffered most from the old Solarist rule. Few wanted to directly associate with ponies who wanted to be free, as to them 'freedom' was a return to terror.\n\nThe future, while still uncertain, was not looking difficult either. The ponies were already coming around, as they should. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. At least she remained true to herself, unlike Celestia who fell from who she was. And the ponies, they recognized that right to rule she believed in, even offering whatever they could to bring an end to unified resistance and start a new age of musical normalcy in Equestria, or at least as normal as things could be under them.\n\nAnd Sonata was willing to start right now. Now that she was back on Mount Aris, she could finally bring the good news to her fellow sirens..."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d4:0 "Sonata was ecstatic.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And, in almost every place she went, she was met with adoration, gratitude and hopeful ponies looking for an end to their constant misery. With both Princesses having fallen from grace, they are willing to accept almost anything that frees them from the madness and insanity that the two Empresses were forcing upon all of Equestria. Almost all organized resistance is despised by the average civilian for ties to the radicals now beaten, keeping their ability to do anything of note minimal.\n\nThe future was bright for everycreature, but especially Sonata and the sirens. Ponies flocked to her as a savior, a worthwhile alternative to everything they thought that they once knew twisted beyond belief. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have doubt about that. If anything, this only reinforced that fact, that the ponies wanted her and that anyone else attempting to lead would only end eventually in failure. Countless were offering to help her and the 'occupation' in any way possible, some out of self-interest, but many others out of gratitude, barely influenced by the spell they were under.\n\nAnd with everything she saw, Sonata almost couldn't wait to get started bringing her old home back. Now that she was back on Mount Aris, she could bring all the news she had back to her fellow sirens..."

 hippogriff_abyss.75.d:0 "Mortals were such an odd thing, at least to Sonata. They died so quickly, yet they had managed to do so much over a thousand years. Even if they were still led by an immortal, it was regular ponies and other creatures that created new spells, new inventions, new music. Their empires rose and fell, and while some thought themselves worthy enough to rule, others were content to follow and be forgotten in history, much like Sonata herself almost was. By everything that she knew, they should have done almost nothing, but everything now contradicted that statement.\n\nAnd none did more than the simple fact of the nature of sirens. Adagio kept telling her that mortals were nothing, that they were disposable servants and nothing more, meant to be ruled over as crowds to adore them. And while yeah, that second part was true with how much conflict the world had seen without them, there was something else. Sonata, and all three of them got their powers from mortals. They fed off their hatred to gain power. Without them, they'd be completely powerless, magic-less sirens in a magic-filled world. The truth that Sonata had finally found, and maybe that Aria and Adagio had known but not spoken for a long time, was that they needed mortals as much as mortals needed them.\n\nPerhaps Sonata had actually known that the whole time, with how she felt the need to always want more for them when Aria and Adagio wanted less. But that was what it came down to now; how should they be treated? The wars with Equestria were over, the threats to their survival finished. This was all that was left now. Could mortals be nothing more than servants to rightful siren masters?\n\nOr, Sonata wondered, could they be something more, something a siren needed to protect?"

 hippogriff_abyss.76.d1:0 "It was over.\n\nWell, kind of. Equestria was gone, but there was still a ton left to do for everyone, especially her. Just because they won didn't mean it would be any easier. But, at least for right now, there was quiet. Nothing to do, no one to meet, just her alone in silence.\n\nSonata was never one for introspection. It just seemed boring and pointless to her, where there were a ton of better things to do. Why worry about what was in the past? She had made some mistakes, sure, but nothing that really mattered in the end. Nothing needed to change, and everything was fine. Everything was as it should be.\n\nAnd that was enough for Sonata. After a few more seconds of deep thinking, she got up to go get a taco. At least that would be more useful then whatever she thought she was doing right now."
 hippogriff_abyss.76.d2:0 ""That sure sounds like a lot of hard work," Zamni commented as Sonata laid on a nearby couch, having recounted everything she had done in the past few months. "Though those two other sirens of yours sound like they're giving you a hard time too."\n\n"They do, like, all the time," she agreed, waving a hoof for emphasis. "They just don't really get the stuff I do, you know? Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who actually thinks about what's going on."\n\n"What do you mean? They're never even seen me once, sure, but you made them sound pretty smart. And older, too."\n\nSonata struggled to find the words to continue. "It's just... I have all these ideas, and they can't understand them. When you made those new gems for us, they thought I was just using you as a tool and that's it. That's what they expected a siren to do, when instead... you're actually kind of nice as a friend, too."\n\nZamni trotted over, finally taking a seat nearby. "I appreciate the sentimentality," he answered, putting a hoof up, "but it sounds like they just can't see things any other way from theirs. Do you have any ideas on what to do about it?"\n\n"No!" She threw her hooves up in the air, clearly frustrated. "That's it! I can see all these things that are wrong, that don't make sense, but have no idea how to fix them or what they mean! They just bother me and I can't tell why."\n\nThere was silence for a few seconds, the only sound being a clock ticking from nearby. "Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually," the zebra finally said. "I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. Want to play a board game instead?"\n\n"Sure, maybe that'll take my mind off everything.""
 hippogriff_abyss.76.d3:0 ""What's wrong, Sonata?" Zamni trotted over to the siren, looking genuinely concerned. "You look troubled. Did something happen?"\n\n"No," she said, clearly unsure of herself. "Nothing happened yet. It's what's going to happen."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\nSonata looked strangely introspective, staring off into the void. "Have you ever heard of Somnambula, Zamni? Pillar of Equestria, from Maregypt?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"I talked to her a while back." The zebra looked expectantly at her as she took a moment to continue. "She told me things I never knew, things I might not have even wanted to hear. She made me ask so many questions about myself, and then I saved her from being banished by Adagio and Aria. She still talks to me in secret, telling me she hopes that I can be a better person, that I can do better things."\n\n"Okay..." Zamni blinked. "That's good advice and all, but what does that have to do with now?"\n\nThe blue siren took a deep breath. "There's so much we're doing wrong, Zamni. So much we need to change. But Aria and Adagio don't want to do that. I have to force them to, even if they hate me for it."\n\nNeither spoke for a long time. The only sound between them was the ticking of the clock from within the room, signaling seconds passing by as they waited. "Well, whatever you do, you can know that I support you no matter what," the Zumidian finally said, moving close to Sonata and looking up into her eyes. "And it sounds like Somnambula does too. Whatever you decide to do, we'll follow."\n\nShe broke out into a small, real smile. "Thank you, Zamni.""

 hippogriff_abyss.77.d:0 "It was cold. The ocean currents had changed this year, bringing with it an unusual chill from the waters beyond Seaquestria. Adagio was barely bothered by it, her full attention on the waterproof map in front of her as Aria and Sonata remained still a few feet behind. The former completely disinterested, the latter looking curiously over her shoulder.\n\n"We've done well," Adagio said, her voice filled with adequate satisfaction. "Our names are said with respect and fear, as it should be. So many bow and adore us, just like we wanted. Now we can go and spread our rule to the rest of the world too, and finally finish what we were supposed to start a long time ago."\n\nAria made a noise, derailing the train of thought. "Already? We haven't even gotten Equestria under our control. We can't just go out and keep fighting expecting everything to continue going our way."\n\n"Why not? Everything has been perfect so far. Our song still rules, despite what you thought before."\n\nThe eldest siren's comment struck a nerve for Aria, who quickly retorted. "It's been going because I keep having to do everything important! All you do is sing and rile up a crowd and then take all the credit! If it was just you alone, you'd be in the ground before you even got off Aris."\n\n"If it wasn't for me, we'd still be stuck down in that Abyss doing nothing!" Adagio put her full attention on the other siren now, moving closer with a death glare. "Don't forget who's supposed to lead this group, Aria."\n\nThe siren didn't so much as flinch, keeping her own glare trained back. "Who said you should be the leader?"\n\nSonata remained silent as neither Adagio nor Aria backed down, the challenge for leadership clear. No more half measures, no more temporarily taking charge, no more struggles for power. This was it. This was the end of the debates and fighting.\n\nWhoever broke first would fall in line permanently, and the victor would see their vision of Sirenalia become reality... alone, for better or for worse."

Finally, she could get what she wanted, without having to deal with the petty arguments that both her partners insisted on having almost every day.\n\n"So, as I was saying... with Equestria and its ponies under our spell, there is nothing out there that can stop us. There is still so much to do, so many creatures left without our song... we have a lot to do."\n\n"We?" Adagio turned back to see Aria once again staring fiercely, but this time with a different shade to it. "There's not going to be a "we", Adagio. I'm tired of following and being forced to put up with your dumb decisions. If you're going to do this, then I quit."\n\n"You... what?" Almost never had the eldest siren been taken by such a confusing surprise. "What do you mean, you 'quit'? That's not an option."\n\n"Says who? If you want to go and entertain your own fantasies, go ahead. But I'm not going to be there to catch you when you fall."\n\n"Aria!" Adagio's voice was filled with anger, and perhaps the slightest tinge of desperation as her now-former partner swam away, quickly disappearing out of sight. "What does she think she's doing?! We've always been a team!"\n\nSonata shook her head, sadly. "We've just been helping you, Adagio. Aria's right. I just... can't anymore. Good luck with your evil plans."\n\nThen, the blue siren swam away as well, leaving Adagio alone. She was victorious... but only she would be the one to see it."

"We still have plenty to deal with before we can think about going after the rest of the world. While I lead things, I'll still need you two to-"\n\n"Us?" Adagio laughed strangely. Usually, there was at least some sort of emotion to it, whether it be genuine amusement or dark malice. This had none of that. It was just... empty. "Why would I do anything for you?"\n\n"Because we're a team?"\n\n"And what gave you that impression?" Aria had turned to put her full attention on Adagio, who was still looking away. "If you want to lead, go ahead. But don't expect me to follow. I have better things to do than watch you ruin everything we've done." And in the next second, she was gone.\n\nAria didn't look impressed. "So stubborn," she said, turning back. "Right, Sonata?" There was no response. "Sonata?"\n\nShe was alone. The blue siren had left while she wasn't even looking. Figured. Well, if that was how things had to be, then that was how it had to be. There was no time for regret, no time for second guesses.

There are creatures out there waiting us, needing us to help them, and all you two can do is argue about who gets to be first!"\n\nThe two were stunned into silence. Aria swam a few steps back while Adagio, ever the aggressive one, moved forward towards Sonata. "'Help them?' Sonata, what are you talking about? They don't deserve our help, and they barely deserve our song. They treat us like monsters-"\n\n"They treat us like monsters because we don't do anything but act like them! You just say that because you don't want to care about them!"\n\nAdagio looked bitter, but still carried on. "And why would I want to care about them, Sonata. We're the bad guys. We're not supposed to be the heroes, we're supposed to take what's ours no matter what it takes. Didn't I teach you that?"\n\n"Well maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore!" Even Adagio paused as Sonata recollected herself, the two other sirens never having seen her act like this. "It's time for the spell to end, Adagio. There are better ways of getting what we want without all of this."\n\nThe yellow siren laughed, though there was no humor in it. There was no spite or malice in it, either. It was just emptiness. "Really, Sonata? What ways? Did you actually have an idea, or were you just hoping I'd agree with you and help you undo everything we've worked for? No, you have no idea what you're trying to do."\n\nSonata looked downcast as Adagio finally got back some of her old pride, giving a triumphant look from her victory.

Aria stopped, choosing a more tactful wording for Sonata's sake. "...weird, there are other ways we can get what we want."\n\nAdagio stared at her, then at Sonata who was looking overjoyed at her newfound support. "So this is how it's going to be," she said bitterly, boiling rage barely kept behind her facade. "Well, don't let me stop you from ruining everything."\n\n"Adagio? Wait, where are you-" Sonata tried swimming after her fellow siren, but the yellow one was already gone, vanished into the ocean depths and the darkness below. "I... I didn't mean for her to leave..."\n\n"She was never going to accept anything but her way," Aria responded, moving up next to Sonata. "But you can't let that get in the way now.

Offering large sums of money for the territories, his request is incredibly generous for our side, though he has also made it clear that should we reject it, consequences may be on the horizon for not just the colonies, but all of Wingbardy.\n\nThe offer is tempting, especially with what is being offered to us. Allowing us to benefit while simultaneously ensuring we are not in the way of the rising power would certainly help keep the peace, at least for us.

Regardless of such costs, we can consider this deal an unmitigated success."

 hippogriff_abyss.1008.t:0 "The Offer Rejected"
 hippogriff_abyss.1008.d:0 "While we expected greed to triumph over all else for the griffons, it seems that not even smooth words and dangling bribes could persuade the Wingbardians to hoof over their colonies. Plumage has been forced to return empty-clawed, likely a result of his own negligence as much as their stubbornness. While this is no reason to engage in full scale war, at least for now, we will remember this slight when the time comes one day for them to pay their dues to us."

 hippogriff_abyss.1009.d:0 "Even while our mission of conquest and domination continues, we have run into a major problem of our own making. It seems that due to some fault of our own, whether intentional or simply the result of our own negligence, we have run out of magic to work with. Fortunately our complete destruction of Skystar's resistance does mean that our regime will not collapse, at least for the moment, but it is hanging by a thread and severely crippled.\n\nWithout magic, our options are severely limited. Therefore, we must devote all our effort now to regaining it, and bringing our powers back up to acceptable levels before approaching any other issue. This is a critical matter, and one false step could lead to our complete failure, or worse yet another banishment for far longer than a thousand years this time..."

Creatures are obedient, fanatical, and willing to follow our every command. Still, we can not let this victory go forgotten, or allow ourselves to become as complacent again. Next time, we may not be able to pull ourselves from the edge.\n\nLet this serve as a warning, and a stark reminder that even now, even we are not completely in control or all-powerful. Only with the domination of the entire world will we have the magic to endless secure our power."
 hippogriff_abyss.1010.a:0 "Still, this is a victory nonetheless."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.1011.t:0 "Victory"
 hippogriff_abyss.1011.d1:0 "The sun was rising.\n\nAdagio wasn't incapable of appreciating the small things in life. Impatient was an accurate descriptor for her, but she had her reasons for being so. There were always things to do, to deal with, to control.\n\nBut now? Now it was all over. The world was solely under her hooves, swearing loyalty to her and her alone. Oh there were a few stragglers, some creatures here and there hiding in their holes trying to fight back, but nothing worth her concern. All were her subjects, and she was the master.\n\nIt felt satisfying, putting it straight. Years of work seen to its natural conclusion. Adagio could not bring them back, but she was sure that all sirens would look at her with pride and respect for what she had accomplished. Even though Aria and Sonata remained missing, which she felt every day, she knew that they would return one day. There were times when she was lonely, there were times when she was angry, but they would come back someday. She had an eternity to wait, after all.\n\nPerhaps now Adagio could sit back and enjoy the fruits of her labor. To revel in her victory, continue the rule of hate, watch a world just how she wanted it. Anything and everything was at her beck and call. Or perhaps there was more things to do. Sirenalia needed to be ready, after all. Ready for its purpose, for nothing but servitude to her, and to the sirens as a whole. It would not be finished until it was written into the laws of nature itself; of life itself, head bowed towards its greatest creation. Until the music was all they knew.\n\nThe performance may have ended, but the show was just beginning."
 hippogriff_abyss.1011.d2:0 "Silence.\n\nDead silence. That was what Aria heard on her throne, down in the ocean far past where any land-dwelling creature could reach. The only light came from the magical sealife the seaponies had installed, as well as the restored Pearl of Transformation on its pedestal in the middle of the room. Even the various seaponies with the honor to work here knew better than to intrude in the throne room; she wanted no visitors. Isolation was where she thrived.\n\nDid Aria miss Adagio and Sonata? Not particularly. They were still out there, somewhere. She didn't care very much for finding them, especially considering how fruitless it would be should they not want to be found. If they ever wanted to return one day, they would certainly be allowed to. But it would be under her rules, on her terms. Aria was done pandering to the wants of others, especially when there was so much left to do.\n\nOf course she wasn't done yet. The world was hers. There was no one left to stand and oppose her, yes. But she could never be done. There was always enemies, and always ways to improve. She would make this world and everycreature in it know order, know their place in the world. They would learn, whether they liked it or not. And when everything was finally said and done... when the day came that her control was truly and utterly absolute, then perhaps she could look beyond to what would come next.\n\nBut until that day, that long off day to come, the world would know Aria's reign.\n\nHer rule, now and forevermore."
 hippogriff_abyss.1011.d3:0 "This was it.\n\nThere had been many creatures who had spoken of peace in the world. Who had dreamed of one without violence or conflict, of eternal harmony and friendship. Such dreams were naive and impossible, that was what Adagio had taught Sonata. There would always be conflict, argument, disharmony. Friendships would come and go, as creatures ruled by their emotions acted on impulse, not logic, and fought for their own self-interests.\n\nThis, however, might be the closest one could get to such a dream.\n\n"So, what now?" Aria asked as the two of them looked out from a cliff somewhere on the east coast of Equestria, overlooking the Celestial Sea. "The world is yours. You won."\n\n"We won," Sonata reminded her, a far cry from the old arguments and spite that once existed (and still occasionally did) between them. "And now... I guess we relax? Watch the sun rise over a grateful world? Adagio never really said what we were supposed to do after we took over everybody..."\n\n"That's up to you now. Adagio isn't here to tell you what to do, and I'm certainly not going to do it. You're past that now."\n\nThere was a small town in the distance, along the coastline. Sonata could just make out the shape of fillies and colts playing some sort of game with each other, while their parents watched. "I... guess we wait then? I mean, we're the only one who can really make things better, or keep the world stable and like it should be, so we can just wait and see, right? I'm sure there's something more that's out there, but we have time to find it."\n\nThe other siren nodded in approval. "You know, Sonata, you're not the worst after all. And maybe Adagio will come back someday too. I mean, if you got me on board with everything..."\n\nSonata sighed. "Yeah, that would be nice. But until then..."\n\n"We do what we need to do... for everyone.""

 #United Aris Resistance events
 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.1.t:0 "Unity in Strife"
 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.1.d:0 "In a nondescript building somewhere in Hippogriffia, three figures sat around a table. The first was Crack Lightning, the nationalist firebrand of Aris First. The second was Posada, charismatic leader of the Revolutionary Workers' Party. Lastly there was Princess Skystar, Queen Novo's daughter and heir apparent.\n\nCrack was the first to speak. "I'll admit, Princess, when I received your invitation to discuss uniting our resistance networks, I was open to the idea. But if I had known that unreliable, nutty communist was going to be here, I would have stayed home."\n\nPosada immediately shot back, "As if I'm happy to see you, you unabashed racist! You've become such a reactionary I'm surprised you can even lead a resistance!"\n\nAs the two continued to trade insults, Skystar's face contorted with frustration. Eventually her patience wore out, and she yelled as loud as she could, "Stop! You have to stop! Can't you see this is exactly what the sirens want? It doesn't matter what ideology you prefer if there's no one left to support it! They've taken our friends, our relatives, even," she choked on the words, "even my mother, and here you are wasting time with stupid arguments!"\n\nPosada and Crack were stunned into silence. Skystar continued, calmer now, "I managed to send a messenger out to find the Elements of Harmony, but I need help keeping the resistance alive until they arrive. I thought you two could be that help. I heard you were friends once, so I was hoping you'd be willing to work together."\n\nBoth guests sat still, considering what the Princess had said. A moment later, Posada looked up. "Hey, Crack. Remember the first time we met, and how we talked for hours about the battle with the Storm King?"\n\nCrack's expression softened. "Heh, of course I remember. I think I see where you're going: it's time to save Hippogriffia once again?"\n\nPosada smiled. "Yes, but this time let's do it together.""

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.2.d:0 "Being honest, Adagio was annoyed.\n\nShe had so been looking forward to taking revenge, to enact her plans to start the great and rightful conquests she imagined across this pitiful world. And then this has to happen. The few free hippogriffs remaining, in all their audacity, were actively choosing to fight back, setting back those conquests by who knows how long.\n\nIt was quite irritating.\n\n"The hippogriffs are proving more resilient then we thought," she told her partners, who had gathered once again in a spare room of the palace. "Every day they hinder us at every turn, and we have to expend more magic just to keep the rest in line. We have stopgaps, but this thorn needs to be removed."\n\n"That's obvious, Adagio," Aria replied in her ever-bored tone. "They're led by the former Princess Skystar, along with two nobody's. And they've gotten smarter and started using earplugs, so our magic doesn't affect them anymore."\n\n"Then why don't we just do what we always do?" Sonata asked. "We like, break up friendships all the time. It's how we get people to do what we want! Won't it be easier if they're fighting each other instead of us?"\n\nAria instinctively rolled her eyes. "Sonata, that's... actually an idea. Maybe you're not always the worst."\n\n"Really? Hey, wait a min-"\n\nAdagio cut them off before they could start fighting again. "Then it's settled. We put the pressure on until they finally crack. I hope both of you remember what to do?" The two nodded back. "Good. Then lets get this show on the road.""

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.3.d:0 "The leadership of Canterlot is both in relief and worry, as a hippogriff messenger has arrived from what was once Hippogriffia. After we had done multiple magical scans to make sure they weren't under the influence of the Sirens, they were let through to the throne room, where they explained that they had been sent by Princess Skystar. The once-royal of Aris had created a resistance against the Sirens, and she needed the help of Princess Twilight and the Elements of Harmony to defeat them.\n\nWhile sending the Elements to help the Princess would undoubtedly make them grateful and could help restore the harmonic monarchy on Aris, it would also be very dangerous. If an Element were to be captured by the Sirens... well, nothing good could come of it. None of the Elements will also be available here to help, and should a war break out we would have to call them back no matter what the situation would be..."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.4.d:0 ""I didn't think we'd be back so soon," Twilight Sparkle said as she and her friends trotted along the shores of Aris, looking out for any sign of trouble. "When I first got Princess Skystar's letter, I didn't want to believe it, but... something is definitely very wrong here."\n\n"Yeah, yeah, so what?" Rainbow Dash asked. "We'll kick the sirens' flanks and be back in time for dinner, just like the Storm King!"\n\nRarity shook her head. "That was different, darling. These sirens have already captured almost all the hippogriffs in their spell, and they won't be easy to get rid of. We don't even know where to find Skystar, she could be anywhere!"\n\n"Or maybe she's waving at us over there!" Pinkie said bouncing while pointing a hoof inland. The other five ponies looked, and sure enough there the hippogriff was, frantically motioning for them to come over.\n\n"I'm so glad you're all here!" Skystar said as they approached. "I know you all must be really busy and all back in Equestria, but the sirens have got Mom and I didn't know anyone else who could help, so I sent a letter hoping you would get it and here you are!"\n\nRainbow Dash waved a hoof brushing off the remarks. "Don't worry about it," she said, "that's what friends do. So, how can we help?"\n\nThe Princess looked around before leaning in. "It's not safe here. I know a place we can go, and I'll tell you everything there. This way!"\n\nThe ponies looked at each other before following Skystar close behind. They didn't know how exactly they were going to defeat this new threat, but they all knew one thing; they would help Skystar and the other hippogriffs free their homeland, in whatever way they could."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.5.d:0 "Raft Wood swam between the underwater coral and seaweed beneath Seaquestria, desperately trying to put as much ocean as he could between it and himself. For months now he had been held prisoner there by the sirens, unable to return to Aris after being completely caught by surprise during their coup. He had nearly given up all hope on ever being able to see the light of day again, until tonight. He had woke up to find his cell door left open, a single note floating in the water.\n\n"Get to Aris and find us. The resistance needs you. -Princess Skystar"\n\nHe didn't know how the Princess had done it, but he wasn't going to question it. Skystar was right, he needed to get back to the mainland. If they were mounting a resistance, he needed to do his patriotic duty to help, no matter what. He just needed to be careful, and made sure that he didn't get caught or enthralled before he could find wherever they were on Aris.\n\nAs Raft Wood swam off, however, he never noticed the pair of eyes watching from the darkest shadows, nor the malicious grin forming right below them. Everything was going to plan."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.6.d:0 "Crack Lightning entered the meeting room in a hurry. Skystar and many other resistance leaders were already there. In the center of the room was Raft Wood, the founder of Aris First. Crack grimaced. Although they had once worked together, he had always considered Raft to be a rival, not a partner.\n\nCrack turned to one of the guards. "What have you learned?"\n"Well sir, he wasn't followed, and he doesn't seem to be enthralled, but we can't be sure."\n"Thank you." Crack approached Raft, getting uncomfortably close. "Now Raft, would you care to explain how you managed to escape from the sirens?"\n\nRaft raised an eyebrow, but his expression quickly shifted to a smug grin. "Certainly Crack. After many months languishing in captivity, I was close to giving up. But in my darkest hour..."\nHe suddenly flung himself down in front of Skystar. On his knees, he reached up to kiss her claw. "Your Royal Highness somehow opened my cell and slipped me this note!"\n\nRaft gave the short note to a stunned Skystar. "I am eternally grateful to you Princess. You are noble and wise, like your mother. It would be my honor to aid the resistance however I can."\nSkystar read the note and frowned. "Raft, I'm glad you got away safely. But I didn't write this note, and I certainly didn't arrange your escape."\n\nThe whole room gasped. Crack roared, "He is under the sirens' spell!"\nRaft rose to defend himself. "Preposterous! I think I would know if I were enthralled!"\n"Really!? How would you know!? How can you be sure you aren't!?"\nRaft looked uneasy. "I, I... I don't know, but I'm asking you to trust me!"\nCrack faced the assembled resistance members. "This griff is clearly a siren plant, meant to destroy us from the inside. To save our movement, we must execute him immediately."\n\nCrack was normally very persuasive, but as he read the room he realized the others had no intention of executing Raft. He scowled. "Well, I will not have anything to do with him, or anygriff who follows him!" he said, leaving in a huff."

He read over the latest intelligence reports, destroying the most sensitive documents immediately. He was interrupted when the door opened and two Hippogriffs entered. The first was one of his agents, the second was a child no more than 10 years old.\n\n"Hey featherbrains, what do you think you think you're doin'? Don't bring a kid into my safehouse!"\n"Take it easy, boss," he replied, frowning. "She's my niece. Her parents got enthralled, and I'm all she's got left. Can you let her stay with us for a while?"\nBlunt observed the sullen expression on the child's face. "Eh, alright, but you better keep an eye on her. Welcome to Aris First, kid."\n\nThe child perked up at the mention of their organization's name. "Are you guys really Aris First?"\nHer uncle beamed. "You bet we are!"\n"Or what's left of it, anyways," added Blunt.\nThe girl began to smile in earnest. "Does that mean I get to meet Crack Lightning and Raft Wood, and help fight back against the sirens?"\n\nHer uncle tensed, and Blunt frowned. "Listen kid. If you're lucky, you might get to meet the Ace one day. But you're better off not meeting Raft, trust me."\nNow the girl looked puzzled. Her uncle anticipated the next question. "When Raft Wood escaped, Crack Lightning accused him of being a siren spy. Half of Aris First stayed true to the Ace, like us, while the other half followed Raft."\n"Oh, ok." She paused to think. "But is Raft Wood really controlled by the sirens?"\n\nThe door slammed open as another Hippogriff entered. Completely breathless, he took a minute to recover and then stammered, "Raft's faction is gone."\nBlunt froze. "What do you mean they're gone?"\n"Every Aris First cell loyal to Raft has gone dark. The leadership's still trying to figure out what happened, but they think our worst fears have come to pass."\nFor a moment everyone was silent. Both the girl and her uncle grew very pale. Finally Blunt turned to her and said, "Well kid, you got your answer.""

"Several RWP members have complained to me that Razorbeak is demanding all our operatives swear an oath of loyalty to Aris. Crack, did you know about this?"\nCrack smirked."Yes. What's wrong with it?"\n\nPosada was beside herself with rage. "You can't impose Aris First beliefs on the rest of us! What exactly is the point of a loyalty oath!?

When they had gotten the news that the revolutionary had finally been captured in the aquatic kingdom, Adagio had immediately sent the two to deal with it, since she herself was busy dealing with issues on Aris itself. That left the remaining sirens to decide what to do with her.\n\n"Did you really think you'd get anywhere fighting us?" Aria asked Posada, the latter refusing to look at either of the sirens. "You're lucky Adagio isn't here, she'd probably think of some creative way to humiliate you before giving you a performance. Personally, I think life imprisonment will suit you just fine."\n\n"What?" Sonata asked, curious. "Why?"\n\nAria rolled her eyes before turning to face her fellow siren. "Because she's still a threat, Sonata. She's charismatic and a firebrand, we can't let her just walk away even if she's under our influence. It's too dangerous."\n\nSonata made a weird expression, one she made whenever she was thinking really hard. "But like, we beat her! She won't hate us anymore after we sing. And look at this hat I found she had!" She pulled out a neon cap, one formerly worn by Posada with a hydrogen atom symbol on it. "It's so cool! Do you think I can ask her to make me one?"\n\n"No, Sonata." At this point Aria's voice was taking on a dangerously impatient tone. "We are not letting her go, and you are not asking her for a stupid hat."\n\n"It's not stupid! You're just no fun!"\n\n"Am not!"\n\n"Are too!"\n\nPosada watched from below, simply confused at the display of pettiness the two sirens were putting on before her.

That charisma that Adagio might have had a sliver of respect for had been used against them, in a futile effort to overthrow their rule. And for that, he had to pay.\n\nShe had done her research on him, just for this. His big speeches of national pride, his talk of hippogriff exceptionalism, it was very clear both what he believed in and where he took inspiration from.

Skystar saw a few of the remaining hippogriffs in the room flinch, holding their weapons at the ready aimed at the door. There was only one way in and out, and it was currently getting broken down by the mob of enthralled creatures outside. This was it for all of them.\n\nWell, not all of them. Skystar had sent Silverstream out of Hippogriffia just a few days ago, to make an escape to Equestria. Silverstream had begged her to come as well, to flee and seek refuge from the sirens elsewhere, but Skystar had refused. She needed to stay here, to keep the last spark of hope for the resistance against the sirens alive.\n\nThat spark was quickly getting snuffed out with every single bang on the door.\n\n"What do we do, Princess?" a hippogriff asked, the claws holding his rifle shaking. "I know that they're enthralled by the sirens, but they're still our friends and family. Are we really supposed to shoot them?"\n\nSkystar had no good answer. How could she? The sirens had turned everyone she had loved against her. Whenever they saw her, all she could see in their eyes was hatred. And now what was she supposed to do? What if her mom was behind that door, forced by the sirens to do their bidding? What if it was Silverstream, who could have been caught by the sirens during her escape? Was one last act of defiance worth more death?\n\nSlowly, Princess Skystar put down the BAR she was holding. "No," she said. "I can't ask any of you to do that for me."\n\nSlowly, the rest of the hippogriffs put their weapons down as well. Some more hesitantly than others, but eventually all their guns were on the floor, forgotten about. Skystar looked around and met each hippogriff's eyes. All of them bore the same look of sadness, yet also acceptance. She had failed, failed all of them, and now the sirens had won.\n\nThat was her last thought before the door burst open and the crowd of enthralled hippogriffs rushed into the room."

Rainbow Dash waved her hoof rapidly as the Element Bearers, Silverstream and Skystar all ran through the streets of Howlington, a mob of hippogriffs close behind. Their target was a single boat at the end of the harbor, their ticket out of Hippogriffia and back to Equestria. Fluttershy and Rarity had gone ahead to get it prepared, and Twilight saw their eyes widen as they saw the crowd which was growing larger by the minute giving chase. The engine started, and all of them put on a burst of speed as they reached the dock itself.\n\nApplejack was the first to jump on the boat as it was already moving away towards the ocean. "C'mon everypony, jump aboard!" Twilight and Pinkie were next, followed by Rainbow Dash. Silverstream and Skystar were last, crossing the gap right as the boat was starting to pick up speed.\n\nAnd that was when a hippogriff grabbed Skystar's back leg.\n\nShe was pulled back onto the dock, leaving only Silverstream to land onto the boat with the Element Bearers. "Don't worry about me, just go!" the Princess yelled, more and more enthralled hippogriffs grabbing onto her like a horde of zombies. "Get out of here!"\n\n"No, we can't leave her behind!" Silverstream said, getting her wings ready. "We have to go back!" Before she could take off, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy grabbed onto her, keeping her on the boat.\n\n"I'm sorry, Silverstream, we have no choice," Twilight responded. "We can't risk the rest of us getting captured too." She signaled to Rarity at the helm, who silently pushed the speed up to maximum as they sped off from Aris, and from the Princess of Hippogriffia.\n\nIt was only when the island was out of sight that the tears began to fall."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.13.t:0 "Fate of the Princess"
 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.13.d:0 ""Honestly, Princess, what did you think you were going to accomplish?" Adagio asked, as Skystar looked defiantly at her. "All you did was delay the inevitable. So you delayed our plans a bit, and maybe caused some trouble here and there. But was it really worth everything you lost? Our rule is simply how the world works; why did you think you could fight it?"\n\nWhen she got no response, Adagio turned to face Sonata and Aria, floating just a ways back from her. "I think making her go out and sing for us across Hippogriffia and Seaquestria would be just the perfect revenge for the trouble she's caused us," she said, pulling out an amulet with a blood red diamond-shaped gem hanging from it. "Just imagine it, the Princess and the last hope of the hippogriffs, now enthralling the very creatures she was fighting to save. What do you two think?"\n\nAria rolled her eyes but didn't say anything, while Sonata slightly tilted her head. "Really? I thought we were gonna make her stay here with the Queen! I was gonna ask about these two clams I found with her." The blue siren pulled out two of the sea creatures, one red and one purple, both with googly eyes on them.\n\n"They are named Shelly and Sheldon!" Skystar yelled out, much to every siren's surprise.\n\n"You named your clams?" Adagio laughed, a dark and sinister tone attached to it. "That's just-"\n\n"Ooh, can they talk?" Sonata interrupted.\n\nAdagio turned back to her, the irritation obvious on her face. "Sonata, that is enough! We are doing things my way, so stop butting in!"\n\n"Aw, but can't she stay here with us? Please? I'll make sure she doesn't do anything, I promise!"\n\nAdagio turned to Aria, who just shrugged. "I don't care. Do whatever.""

Every day brought more news of strikes against them by the resistance; more places sabotaged, more disappearances, more members for their cause. The situation had gotten truly desperate, with Adagio, Aria and even Sonata at this point straining to keep things under control with their magic. But all three of them knew this couldn't last; they were just running out of stamina to keep things going like this. Every day they were growing weaker, even if none of them would admit it.\n\n"We can't stay here, Adagio," Aria pressed for the third time, despite the yellow siren's stalwart refusal. "We need to leave before the hippogriffs catch us, or worse."\n\n"I am not going to run away like a coward from mere mortals! So they're put a few hitches in our plans; we can still get our revenge, with their help or not!"\n\n"Uh, Adagio? Aria?" Sonata asked while looking out the window. Both sirens ignored her.\n\n"Forget about the plans! I'm not going to risk getting sent back into the Abyss for another thousand years!"\n\n"Aria, maybe you should come see this..."\n\n"We are not going to be banished again," Adagio snapped. "I just need a bit more time, and we can-"\n\n"Dagi!"\n\n"What is it, Sonata?!" The two finally looked over at the third siren, who was still staring out the window. "What could possibly be so important right now?!"\n\n"I think the Hippogriffs are starting to wake up..." They swam over to the window, where a crowd of them were gathering outside. But these weren't enthralled Hippogriffs, no. These ones were fully aware, and moving to break into the palace where the sirens were.\n\n"Oh."\n\nAnd as the final dimming light in each of the sirens' gems went out, the spell across Aris was broken."

Adagio snarled as the one called Twilight Sparkle took a step forward, her wings spread wide. "Your reign ends here!" she said, pointing a hoof at her. "The hippogriffs are free from your spell, give up!"\n\n"Or what," Adagio replied, "you're going to use your little Elements on us? We may not have enough magic to force these pathetic creatures to follow us anymore, but we still have enough to defeat the likes of you, Princess."\n\n"Well, technically if we were able to play instruments then we would totally be able to beat you and shatter your magic thingies, but it's hard to play the drums with hooves. Oh, wait..." Pinkie Pie tapped her chin with a hoof as Applejack stared at her, confused. "That hasn't happened. Oops!"\n\nIt only took a few seconds for Adagio to shake off her confusion. "So, what's your plan, Princess? You have us out in the open. Are you going to turn us to stone? Banish us back to the abyss? Kneel before us and apologize for ever fighting us?"\n\n"Or maybe Princess Skystar and her friends are going to hit us with metal bars!"\n\nAdagio laughed. "Sonata, what gave you that- wait, what?"\n\nAnd with three loud noises, the sirens fell to the ground, unconscious, as Skystar, Crack Lightning and Posada stood over them. "Thanks for the help!" Skystar said as she dropped the steel pipe she was holding.\n\nTwilight smiled. "Happy to help, Skystar.""

The guards were gone, and Queen Novo was nowhere to be seen, liking having run off when the spell was broken. It was just the three sirens. Alone.\n\n"I told you this was a bad idea from the start, Adagio," Aria said, looking out one of the windows. "We never should have tried taking over this island."\n\n"And what, you would rather have us still trapped in that Abyss?" Adagio asked harshly. "I did what we had to do to escape. Just because you failed to help me keep this place under control doesn't mean I made a mistake in starting this!"\n\nAria swam over to Adagio, glaring daggers at her. "I was the one having to do everything! You were too busy dreaming about being adored to even care about what was happening right outside! Maybe if you had actually helped for five minutes, we wouldn't be in this situation!"\n\nThe doors leading out of the throne room slammed open, and all three sirens, even Sonata who was busy floating near the throne itself flinched. Skystar and what seemed like an entire army of hippogriffs ran or flew into the room, all of them armed. The Princess raised the BAR she was holding and pointed it at Adagio. "Put your hooves up! And if I hear any kind of singing, we will shoot!"\n\nAdagio looked at Aria, who only shrugged. "Guess that's it," the latter said. "We aren't bulletproof, after all." Sonata had already put her hooves in the air, half-hiding behind Novo's throne.\n\nSlowly, both Adagio and Aria's hooves went up as well.\n\nThe reign of the sirens was over."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.17.d:0 "Scarlet Banner had always dreamed of revolution. She longed for a chance to fight against oppressors. When the sirens rose from the abyss and put many of her comrades under their spell, she joined the resistance immediately. Now, standing between two Aris First members, she was beginning to have second thoughts.\n\nAt the center of the room, an older griff who had introduced himself as Silverwing explained the plan. "This operation will be the biggest we've ever pulled: a raid on a barracks near Mount Aris. Security will be tight, but we've memorized the guards' rotations, so we shouldn't have any trouble. Let's show those sirens they're not safe anywhere!"\n\nBefore everyone could disperse, he continued, "And as for you commies, remember: we may need you to fill out our ranks, but we'll be keeping an eye on you."\n\nScarlet glared at him. "We'll be the ones keeping an eye on you, fascist pig!"\n\nWhen the resistance fighters reached the barracks, their plan fell apart almost immediately. A siren was singing nearby, and though they had earplugs for protection from the sound the vibrations shook them to the core. A guard managed to raise the alarm, and they had no choice but to fight their way out.\n\nScarlet found herself pinned down near the exit. When her gun jammed, she knew her time had come. A guard approached her, rifle in claw...\n\n...and was tackled to the ground by Silverwing. Scarlet's hope returned for a brief moment, but it was quickly dashed as the guard pulled out one of Silverwing's earplugs. Silverwing managed to knock the guard out, and Scarlet flinched as he came closer.\n\nYet instead of attacking, he grabbed her claw and led her away to safety.\n\nBack at base, Scarlet found Silverwing getting his wounds bandaged.\n"I'm sorry for what I said earlier."\n"It's ok," he sighed, "I am too."\n"It would be an honor to fight by your side again. But first, could you explain how you managed to save me without falling under the siren's spell?"\n\n"Oh, that!" He smiled. "I was a gunner's mate in the Storm King War.

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.1.d:0 "Skyward Tenderquill had long had a cushy life on Mount Aris, having been the son of a wealthy estate owner. He went to school in one of the finest institutes in the country, and he aspired to go into a scientific field. He had friends, he had money, he had everything a hippogriff could ever want.\n\nHowever, one day, there was a commotion outside his school. There was a minority of Seaponies that also attended classes there, a recent initiative put forward when Queen Novo was in power in an attempt to promote racial equality on Mount Aris itself. They transformed into Hippogriffs to take the classes themselves, but would often take breaks to nearby available pools during their free time, as many vastly preferred their aquatic forms. For some bizarre reason, however, there was a mob forming, barring entry to the Seapony students.\n\nTenderquill couldn't think of any reason why there would be such a commotion and ventured further into the crowd to get a better look. Weren't they all supposed to be united after all? Something was wrong, but the more he thought about it the more it hurt to think. He must have been forgetting something, there must have been some sort of event to cause this he had overlooked...\n\nWhen he finally got to a position where he could see the Seapony-turned-Hippogriff students, something inside him clicked. He didn't know what it was or how it happened, but he could see clearly now. Why did these Seaponies deserve to go to THE finest institute in the country, taking spots that hard-working Hippogriffs deserve? All they did was flop around all day and sunbathe, while the Hippogriffs do all the work! It wasn't fair to have them come here, where some Hippogriffs struggled to even live out their lives, and take places meant for them!\n\nFilled with righteous anger, Skyward Tenderquill joined the mob, certain that his school would be a better place if these no-good lazy fish went back to their sea. If they wanted to get an education, they should just stay in Seaquestria where they belong. His former friendships with some of them no longer mattered; the one thing left in his mind was righteous anger towards the creatures he once called classmates."

It happened slowly, gradually until by the time you realized things were different, that they were worse, it was impossible to tell when it had started and when it had ended.\n\nIn this case, though, it was very obvious when everything had gone so wrong.\n\nThe day after prominent businessgriff Plumage Moonfeather had formalized his group of collaborators, the factory that Cloudy Seas had worked at for years now had instituted new 'regulations' that were supposed to improve efficiency at the workplace. And they did, in a way.. by forcing him and all the other hippogriffs to work twice as hard and extending their shifts for hours past what they originally were. There was little doubt that the new armed guards stationed around the factory were there to dissuade any thoughts of protest against these new changes. Cloudy and the other workers saw them as nothing more than thugs, hired guns only there to suppress and take their paychecks from their rich employers.\n\nHe hated them. He hated his manager, he hated the corporation owner, and most importantly he hated Plumage Moonfeather. All of them were to blame with his new miserable life, all of them were causing him this pain and suffering. He hated his coworkers, who were clearly being as lazy as possible just so he had to do more work to cover for them and his own quotas. He could tell they hated him too; he could see the looks on their faces, the anger whenever they saw his face, hippogriffs he once called friends now saying his name like it was poison.\n\nIt wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair at all. The sirens had clearly never meant for this to happen; they must have expected Plumage to try and manage things well, to be reasonable. After all, they were the ones who were just better by nature, they were guardians in a way for all of Aris. But Plumage had taken their trust and used it for personal profit and nothing else. He was greedy, immoral, and downright evil.\n\nIf Cloudy Seas ever saw him in person... well, he couldn't be blamed for what he would do.

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.3.d:0 "Being an agent for Skystar's Resistance was dangerous work. Seaward Wings knew that, and it was only encouragement to get her job done correctly and get out safely. Today's mission against the tyrannical Sirens was a simple reconnaissance of the surrounding countryside to ensure that nothing important was ahoof. It was one of the easier tasks she had been assigned, and yet something felt off to her as she began the trip home.\n\nThe nearby guard checkpoint was all but vacated. Every mission she had undertaken before in this area, the post had a full entourage of enthralled guards looking to keep the road safe and keeping an eye out for dissidents, but not today. Still, Seaward Wings reasoned, there must have been a reasonable explanation for it. Chalking it up to a staff transfer, she logged down the absence before continuing.\n\nFurther down the road, she noticed an armored vehicle heading back towards the checkpoint. Those must have been the missing guards, though why would they be coming from that direction? There's was nothing out that way besides a few farms and... Her home.\n\nShe spread her wings and started flying, not caring about remaining covert anymore as much as she cared about her family. It wasn't long to get to her homestead with her burst of speed, and when she got there the front door was wide open.\n\nCalling out for her parents and sister and receiving no answer, she slowly walked through the once-welcoming home, nothing seeming out of place until she got to the dining room. Tables overturned, broken chairs, all the signs of a struggle between two parties. And on the counter was a single note, one that Seaward Wings tentatively moved to read.\n\n"Turn yourself in, and your family will not be harmed". That was all that it read, simple as could be. Those ten words rang out in her mind, as a million questions spun at the same time. How had they found her? Had she made some mistake somewhere? But one question rose above all else; what would she do now?\n\nThe thing was, Seaward Wings already knew the answer.\n\nAfter putting the rifle she had been carrying the whole trip on the counter next to the note, she somberly turned her head away and began the long trip back to the checkpoint she had seen only earlier that day. All she could hope now is that even if they would never let her see daylight again, at least her family could have the life that she could not."

When Hippogriffia first fell to a threat that only now they knew were the sirens, Zumidia had made sure not to catch itself offguard. They had quickly declared their complete independence from the Hippogriff mandate, led by the Regency Council that everyzebra had agreed to follow in the interest of the defense of the country against its threats.\n\nStill, it was no use against the inevitable declaration of war by the sirens, and the army that followed. Zakinel had been in the city when it had fallen to the hippogriffs, watching them march into the city like puppets on a string. What was interesting was they fact that they were reluctant to use deadly force, instead relying on blunt force or shooting to injure instead of kill. While opposition had been brutally suppressed, there were very little casualties in their occupation.\n\nEver since then, things had actually gone on as normal in the city, or at least as normal as they could be. Zakinel and the other Zumidians were allowed to go about their daily lives as they did before, just under the watchful supervision of the hippogriffs. It actually reminded him of back when they were under the official mandate, in some ways. But back then the hippogriffs had been friendly and helpful, while now they were more akin to statues. The only times they ever intervened was when open acts of dissidence were happening.\n\nBut now, the winds of change were blowing. There was word of the sirens coming, of those called Beacons with songs that would turn them into nothing more than marionettes listening to the whims of their masters. Perhaps it was nothing but fearmongering. What was certain, though, was that there was an aura of uncertainty on Zumidia, and that it would not last much longer."

No, what was happening was nothing less than the full liberation of Chiropterra.\n\nThe only information of the Sirens that Cherry had been permitted to know was that they were "a scourge devoted to destroying and enslaving everycreature", but it was already obvious that the Chiropterrans would have said anything to ensure the laborers would not rise against them. These Sirens must simply be the true saviors of the worker's revolution, here to overthrow the corrupt and authoritarian government that has plagued North Zebrica, forcing all around them into true slavery in service of their Goddess.\n\nNow, with such a powerful force behind them, the workers can finally see justice for the crimes that have been committed against them, and Cherry knew just who to start with. There was a collection of the old Chiropterran elite that instead of fleeing the country had attempted to hold out in their estates and wait out the storm for things to return to normal. However, things would not return to normal for them. No matter the cost, they would see justice for their actions.\n\nAlong with a collection of workers riled up by something more than just revenge, they marched on the estate of the tyrant supervisor that had abused them for decades.

The world could be burning to ash, and they would be none the wiser.\n\nAnd yet, something changed. It was hard to tell exactly when, or how, but it did. Newspapers, once almost irrelevant by the takeover, now printed new stories of foreign nations falling to communism, of monarchs being beheaded by revolutionaries, of famines and chaos in the places that the red banner flew. Posters were put up of the threat communism posed worldwide, and what terrors it would unleash if brought here. Word of mouth slowly spread of family members overseas being killed by revolutionaries for being 'reactionaries', or worse.\n\nThe resistance, of course, was not fooled. They did not turn on their allies immediately, knowing that the sirens were just attempting to distract and that they still posed the larger threat to Aris. But propaganda is effective in ways more than just what meets the eye, and Posada's supporters soon found it hard to coordinate with their allies, always being looked upon with the smallest hint of suspicion..."

Hippogriffs and seaponies alike flocked from all of Aris and Seaquestria to attend, learning about economics, mathematics and the sciences in the hopes of getting a degree from the university. It had a talented staff, international recognition, and a vibrate group of political and ideological clubs ever since such ideas began flowing in from beyond the mainland.\n\nHowever, such a bright light was not meant to last. Crescent Skies, a former resident of Seaquestria had been part of the communist club that had formed before the siren takeover, and had been one of the few to avoid the magic song, alongside a few friends and his professor. He had come into contact with Posada herself and her resistance after they had formed the Arisian Resistance, and while he didn't want to risk becoming a partisan personally, he was more than willing to support them from the sidelines in whichever way he could.\n\nThat was, until one fateful day occurred. When he reached his club room, his friends were there, but not the professor. All the other students shrugged at him.\n\nIt was only half an hour later when their professor came in, looking defeated. He was flanked by two armed guards, both carrying rifles and looking quite threatening. "Students," he said weakly, "I am sorry to say that school is closing. The university is getting shut down indefinitely while communist sympathies in the staff is being investigated."\n\nThey all looked at each other as he continued. "In addition, we all are being sent in for musical correction to ensure that we have listened to the siren song. These gentlegriffs here are going to escort us to the courtyard and ensure that there aren't any complications on the way."\n\nAnd that was it. Crescent Skies slowly got into line to file out of the classroom, knowing that the jig was up. He should have known that this would have happened eventually.

Right now I am alive and well, but if you continue to resist the sirens will no longer be able to guarantee my safety. I love you, Skystar, and I hope to see you again soon."\n\nWhen news of the broadcast reached resistance HQ, all eyes were on the princess.

While not as dangerous as Moonfeather's lackeys, as long as you were prepared, they were being quite the pain for Skystar's resistance when they caught hippogriffs who weren't.

He recognized him instantly; back during when the Resistance factions had still been united, he had seen him with Crack Lightning and Aris First. "I could ask the same thing of you!" Seaside whispered back.\n\n"Me? I'm scouting the tunnel to Seaquestria, obviously! We need to get messages to our cells in Seaquestria, but it's gotten hard recently with all the guards all across Aris."\n\n"That makes two of us," Seaside muttered. "Maybe if you dolts hadn't gotten captured going through the pathways, they wouldn't have increased security!"\n\n"Us?" The Aris First member looked indignant. "It's you Harmonists who were too sloppy! A blind seapony could have followed you from the trails you left behind!"\n\n"Well at least we don't throw ourselves right into the enemy like you do, you reckless buffoons!"\n\nThe Aris First hippogriff opened his beak to respond when his eyes widened in fear. The next second he was gone, grabbed by another hippogriff with glassy eyes and a blank stare. They both disappeared into the next room, as a soft musical voice began to play.\n\nAnd as he felt claws close around him, Seaside knew that he had messed up."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.10.t:0 "The Voice Inside"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.10.d:0 "In the dead of night, the sound of soft hoofsteps echoed through a suburb of Canterford. There was only one Hippogriff walking the streets at this hour. With her soft yellow feathers and light blue mane, she looked exactly like Princess Skystar.\n\nHowever, a closer look would reveal important differences. She walked slowly, without any passion or excitement. Her once bright eyes were dull, and her expression was completely blank. She no longer had a magenta flower in her mane. The only accessory she wore now was a blood-red gem attached to her necklace.\n\nSomewhere deep inside, underneath layers of magic, the real Skystar was still there. Her existence had become a state of endless suffering. She was fully conscious of everything her body felt, heard and said, yet she was powerless to stop it. She could only watch helplessly as she was made to serve the sirens as a beacon. Sometimes she wished the sirens had chosen to execute her. It would have been a more merciful fate than this.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone approaching from behind.\n"Princess Skystar! Thank goodness you're safe. I was afraid you'd been-"\n\nAs Skystar's body turned around, the stranger saw her gem and shrieked in horror. They tried to get away, but Skystar's body was already beginning to sing. She felt the power of the sirens flow through her as the gem around her neck began to glow.\n\nThe stranger ran out of sight, but it was already too late. Just a moment of exposure was all it took for the effects to begin manifesting. Soon that Hippogriff would be arguing with their friends constantly while trusting the sirens completely.\n\nThe real Skystar sank even deeper into despair. Siren magic had ensnared another victim."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.11.t:0 "The Reunion"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.11.d:0 "The waiting was driving Skystar crazy. When the blue siren convinced the others to keep her in the palace, she had assumed it was the prelude to some far worse punishment.\n\nYet since then nothing had changed. Skystar stayed in her bedroom, under guard but mostly unsupervised. She had asked to see her mother several times, but was told that Queen Novo could not have visitors in her current condition.\n\nThe blue siren, who called herself Sonata, visited frequently. She would ask Skystar about her life, her friends and family, even about Shelly and Sheldon. Occasionally Sonata would sing for the princess. In confinement she was powerless to resist the siren's voice, but she didn't seem to be experiencing any ill effects. It was almost as if Sonata genuinely wanted others to enjoy her music.\n\nSkystar's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. She expected Sonata, but the creature that entered wasn't a siren. The princess could barely believe her eyes...\n\n"Posada!"\n"Skystar!" Posada cried, pulling her into an embrace.\nSkystar began to tear up. "I'm so glad you're safe! When you abandoned me and the resistance I thought I'd never see you again!"\n\nPosada frowned, pushing Skystar away. "Hold on, I didn't abandon the resistance or you. You weren't helping with the resistance at all and-"\n"Don't give me that! It was your fault the resistance collapsed!"\n"How dare you! I should never have trusted such a spoiled princess!"\n\nThe two continued to trade insults, their argument becoming increasingly heated. Eventually Posada reached her limit and stormed out of the room.\n\nAs she left, Skystar couldn't help but think that it would have been much nicer to see Sonata. Unlike Posada, the blue siren was a kind creature with a big heart. The more she thought about it, the more it felt like Sonata was the only one who truly understood her.\n\nYet instead of getting to see her real friend she'd been stuck with that arrogant, inane communist..."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.12.t:0 "Abstract: Effects of Siren Magic Through Electronic Means"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.12.d:0 "Background: The effects of siren magic are incredibly potent, requiring only seconds of sound to reach the auditory methods of a creature before it falls under their complete control. However, this is severely limited by the fact that the sound has to be sung by the siren personally, and so through the demands of Adagio Dazzle an experiment was created in which the song was attempted to be recreated using artificial, electronic means.\n\nMethods: An unenthralled hippogriff was placed in a secure soundproof room monitored by scientific staff, who proceeded to place multiple methods of remote audio playback within the room, including speakers, a music player, a radio, and other such devices (the full list included in Appendix A). The song of the Sirens was then played through these electronic devices, and the effects upon the hippogriff were closely studied.\n\nResults: We have definitively concluded that no alternative methods exist to enthrall other creatures using the song. Every experiment to do so failed, despite our best efforts, and all evidence points to the siren having to be present and using their own natural voice and magic for the intended effect to take place.\n\nConclusion: The experiment in all purposes was a complete failure, and the idea is being scrapped on the demands of Aria Blaze to pursue further studies in magical crystals instead, which are believed to hold more promise in fields of study. Should we wish to be able to enthrall other creatures in ways other than direct song from a siren, we will have to utilize other methods to do so."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.13.d:0 "When Crack Lightning began his resistance against the sirens he thought victory was assured. Their enemies were powerful, but that power was nothing the Ace and his country couldn't handle. Hippogriffia defeated the Storm King, achieving victory where so many other nations had failed. Clearly this struggle was just the prelude to another moment of national glory...\n\nThe lights in the Ain Trotgourait post office covered every surface in a harsh glare. Crack looked up from his desk at the long line of zebras before him. Apparently a Zumidian holiday was coming up, so a lot of creatures had letters and packages to send.\n\nCrack sighed. This was going to be a long day.\n\nArranging the papers in front of him, he wondered how many of these zebras were under the sirens' spell. It was impossible to tell, since most Zumidians knew who he was and what he'd said about them and their country. No magic was necessary to make them hate him.\n\nCrack's new coworkers delighted in making him carry several heavy packages at once, or fill out hundreds of forms by himself. The work was grueling, but the most infuriating part was that these zebras believed they had every right to order him around. He thought about running away, but the constant presence of armed guards made escape impossible.\n\nA female zebra approached the desk. She scowled at Crack as she put her package down. He examined it, noting the postal markings.\n\n"This will require a routine search, and I need a form for fragile contents."\n"Yes, I have that right here," the zebra said, pulling a paper from her bag.\nCrack read the form and smiled. "Thank you for filling this out yourself. Normally I have to do it, and it's always such a pain."\n\n"Oh, really?" the zebra replied, a wicked grin forming on her face. She quickly grabbed the paper back and ripped it to pieces.\n\nFor a moment they both were silent. Crack's beak hung open in shock.\n"Well, what are you waiting for? The form's not gonna fill itself out!""

It was only when I was left with no other choice that I was forced to fight," Zeshmunazash explained as Sonata carefully grabbed another taco, barely listening. The meeting was technically supposed to be about land reform, but the siren had forgotten about that instantly upon being offered some new interesting food that was supposedly a local thing.\n\nShe, however, considered it a blessing from whatever entities created her. There was no words to describe it. Perhaps she'd need to devote an entire day just to the food; 'Taco Tuesday' had a nice ring to it.\n\n"What are you doing, Zesh?" a voice called out from the stairs drunkenly. It was Zarishat Zeirutid. "Still trying to be self-righteous even now?"\n\nZeshmunazash sighed, sounding almost genuinely annoyed. "You're drunk, Zari. Go back to sleep."\n\n"Look at you, always being so perfect," she continued bitterly, waving a bottle around with a hoof. "It's always about you, you, you, all the time, isn't it?"\n\n"You might be able to do more if you didn't always get yourself into trouble!"\n\nAs the argument heated up, Sonata slowly grabbed one last taco before quietly making her way out of the farm and away from the dispute. Even she knew better than to stay around for family matters.\n\nBesides, she got what was important anyway."

But for once, it was not the music causing the fighting.\n\nBreezy Skies' claws glided over the piano keys as he continued playing the piece he composed. It wasn't that he couldn't hear the fighting out his window; the screaming, the cries of anger. But what could he do about it? He was just a musician; he was lucky enough to avoid becoming like them in the first place. Him and his talented friends got to stay inside these specially designed and guarded places to practice their craft, more like pets to a master than any sort of actual social class. Sometimes one of them got called to personally play for one of the sirens - the blue one, who had got them all together in the first place.\n\nSome considered it a rare honor. Others considered it a nightmare.\n\nPersonally, Breezy didn't know what to think about it. He did see how unfair it was, how everyone else suffered while he remained untouched. He had no delusions on who he now technically served. But shouldn't he just be grateful that he didn't join them? It was a miracle itself that he was here and not out there.\n\nSighing, he picked up his sheet music and put it on his desk. It would be a good piece in case he got called to play. After all, the siren seemed to find amusement in them being named after her, even if it had gotten it's name during her banishment."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.17.d:0 "The argument started like many others among the sirens; in the throne room, about the most trivial of things.\n\n"Honestly, the title is a bit much, don't you think?" Adagio said, mostly to herself as she floated in midair, the only other creature in the room being the enthralled Queen Novo. "I mean really, this whole 'monarchy' thing was never meant to last. Your use has come to an end, and well, we simply don't need you anymore-"\n\nThe door slammed open, and Aria came flying in. "Don't even think about it, Adagio," she said, almost in a warning tone.\n\n"Ugh, must you do this every time?" The siren turned to meet her approaching partner, already annoyed. "This island is ours. The Princess's games are over. All this 'Queen' is doing is taking away from our spotlight with a fake title and an illusion of power."\n\nNovo continued looking on blankly as Aria fired back. "So we're just going to give up the best leverage we have on these hippogriffs? And what if something like Skystar happens again? This will cause us nothing but possible trouble."\n\n"It won't happen again." Adagio pointed a hoof to accentuate her words. "All you do is keep doubting our own music, our own spell, when its never failed us before. Why don't you try focusing on what actually matters?"\n\n"I am, Adagio. And all I'm seeing is a petty decision because you can't stand someone else getting praise."\n\nThe two sirens stared each other down, both folding their hooves.

The blue one looked a bit sheepish; the guilt was already written all over her face. "Surprise?" she asked.\n\nBoth of the other two were fuming. "Sonata, you can't just go and steal guns and then have them disappear," Aria said, voice three notches more annoyed than her usual. "We need those, and they're mine to use. Where did you even send them to?!"\n\n"Tobuck?"\n\nBoth Adagio and Aria looked incredulous, causing Sonata to continue. "I mean, that Wallnut guy seems alright, and we need to defeat Chiropterra sometime anyway, right? If he's going to fight them now, we can at least help him out."\n\nAdagio facehoofed. "Sonata," she replied, "we still need to fight Tobuck too."\n\n"Well yeah, but Wallnut is much more fun than everyone else!"\n\nThere was no response.

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.19.d:0 "It wasn't often that you could persuade Wallnut Drive to stay up late without a good party, but Soft Blot - his secretary in whom he placed great trust - had insisted that he take a trip down to the ports for this. He shivered and flexed his wings in the night air, but managed a steady trot down to the dock in which the 'strange visitors' had apparently weighed anchor. It was almost silent, save for the sounds of boxes being hauled out of the ship which he could now see. It seemed to be a trawler, or some other vessel that was far from military in nature; a good choice for whatever their discrete mission here was supposed to be.\n\nOne of the sailors, upon noticing the presence of the thestral, marched over in a particularly unnerving fashion. "Wallnut Drive?"\n\n"Uh... Yeah, that'd be me. You aright there? Lookin' a little stiff." He managed in response, utterly confused by the seemingly robotic behaviour of the curious hippogriff.\n\n"Good. We have a message for Wallnut Drive." The creature returned, not emoting at all as it held out a note in its claw. "Read, please."\n\nWell, he wasn't going to say no to that.\n\n"Dear Wallnut,\n\nI hope this stuff helps out against Chiropterra, Aria told me it's really important for fighting wars. When I heard that they had attacked you and wanted to end your fun parties, I knew I had to help somehow! From what I hear those Chiropterrans are no fun at all, always so serious. Oh, but don't tell Adagio or Aria about this, they'll totally get really mad at me if they find out. Good luck, and can't wait to see you again when we get to sing in Tobuck!\n\nYour bestest friend, Sonata"\n\nOf course, he had a litany of questions upon reading this message ranging from who any of these individuals were and why these assumedly hippogriffian donors were quietly sending them materiel. But, as he looked up from the piece of paper, Wallnut realised that the messenger was already back to unloading more boxes of weaponry. The only thing he knew for certain was that this Sonata character was clearly well intentioned and that this much-appreciated shipment should be kept quiet."

They had fell not by heroes or by spells, but by armies, plain and simple. The world had advanced without them, and they could not catch up in time.\n\n"So what do we do?" Sonata asked. "We can't stay here, right?"\n\n"No, we can't." Adagio agreed. "We are not getting banished again, or whatever they may have planned for us. It's time to leave."\n\nAria rolled her eyes. "Go where, Adagio? There's not exactly another nation we can just take over and try again with."\n\n"I didn't mean that! We'll retreat back under the waters, plan our next move. We have an eternity to take over this world; we can afford to be patient a little longer. But for now..." It was obvious that the siren was loath to admit it, but she finished her sentence all the same. "...we have to give up."\n\n"And what about the hippogriffs? About what we have left?"\n\nBoth other sirens shrugged at Sonata's question. "I'm sure Moonfeather will take over enough to make peace eventually," Aria remarked.

There was no fights, there was no objections, no real arguments. Just her getting her way.\n\nHowever, despite Adagio wishing such a situation many times before, she never expected to be alone again, without Aria and Sonata. They had always faced things together, as a team. Aria had dealt with the dirty work, and Sonata had... well, she just did whatever Adagio didn't personally have time for, which had been a lot. Adagio never doubted her ability to do things herself, but still... she missed them.\n\nBut now, it was up to her. The notes Aria had left behind were confusing, to say the least. A complete mess if you wanted to be harsh. And when Adagio had finally gotten it all together, it was all so inefficient. There was so much she had done herself, so much wasted resources that she was leaving to 'stabilize' things. Didn't she ever get how sirens were supposed to do things? How they always had?\n\nIt didn't matter now. The orders had already been sent out, simple enough for the garrisons to understand. There were two commands; keep the other mortals in line, and ensure the song was spread.

Should she go after them and try to bring them back? Force them to come back? Adagio could never apologize or concede; she was right, and they were wrong. They had always been blind. But...\n\nAdagio could never quite figure out where that trail of thought led her. Had she gone soft already? Was it the silence in the halls missing Sonata's infuriating voice, or the lack of interruptions by Aria for more pointless arguments? The world was supposed to be their's to share, not just her's. Adagio had protected them, taught them everything she knew, and despite their differences... she cared about them.\n\nHer choice had already been made; the two would be left alone. She couldn't force them back, assuming she could even find the two in the first place. If they ever finally understood, there would always be a place for them, by Adagio's side. Until that day came however, and she knew it likely wouldn't be for a long time, she would have to carry on alone. To complete the task given to them by right, with or without her partners. She was now the only one left who could bring what this world was supposed to have, and if that was the way it had to be...\n\n...then she'd stop at nothing to finish what they started."

But did they really deserve that honor? After all that mortals had done to sirens, shunning and banishing them, allowing them a glimpse of her power seemed too good for them. She was sorely tempted to just do away with the whole system, to shatter the gems and bring their magic back to herself.\n\nThe other two certainly would have been against it. The Beacons were one of the few things she and Aria had agreed on as a good idea. They could still certainly serve a use in keeping the population angry, ready to kill in Adagio's name.

There was no higher power in the world, at least not for her. The alicorns those ponies revered were far younger and naive than she was. The pantheon the griffons had created was nothing more than symbols for them to believe in, and had no real power in the real world. There were even a few with the audacity to consider their leaders divine after their deaths, which was just absurd. If they were gods, then why would they be dead?\n\nFor years after the banishment, Adagio had hated all the religion. But it had also reminded her of something. Back in ancient times, many ponies had considered sirens deities in their own right as well. This idea lived on, with a few fringe movements appearing during the conquests praising all three of them in similar fashion. But it wasn't until Aria and Sonata had left her, disappeared back to the waters that it had exploded in popularity, focusing solely on Adagio and becoming widespread enough for her to take notice once more.\n\nAnd yet she felt no disdain this time. In fact, it almost felt right, like it should have been how things were the whole time. She was a siren, wasn't she? Why shouldn't she be regarded as a deity among mortals? She was immortal, she had power, and she certainly deserved all the reverence. Religion was just a tool, but were tools not meant to be used?\n\nAdagio could already imagine it. Grand temples built in her name. Statues, art, works on a scale never seen before made in an attempt to capture her glory. Prayers in her name, cults devoted to her power, creatures spending their lives serving her alone. It could be a world completely and utterly for her.\n\nBut there something still bitter left with the idea. For a siren to be adored from the spell, they had to be present. And ever since Aria and Sonata left, they had been all but forgotten by all but Adagio. The idea of them being lost to time again like they all had, consigned to dusty history books and faint memories... could she really take the attention and leave them behind, even if it was only for how long they were gone?"

Must have been the most hated bird in all of Aris for a while.\n\nThings improved, of course. The money started rolling in, not that those sirens cared much about that. I got my own little group together, free from their magic, and life was smooth. The purple one was too smart for her own good, and the blue one was just plain stupid, but the yellow one... Adagio, she was my main benefactor. The new queen of the mountain, if you will.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when, after we take Equestria of all places, I find one day that she's the only one of those three left. Other two just packed up and bailed, from what I heard. So now Adagio, she's got to rely on me even more for dealing with everything she doesn't want to. And with the other two no longer constantly looking into my business... well, you could say the sky's once again the limit, my friend!\n\nI would never turn traitor, of course. She may be alone now but she's no fool either. I have no intention of risking this cushy new job I got as her Constant, or whatever she called it. But there's always cracks in the system; I know that better than any other bird in the business. There's always profit to be made, and let me tell you, when I finally get to retire from this job and someone else takes my place.. I'll be living it up better than any hippogriff could dream of!"

 hippogriff_abyss_adagio.7.d:0 "Cloudy Skies was exhausted. Ever since the Siren's Constant began 'revising' labor laws the workday had been getting longer and longer. Nearly 14 hours had passed before his boss blew the whistle today, but he was finally done, and he was ready for some well-deserved rest and relaxation.\n\nJust after sunset Cloudy traveled to a secluded meadow outside of town. When he found a suitable spot he laid down on his back, stretched out his wings, and looked up at the stars. He'd seen the night sky countless times before, but it always managed to take his breath away. The beauty of the cosmos, distant stars twinkling against an inky black void, it was magnificent. For the first time in a long time he almost felt happy.\n\nYet there was still something missing. Before the war Cloudy always had company when he went stargazing. He and his friends would find the constellations they'd learned in school, swap stories, and just enjoy each others' company. Now, being here by himself, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.\n\nCloudy heard a rustling noise and sat up. Somepony was coming this way. What could they be doing out here at this late hour? A fellow stargazer, perhaps? He smiled at the thought. As the stranger approached he prepared to greet them and... wait, was that a horn?\n\n"What do you think YOU'RE doing here!?" Cloudy said with a scowl.\nThe unicorn took a step back. "That's none of your business!"\n"This meadow is for pegasi only! You horn heads have plenty of other spots, so get lost!"\n\n"And what if I don't?" the unicorn sneered, "Are you going to beat me up, you feathered brute!?"\n"Argh! Arrogant snobs like you have no right to call me that!"\n\nAfter over an hour of arguing the two parted ways. Cloudy was so upset he felt sick. Not only had the fight taken up all his stargazing time, he still hadn't found anyone to share the night sky with."

 hippogriff_abyss_adagio.8.d:0 "The paychecks for service workers were late this month, to nopony's surprise. Ever since Moonfeather and his collaborators took control of Equestria's economy the ponies regularly got paid late, if they got paid at all.\n\nNow short on cash, Olive Green looked through her attic for things to pawn. She didn't find anything valuable, but under a pile of garbage she found something interesting: an old Hearth's Warming Eve card that said, "What's your Hearth's Warming Wish?"\n\nOlive was taken aback by the question. She remembered life before the siren invasion, of course, but it increasingly felt unreal. Her memories of celebrating Hearth's Warming as a filly, spending nice summer days with her friends, and going on vacations with family were all hazy. She couldn't really imagine herself doing any of those things ever again. So if she had a wish today, what would she wish for?\n\nMaybe she'd wish for her parents to stop arguing so much? No, that would be impossible. Her dad's temper used to be infamous, but now her mom's was just as bad. When they weren't fighting about money it was his attitude, or her fashion sense, or his bad breath. Olive could never stop them, or herself, from arguing with everypony they met.\n\nPerhaps she could wish for more days off, or better pay? No, neither one would be worth it. More time off would just give everyone more time to argue, and getting more money would only make her coworkers more jealous and hostile.\n\nIt seemed like there was nothing Olive could wish for, but then it hit her. She remembered with perfect clarity the day the golden siren came to town.\n\nThe whole city had shut down for Adagio's arrival. Everypony took a break from arguing and hatred to line the streets and look upon their magnificent ruler. Olive remembered standing beside her parents when the siren passed by, feeling complete as the beautiful song washed over them like a flood.\n\nIf Olive had one wish, she'd wish for Adagio to come back and sing for everyone again!"

Some might call it wasteful; Adagio called it necessary. Her performances deserved only the very best, after all. To have anything else was an insult to her talent.\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers as she made her way onto the stage, thousands upon thousands of ponies, hippogriffs, zebras and everything in between showing their adoration with pinpoint pupils from the effects of her spell. It was hard, controlling this many creatures to such a degree for this alongside everything else, but it was worth it. Everything was worth it. This was what she was meant to do.\n\nAnd when silence came at her demand, Adagio began to sing.\n\nShe sang like she never had before. The sound, with all its beauty and grace, traveled across the entire audience with its enthralling and magical nature. A performance like no other, music incomparable. It filled Adagio with pride as she felt all the praise, all the attention resting solely on her. Even the fact that Aria and Sonata were missing temporarily disappeared from her mind, replaced with nothing but the glory of the moment. She was finally the star of the show.\n\nAnd as she finished and all the creatures cheered for her performance, for their master, for her... for perhaps just a moment, she felt satisfied. All was right with the world. This was just how things were supposed to be.\n\nIt was how it would always be."

A tale brought to a close, a finale to a grand performance, these were the things she lived for. After all, no one liked anything left unfinished.\n\nThis ending, though, was one she was particularly excited for.\n\nThe beginning of this story was long ago. Before Adagio's time, even. She was not the first siren, after all. But she could still remember a time before history, where sirens ruled the seas and ponies found their song to be a simple fact of life. Not one they enjoyed, perhaps, but still a fact all the same. She had reveled in knowing her place as an apex predator, someone whose voice would be listened to.\n\nAnd then it all came tumbling down. In what was like the blink of an eye, they were all gone. The only ones Adagio had left were Aria, who had barely seen the last remnants of siren rule, and Sonata, who was too young to remember it at all. She had sworn to one day set things right, to honor all those lost by bringing the world once again to the beginning, to balance. She kept the other two close, taught them how to be sirens despite their learned eccentricities.\n\nThe banishment came, and the banishment was avenged. They had come back, as fate willed, and taught the price of seeking to avert destiny. And then the other two were gone. They had left her, abandoned her for the deep, willing to be forgotten just to get away.\n\nShe hated it. Not them, of course. She could never bring herself to truly hate Aria or Sonata; they were the only sirens she had left. It was the mortals' fault, driving the two away from her. They had done something, changed the world to ruin their trio, just to spite Adagio's victory. They deserved nothing.\n\nBut nothing was not what they would get. They would learn the price of what they did. Every creature on this pathetic planet would, and they would feel the same rage, pain and suffering Adagio did. To lose everything. It wasn't just her destiny, this was personal.\n\nThe world wanted to serve, and Adagio was all to willing to give it what it wanted. It was time to finish things, once and for all."

 hippogriff_abyss_aria.1.d:0 "Aria had a complicated relationship with magic.\n\nShe wasn't against it, despite whatever Adagio might have said. She enjoyed singing as much as any siren, and found amusement whenever some mortal would try to even come close to replicating it. Magic was an incredibly useful tool, and it had paved the road to everything they had done to this point.\n\nBut all tools break someday, and Aria did not want to be the one caught when her's did.\n\nRight now, as Aria knew all too well, the entire country rested on one thing. There were guards posted across her vast holdings, but they were only there to keep at least some semblance of order among a population who willingly served. If there was ever any real attempt to overthrow them, they would fold like a house of cards. Aria knew that from the start, and it was finally time she did something about it.\n\nIt would take a lot. With just how far Sirenalia spread, keeping order across multiple continents was no easy task. But if Aria had to find every last creature in this world with enough immorality to serve her willingly to secure the occupation, then that's what she'd do. There was no price too high for that.\n\nNot even her fellow sirens."

The game was simple; there were those who could bring change, and those who sought the ability to bring change. How they sought it took many forms, from assassination, to bribery, and even that absurd system of 'democracy' that creatures had thought up.\n\nOf course, those who wanted her fall would not use such non-violent tactics.\n\nAria had hated her banishment. So much time in the nothingness, it was horrible. The worst experience she had ever been subjected to by far. But even that paled in comparison to the final end that many faced - death itself. Sirens were immortal, but that didn't mean they couldn't die. That, so many of her own kind had learned firsthoof.\n\nIt terrified her. A sort of eternal banishment, from which there was no return. No matter what Aria did, how thorough she was, it would never matter if just one creature took any opportunity to take her life. Everything would come crumbling down.\n\nSo the only way to avert that, of course, was to never let such an opportunity come. Aria knew she was being paranoid. There would be consequences for giving into it, too. When you trust no one, no one trusts you either. From every other point of view, falling to her urges fueled by fear could start a downward spiral.\n\nBut to Aria, the shadows were already cutting deeper, creatures already looking at her for any chance to take her place.

After all, she had to make up for the other two's lack of vision, since they certainly weren't going to do it. Neither could think more than one step ahead, never saw things in the long term over what they wanted now. They preferred the quick and easy over the difficult and long term.\n\nFor Equestria, however, things were different. It wouldn't do to lose such a prize, of course. It was her home, and the ponies in it rightfully hers. It had countless creatures to feed off of, to give her more magic than ever before. They wouldn't like it, but Aria agreed with Adagio in their opinions being irrelevant. Their lives were meaningless, though their purpose was not.\n\nStill, weighing everything, there were benefits to keeping them at least slightly placated. Less will to fight meant less trouble to deal with overseas. Fires never helped anyone, and certainly not her. Scaling magic back would make her weaker, yes, but such a token instance of 'goodwill', or whatever they referred to it as could get a few more ponies in line. And besides, if she wanted to do away with this magic-reliance nonsense, it would be an important first step in that direction..."

He looked ridiculous jumping at shadows, but he couldn't help it. Nothing in basic training had prepared him for fighting urban guerrillas.\n\nThe resistance had started out small. Ponies who escaped the siren's song began by organizing protests and strikes. When the city's small garrison proved unable to stop them they grew bolder. Before long they were procuring weapons and creating defense committees.\n\nNow things were spiraling out of control. Soldiers didn't dare enter the city center at night, and the rebels seemed poised to breach containment. With the garrison short on both guns and creatures, green recruits like Tight Squeeze found themselves on guard duty alone.\n\nTight heard hoofsteps behind him and started to panic. He turned around and saw a unicorn mare approaching. The stranger was in uniform but appeared to be unarmed.\n\nWithout even looking at Tight she said, "You're relieved, soldier." and kept on walking.\n\nTight was about to warn her it was suicide to go further, but then he noticed the blood red gem hanging from her neck: a beacon. He'd heard the stories, but he'd never seen one up close. They were an elite force, deployed only in the most serious situations.\n\nAs the unicorn passed out of sight she began to sing. Her song was echoed by a few other beacons scattered across town. Their powerful voices and glowing red gems made them easy targets, but nopony fired a shot. It was only after they finished their song and withdrew that the shooting began. Resistance units turned on each other as bloody gunfights erupted throughout the city.\n\nBack at base, Tight breathed a sigh of relief. He might still have to fight, but only in mop-up operations.

There was remarkably little fanfare for something so consequential. When the door opened the officer read a brief proclamation:\n\n"On the authority of Aria, you are hereby ordered to return the piece of the Pearl of Transformation with which you have been entrusted."\n\nTerramar looked down at the shard hanging from his necklace. For most of Hippogriffia's history this pearl had been controlled exclusively by kings and queens. When his aunt Queen Novo broke it up and distributed it amongst the people it felt like a new era was dawning. He remembered how proud he felt to receive this piece, how much it meant to be able to see Aris or Seaquestria whenever he chose.\n\nNow the siren was taking that away. Hippogriffs and seaponies would only be able to use the pearl if Aria allowed it. Given her despotic tendencies and intense paranoia, that would probably never happen.\n\nHe wondered if this confiscation would matter in the grand scheme of things. The sirens had already taken his country, his friends, his aunt, his cousin and his sister from him. What did it matter if they took this too?\n\nBut it did matter. It mattered so much. Losing this shard meant losing half of the family he had left. He tried to think of something, anything else, but all he could imagine were the faces of his mother and father. One of them was a face he might never see again.\n\nTerramar was shaking uncontrollably, but he tried to hold his emotions in. He wouldn't give these goons the satisfaction of seeing him fall apart. Slowly and deliberately, he unlatched the necklace and held it out for them. His face was a mask of stone.\n\nWithout saying a word, the officer grabbed the shard and turned to leave.

They drilled straight into Moonfeather, observing his every move.\n\n"As a matter of fact, I did." Aria swam through the air closer to the hippogriff, seeing the fear in him and very much enjoying it. "I just needed to make sure we're on the same page. After all, I'm sure you didn't enjoy being kept out of the loop."\n\n"Well I, ahem, completely understand that some matters were not meant for me to hear of course, even if my only duty is to serve you-"\n\nShe held up a hoof to silence him while nodding her head. "Correct. I'm well aware of your little schemes that you had while I was distracted elsewhere. Am I going to need to do something about them?"\n\nMoonfeather sputtered, trying to find an out while Aria watched him passively. Finally, he caved in. "...No. I'll deal with it."\n\n"Good. And since Adagio's warning clearly didn't it reach you, I'll give you a refresher." Aria swam around Plumage, twirling uncomfortably close before glaring straight at him from the front. "Your life is mine. You live and die by my choice, and if you want the former I expect you to prove you deserve it. There won't be a next time for this.

"Are you saying I'll be the assistant of an assistant of a secretary? How does that work?"\nAzorbaal raised an eyebrow. Apparently this new hire was dumber than she looked.\n\n"Well, each region has its own administrative office, as does each province in a region, and each city or township in a province. The head of each office has secretaries that deal with different aspects of policy, and they have assistant secretaries to deal with more specific policy areas. The whole thing forms a vast bureaucratic matrix with a rigid chain of command, but the siren can intervene at any level if she so desires."\n\nCrystal broke into a huge grin.

Who wouldn't desire such power, such control? The life of every creature at her hooftips, their lives given meaning by her as cogs in her machine.

The rise of ideas such as morality was one of the more disappointing things Aria had seen after the banishment.\n\nAnd yet, this idea of the importance of patience was one that struck true. It was important not to rush into things before one was ready. It was true of many things, and control of the world was no exception. Sirenalia was not yet ready to continue its conquest. There were too many variables left unaccounted for, too many chances to be taken. But Aria had time, and resources. She could wait.\n\nSirenalia was a machine, and an extension of herself. It lived and died with her, it worked in perfect order, constantly improving itself to better serve. New weapons, new tools of peace, new instruments of order; it would stand above any other nation on the planet, a beacon of progress in the darkness of individualism.\n\nThe mortals would fall, that was certain.

Not even seaponies could survive the darkest parts of the Mareiana Trench, at least not without special equipment. Sirens were different of course, having magical protection to survive the pressure. Aria herself was in no danger there, and that it why it was perfect to put her new base of operations.\n\nIt was not going to be finished for a long time, yes. The costs were massive for the difficult site, and there had been more than a few accidents so far in construction that deep. But real progress was already being made, an unassailable fortress hidden to all those who Aria did not want.

Her future.\n\nIt would not go quietly into the night. Even with the months upon months of meticulous preparation, planning, fallbacks and contingencies, there was still sure to be chaos. But it would subside, in time. With a mix of bribes, threats and the work of Plumage who was finally pulling his weight for once, Sirenalia would not collapse. It would only come out stronger.\n\nHer personal power would suffer, it was true. Without all that strife across continents to feed off of, her magical ability would fall dramatically. But mortals needed no encouragement to fight; they all too easily hated each other when given the slightest reason. She could simply passively feed off the negativity, along with whenever the Beacons needed to deal with a few... issues.\n\nAnd so, the die was cast. Looking out over Mount Aris from the palace she and the other two had stormed so long ago, Aria took one final look over a sleeping, a passive, a calm city. The quiet of the night was gentle, almost begging to remain, to turn back and keep things the way they were, the way Adagio said they should be.\n\nBut all dreams must come to an end.\n\nThe spell broke, and the fires rose."

"Well, maybe not no idea, but if you had advice I would totally listen to it!"\n\n"...Better than nothing, I guess. Do you know why we and Adagio stuck together this whole time?"\n\nSonata blinked, trying her best to think of an actual answer. "Because she liked being mean?" she tried, tone completely sincere.\n\n"No." Aria sighed, tempted to facehoof. "It's because we could trust each other. If you're serious about ending the spell, both of us are going to need other people that we know won't try and kill us in ten seconds." She turned to face her partner. "Got any ideas?"\n\nFinally, a question Sonata actually knew the answer to. The siren looked practically excited to answer, but restrained herself at the last second. "I know a few, yeah..." she started, "but you might not like them..."\n\n"Doesn't matter. If they somehow trust you, that's enough. I'm just here to make sure the country doesn't collapse in less than a minute with you in charge. Can you go out and find them?" Sonata nodded. "Good. I don't think I'll be much help there, so I'll stay and keep things running while you're gone. Now get out of here, we aren't going to do this by wasting time."\n\nThe siren nodded once more before hurrying out of the room, clearly excited by the prospect. "And good luck," Aria muttered under her breath, quiet enough for her not to hear."

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.2.d:0 "The first stop was obvious. It would have to be at the beginning. The place where it all began, when Sonata's eyes finally began to open past what she wanted to see. When she met the one zebra that she could treat not as a subject, but as a friend.\n\nZamni had gotten older since they first met. No longer was he the small prince that he once was, scared and impatient. Now he looked more like a true king, complete with his own crown, one of the birthday gifts Sonata had given him. He wasn't wearing it as Sonata came into the room; instead it was on the table, the monarch studying it intently. He didn't even seem to notice her come in.\n\n"What are you looking at, Zamni?" she asked, peering over his shoulder. "Why aren't you wearing your crown?"\n\nHe seemed to shake himself out of his stupor, turning to Sonata and giving a small smile. "Oh, nothing. What are you doing here, Sonata?"\n\n"Oh, uh... I need your help. It's about Zumidia."\n\n"Well, there's not exactly much I can do about that from the palace, but I'll help however I can." Zamni got off the chair and put his crown back on, turning back and giving a mock bow. "How may I be of service?"\n\nSonata hesitated. She could still see it, in his eyes. That childhood innocence, remaining even after years of being held prisoner in his own home, built off their friendship. It was the same innocence Adagio must have seen in her. She still had the chance to back out, to keep him sheltered away, to keep his friendship.\n\nBut that wouldn't be what he would want. And she needed him now, more than ever.\n\nSonata turned away, hanging her head low. "Zamni, there's something I need to show you. Outside."\n\nZamni blinked."

He always thought he'd be excited one day to go out and see the wider kingdom of which he technically ruled, but this was nothing like what he expected.\n\nHis people were not his own. Sure, they were his subjects in technicality, but they certainly weren't listening to him. They argued and fought, but heeded Sonata's every command. Zamni looked up to the siren, both confused and hurt. "What happened here, Sonata?"\n\n"This is what our music does, Zamni. This is what we do. We get our magic from people fighting, so... we make people fight. We control them so they do whatever we want."\n\nZamni didn't answer. He just remained silent, looking away from his friend. "I know you probably hate me now. If you want to leave, I won't stop you. I just thought you should know the truth, that I'm-"\n\nSonata froze when the zebra turned around and suddenly hugged her tail. "Sonata, you've been my closest friend for years now," he said, his voice soft. "I'm not going to just leave you. And besides, didn't you say you wanted to change things?" When she nodded back, he gave a small smile. "Then we'll do it together."\n\n"I..." Sonata lowered herself down to Zamni's level before wrapping her own hoof around him. "Thank you."\n\n"Don't worry about it. Besides, at least you gave me more attention than the hippogriffs ever did. It was pretty obvious they were never going to let us rule ourselves again, at least not without consequences." He frowned. "Makes me wonder if Skystar ever really cared about me at all... but here? Here I can finally make a real difference, for more than just my people."\n\n"We're in this together, Sonata, until the end.""

Adagio had expressed forbidden her from seeing Somnambula again, and she had been far too busy afterwards to do so anyway.\n\nOf course, things had changed, and now she was the one thing Sonata needed.\n\nThe pegasus looked up from her manacles as Sonata had the enthralled guards open the door, moving into the room they had first met in all that time ago. "I was beginning to think you had forgotten about me," she said, sitting down. "It's been a while."\n\n"I need your help."\n\nThe guards moved to unlock the chains binding Somnambula, the iron clattering against the ground as they fell. "And what would you need me for?" the pony asked, no ill intent behind her question.\n\n"I want to change things. I don't want to keep forcing people to do whatever I want. But I can't do it by myself. You said you put your hope in me, and now I need you to help me make that real."\n\nSomnambula nodded. "I can not lead you to change. You must find your own path yourself should you wish to see this through. But I can help guide you along that path however I can."\n\nThe siren blinked. "So is that a yes?" When the pegasus nodded, she smiled. "Great! I'm sure Aria will totally be on board with bringing you to help!"\n\n"You did not tell her you were visiting me?""

All except Starswirl of course, with Stygian taking his place. Somnambula had called them to Aris, where she was staying since her release. Being directly under the watchful eye of the two sirens and their thralls did not make the atmosphere any lighter, but at least they remained outside the room, blank and unmoving.\n\n"Are we sure this is the right thing to do?" Rockhoof asked, finally saying the question everyone was too reluctant to speak. "These creatures, we know what they are like. How can we trust them now?"\n\n"We do not have a choice," Stygian replied, deep in thought. "When we faced the sirens millennia ago, they merely had the strength of my village for their magic, and even then we had difficulty in banishing them. Now they have millions, nay, tens of millions, and modern technology on their side. We could not possibly win a fight against them."\n\nFlash Magnus stood up, clearly unsatisfied with Stygian. "So we just sit here and do nothing?" he challenged, putting a hoof on the table. "Equestria is gone, and all we're going to do is watch? If Somnambula is right, they're going to break their spell soon, and then we can go and-"\n\n"No." Every Pillar turned to look at the Maregyptian pegasus, who has spoken with such authority that even Flash had fallen silent. "If we betray Sonata's trust, all that does is prove them right about the world. She has given us a chance, and all we can do is hope that she will do the right thing."\n\nNo one looked her in the eyes as she slowly put her own hoof on the table.\n\n"It is all we can do.""

"They'd be perfect!"\n\nAria's face sank deeper into annoyance, rubbing her forehead with a hoof before bothering to respond. "First, no they aren't," she objected, trying to speak slowly so Sonata would understand. "And second, we can't even reach them if we wanted to. The changelings aren't going to just give up the Element Bearers, even if they'd be better off doing so."\n\nSonata paused for a moment, giving at least a semblance of deep contemplation. Aria didn't like it very much; it didn't suit her very well. She preferred it when Sonata looked as clueless as she was. "But what if we-"\n\n"The only way we are getting close to them is through an all-out war," Aria cut off flatly. "We could win it, obviously, but it would be long and take a lot of what we have. It doesn't help that you're currently trying to dismantle the system we have, so do you really want to do that?"\n\nThe blue siren fell back into silence. "...No," she finally responded, quietly.\n\n"That's what I thought. I've already found the best of what we have here in Aris; they'll be here to deal with what you can't. I'll have them ready for you to meet within the week.""
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.6.d2:0 ""This is a terrible idea."\n\n"What do you mean, Aria?" Sonata was swimming in the air, excitement clear on her face at what she was about to do. "They're perfect for what we're trying to do! Plus, you did say we needed important people who would work with us, right?"\n\nThe siren buried her feelings of deep frustration before answering, trying desperately to keep her voice level. "I did say that, yeah, but this is not what I meant. There is absolutely no way that the Element Bearers are going to agree to work with us. Not after everything we've done to them."\n\n"But we're gonna be better now! They're all about helping people be better, right? If we just say we're sorry, they'll totally forgive us!"\n\nAria blinked, not quite sure how to process what Sonata had just said. "We literally enslaved Equestria and took their families because we couldn't put them under our spell," she said flatly. "One of Twilight's closest friends is literally right there."\n\nSonata looked over at Sunset Shimmer, who was staring blankly ahead of her, before turning back with an awkward expression. "That's all in the past, right? I'll let her go back with Twilight, and we can just start over! We can still be friends!"\n\n"If you say so," she finally answered, resigned. "Just be careful, and don't say I didn't warn you if it doesn't work out."\n\nSonata scoffed. "Of course it's gonna work out. Trust me.""
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.6.d3:0 ""Well, that's everyone!"\n\nAria stared at Sonata, mostly out of disbelief. "Please tell me you're not serious," she said, exasperated. "Do you really not know anyone other than a minor king and an untrustworthy Maregyptian that could possibly be of use?"\n\nThe blue siren thought for a moment, looking up towards the ceiling. "...Nope!" she finally answered, still her cheery self. "I mean, I know a lot of creatures, but ones I can trust? That's a lot harder!"\n\n"Well... yeah." For once, Aria couldn't argue with that point. "Guess I'll have to find the rest, as usual. Fortunately, I was prepared for something like this."\n\nSonata blinked, confused at what Aria was saying. "Wait... did you know I wanted to get rid of that already? Why didn't you say anything earlier?" She crossed her hooves, annoyed. "We could have done this, like, way earlier!"\n\n"No, I did not know you were going to do this. I just knew that we would need something in case our magic failed. I'll have a group of people for you to meet in a week or two." Aria smirked, and Sonata knew something horrible was coming. "I'm sure you'll have plenty of fun at the meetings."\n\n"...They're gonna be boring, aren't they."\n\n"Yes. Have fun.""

If any of her new "advisors" noticed or were offended, they didn't show it. There was likely good reason for that too; Sonata didn't know what Aria had done to get these various creatures in a room working willingly for her. And thinking on it further, she probably didn't want to know.\n\n"...heavy burden on the economy, but expected benefits from the increased expenditures more than make up for the initial investments. Specifically, investments in..."\n\nThe siren still remembered what Aria had said when she had brought all the creatures here.

Sometimes the answers she had were even good ones!\n\n"...keeping these key figures alive and cooperative will be vital to the continued operation of these regions for the benefit of Sirenalia, so to that end we have already secured key assets involved in..."\n\nAnd besides, they were so boring to listen to!

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.8.d1:0 "The second meeting between Sonata and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony looked much like the first. Enthralled ponies surrounded them, standing at attention and awaiting orders. Sonata wasn't stupid; she knew that it was still possible for something to go terribly wrong. She hoped that they wouldn't be needed, though, especially since it would prove Aria completely right.\n\nSonata didn't like when Aria was right and she was wrong.\n\n"Let me get this straight," Rainbow Dash said, pointing a hoof at the siren. "You want our help because you're going to end your whole 'mind control' thing, and ponies don't like you enough to do it safely?"\n\n"Well, yeah!" Sonata responded, trying to keep her voice upbeat and friendly. "So, you're totally gonna help me, right?"\n\nApplejack shook her head. "Ain't no way in Celestia we're helping you! You took our families, our friends away from us. You think you can just make that go away by saying sorry?"\n\nThe siren looked towards the recently freed Sunset, who was trembling behind Twilight and unable to look her in the eyes. "I... we're trying to be better!" she answered desperately, attempting to find any reason for them to stay.\n\n"If you wanted to be better, you would leave Equestria and never come back. Haven't you done enough to us?" Twilight's words stung harder than any wound, Sonata's eyes not leaving the ground. "Come on girls, let's go home."\n\nThe seven ponies trotted away, the enthralled guards paying them no mind as they passed. Sonata was able to keep herself together until she thought the Element Bearers were far enough away not to notice. Only then did she begin to cry, tears falling as she lay on the grassy plain surrounded by creatures, yet completely alone.\n\nAnd only Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy bothered to look back."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.8.d2:0 "It was not meant to be five.\n\nThere was no one there who did not feel the absence of Princess Twilight Sparkle, save perhaps the enthralled guards who did not think much at all. She should have been here, standing with her friends defiantly against Sonata, at least from what she would imagine. Instead, she was far away from here, and the rest of the Element Bearers were left looking downcast, troubled and alone. It didn't suit them very well; Sonata almost wished they still had the spirit to argue with her.\n\n"What do you want?" Applejack asked the siren, barely able to conjure any fire in her voice. Not the greatest start, but not completely horrible.\n\n"Look, I know we did a lot of bad things. And Twilight not being here sucks, but-"\n\n"Don't say her name!" Rainbow Dash snapped, causing Sonata to blink and float back a little. "You don't care about her! You don't care about any of us! You didn't let us see Twilight because you were nice, you did it because you wanted to hurt us! Because that's all you know how to do!"\n\nThe pegasi's words cut deeper than any knife could, forcing Sonata to look at the ground instead of the ponies she was trying to convince. "I know that Adagi- that we hurt you," she started, trying to keep her voice steady. "But being mad at each other isn't going to solve any problems. It never has and believe me, I would know. But if you could trust me, for just one time, we might be able to make things better... for everyone."\n\n"And how could you make things better?" Rarity asked, unconvinced.\n\n"I can explain everything, if you follow me back to Aris." Sonata looked up at each of them, eyes pleading for them to agree. "Please."\n\nThe ponies all looked at each other, then at the empty space were Twilight would be. Perhaps they were thinking of what she would have done.\n\nBut what she would have done did not matter, for she was not there."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.8.d3:0 "Sonata had hated looking at Princess Twilight Sparkle the last time they had met. It wasn't from any ill intent towards the alicorn - quite the opposite, in fact. Seeing what the changelings had done to her, the wanton cruelty that resulted in her fragile state, it was horrible. Even Adagio, as sadistic as she was, had never intentionally pushed someone that far.\n\nOf course, their rule had not helped at all. Sonata could only imagine the stress and fear from knowing your family and friends were far away, at the mercy of who in all regards was your enemy. Was it any wonder that Twilight barely looked any better from when they had last met, still tired and frail? The siren's hopes were falling by the minute seeing the results of the changeling occupation... and what she had helped perpetuate.\n\n"Let me get this straight," Rainbow Dash said, pointing a hoof at the siren.

Working with Adagio on all of that, being too careless and not standing up earlier to the plight of others. She was the only one who could, but she had done it too late.\n\n"Stop laying around, Sonata. We have real things to do. Now that we've put your little project behind us, you and I can-"\n\nThe doors to the room they were in opened, and two ponies carefully trotted into the room. Aria growled, and Sonata watched as Fluttershy yelped and hid behind Pinkie Pie. "What are you two doing here?" she asked, getting off the floor.\n\n"We... um..." Fluttershy was too terrified to continue, causing Sonata to motion to Aria to knock it off. The latter rolled her eyes before flying out of the room through a different exit.\n\n"We came to help, duh!" Pinkie Pie said, somehow still maintaining an upbeat and cheery attitude despite everything. "I mean, we were all ready to leave you behind and everything, but then we looked back and saw you were all sad and that made us sad too!" Pinkie frowned. "And fighting each other doesn't help anypony, either. So, what do you want us to do?"\n\n"I, um..." Sonata pushed her feelings of gratitude out for a second to try and focus. "I don't know, I didn't plan ahead this far." A lightbulb went off in her head. "Oh, I know! Maybe you can talk to ponies in Equestria?"\n\n"What, you mean like throwing a party?"\n\nThe siren shrugged. "Whatever makes them less angry. You don't need to talk about how great we are, I mean enough people do that already. Just maybe stop them from burning everything down? Please?"\n\n"Um, Pinkie?" Fluttershy tried to say, "I think this might be a little difficult-"\n\n"And fun!" The pink pony bounced around, completely ignoring the pegasus.

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.9.d2:0 "The ponies were impatient. Sonata could tell from the looks on their faces that they would have rather been just about anywhere else if they could. She supposed it might have been the atmosphere, considering that generally other creatures weren't very comfortable having enthralled armed guards in the room with them. It must have been a non-siren thing, since she was perfectly fine with it.\n\n"So?" Rainbow Dash asked, proving Sonata's initial assumptions correct. "What's so important that you wanted us all the way here to explain?"\n\nOne chance, Sonata. Don't mess this up. "I want to try and fix Twilight Sparkle," she said, getting straight to the point. "She's not who she's supposed to be. We both know it's not right."\n\n"Oh, and the spell you put on everypony else is so much better?" Rarity responded, folding her hooves. "Why would you care so much about Twilight?"\n\nThe siren's face flashed with anger. "We don't change who people are!" she almost shouted, causing the unicorn to flinch. "It's still wrong, but it has never done something like... like that! And I can't do anything about it if all of you refuse to help! You're just proving Adagio right!"\n\nThe ponies looked at each other uncomfortably. "Listen, we don't want to make things worse for everypony, Sonata," Applejack said, finally using the siren's name. "We've just been through a lot with everything, and it's hard to trust anypony anymore."\n\n"But if you can bring back Twilight," Rarity continued, "then I suppose we can put aside our many differences for now. As long as you keep your word, we can keep ours."\n\nAnd there it was. Sonata gave a deep sigh of relief internally; not only was this going to make things way easier, but it also completely proved Aria wrong, which was arguably more important. "I don't want to promise anything," she warned, looking uncharacteristically serious, "but we'll try our best. I know you might never forgive us for everything we did, but I hope that we can move past it together."\n\nAnd everyone in the room nodded."

Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy were by her side, supporting the weakened alicorn in between glances at the two sirens. Sonata looked at Aria, who shrugged before flying away out the opposite end of the room. "What are you doing here?" the remaining siren asked the ponies.\n\nTwilight looked at Fluttershy, who nodded back at her. "I remembered seeing how honest you were when you were talking to us.

And besides, being mad at you..."\n\n"...isn't going to solve anyone's problems," Sonata finished.

Focus includes the entirety of the primary territories encompassing Sirenalia.\n\nZonicia: Comprised of the former nations of Warzena, Zumidia, and greater Colthage. Should we be in possession of all of these territories, and due to our strongest base of support being in Zumidia, initial suggestions are to allow the entire region autonomy united under the subject King Zamni. Success of said proposal is unknown.\n\nChiropterra: Remains extremely volatile even after subjugation. Requires a military council and intervention to maintain grip on territory. Highly unlikely for prolonged stability in region unless alternative measures are in place. Tobuck and Zarantia confirmed relatively stable, further issues unlikely.\n\nMaregypt: Long-term stability heavily reliant on continued cooperation of local hero Somnambula to keep peace. Further efforts not required as long as resistance kept in check. Aria Blaze has suggested further security around Somnambula, up to the approval of Sonata Dusk.\n\nEquestria: Overseas territory deemed impossible to feasibly integrate in any reasonable timeframe. Impact of the spell's end highly reliant on cooperation with local ponies. Final outcome extremely variable, results unknown.\n\nConclusion: Success of reorganization heavily reliant on outside sources and factors out of control. Advisors recommend a close eye on all situations, and emergency plans in case for worst-case scenarios following demagification."

How can any of them possibly change when you all make that impossible?"\n\nThe crowd had grown silent. "I'm not asking for your trust, or your loyalty. I know that's too much right now. What I'm asking for you, is a chance. Just give her - give us a chance before you decide what you want to do.""

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.12.d:0 "Chiropterra. Truly one of Sonata's least favorite places to be in, deal with, or generally think about for any sort of reason. The fact that she had to deal with it yet again was completely ruining what had started out as a pretty fun week, and she was determined to just get this over with for once.\n\nAnd luckily for her, Aria could not agree more.\n\n"You know, this feels familiar," Sonata commented as she swam through the hallways in Seaquestria along with her fellow siren. "It almost feels like yesterday that we were doing this with... with Adagio."\n\n"Focus," Aria reminded her. "The Chiropterrans will never take our rule well. The only method they understand is brute, unrelenting force. Even then, it would take one of their own to apply it effectively."\n\nBoth of them paused, looking at each other. Sonata kept more of a confused look on her face while Aria waited expectantly. "Wait..." the former finally began, "didn't you end up killing all of their leaders like years ago?"\n\n"Yes, but one of their descendants escaped. I tracked Lucent Eclipse to the middle of nowhere in Zarantia, and had someone keep an eye on him in case he ever tried anything. And by the way," she said, the faintest edges of a smirk beginning to form on Aria's muzzle, "you're welcome."\n\n"Can we... trust him?"\n\n"No," was the flat response. "But we can't trust anyone that comes out of Chiropterra. The best we can hope for is that he realizes that no one wins if Chiropterra burns itself to the ground. Unless of course you know someone better who can do the job?"\n\nSonata thought to herself for a moment. A Chiropterran who could rule the nation in their place, and who wouldn't betray them at the first opportunity. Did she know someone like that?"

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.13.d1:0 "The way they marched still put him off. Through that suddenly absent foggy sensation, Wallnut Drive still remembered the crew of that trawler which arrived in the dead of night; the one that he'd been sent by Sonata. At the time he hadn't known who she was, but he soon found out. Everyone that survived the Chiropterran invasion soon found out. After the mind control, the friends he'd lost and Sonata's dishonesty; a small part of him remembered how naive and kind that letter had made her seem, even now.\n\nThe enthralled guards that surrounded the thestral began to file off to the sides, leaving him alone and only a short distance away from the towering blue monster. "Before you say anything, I..." Sonata had to stop just after starting, doing her best to compose an apology that she knew wouldn't make things better. "I'm sorry. You fought so hard against the Chiropterrans and I helped you and then we..."\n\n"You burned everythin' down." He gave out quietly, returning silence to an already eerily quiet room.\n\nFor a moment Sonata simply stared down at him, unsure of what to say. "Well... um... I didn't want to but Adagi-" She cut herself off again, took a breath and started over. "I did, yes. I... We destroyed everything you built."\n\nWallnut Drive managed to meet her gaze, craning his neck to do so. "So why am I here? Ain't that enough?"\n\nAt first glance he seemed nothing like the thestral that she'd been told stories about. He was drab, almost lifeless in fact; not showing off even a shred of the bottomless energy and charisma that had made him famous as the 'Generalissimo', whatever that was. It didn't take Aria's presence for her to understand what they'd all done to him. And yet, despite everything, she could still see something behind his eyes that gave her hope.\n\n"I... need your help." She began slowly, doing her best to concentrate and smile ever-so-slightly. "You handled the Chiropterrans once so I thought you could do it again! It's... it's not not my best idea and... and you especially have no reason to trust me... um... y-you can go if you wa-"\n\n"A'right." he cut in with sudden, subtle vigour. "I ain't doin' much good for folks as it is anyway. I'll help."\n\nAlthough delighted by the response, Sonata tried her best to contain her excitement and her questions. "Really? That's fantastic! I... uh... Thanks!""
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.13.d2:0 "Sonata frowned. Usually, she considered herself pretty good at understanding situations, contrary to what many others thought of her. She didn't have much reason to try very often, since it was usually boring anyway. But none of this stuff was supposed to be rocket science, either. All of those advisors or whatever had said it was going to be simple.\n\nStill, this whole concept of a 'gross domestic product' or something was a bit difficult for her to wrap her head around...\n\nAria came into the room, Sonata enthusiastically taking the opportunity to put away the economics report. "Did you find him?" she asked, oblivious to the fact that Aria was looking far worse for wear than usual.\n\n"Yes," the purple siren responded, "despite his best efforts. Searching a massive desert for a single pony isn't the easiest thing in the world."\n\n"Well, did he agree? It sure would suck to have done all that effort for nothing!"\n\nAria's frown deepened. "Yes... but actually no. It's complicated."\n\nSonata finally joined her fellow siren in frowning. "I don't like complicated. What did he do?"\n\n"It's what he doesn't do. He'll work with us, but it's definitely not out of any willingness to. We can expect the bare minimum and nothing else. Which means..."\n\n"It means he's not very helpful at all, is he?" Sonata finished, looking somewhere between upset and downcast. "So what do we do?"\n\nAria shrugged. "We wait. Who knows, maybe we already did enough and the Chiropterrans will know their place. Or maybe everything will fall apart there anyway. After all, they are certainly determined when they have something driving them..."\n\nSonata blinked. Was Aria implying something?"

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.14.d:0 "Somnambula, at least in Maregypt, was what most would call a hero. A legend. A pony that the masses looked up to, that they aspired to be like, a figure larger than life that foals dreamed of meeting. But as a legend proven true, that also meant the shoes she was meant to full was larger than almost anypony else's. She was expected to play her role as a hero, a paragon of virtue and a symbol of hope.\n\nShe and Sonata were kindred spirits in that regard.\n\nSonata was expected to be the villain. She was supposed to be the mind-enslaving tyrant, who showed no mercy and should receive none. In a traditional narrative, Somnambula would have to rise up to bravely face down the tyrant, to inspire hope in the resistance and overthrow the evil sirens, to banish them back into the depths where they belonged.\n\nBut she didn't do that, and ponies would never understand her for it. They had suffered too much to be able to. And Somnambula understood that suffering, did not forget it when she spoke with the siren regularly. But holding that bitterness, that hatred only led down a road of darkness, like the one she had watched Stygian trot down while doing nothing. She would not make that same mistake again.\n\nTimes change. Ponies change. Sirens can change, too. Somnambula remembered a time long ago, when she was called from Maregypt to save Equestria from a great evil. She wondered what things would be like if they had tried talking to the sirens first instead of fighting. Could things have been different back then as well? Maybe so, but perhaps not. There was something underneath their pride and ego, something that Aria refused to speak about and that Sonata did not wish to think about. Somnambula didn't wish to think about it either. Instead, eyes had to be on the future.\n\nA guard walked into the room. "Somnambula, the ponies are waiting outside for you," he said.\n\nThe mare nodded and slowly got up from her meditation pose. No longer was it time to hope, or to think and plan.\n\nNow was the time to act."

Where'd you steal it all from?"\n"I didn't have to steal anything, it's our official government ration."\n\nRaspberry looked towards Melon and frowned. "We have a ration system?"\n"So, remember when Sonata came through town?"\n"How could I forget? We were stuck down here for almost a week!"\n"Yeah, well, apparently she held a public ceremony to receive petitions from the people, and now she's granting some of their requests. They've also started repairing the roads, and they say there's more to come."\n\n"Let me guess," Raspberry sighed, "Everypony's praising our great and benevolent siren for all this?"\n"Yep. It's basically the only thing they're talking about."\n"Well, duh! They've all heard the song, the only things they can do are argue and praise the sirens! Sonata could've spent the whole visit sucking her hoof and they'd still say she's the greatest creature in the universe."\n\nMelon scratched his chin. "So then why is she actually doing stuff?"\n"Huh?"\n"They all adore her no matter what, so why implement these reforms? Does she want to help us?"\n\n"Of course not!"

What had started as a protest was quickly becoming an open rebellion, with righteous rage animating the demonstrators.\n\nIn the center of the square Lens Flare shouted with all his might. For many moons he'd been living in a fog, his thoughts scrambled, always upset and constantly lashing out at others. Now his mind was clear, and he knew exactly where to focus his anger.\n\n"A 'Test Area' is what they're calling us!" Said a blue mare on a makeshift platform, "They think we're so grateful to be free of the spell that we'll obey them willingly! Well Baltimare, will we?"\n"NO!" Everypony yelled in unison.\n\nLens had no idea who this mare was, but it didn't matter. Her words rang true because they all had experienced the same pain. The monsters who had conquered their country, killed their friends and families, and stolen their minds had to be stopped!\n\nSuddenly there was commotion near the edge of the crowd. A platoon of hippogriff marines was sealing off the street. Zebra soldiers took positions on the opposite side of the square. Nopony knew if these creatures were enthralled, but that didn't matter either. They were minions of the sirens either way.\n\n"Don't let them control you again!" screamed the mare on the platform, "Show them we'll never be their slaves!"\n\nNeeding no further convincing, Lens picked up a brick and charged the nearest group of soldiers. Other ponies joined in, shouting and attacking with whatever they could find. The soldiers fired warning shots into the air and, when that didn't work, started lobbing tear gas canisters.\n\nScenes like this played out in test zones all across Sirenalia.

There was movement in the water; Sonata could have sworn she saw a seapony or two diving out and back into the depths.\n\n"There were more of us," Aria finally started, startling Sonata. "A long time ago, before me or you. Sirens were everywhere, spreading their own unique songs across the entire world. Adagio has a lot of nostalgia for that time."\n\n"Oh. What happened?"\n\n"They happened." Aria said the word 'they' with such malice behind it that it struck fear into even Sonata's heart. "They came, and they killed us all. They forced us beneath the waves, and even then we weren't safe. You were the last siren Adagio and I ever met, too young to remember anything."\n\nSonata looked away. Her entire life had been nothing but memories of being raised by the other two sirens. Of being taught everything a siren should be. "But if that's why Adagio is the way she is," she said slowly and quietly, "and why we always stuck together... is it also why you're always so worried about everything?"\n\nAria shrugged.

Though Zamni himself was too busy to attend now, Sonata could never let such an opportunity to have fun go to waste, especially after having to argue that setting money aside to help host events like it around Sirenalia wasn't 'a complete and total waste of time and resources'.\n\nThe zebras seemed nervous, at least for the first part. Sonata's arrival was entirely unannounced, after all, and she still had her personal guard with her (since Aria would have exploded if she found out Sonata hadn't let them tag along), and as it turned out having a massive siren around did change the mood of the party a bit. But as drinks were passed around and zebras remembered why they were there, everycreature started having fun again. Sonata herself was slightly disappointed at her own inability to get drunk off of alcohol, but watching others stumble around and laugh and sing song together was just as entertaining. A few even had enough liquid courage to speak directly with Sonata, asking her how she was doing her how hard it was being a siren and doing everything from Aris.\n\nEventually, things started winding down as the night dragged on, with zebras passing out on the ground or in their chair.

And the only downside was having to take just one mandatory class per semester!\n\n"Attention, please," the professor called out, ringing a bell on his desk at the stage. There must have been at least a hundred creatures at the lecture hall, of all different kinds of creatures. Sugar could make out hippogriffs, zebras, griffons and even an Abyssinian or two!

"But tell me, young one, was life really all that better before they came here? This very university was built from their generosity. None of you would be here were it not for them. Neither would I."

Who could have guessed that getting dethroned and cast out on the street would be such a blessing?\n\nNovo made her way to the third floor and found the doctor on duty.\n"I'm here to see my daughter."\n"I'm afraid now's not a good time," he replied, too nervous to meet her eyes. "She's very agitated. Perhaps if you come back later, or tomorrow-"\n"I'm going to see my daughter NOW." Novo said, pushing him aside.\n\nSkystar looked unwell, to put it mildly. Her bloodshot eyes darted around the room frantically. Her chest was scarred, the result of her clawing at a red gemstone that was no longer there. Her nerves were so frayed that she would have been pacing back and forth, if she wasn't too weak to leave her bed.\n\nThe former princess looked at Novo. Panic set in instantly.\n"Mother, you have to get out of here! I'm going to sing, and I... I can't stop myself!"\nNovo said nothing. She slowly approached and pulled her daughter into a hug.\n"Mother, no, please! You have to leave! I... I..."\nHer breathing slowly stabilized. When she finally calmed down she buried her face in her mother's shoulder.\n\n"Skystar, honey." Novo whispered, "As a queen I failed to protect my subjects. Even worse, as a mother I failed to protect you. I may not be queen anymore, but I'm still your mother, and I promise you won't ever be alone again. No matter how long it takes, I know you'll make it through this."\n\nNovo stayed at her daughter's side for hours, sitting through panicked shrieks and bitter tears, until finally Skystar drifted off to sleep."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.25.d2:0 "The sunlight streaming through the hospital windows reflected off of white walls and tile floors. The drips of IVs and the creaking of beds filled the rooms with ambient noise. A hippogriff nurse walked the hallways, checking her chart, until she noticed a familiar face.\n\n"Ms. Skystar, hello! What brings you here today?"\nThe former princess looked down at the bundle in her claws. "I'm here to drop off fresh linens, and new flowers for my mother."\n"Oh, of course, thank you! You're always so thoughtful."\n\n"Has there been any improvement in her condition?" Skystar asked.\nThe nurse gave a nervous smile. "Well, it's hard to say. We don't have a lot of experience with the effects of prolonged mind control."\n"But have you noticed any changes? Anything at all?"\n"Uh..." The nurse looked away. "I'll take care of those linens. Why don't you go see her?"\n\nSkystar found Novo sitting on her bed. She was staring straight ahead, her eyes unfocused. She didn't react to her daughter's entrance at all.\n"Good morning, mother. How are you?"\nNovo did not move or speak. The only audible sound was her breathing.\n\nSkystar grabbed her mother's claw. "Mother, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I wasn't there when you needed me most. But don't worry, I promise I won't ever give up on you. I know you'll come back to us someday."\nWith that, the former princess released her grip and turned towards the door.\n\n"Skystar."\n\n"What?" She exclaimed, turning around. "Mother, did you just..."\nNovo still had not moved, but a slight smile had formed on her face.\n\n"Oh, mom." Skystar said, tearing up. "It's been a long time since you called my name. Hearing it again makes me so happy!""
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.25.d3:0 "The sky was calm over the hills surrounding Mount Aris. The morning dew had largely faded, but the grass still shimmered in some places. It was sunny, but not too hot, and the singing of birds filled the air.\n\nIn a small cabin nestled at the edge of a valley, Skystar stood in the kitchen cutting vegetables. Being raised as a princess she never had to cook for herself, but she had learned quickly after Sonata let her leave the palace.\n\nSkystar had been surprised when the siren spared her from becoming a beacon, and even more shocked when she was suddenly freed from the spell and allowed to go. She didn't know what to do at first, but before long she found her mother. The former queen, after being dethroned and cast out by the sirens, had been able to fully recover from their mind control.\n\nWhen she was finished Skystar went looking for Novo. She found her in the office, hunched over her writing desk.\n"Mother," Skystar called, "Lunch is ready, come and eat."\n"In a minute." Novo replied without looking up, "I've got to finish this, it's important."\n\nSkystar raised an eyebrow. "What are you working on, mother?"\n"The next speech I'm going to give. Now that the spell is ending the hippogriffs will be looking to us for leadership. I won't fail them again."\nThe former princess sighed. She didn't have the heart to tell her mother that their time as royals was over. Many creatures still respected them, of course, but no one would be asking them to lead anytime soon.\n\nInstead, Skystar came up behind Novo and wrapped her in a hug.\n"Why don't you take a break from that, and we can go outside for a picnic? It's a beautiful day, we should enjoy it together."\nNovo stopped writing and turned towards Skystar. When their eyes met she smiled.\n\n"I guess this can wait until later. Queen or not, a mother should always make time for her daughter.""

 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.26.d:0 "Shama Batahiram weaved through the busy streets of Ain Trotgourait, struggling with several bags. Prices in the market had been rising lately, but by some miracle she'd gotten almost everything she needed. She had just one more stop to make before heading home.\n\nAs she passed by the Royal Palace she heard shouting and marching. A crowd had gathered on the steps outside, picketing and chanting anti-siren slogans.\n\nThis kind of thing started up every morning, and everyday by noon the protest would turn violent. Soldiers would then appear and force the crowd to disperse. The demonstrations had gotten a bit smaller with time, but they showed no signs of stopping.\n\nTurning down another street, Shama encountered a military checkpoint. As two very stern hippogriffs patted her down and searched her bags, she sighed to herself. Heavy-hoofed policing, instability and unrest seemed to be the price they all must pay to be free of the spell. She was glad to be herself again, of course, but that didn't make this any easier to deal with.\n\nFinally Shama arrived at her destination, a bakery.\n"Good day neighbor, I need a baguette and a loaf of sweet bread."\n"That'll be 3 zhekels." the baker replied, bringing the goods to the counter.\n"Times are tough," said Shama, feigning desperation. "I'm afraid I can't afford 3 zhekels, could you take 1 and a half instead?"\nThe baker scratched his chin. "I can do 2, but no less."\n\nShama collected the money from her purse and looked up to find the baker smiling.\n"Is something funny?" she asked.\n"Oh, It's nothing. I guess I just missed haggling with my customers. Not long ago we would've been compelled to argue about the price instead."\n\nAs she made her way home Shama considered the baker's words. The sirens' spell had scarred society deeply, and life wasn't about to get easier anytime soon. Yet small things like common courtesy and friendly conversation had already come back. Maybe there was reason to be hopeful after all."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.26.a:0 "The longest journey begins with a single step."
 
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.27.t:0 "A New Friend"
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.27.d:0 ""Hm, not a single person has come in yet!" Sonata thought to herself as the clock nearby ticked on and on, signaling the coming of evening as the sun started its descent across the horizon. "Do you think it's too much walking to get here?"\n\n"I think it might take a bit more time for them to like you, Sonata," Aria answered, rolling her eyes. "People don't get over their fear of sirens easily, you know."\n\n"And you don't make that any easier, Aria," Zamni reminded her as he trotted a bit closer to Sonata. "I'm sure they're just getting used to normal life again. You just need to wait a bit longer."\n\nShe crossed her hooves. "But I hate waiting!"\n\nThe zebra suppressed a laugh. "Yes, Sonata, I know. Speaking of which, where's Somnambula? Shouldn't she be back by now?"\n\nAs if on queue, the pegasus flew in through the doorway, looking behind her every so often. "Apologies for being late, but there were creatures who required my help," she said, bowing her head.\n\nSonata's frown deepened. "See, everyone's still friends with her!"\n\nAria raised an eyebrow, Zamni facehoofed, and Somnambula only seemed to smile before moving to the side. A single pony walked in to where she stood; a small unicorn filly, who blinked a few times looking at the zebra and two sirens on the other side of the room. "Wow, are you the friends Somnambula was talking about?" she asked, her eyes wide. "That's so cool!"\n\nSilence. Sonata looked at Aria, then at Zamni. The latter waved his hoof along, encouraging her to speak up. After nodding, the blue siren floated upwards before slowly approaching the filly, holding out a hoof."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.27.a:0 ""Hi, I'm Sonata! What's your name?""
 
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.28.t:0 "Blot"
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.28.d:0 "Walnut Drive stared blankly in the direction of his old uniform that was hanging up by the door to his office. It was caked in sand, mud and grass stains and it reeked of sweat from far too many days spent in the field. It had only been a few hours since he'd returned to the headquarters, taken a shower and changed into something comfortable.\n\nCalling it an office was in and of itself a little generous. It was more like an undersized war room in a forward operating base, itself thinly veiled under the guise of a small shipping company in Firstport. From here they could easily receive deliveries from Aris without any raised eyebrows from the resistance, a significant boon considering how widespread the Chiropterran informant network was. Regardless, it was still this thestral's workplace.\n\nThe ex-legionnaire sighed and finally broke his staring contest with an inanimate object, heaving open a drawer and taking out some pen and paper to write an operation report. Walnut immediately came to regret that decision once he remembered to acknowledge the aching in his leg muscles, but began to recall the events of the last week in spite of it.\n\nAll in all, it had been a success; albeit a time consuming one. He and a small detachment of hardened veterans that he'd assembled with Sonata's approval had expertly countered a raid that the Chiropterran resistance had attempted to conduct in the Howling Mountains. They intercepted communications, prepared for a number of days, watched and finally wiped out the raiders with surgical precision. Walnut could recall the tactics of the old legionnaires verbatim, which was more than enough to crush any single force at a tactical level. The rebels had managed to destroy a small number of trucks in the targeted convoy, but nothing that couldn't be replaced.\n\n"Nothin' that can't be replaced..." He gave out quietly, realising that he had included the drivers of the trucks in that assessment.\n\nJust as he put down his pen, an earth pony politely knocked on the open door. "I have a report on regional rebel activity sir, and it's looking quite positive. Care to read it?"\n\nAs she set down the folder on his desk, the thestral managed a smile for the first time that day."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.28.a:0 ""Thanks, I've been needin' a distraction.""
 
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.29.t:0 "The Lucky Siren"
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.29.d:0 ""...an' they operate just like the legions did, when they can anyway. They've become so easy to deal with that I ain't always needed at the operational level anymore, an' obviously they've got no support. That's partly your doing a'course but we've been making improvements an' carefully picking at the whole 'Nightmare' thing too. The team's been good; to me, for Chiropterra an' for you too I reckon." The batpony gave out with a hint of optimism in his voice.\n\nWalnut Drive stood at the edge of a wooden pier with one hoof over the railing as he looked out across the ocean. Sonata was hovering beside him, doing her best not to be excited by his change in demeanour since the last time they had spoken face to face.\n\nThe siren contained her glee and asked the all important question, "So what you're doing has... worked?"\n\n"Yeah, it has." The thestral turned to meet her unintentionally piercing gaze and paused for a moment, before asking a question of his own. "You really are well-meaning ain'tcha? I mean you're doin' some heinous stuff, but you really are tryna make things better an' be better than your sisters aren't ya?"\n\nSonata cocked her head quizzically, as though she'd suddenly forgotten that people thought she was a monster. "Um.. Well, I... I'm trying, yes and... and Aria is helping too, sometimes..."\n\nWalnut shook his head and stifled a genuine laugh, interrupting her train of thought before it could rapidly derail. "I wasn't meanin' to be mean, I just... I ain't seen many creatures with such evil surroundings try an' do what's right, no matter what happens. I ain't seen many creatures burn it all down an' then try honestly to apologise an' build it back up. It's a rare thing."\n\nAt that moment the whirring gears in the siren's head suddenly clicked into place. He looked at her and saw himself! Not literally of course but metaphorically, or whatever it was; it made sense because he'd grown up in Chiropterra before escaping, surrounded by... Well, all of what he was slowly getting rid of now. All of what he'd tried to get rid of before they came and ruined the whole thing.\n\nSonata's typical naive smile gradually returned, albeit with a slight quiver in her lips and then in her voice."
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.29.a:0 ""O-Oh... That's... I, uh... T-Thank you.""
 
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.30.t:0 "A Questionable Victory for the Zonician People"
 hippogriff_abyss_sonata.30.d:0 ""So, how did everything go?"\n\nZamni ignored Sonata and went straight for the only couch in the room, collapsing into it with a heavy sigh. "Pretty good, all things considered," he finally answered back after taking a minute to recover. "I think they might finally not want to kill you on sight anymore."\n\n"That's great! Or at least way better than before... I think. Was it fun?"\n\nLifting his head, the zebra pointed at the dark bags under his eyes that had formed over the past week. "Does this look fun?" he asked before slamming his face back down into the cushions. "At least I'm done visiting Zumidia and Warzena now..."\n\nSonata tapped her hooves lightly together. "Yeah, so about that..."\n\nZamni twisted his head so he could look at the siren without lifting his head. "Sonata. What did you do?"\n\n"I may have made you king or sufrit or something of Zonicia and told people in Colthage that you would visit soon? Don't worry though, I'll make sure the train has a bed for you to sleep in on the ride there!"\n\nThe monarch blinked. Then, with an unceremonious groan, he finally passed out, his crown falling from his head and clattering on the floor below. Sonata swam over through the air to pick it up and looked at it closely.\n\n"Hm, we might need to get you a new crown too. This one doesn't look as fancy as the ones I saw in the museums...""

 hippogriff_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Shocking news from the nation of [HIP.GetName], as [HIP.GetLeader] has proclaimed the successful test of a weapon thought years away. This has been corroborated by spy plane flights that recorded high levels of radiation near the uninhabited isles of Sunset Atoll.\n\nWhile technical details are classified, it appears the weapon used a fission reaction to kick-start a fusion reaction in a shell of tritium and deuterium outside it, creating a blast in the megaton range. What this may mean for the world is unclear, but one thing is certain: the power of the sun is now in mortal fins."

 HIP_salina_blue_desc:0 "Salina Blue was never supposed to wind up in power. A radio operator from a poor family, she became a founding member of one of Hippogriffia's first unions, the Arisian Union of Telegraphists. When the SLPA formed, Salina was chosen as its party leader. Although once a supporter of Queen Novo, the Queen's crackdown on the motor strike disillusioned her and pushed her further to the left, turning her from a constitutionalist into a republican. A popular figure even outside the SLPA, Salina was an easy choice for People's Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs. The RWP may rule Aris now, but Salina is determined to ensure it never gets its head lost in the clouds or turns its back on the workers."
 HIP_SALINA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 977 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Salina Blue was always a shy, reclusive seapony. She never wanted to rule a town, let alone all of Aris. But fate, it seems, had other things in mind for her. Before the final battle with the Storm King she met Fluttershy, Element of Kindness, and she came away more confident and self-assured, though still shy.\n\nA radio operator from a poor family, she came to read the works and deeds of Alexander Kemerskai, Théodore Vérany, Caramel Marks, and even the peasant revolts throughout history. Realizing that a better life was not only possible but achievable, she became a founding member of one of Hippogriffia's first unions, the Arisian Union of Telegraphists, and served in Posada's government.\n\nWith the loss of Zumidia and the collapse of Posada's revolutionary government, a new one has been instituted: republican, not revolutionary. The Workers' Republic of Aris may not be as visionary or future-minded as Revolutionary North Zebrica, but it will hopefully prove more stable and long-lasting.\n\nSalina may lack her predecessor's fiery rhetoric and ferocious dreams, but is determined to do the best for all the people of Aris and lead the nation into a brighter future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Venva"

 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenage years. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would stargaze while contemplating if there were creatures on other worlds. It was on one such night she accidentally drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes, images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw how stars burned. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could. Now with the RWP in power, the interstellar revolution is upon creaturekind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_SAD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: "Everything I did, I did for the revolution."\n\nPosada has believed in the promise of communism for years, and has seen with her own eyes how it benefits the world. But little by little, her idealism has cracked. Reactionaries, once met with rehabilitation, gradually became imprisoned for life and later simply shot.\n\nThe world looks grimmer every day, and the rare rays of light in her life gradually distanced themselves from her, as if fearing being contaminated themselves. Few indeed are the associates she genuinely enjoys the company of anymore, and fewer still the creatures who say what she wishes they would: that she's gone too far and has to stop. \n\nOceans of blood have been spilled at her directive, ruthless operations justified by the fact that this is necessary for a better world. That excuse still holds water, but it seems drier than it once did. The revolution is worth dying for, but is it truly worth massacring for?\n\nPosada knows in her heart that she has become a monster, one the Storm King would welcome with a smile as a sister-in-arms. The only thing that gives her the energy to rise from bed is the terrible knowledge that there are so many worse monsters still left to slay.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

That excuse still holds water, but it seems drier than it once did. The revolution is worth dying for, but is it truly worth massacring for?\n\nWhen the Star People come, what will her legacy be? Will she be seen as someone who did what needed to be done, or someone who went too far out of ideological fanaticism and hatred? The only thing that gives her the energy to rise from bed is the terrible knowledge that without her, Revolutionary North Zebrica will die and everything will have been for naught.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_GOODEND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Communism has won against all odds, and the dream has been fulfilled. Throughout the lands of Revolutionary North Zebrica, suffering, poverty, and scarcity are things of the past. Nuclear reactors dot the land like gemstones, powering entire cities and providing the state with an ever-growing supply of fissile material. The scientific method has been applied to politics, and government is administrated with maximum efficiency with an eye towards fairness. The stars shine as bright as the souls of the creatures building this utopia.\n\nPosada has known for years that this world was not the only to harbor life. It'd simply be impossible to have only one planet with creatures upon it. Somewhere out there, in the vast cosmos, are Star People, creatures who have moved past the troubles of reaction and violence, and formed glorious civilizations aglow amongst the constellations. \n\nRevolutionary North Zebrica, once the small state known as Hippogriffia, has become a beacon calling out to the stars. Communism has prevailed here, and grand efforts are underway to contact the astral comrades. \n\nPosada has come far from the broken madfish she once was. Her soul has crystallized with a clear purpose: to win the great war against reaction, to uplift the lives of all creatures around the world, and to reach out to the Star People and gain their aid in creating a better, more loving world.\n\nThe aliens will come - and Posada will welcome them with open fins.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_STARRYEYES_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of July, 984 in Starfield.\n\n§YBiography§!: As the youngest daughter of a lower middle-class family, Starry Eyes enjoyed a happy childhood. She loved spending time with her many friends, but she was also known to spend hours by herself engrossed in a good book. On occasion she read about politics and history, but her favorites were always works of fiction and poetry.\n\nLike many other hippogriffs, her life was upended by the Storm King's arrival in 1005. Moving underwater could have been disastrous for her family, as her parents were unable to work and there wasn't enough food and shelter to go around. However, a generous seapony invited the whole family in and shared what he had with them. Starry would never forget this random act of kindness, and it inspired her to always help creatures in need. When the Storm King was finally defeated she decided to remain in Seaquestria. She was working at a soup kitchen when she first met Posada, who convinced her to join the newly formed RWP.\n\nHer talent for organizing and her ability to make friends with everyone helped her rise through the party's ranks rapidly. By the time Posada announced her retirement, Starry had already been elected to the Supreme Workers' Council and the Presidium. Now serving as General Secretary, she is continuing most of Posada's policies while also trying to step out of her shadow. Instead of investing heavily in technological progress, Starry believes the revolution will be best served by reforming the social relations between creatures.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

 HIP_HARDLINE_LEADER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of September, 977 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Among the seaponies, having a lure is seen as a sign of nobility. For Hard Line, it is a reminder of a past that has haunted him for his entire life.\n\nHard Line, born with the name Kelp Strand, was the product of an affair between a highborn duchess and a poor mechanic. His mother abandoned the family just after he was born. His father tried his best to provide a good life, but living on the edge of poverty meant that times were often hard. Kelp's origins as a bastard child frequently made him the target of insults and mockery from his peers, and over time he came to blame his mother for all the indignities he suffered. Among the many enemies of the revolution, those of royal or noble birth are the only ones he truly despises.\n\nKelp Strand was always a very bright student, excelling in all of his classes. It was in school that he first came across the collected works of Caramel Marks, which he devoured voraciously. He soon developed a set of ultra-orthodox Marksist beliefs, upholding dialectical materialism with an almost religious fervor. Even world-renowned revolutionaries like Steel Stallion are considered revisionists within his framework. To showcase the strength of his convictions he adopted the name Hard Line.\n\nHard Line joined the RWP as a founding member and quickly became one of Posada's chief advisors. Although he was often critical of her policies, he never broke with the party or the General Secretary. Now Posada's untimely demise has allowed him to take control, beginning a dark new chapter in the history of Revolutionary North Zebrica. Revisionists, reactionaries, even those with no interest in politics: none are safe in a state that has declared compassion and basic decency to be "bourgeois constructs."\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

 HIP_CRACK_NAZBOL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of February, 977 in Harmonizing Heights.\n\n§YBiography§!: Crack Lightning became a household name during the Storm War and has remained one ever since. He is known for being many things: a heroic fighter ace, a talented and adventurous aviator, and a bombastic nationalist firebrand. But one thing most people did not know about him until very recently is that he was also a close friend of Posada.\n\nJust after the war Crack was introduced to Posada, whose miraculous escape from the Storm King had earned her minor fame. The pair bonded over their mutual hatred of the yeti conqueror and shared desire to embrace new ideas. Although Posada became a marksist while Crack took inspiration from Wingbardian fascists, they remained on friendly terms in private. As Posada took control of the state and expanded it across North Zebrica by force, Crack came to see her communist party as a possible vehicle for his own ideas of hippogriff hegemony. He unexpectedly asked to form a National Communist wing of the RWP, and Posada, even more unexpectedly, allowed it.\n\nCrack Lightning supported all of Posada's most controversial policies, especially her brutal treatment of the Chiropterrans. He believes that Skystar and other harmonists unjustly vilified Posada for doing what was right and drove her to suicide. Now that fortune has placed him in the General Secretary's chair, his priorities are twofold: build the hippogriff hegemony he's always dreamed of, and take revenge on those responsible for the death of his friend.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 HIP_SILVERSTREAM_COMMIE_DESC:0 "Silverstream, niece of Queen Novo and graduate of Princess Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship, was the last creature anyone expected to become the new General Secretary of Revolutionary North Zebrica.\n\nWhen the revolution came to Hippogriffia, Silverstream chose not to flee like many other members of the extended royal family. Instead she took the advice of her cousin Skystar and formed a harmonist faction within the RWP. Her platform of curbing the revolution's worst excesses and improving relations with Equestria attracted many followers. After Posada's death both the party and the people wanted a leader who could restore some semblance of normalcy, and they turned to Silverstream.\n\nBut fulfilling the people's hopes is easier said than done. Silverstream never wanted to be General Secretary, and she now finds herself in a very precarious position. Posada's many crimes have done severe damage to the government's reputation, and the effects of other communist policies remain divisive issues. Silverstream will have to tread carefully if she hopes to restore any form of harmony to her troubled homeland.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"

 HIP_COLOUR_FIELD_DESC:0 "Colour Field grew up like a normal Stalliongradian filly, struggling to make ends meet. The Equestrian blockade on trade to the country didn't help with that fact, so much for harmony. Colour's father, Berry Star and her mother, Caramel Candy were hardcore communists while their daughter was a harmonic socialist. Colour Field was born and raised in her family's "better" years, when they at least had food on the table and a stable generous wage. Unfortunately, this didn't last, as later on she went to sleep hungry. She had just one friend, a thestral named Solar Crunch who was always there for her when she was in need. Because of him, Colour would grow passionate about thestrals and their struggles in Equestria. At an early age, Colour always loved art and writing. Sadly for her, her writing skill was terrible but her painting skill was superb.\n\nShe moved to Vanhoover against her parents' wishes so she could enroll in an art school there, where she quickly made a good friend there named Lucky Star; another harmonist socialist. After graduation, Colour would quickly find herself with Lucky Star in Revolutionary North Zebrica after learning about a hippogriff named Posada. What caught her eye was how the Marksist government was installed, through diplomacy and pressure instead of a long violent revolution, which just made her Reformist heart sing out loud. With no prior training or even... logical thinking, Colour signed up for the North Zebrican Army. She quickly rose through the ranks thanks to Posada's efforts at finding skilled commanders from the rank and file.\n\nWith her poor mental state, it was no shock that her fixation with Posada would turn into an obsession, idolising her to an unhealthy level. She is committed to the revolution and to making the world a better place but she is still a little uneasy about killing for it. However, she trusts Posada's leadership and just like her hero, she hates supremacists and wants to overthrow them all."
 HIP_CABBAGE_STEW_DESC:0 "§YRank§!: Rear Admiral\n\nCabbage Stew was born in Winggarden on March 18, 985, to a lower middle-class family. Though times were sometimes hard, he managed to get into naval officer school, and made Captain. However, his further rise was slowed by his radical political beliefs, which shifted over time from just wishing that Novo were more involved in the economy, to constitutionalism, to republicanism, finally to socialism.\n\nWhen the Left started to rise, he organized for the SLPA in his hometown, teaching workers about the wonders of unionization and a future without bosses. And when the Revolution came, he saw a chance to join in. As a syndicalist, he has sometimes been at odds with Posada, but he fully trusts her and the RWP to do right by Aris and the workers of the world.\n\nNow, his political beliefs have switched from an obstacle to an aid. In the dictatorship of the proletariat, it's quite useful to be a committed socialist.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opal"
 HIP_ATLAS_SHINE_DESC:0 "§YRank§!: Brigadier General\n\nOriginally from the small settlements in the Buffalo Chiefdoms Atlas found herself quickly coming to blows with her local contemporaries about the best ways to integrate into Equestria and quickly moved to Appleloosa where she found a disappointing amount of apathy towards the Equestrian working class.\n\nAfter multiple instances of inciting violence in southern Equestria and finding herself repeatedly imprisoned and harassed, Atlas applied for Asylum in Hippogriffia hoping to find more likeminded creatures there without a significant change in her way of life.\n\nQuickly she fell in love with the Hippogriffian way of life settling in the small island of Grand Alaudia finding it to be similar to her home conditions. Despite enjoying the way of life she still had an extreme disdain for the ruling monarchy, even despite their relatively light touch when it came to the general population. Despite the monarchy Atlas quickly found herself integrating into what socialist societies she could find. In particular the revolutionary Posada was quickly amassing a following that Atlas was keen to join in on due to her incredibly unique Marksist theory.\n\nAfter Posada's swift and non-violent takeover Atlas thought it high time to do more with her life and using her intricate knowledge of maps and patience signed up to the Revolutionary Army and using her special talent of proper map design and analyzation, she was shown to be the embodiment of the 'Josipean Strategy' with proper planning and wearing her opponents down. Atlas was quickly recognized as being a talented and pragmatic commander.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

 POLITICS_NOVO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of May, 944 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For the last thirty years, Aris and Seaquestria have been ruled by the steady claw -or fin- of Queen Novo, the Fourth of Her Name. Novo's reign has been highly eventful, to say the least. Its early years were marked by completing the integration of industrial production into Hippogriffia's economy, a process started by her father King Skylance. Novo managed to soften industrialism's birth-pangs by impressing strong Harmonic values upon the industrialist class, preferring to lead by example rather than force. The second decade of her reign was marked by a long period of stability and peace, with Aris retreating from North Zebrican affairs and establishing closer ties with Equestria and New Mareland.\n\nAll that changed when the Storm King attacked. Unwilling to risk total destruction as had befallen so many other nations which had faced his wrath, Novo evacuated the population and industry of Mount Aris to the underwater realm of Seaquestria. There, she prepared for an eventual confrontation. Her fin forced by her precocious daughter and the Equestrian Elements of Harmony, Novo's forces defeated the Storm King and reclaimed Aris. However, the evacuation left deep scars, and Novo has had more and more difficulty balancing the needs of her creatures: seaponies and hippogriffs clash and the new generation of industrialists abandons Harmonic values in the name of profit, all while the new generation of workers and students turn to radical ideas.\n\nThroughout her long reign, Novo has proven herself a master of negotiation, or some would say concession. She has proven herself a pragmatic ruler, or some would say a coward. She has been a rock of stability in a rapidly changing world, or some would say she has held Hippogriffia back. Some whisper that she plans to retire in favour of her daughter Skystar, others long for a change of pace, but most Arisians simply could not imagine an Aris without Queen Novo.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
 CRACK_LIGHTNING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of February, 977 in Harmonizing Heights.\n\n§YBiography§!: If you'd asked anygriff what Crack Lightning's future held after his rise to fame as an ace pilot in the Storm War, none would have guessed he planned on becoming the voice of the Aris First nationalist movement, much less the supreme commander of Aris' armed forces or the de facto ruler of Hippogriffia.\n\nFew now remember that Crack Lightning opposed the move to Seaquestria following the Storm King's arrival, nor that until his rise to fame he had never particularly cared for traditionalism, for all of that has been wiped away by the bombastic fervour of his commitment to Aris First after his round-the-world flight.\n\nPassionate, young, aggressive, adventurous, seductive, he was everything Aris First needed to contrast the stoic Raft Wood and to rile up the youth into a nationalistic frenzy. Few suspected that his ambitions went far beyond the isolationism of his colleague, and those that did notice found their objections falling on deaf ears as his influence grew and his followers grew more zealous. Now with Raft Wood out of the picture, Hippogriffia is under the full control of Crack Lightning, and there is little doubt that "The Ace," as his followers call him, will put the country's considerable might towards creating the Hegemony he dreams of.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 RAFT_WOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of June, 950 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Advisor, populist, nationalist, disgrace, leader. Raft Wood has been many things over the years, rising through Novo's court to become one of her chief advisors during the difficult days of the Storm King. It was his idea to migrate the hippogriff population to Seaquestria, and in the aftermath of the triumphant Storm War he saw his influence fade.\n\nBlamed for everything that went wrong during the isolation, called a coward by hippogriffs and foreigners alike, Raft Wood lost his influence in the court but never his faith in Queen Novo or Hippogriffia. His waning period turned out to be a cocoon, from which emerged a transformed Raft Wood: reaffirming everything he believed in, he masterminded the nationalist Aris First movement alongside ace pilot Crack Lightning, becoming the first to bring mass politics to Hippogriffia.\n\nA vocal supporter of the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee and the superiority of the Arisian way of life, Raft Wood found his fortunes rising as nationalism and Harmony blended together in the popular consciousness and, eventually, the law of the land in Hippogriffia. When Novo appointed him chairpony of the AHAC and granted him and Crack Lightning extensive emergency powers, Raft Wood expected to comfortably lead Aris into a new era free of foreign influence.\n\nTo his dismay, he soon found himself dragged into two conflicts: the raging North Zebrican War on the one fin, and a shadow conflict with his former compatriot Crack Lightning on the other, who intended to use Raft Wood's movement to transform Aris into a fascist dictatorship. With Lightning exposed and apprehended, Raft Wood stands as the leader of [HIP.GetName]. Nothing stands in Raft Wood's way of pursuing a strong, united, and pure Aris, save perhaps his own nagging doubts at how deeply Crack Lightning's venomous ideology has seeped into his followers.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

Even when the rest of the Phalanx turned on him, Razorbeak remained loyal.\n\nLightning's assassination and the bloody fighting which followed has seen Razorbeak take over as Supreme Commander of Aris, unleashing her signature cold-hearted violence on those who failed The Ace. She now rules with an iron claw, seeking to weed out weakness among the entire Hippogriff race in the same way she once did to cadets at the academy, now completely unrestrained by law and oversight.

 HIP_LUCY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July, 973 ALB on Mount Aris\n\n§YBiography§!: Born high above the land atop Mount Aris, Lucy Duskfeather had grown to enjoy and eventually love the great heights of her home. Born to a high-middle class commoner family, Lucy was originally intended to succeed her mother and take over a local bakery business. Tensions in the family resulted from this as soon as the young Hippogriff reached the age of 14 and made it known that she intended to join the local scouts which her parents objected to. After a month-long deadlock and emotions flaring both towards sadness and anger, her parents relented and sent her off. To this day, Lucy would go on to say that her time in the scouts on Mount Aris was perhaps the second most impactful time of her life, with only the Storm King's invasion overtaking it. She found herself quick to reach out to her fellow hippogriffs to make friends and allies, and generally enjoyed the experience of developing new and existing skills and using them to tackle challenge after challenge. As she left the scouts and looked to her future, her parents had come to terms with their daughter's ambitions, and Lucy went on to attend the Royal Seaquestrian Military Academy at the age of 20. She would go on to become an overall adequate officer, but developed a particular hunch for combat in greater and greater heights, taking great inspiration from her childhood on Mount Aris, to the point where some of her subordinates wondered why she had joined the Army and not the Air Force. \n\nA Major-General by the time, Lucy chafed under the Storm King's reign, being forced beneath the waves by the Queen where her skills were made useless. The subsequent defeat of the King, however, made her all the more expressive that, if Hippogriffia should ever again come under siege, they should utilise the great peaks and heights of their mountain for safety, not the depths of Seaquestria. Privately, the newly minted Lieutenant-General came to blame the left-wingers among society for the humiliating plunder of Aris, coming to see socialists more as somegriffs that failed to make friends in society, and thus resorted to sabotaging a society they thought had failed them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 HIP_MOONFEATHER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of August, 966 in Mount Aris.\n\n§YBiography§!: Plumage Moonfeather was born to an affluent family steeped in the values of a harmonic society. The only child of a judge and a captain of the Royal Guard, his loving parents catered to his every need. He received a world class education at some of the country's premier institutions. After graduating from university he entered the private sector...\n\n...and became one of the world's most ruthless businessgriffs. With one claw he cut down the competition, using corporate espionage and market manipulation to destroy rival companies. With the other claw he brutally oppressed the workers, hiring thugs to break up strikes and blackmailing union organizers. These tactics earned him riches but also made him a social pariah, something he never seemed to mind. While the Storm King's arrival was a traumatic event for most hippogriffs, Plumage took it very differently. In private conversations he would later deny, he admired how much wealth the yeti had acquired through conquest and wondered aloud if a hippogriff could emulate his "success."\n\nDespite his massive economic influence, Plumage has always been politically isolated. Leftists and harmonists alike are disgusted by his cruel business practices, while conservatives bemoan his lack of patriotism. Now that he's attained a position of power the future of Hippogriffia, and all of North Zebrica, looks very bleak.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofkov"

 
 HIP_SIR_ADAGIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAdagio Dazzle is the leader of the three sirens, and for good reason. Even without magic her voice carries with it a stunning amount of charisma, and her elaborate plans are both long and rarely ever fail. Yet despite that she is extremely egotistical and controlling even compared to her fellow sirens, and believes that only she can lead the three to their rightful places as the masters of the entire world.\n\nAdagio believes everything can be solved using their magic and their voices, a sentiment not exactly shared with her partners. She sees Aria as too distracted by her "what ifs" and a constant annoyance due to her constant fights with Sonata, who she sees as a loose cannon at best and an active hinderance at worst. Still, she works with them for a shared dream and her birthright; for everyone in this world to adore her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAdagio Dazzle, self-proclaimed leader of the former trio, now stands alone, and for good reason. Even without magic her voice carries with it a stunning amount of charisma, and her elaborate plans are both long and rarely ever fail. Yet despite that she is extremely egotistical and controlling, and believes that only she can bring herself to her rightful place as the master of the entire world.\n\nAdagio believes everything can be solved using their magic and their voices, an idea not entirely without proven merit. Equestria has fallen, but even alone she remains driven to even further heights. With her egotism and spiteful nature now left unchecked, creatures can only tremble at the possible future that now awaits them. Adagio, on the other hoof, only sees it as the natural conclusion to everything; her very birthright, for everyone in this world to adore her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_ARIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAria Blaze is the serious and level-headed member of the sirens, being a stark contrast to her partners and their eccentricity. While being just as capable of manipulation as Adagio, Aria concerns herself more with what could happen, no matter how unlikely those situations could be. Her plans and backup plans are thorough and numerous, which could even be described as paranoia in some cases.\n\nHaving learned of the new world and the vast differences from the old, Aria is a proponent of less-magical solutions to problems she and the others come across, seeing them as more reliable than continuing to trust in their magic never failing after her banishment. While she does listen to Adagio, she sees her fellow siren as too obsessed with world domination and egotistical to see the possibility of their plans falling apart, and Aria's annoyance with Sonata's carefree attitude has led to many an argument. Still, she works with them side by side, for Aria knows that her fellow sirens are the only creatures she can trust completely.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_SONATA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world.

Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nSonata Dusk is an outlier among the three, severely lacking in any sort of skill regarding intentional manipulation. Often forgetful and ditzy, Sonata legitimately enjoys music of all kinds, including music being played by others. She hates boredom, and prefers doing things and being in the moment, as opposed to the other two with their long plans and eyes on the future.\n\nSonata frequently gets into arguments with Aria over trivial matters, which constantly results in Adagio having to intervene in their pointless arguments. This has led to Sonata seeing Aria as "no-fun", and Adagio as the leader with the evil plans. The result of this has been her being the siren most involved with the enthralled population, preferring to get away from her partners often when possible and occasionally unwittingly doing something useful in the process. Despite it all, though, she still cares about the trio and does whatever she can to help, even if it isn't always useful.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_sunset_shimmer_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: March 23rd, 974, in Tall Tale\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Shimmer, many said, was destined for greatness. Having a natural talent at magic even before she gained her cutie mark, her unique skills and ambition eventually caught the eye of the Princess herself. But although Sunset was proud to be her one and only protege, both her hubris and aspirations knew no limits, and she soon became discontent with the progress she made in her studies. After an incident involving a magical mirror, Celestia was forced to expel her, though she escaped into an alternate world using the mirror as a portal.\n\nYears later, Sunset Shimmer returned to steal the Element of Magic from Princess Twilight during her visit to the Crystal Empire. Fleeing back into the portal with the Element, Twilight was forced to chase after her, with Spike as her only company. Nopony quite knows what happened while they were gone, but Twilight eventually emerged with her crown secured, and stated that Sunset was in good hands.\n\nFor many years, she went unnoticed and unremembered by many. But that all changed when Equestria came under attack, and Harmony itself was threatened. Gaining an official role in the Equestrian Armed Forces, Sunset Shimmer led armies into battle with the same confidence she always had in life; defending her friends and her homeland from anyone who would have seen it fall.\n\nBut fall it did. Despite her best efforts, Equestria was defeated by none other than the ancient sirens. And yet, she retains her position as a talented military commander for a single reason; her complete obedience helps keep the Element Bearers in line. Some say she is the same she's always been - others believe her odd moments are her true personality trying to break free from the spell. Either way, she remains nothing more than a puppet on a string; a marionette playing someone else's game.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

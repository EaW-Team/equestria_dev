 HIP_rozenkampism_desc:0 "Lightningism continues all of Posada's most notorious policies at an even more intense pace. Chiropterra continues to be devastated, and resources are ruthlessly extracted from North Zebrica to fuel the post-scarcity society on the home front. Calling himself the true heir of Posadism, some fear he aims to persecute ethnic minorities within Revolutionary North Zebrica due to his nationalist roots and belief in biological lumpenproletariat. Crack insists the phenomenon of biological lumpenproletarians is based upon ethnicity and direct heritage, not race, but for the zebras and ponies within Revolutionary North Zebrica, that offers a small comfort as the nebulous "superculture" they are supposed to conform to seems quite ill-defined."
 HIP_magocracy_desc:0 "Though enforced through magic, the rule of the sirens is nothing like that of other magocracies in the world. The country is first and foremost used as a feeding ground of strife, which in turn gives the sirens the magic they need to continue enthralling the population. None except the sirens themselves are seen as of any importance, and they alone dictate the will of the nation. While the exact direction of that will may vary from siren to siren, the fact remains that free will remains only a myth to those that live under their regime."

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand The Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_focus:0 "Form The Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_focus_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand The Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely. We lack many resources other nations enjoy, and to keep our war machine operational we must protect our trade routes. Modern destroyers will keep our convoys safe."

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Integrate The Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "There are some things best done in above-water dockyards, and other things best done in underwater ones. We will integrate our surface and underwater shipping facilities to better repair our vessels and streamline shipbuilding."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Refine Underwater Construction Techniques"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support The Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_focus:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_focus_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus:0 "Form The Bellbreeze Aircraft Corporation"
 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus_desc:0 "We are a naturally airborne people. When we fight our enemies in the skies, directing our efforts to maneuverability will let us shoot them down while dodging their attacks."

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form The Department Of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open The Office Of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Expand Metalworking Industry"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is quite resource rich, but much of those resources are particularly hard to get to or require extensive refining to be made usable. To get the most out of our mineral wealth, we will expand aluminum mining operations in Grand Alaudia and develop the Starfield Steelworks so that our industries never want for materials."

 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES
 HIP_defence_department:0 "Department Of Defence"
 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armament Plans"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "We will contact prominent figures in the arms industry, such as Plumage Moonfeather, to improve our arms procurement process. Factory owners must know that there will be great demand for weapons in the near future, so they will be prepared to convert their civilian factories into military ones should we be attacked."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund The Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising The Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps:0 "Expand The Royal Engineer Corps"
 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especially the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School For Signals And Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons From The Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds At Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-To-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion Of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 ### AIR FOCUSES
 HIP_air_armament_committee:0 "Establish The Air Armament Committee"
 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus:0 "Consolidated Aircraft"
 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences:0 "Academy Of Aerial Science"

 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrent."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war.

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours.

We must stop blaming one another for losing the war, and come together as friends once again."

 HIP_moment_of_truth:0 "The Moment Of Truth"

 HIP_demobilize_economy:0 "A Time Of Healing"
 HIP_demobilize_economy_desc:0 "Silverstream suggests we lower work quotas, ease wartime rationing measures, and redirect our economy to providing for our subjects in these difficult times.

 HIP_partition_cth:0 "Partition Colthage"
 HIP_partition_cth_desc:0 "Many of Colthage's problems stem from the city of Colthage exploiting the other regions in the republic. Simply putting a harmonist Sufrit in charge would hardly fix the underlying problem.

 HIP_entrench_representation:0 "Entrench Representative Institutions"
 HIP_entrench_representation_desc:0 "While we have no need to embrace constitutionalism, our existing representative institutions have proven quite capable at governing. The crown shall take a step back from legislation, and over time the role of democracy in our kingdom will expand naturally."
 HIP_reassert_absolutism:0 "Reaffirm Royal Sovereignty"
 HIP_reassert_absolutism_desc:0 "Queen Novo asserts that Harmony in Aris has always been monarchist, and that the system has worked marvellously.

 HIP_trust_carrot_stick:0 "Trust In Carrot Stick"
 HIP_trust_carrot_stick_desc:0 "Chiropterra may have done terrible things, but Harmony means giving your enemies a second chance.

 HIP_nzfta:0 "Found NZFTA"

 HIP_harmonist_syncretic_economics_desc:0 "While we only implemented it out of desperation, in many ways our wartime economy was more Harmonist than our peacetime one: the state, labour unions, and business all working together for the common good. Why return to normal when we can make something better than normal?"
 HIP_natsynd_elements:0 "...With National Syndicalist Elements"
 HIP_natsynd_elements_desc:0 "By giving the industries placed under temporary state control to the labour unions in those sectors, we can share the decision-making and the profits among the workers, and coordinate between workers, the state, and capitalists on a sectoral basis. National syndicalist economic theory predates its perversion by fascism: ensuring everygriff is benefitting is just Harmony applied to economics."
 HIP_planned_elements:0 "...With Centrally Planned Elements"
 HIP_planned_elements_desc:0 "The Marksists say that under capitalism, creatures are enslaved by the means of production rather than the other way around. While we disagree with their conflict-based worldview, we understand how it can feel that way.

 HIP_private_industry:0 "Expand Private Industry"
 HIP_private_industry_desc:0 "While wartime necessity forced the state to play a larger role in the economy, we are still a capitalist nation at heart. Private property and entrepreneurship are the base upon which our economy was built, so we should work to preserve and expand them. Ensuring our citizens have access to ample capital for investment is a good place to start."
 HIP_state_industry:0 "Expand State Industry"
 HIP_state_industry_desc:0 "The nationalization of major industries may have been an act of wartime necessity, but it has proven very effective.

 HIP_harmonic_austerity:0 "Austerity And Sound Spending"
 HIP_harmonic_austerity_desc:0 "When we speak of austerity, it is not a sink or swim system. We can never simply give up on supporting our population.

 HIP_social_state:0 "The Social State"
 HIP_social_state_desc:0 "Harmony isn't just an agreement to leave the people alone, it's a commitment to look out for them and their wellbeing.

 HIP_moderate_racism_desc:0 "Raft Wood argues that we have already wasted too much money on ungrateful Zumidians.

 HIP_hardline_racism:0 "They Have Their Uses"

It also took violence to depose him, and now the Pinks and the Blues are debating over what role violence should play in politics, and whether it can ever be regarded as a force for good."

 HIP_moral_politics:0 "Moral Politics"
 HIP_moral_politics_desc:0 "The question of violence has led inexorably to the question of morality. The Pinks say that tyrants can only be held back by the embrace of moral precepts, which fill the gaps left by law. The Blues argue resolutely that even the most upstanding individuals will turn to demagogues in times of social alienation, and we must combat the fraying effects of capitalism in order to restore social solidarity."

 HIP_right_to_bear_arms:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
 HIP_right_to_bear_arms_desc:0 "The right to bear arms is a recent suggestion by Posada, who argues that the workers must be armed and organized into worker's militias, so as both to defend their homes and to overthrow any tyrant. Others see it as an legitimation of the armed gangs of "patriots" which helped Crack Lightning seize power in the first place."

 HIP_right_to_revolution:0 "The Right To Revolution?"
 HIP_right_to_revolution_desc:0 "Overthrowing Crack Lightning was clearly the right thing to do, but Skystar is being asked a vital question: why? Was it only because his rule was illegal, a usurpation of legitimate authority? Or was there something more: does every creature, usurped royal or not, have the right to rise up against their government if they believe it to be tyrannical?"

 HIP_moral_failure:0 "The Moral Failure"
 HIP_moral_failure_desc:0 "Apparently, we hippogriffs are not as noble as we thought. All it took was a few appeals to common prejudices and a new government to get us to act like barbarians. Where does that leave us?"

 HIP_elements_revisited:0 "The Elements Revisited"
 HIP_elements_revisited_desc:0 "Kindness, Generosity, Laughter, Loyalty, Honesty, and Magic. While never openly repudiating them, Aris First twisted and ultimately discarded the Elements of Harmony.

 HIP_question_of_justice:0 "The Question Of Justice"

 HIP_military_failure:0 "The Military Failure"
 HIP_military_failure_desc:0 "While it is tempting to pin blame for the defeat in the North Zebrican War on Crack Lightning, that is simply too easy.

 HIP_question_of_military_culpability_desc:0 "The military was the starting point for much of Crack Lightning's seizure of power, and they followed his orders even when they were monstrously wrong.

 HIP_cracking_the_silver_curtain_desc:0 "A silver curtain has fallen over continental North Zebrica.

 HIP_depleted_uranium_desc:0 "After nuclear refining is done, we have massive surpluses of depleted uranium left behind.

 HIP_expand_crystal_mining_desc:0 "More reactors require more crystals, and we cannot rely on imports in a world filled with enemies. The crystal mines of Mount Aris must be expanded, and we must begin efforts to create synthetic crystals. Our nation needs crystals far more than rubber anyway."
 HIP_integrate_cth:0 "Sweep The Remainder"
 HIP_integrate_cth_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a nation run by reactionaries for reactionary ends. It must be defeated for the sake of the lives under it and the lives of those adjacent to it. Macawia has long been a democratic land, but unfortunately it has proven resistant to communism and focuses on free trade. We will seize these lands through diplomacy or combat as material conditions require."
 HIP_attack_cth:0 "Free The Slaves"
 HIP_attack_cth_desc:0 "Colthage has long been a "republic", and yet they still have such awful institutions as slavery. Is this not the ultimate proof of the failure of reactionary democracy?

 HIP_absolute_education:0 "Absolute Right To Learn"
 HIP_absolute_education_desc:0 "Any creature that desires to learn shall be able to. From preschool to graduate, all learning will be provided for by the state. Training in all technical skills will likewise be free. Reactionaries abroad might call this a gigantic waste of money; we see it as an investment into the future of the nation and the world at large."
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With The Harmonists"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation_desc:0 "Comrade Silverstream leads a minority faction in the party advocating for avoiding excessive brutality or authoritarianism. Should we align with these ideas, we may find relations with Equestria thawing. The fact is that harmony is a vastly less terrible system to live under than supremacy, so why shouldn't we work together to destroy the latter?"
 HIP_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 HIP_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "It is only logical to follow Steel Stallion's application and allow for the majority to rule, as they do in bourgeois democracies. As we are a party, however, after the voting is concluded, everycreature must abide willingly by the ruling. This is the best and fairest way to ensure the workers' say is heard, and the reactionaries do not gain undue power over us."

 HIP_devolve_power_to_councils_desc:0 "Why should party bureaucrats hold authority over the people they are meant to serve? It is absolutely vital that the workers themselves hold their fate in their own fins, and so we will put in place safeguards against repression and tyranny. The Supreme Workers' Council and the office of General Secretary will have powers revoked as a precaution."
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model:0 "The North Zebrican Model"
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model_desc:0 "Steel Stallion was a great pony, but to call yourself a "Stallionist" is to put up a hero to be worshipped instead of another traveler along the same path. We must always improve upon those that have gone before, and Stalliongrad's system fell to infighting and factionalism after Stallion's death. We need to guarantee that will not happen here, and so our government will be built accordingly."
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism:0 "No Compromise On Communism"
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism_desc:0 "Communism is the real movement that abolishes the current state of things.

 HIP_organic_centralism:0 "Organic Centralism"
 HIP_organic_centralism_desc:0 "The Party is the most class-conscious part of the proletariat.

 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory:0 "A State Built On Theory"
 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory_desc:0 "We must consult every part of the party and then make decisions in accordance with revolutionary theory.

 HIP_towards_post_scarcity:0 "Towards Post-Scarcity"
 HIP_towards_post_scarcity_desc:0 "One of the greatest aims of a communist society is to abolish scarcity. While we are not yet in a place to eliminate scarcity of weapons, we can do so for civilian desires, at least in peacetime. This will be a significant drain on our economy, but it will be worth it. Isn't the goal of communism a better life for the worker?"
 HIP_industrial_bureaus:0 "Found New Industrial Bureaus"

 HIP_an_admitted_monster:0 "An Admitted Monster"
 HIP_an_admitted_monster_desc:0 "Posada did terrible things by her own admission. We can respect the good work she did for the workers without praising or legitimizing the atrocities she committed. For the nation to begin healing, it is time for all of us to confess our own wrongdoings."
 HIP_our_eternal_hero:0 "Our Eternal Hero"
 HIP_our_eternal_hero_desc:0 "Comrade Posada didn't receive the mental and emotional support she clearly needed, which is why she came to believe that she was somehow at fault for doing what had to be done to ensure the survival of the revolution.

 HIP_ignite_atom:0 "Ignite The Fires Of The Atom"
 HIP_ignite_atom_desc:0 "One of Posada's greatest legacies is her support for nuclear power. Her policies have made us a world leader in what is likely to be the energy of the future. We should continue to support nuclear research and explore the many applications of nuclear technology."
 HIP_computer_aided_administration:0 "Computer-Aided Administration!"

 HIP_purge_revisionists:0 "Purge The Revisionists"
 HIP_purge_revisionists_desc:0 "Posada's greatest mistake was tolerating heterodox viewpoints within the Revolutionary Workers' Party.

 HIP_purge_moderates:0 "Purge The Moderates"
 HIP_purge_moderates_desc:0 "Within the Party and the populace at large, there are many who profess loyalty to our cause while objecting to our methods.

 HIP_unchained_by_morality:0 "A Revolution Unchained By Bourgeois Morality!"
 HIP_unchained_by_morality_desc:0 "The Party rules all. The Party is always finding ways to improve. Through dialectics, we develop the ideal modes of theory and praxis.

 HIP_restore_stability:0 "Restore Stability"

 HIP_moderate_outlook_desc:0 "For Skybolt Spear, the revolution was never about turning the world upside down or creating technologies that sound like science fiction.

 HIP_navy_brings_revolution_desc:0 "There are three institutions the people can always rely on: the Blue Army, the Blue Air Force, and the Blue Navy.

 HIP_biological_lumpen:0 "Classify Biological Lumpenproletariat"
 HIP_biological_lumpen_desc:0 "It was the Hippogriffs who led North Zebrica to revolution while the other races were content to be exploited by reactionary elites.

 HIP_build_a_hegemony:0 "Construct The Hegemony"
 HIP_build_a_hegemony_desc:0 "Crack Lightning has always known the Hippogriffs were destined to rule North Zebrica.

 HIP_class_culture_race:0 "Class, Culture, And Race!"
 HIP_class_culture_race_desc:0 "Crack Lightning's position is secure, and Posada's revolutionary state continues its evolution into a Hippogriff Hegemony.

 HIP_codify_rights:0 "Codify Absolute Rights Of Creatures"
 HIP_codify_rights_desc:0 "There are rights that absolutely must be enjoyed by all creatures, such as the rights to life, liberty, food, and shelter.

 HIP_reparations_for_atrocities:0 "Reparations For Atrocities"
 HIP_reparations_for_atrocities_desc:0 "The crimes Posada committed against the people of Chiropterra are unforgivable. Because of her, hippogriffs are seen as monsters across North Zebrica and around the world.

 HIP_harmonic_communism:0 "Harmonic Communism!"
 HIP_harmonic_communism_desc:0 "General Secretary Silverstream is finally beginning to understand this "dialectical materialism" thing.

 HIP_abolish_CSR:0 "Abolish The CSR"
 HIP_abolish_CSR_desc:0 "The CSR has served the revolution well, but it has achieved its purpose.

 HIP_rehabilitate_reactionaries:0 "A Rehabilitationlist Legal System"
 HIP_rehabilitate_reactionaries_desc:0 "In the opening days of the revolution, we condemned people to terrible sentences to send a message to others who would do the same.

 HIP_radiation_proof_armor:0 "Radiation-Proof Armour"
 HIP_radiation_proof_armor_desc:0 "With the increased commonality of nuclear devices on the battlefield, our forces will need to be properly protected. This in turn requires that we develop thick lead armor for our mechanized and tank units, and reshape the tank design to allow the blast wave to flow around it. While this will be difficult and complicated, the rewards will make it worthwhile."

 HIP_thermonuclear_aims:0 "Thermonuclear Aims"
 HIP_thermonuclear_aims_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons are valuable at the tactical and strategic level, but as they have proliferated, the shock value has decreased.

Our scientists have hypothesized that a fusion weapon, mashing tritium and deuterium together, would be incredibly more powerful than the first nuclear weapons."
 HIP_tritium_amassment:0 "Tritium Amassment"
 HIP_tritium_amassment_desc:0 "In order to construct such a weapon, we will need plentiful fuel. Fusion weapons require entirely different fuel than fission, and we're essentially starting from scratch. We will begin purchasing lithium-6 and bombarding it with neutrons to create our tritium."
 HIP_cult_of_the_atom:0 "Cult Of The Atom"
 HIP_cult_of_the_atom_desc:0 "Isn't there something almost transcendental about the eternal dance of fusion and fission? The beauty of a self-sustaining reaction, the four protium atoms slammed together into helium at the core of a star, these are more than merely interesting phenomena. They have an almost spiritual quality. Religion has long been sidelined in our state, and yet could faith find an atomic resurgence?"

 HIP_reason_and_logic_desc:0 "As magnificent as nuclear processes are, they are still entirely secular. One does not need to worship the atom to respect it, nor does one need join a cult to feel in harmony with the infinite. The scientific method shall underly society, as it does politics."

Technological superiority was of insufficient use against our foes, and now we are faced with a grim question.\n\nWhat do we do now?"
 HIP_anarchia_mama:0 "A Different Approach"
 HIP_anarchia_mama_desc:0 "This war has only confirmed the fears of the anarchists relating to "Revolutionary North Zebrica": the supposedly materialist authoritarian communists are in fact themselves utopian idealists, lost in their visions of post-scarcity and blind to the real material conditions of this nation-state. We can no longer trust in benevolence among our rulers. It's time to seize our own fate!"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection:0 "Prepare An Insurrection"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection_desc:0 "The blue tyrants have betrayed us before, and there is no doubt they will do so again when the opportunity presents itself.

 HIP_peaceful_transfer:0 "The Peaceful Transfer Of Power"
 HIP_peaceful_transfer_desc:0 "While the authoritarians have failed, they are not our enemies. Rather, they are misguided comrades we must help see the error of their ways.

 HIP_one_more_try_desc:0 "Revolutionary communism has not failed us; we have failed revolutionary communism. But we can't give up, or toss the chick out with the eggshells.

 HIP_cheat_on_treaty_desc:0 "The treaty has no legitimacy because it is signed between class enemies.

 HIP_request_foreign_aid_desc:0 "We have comrades from all over the world eager to help us.

Arms trafficking is magic!"
 HIP_anarchist_assistance:0 "Acquire Anarchist Assistance"

 HIP_crush_anarchists:0 "Crack Down On The Crypto-Reactionaries"
 HIP_crush_anarchists_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the anarchists continue to serve as catspaws of reaction. They picket our party meetings, they sabotage industrial equipment, and in three cases have even been linked to assassinations.

 HIP_round_two_two:0 "The Vote Of No Confidence"
 HIP_round_two_two_desc:0 "With the crisis finally over, it's time to reaffirm that we do indeed have the will of the people behind us. We cannot in good conscience drag a population into a new potentially-disastrous war without their consent, and some even claim that the RWP itself has failed the people. The only way to prove we are still the representatives of the people is to have a vote of no confidence. Let's hope we win."

It is neither possible, nor desirable, to return to a pre-civilized state of being.\n3. It is therefore desirable to imagine and enact a post-civilized culture."
 HIP_our_own_anarchism:0 "Seaquestria's Own Anarchist Society"
 HIP_our_own_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism is more than a word. It is the opposition to all tyrants, to all powers, to any form of control. We are not anarchists out of idealism, but cynicism! We have seen the fruits of authoritarianism in the horrors of the North Zebrican War! Our rallying cry is simple - never again."
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement:0 "The Anti-Hierarchy Movement"
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the placing of one life, one will, one culture above another. While many anarchists would be satisfied with merely some reforms to hierarchy to render it less tyrannical, we would not. Our aims are far more far-reaching, and we refuse to let compromise or moderatism slow us."
 HIP_school_based_life:0 "Reintroduce School-Based Life"
 HIP_school_based_life_desc:0 "Before the invention of agriculture, seaponies lived in communal, non-hierarchical shoals. We swam through the seas, eating kelp and simply living without any central government or supreme authority. While we are not primitivists, we do recognize that primitive life had advantages over modern life. One such was these schools."
 HIP_sustainable_aquaculture:0 "Sustainable Rotating Aquaculture"

 HIP_abolish_office_of_gensec_desc:0 "The position of General Secretary, at its best, is redundant because the general secretary is in complete accord with the wishes of the people. At its worst, it becomes a new royalty. We will eliminate this redundancy and potential threat."

The sea shelters us, and we must become an ocean-based society."

 HIP_isolationism_and_peace_desc:0 "Who stands to benefit from war?

 HIP_dissolve_supreme_workers_council:0 "Dissolve The Supreme Workers' Council"
 HIP_dissolve_supreme_workers_council_desc:0 "The Supreme Workers' Council was an attempt to represent the people in the central government. But why do we need a central government at all? A bureaucrat in Aris can't make good decisions for a family in Starfield, let alone Squidville. Every school should be able to manage itself and its own affairs."
 HIP_weep_no_more:0 "We Shall Weep No More"

 HIP_augmented_hunter_gatherers:0 "Augmented Hunter-Gatherers"
 HIP_augmented_hunter_gatherers_desc:0 "In many parts of the world, hunter-gatherer society had problems, such as cultural conservatism, authority of the tribe leader, and feuds. We cannot let that happen here. The ocean is vast, and surely there's enough space for everyone - even those with ideas some of us may find distasteful."
 HIP_waste_not_want_not:0 "Waste Not, Want Not"
 HIP_waste_not_want_not_desc:0 "The idea of recycling is a very good one, but it must be applied to everything.

 HIP_present_for_monsters:0 "A Present For The Monsters"
 HIP_present_for_monsters_desc:0 "The monsters who engineered the atrocities of the North Zebrican War may one day come for us. Upon that day, we must be ready to make them slowly attrition to death.

 # SLPA
 HIP_enshrine_democracy:0 "Enshrine Democracy At Every Level"
 HIP_enshrine_democracy_desc:0 "One of the greatest flaws of the Posadist government was the identification of the state with the RWP. We will not repeat that mistake. The SLPA is one party among many competing for the hearts and minds of the people, and doing its best to win their support. We will never let the office of party leader become superior to that of head of government."
 HIP_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin The Reconstruction Process"
 HIP_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The decommodified economy Posada engineered, while a marvel in times of peace, was strained to the breaking point during the North Zebrican War, and it simply could not handle the catastrophic loss that followed. As much as it pains us, we have to begin a new economic policy."
 HIP_open_up_foreign_policy:0 "Reevaluate Foreign Policy"
 HIP_open_up_foreign_policy_desc:0 "The Posadist government shunned diplomacy with the imperialist powers of the world, and even relations with harmonists deteriorated. While we have no desire to negotiate with fascists, harmonists are another matter. It falls to us to rebuild those burnt bridges and take a place of peace and dignity among the nations."
 HIP_recallable_delegate_principle:0 "The Recallable Delegate Principle"
 HIP_recallable_delegate_principle_desc:0 "At any time and for any reason, a delegate can be recalled and replaced in a snap election. This one principle will ensure that the people are always in-touch with their representatives. Had we had it during the North Zebrican War, many lives may have been saved."
 HIP_soldiers_into_construction_workers:0 "Soldiers Into Construction Workers"
 HIP_soldiers_into_construction_workers_desc:0 "We have a massive armed forces, but we are not at war. Reducing military resources and moving soldiers into industrial and infrastructure jobs will help salvage our dysfunctional pseudo-economy and rebuild from the damage of the North Zebrican War. "Salina's Tree Army" may be a joke now, but it won't be in ten years."
 HIP_open_the_markets:0 "Open Limited Markets"
 HIP_open_the_markets_desc:0 "One of the hardest decisions we've ever faced, and one that divided the Presidium to the core, is that of limited markets. The remaining RWP delegates denounced the move as a concession to capitalism, but we have no choice. It's this, war communism, or economic collapse, and this is the least terrible option. Hopefully it will be a temporary measure."
 HIP_reach_out_to_STG:0 "Reach Out To Stalliongrad"
 HIP_reach_out_to_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, the home of revolution, may be our best shot at saving our floundering pseudo-economy. Through the spirit of international communism, hopefully they will see our dire need and come to our aid. Fortunately, they were one of the communist states that Posada maintained warm relations with."
 HIP_what_skynavia_got_right:0 "What Skynavia Got Right"
 HIP_what_skynavia_got_right_desc:0 "In a frozen hellhole at the top of the world, a band of idealistic griffons dared to dream. When the tyrant Kemerskai abolished elections, they broke away and founded their own society. While flawed in many ways, their model of democracy is an ideal one for our own."
 HIP_army_of_industry:0 "The Army Of Industry"
 HIP_army_of_industry_desc:0 "Conscription will be reshuffled into industrial work. Right now, we need cement, steel, and lumber far more than guns or tanks. In twenty years, perhaps, we can look at retaking Zumidia. For now we'll focus on civilian efforts."
 HIP_elevate_unions:0 "Elevate The Unions"
 HIP_elevate_unions_desc:0 "The unions largely disappeared under the Posadist decommodified society, but with the reintroduction of markets comes the necessity for the unions to return. There is no need to restore bosses; instead, workplace democracy can triumph."
 HIP_mutual_aid_societies:0 "Mutual Aid Societies"
 HIP_mutual_aid_societies_desc:0 "Unfortunately, with the return of money comes the return of poverty. But we will not let creatures starve. Charities, UBI, mutual aid networks, and credit unions will help the poor, and make life as bearable as possible for them."
 HIP_equestrian_support:0 "Request Equestrian Support"
 HIP_equestrian_support_desc:0 "Although relations with Equestria have been frosty since the revolution, they remain the greatest beacon of harmony in the world. They have one of the most powerful economies in existence, and feats deemed impossible for other nations are easy for them. We should reach out to these benevolent reactionaries and ask for ponyitarian aid."
 HIP_draft_a_bill_of_rights:0 "Draft A Bill Of Rights"
 HIP_draft_a_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "We cannot rely on the benevolence of our leaders and their proletarian nature to protect us from abuses of power. The time has come to codify, in immutable law, the rights of creatures and ensure they will be safeguarded. The revolution is important, yes, but if we get to upper-stage communism by abusing the people we are supposed to be helping, we've missed the point."
 HIP_healthcare_food_and_education:0 "Healthcare, Food, And Education For All"
 HIP_healthcare_food_and_education_desc:0 "With our industries somewhat functional again, we can restore critical aspects of life to be decommodified once more. While they will no longer be as before, they will be state-subsidized, paying farmers for their food and then distributing the food as needed."
 HIP_the_new_deal:0 "The New Deal"
 HIP_the_new_deal_desc:0 "If Posadism would be summarized in a single word, it would be "idealistic," with all the good and bad that entails. The RWP aimed for the stars, and sadly fell short. But that isn't the end of communism. We will learn from their mistakes and institute a New Deal for the people of Aris, with realistic, achievable goals in both the short and long term."
 HIP_invite_foreign_capital:0 "Invite Foreign Capital"
 HIP_invite_foreign_capital_desc:0 "There are many hungry capitalist powers looking to exploit our resources. While it pains us, this may be the best avenue to restoring economic growth. Using the bit as our currency will require Equestria's survival, but it will also help kickstart our economy. Hopefully history will forgive us..."
 HIP_peace_land_bread:0 "Peace, Land, Bread"
 HIP_peace_land_bread_desc:0 "These three words embody the philosophy of the SLPA. We are not hawks. We are not petty tyrants. And we are not plutocrats. While certain members of the RWP consider us revisionists, the support of the people speaks for itself. The gods smile upon Aris once more!"
 HIP_aris_soars_again:0 "The Enduring Bastion Of Communism"
 HIP_aris_soars_again_desc:0 "Despite all our trials, Revolutionary Aris has pulled through. While our system may not be as wonderful in good times as Posada's, it will hopefully prove to be more resilient against adversity. Glory to the workers!"
 HIP_powerful_friend:0 "A Powerful Friend"
 HIP_powerful_friend_desc:0 "Our industrial focus has left us admittedly vulnerable to the predations of other North Zebrican powers. Earning the protection of Stalliongrad, Wingbardy, or even Equestria, would guarantee our independence and security."

 HIP_subject_of_a_foreign_power_desc:0 "Our friends in [OVERLORD.GetName] have finally saved us from the communists and the fascists, letting us return to our proper nature as a monarchy by and for the people. But our work has only just begun. The war has left us devastated, and we have to build back better."
 HIP_hunt_the_communists:0 "Put Bounties On Commies"
 HIP_hunt_the_communists_desc:0 "Communists hate us because we're free, prosperous, and happy. They want to drag us all down into the black abyss of poverty with them. No more! Our esteemed Lord Keeper of the Royal Seal, Plumage Moonfeather, has signed an order offering 2,000 seashells for every communist--be they RWP, SLPA, PCCCA, or whatever--dead. Inquire about details at your local government office!"
 HIP_cage_the_queen:0 "The Serene And Regal Monarch Of All Aris"

 HIP_hunt_the_fascists:0 "Execute Aris First Leadership"
 HIP_hunt_the_fascists_desc:0 "Aris First chose their name to hide their true intentions to destroy Aris. Crack Lightning was infamous for his friendship with arch-communist Posada, and Raft Wood for his isolationism. Every member of the ruling commission of Aris First will be publicly executed. Glory to Aris!"
 HIP_were_a_puppet:0 "Cooperate With Newfound Allies"
 HIP_were_a_puppet_desc:0 "We have gone from a state loathed by our neighbours to one with three powerful allies. We should show them our appreciation, and make sure they don't withdraw their support due to the increasing costs of securing our freedom."
 HIP_tanks_in_the_streets:0 "Freedom, Security, And Peace"
 HIP_tanks_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Previous Arisian rulers never had to resort to putting tanks in the streets to keep the population in line, but that was because they exploited the complacency and indolence of the Arisian population. The new Arisian state cannot tolerate indolence, so we need a firmer claw."
 HIP_embezzle_money:0 "Reinvest Wisely"
 HIP_embezzle_money_desc:0 "Aris is in a unique position in that it has 4 legal currencies: our own rapidly devaluing Seashell, but also those used by Wingbardy, Colthage and Chiropterra. This offers unique opportunities for savvy individuals to rightly compensate themselves for their great service to Aris, and to throw the moralistic do-gooders and prying auditors off our trail."
 HIP_subjugation_day:0 "Declare Liberation Day"
 HIP_subjugation_day_desc:0 "The Three Days of Freedom are excessive and an anachronism. We were not free during the bad old days, and our Colthaginian allies have rightly objected to us celebrating our previous cowardice in the face of the Storm King. The three days will be replaced with one day, observed on the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Mount Aris, to celebrate our true liberation and our new place in the world."
 HIP_remove_basic_decency:0 "Streamline Excessive Wages"
 HIP_remove_basic_decency_desc:0 "Defeat is an ugly word to describe our liberation, but nonetheless it is sometimes important to remember that our new friends did defeat us, both on the battlefield and in the workplace. Let that be a lesson to us: the Chiropterran Labourer and the Colthaginian indentured worker outproduced us, so clearly their model of wages and working hours is the way of the future."
 HIP_a_puppet_forever:0 "The Arisian Phoenix"
 HIP_a_puppet_forever_desc:0 "Aris is strong, Aris is stable, Aris is profitable. We could not have gotten here on our own, and in an increasingly interconnected world it would be foolish to expect us to be on our own in the future. Aris rises from the ashes, together!"

 HIP_wingnot_accords:0 "Revisit The Zerma Accords"

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand The Aurez Mines"
 HIP_expand_highwing_mines_desc:0 "Our surveyors have found massive deposits of tungsten under the Aurez hills.

 HIP_ain_tougot:0 "Urbanize Ain Trotgourait"
 HIP_ain_tougot_desc:0 "Ain Trotgourait was sacked by the Storm King and has never really recovered. With our modern industry, we can restore it to its former beauty. It's time to begin a vast construction project and make Ain Trotgourait an amazing city once more."

 HIP_government_representation:0 "Zumidian Representation"

 HIP_integrate_zumidia:0 "Integrate Zumidia"
 HIP_integrate_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia is no longer a nation-state, but an integral part of our united kingdom. The people of Zumidia are our friends, and it's time to grant them full citizenship of Hippogriffia."

 HIP_self_rule:0 "Institute Self-Rule"
 HIP_self_rule_desc:0 "It only makes sense to restore Zumidia to its own state. The Zumidian people deserve to have a ruler of their own. The only question remaining is to what extent we should grant them autonomy. A new conference at Zerma should take care of that."

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"
 HIP_north_zebrican_union_desc:0 "It is time to formalize our cooperation with Zumidia into a North Zebrican Union. Mutual protection, economic aid and free trade, and scientific collaboration between our peoples will ensure a harmonic bulwark against any foreign threats."

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica:0 "Withdrawal From Zebrica"
 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place. We cannot risk entangling alliances on the continent, and so we should fully release Zumidia as a sovereign state. This is what's best for Zumidia too; they deserve to carve out their own destiny. Both of us will be happier as free, separate nations."

 HIP_north_zebrican_development:0 "North Zebrican Development Commission"

 HIP_north_zebrican_research:0 "North Zebrican Research Cooperative"
 HIP_north_zebrican_research_desc:0 "Education is what creates a people able to truly engage in politics without being swayed by rhetoric and thus to determine their own future.

To spread our song for all to hear, and for every creature to fall under our sway. There is no time to lose, and the show must begin."
 HIP_SIR_we_got_the_music:0 "We've Got The Music"
 HIP_SIR_we_got_the_music_desc:0 "Three. In all our time, the only sirens we have ever known have been ourselves. And now it is us against the entire world. So, we work together against them, our song playing above all else, because only we have the music to rule all. And if our partnership means we have to listen to each other now and again, so be it."
 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses:0 "Ready The Masses"
 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses_desc:0 "Our magic is powerful, but it is clear that magic is not the only weapon is this world now. Heroes and monsters do not win battles, armies and weapons do. Adagio may not realize it, but we will need these things if we are to survive in this era now. And the first step to this is making sure our future soldiers aren't too busy fighting themselves instead of our enemies..."
 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games:0 "No Time For Games"
 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games_desc:0 "Industrialization has changed this world to be nearly unrecognizable, with factories making up the power of a nation as much as its people or its magic. We are fortunate enough to be ahead of the rest of the world in many ways, but the system in place is... horribly inefficient for our plans. Some changes will have to be made, even if it may take some magic to do so."
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own:0 "An Army Of Our Own"
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own_desc:0 "One pony can no longer win a war. And unfortunately, neither can one siren. Fortunately, we have a lot of spare bodies in the form of our new subjects to fight instead. It will mean that they will no longer be able to fight for us to feed on, but that is a small price we will have to pay for an army."
 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories:0 ""Seize" The Factories"
 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories_desc:0 "In reality, there is no distinction between what is owned "privately" and what belongs to us. The hippogriffs already listen to our every command, after all. It's only a matter of making it official, and telling them to do what we want them to do."
 HIP_SIR_defending_what_matters:0 "Defending What Matters"
 HIP_SIR_defending_what_matters_desc:0 "The number one priority we have is our survival. We were banished once, and we must never let it happen again. And if that means the loss of life of others, than so be it. We will raise an army to defend us first, and follow Adagio's plans of conquest second."
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have:0 "Taking What We Have"
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have_desc:0 "There are many resources on this island, but much of it was wasted by the hippogriffs for trivial matters. That changes now, whether they like it or not. Ever drop of oil, every bit of metal will be used by us, for us, and we will do whatever it takes to find more to further our plans. Adagio might find the magical crystals under Mount Aris interesting as well..."
 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production:0 "The Means Of Production"
 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Weapons are no longer made by craftsmen and blacksmiths in forges, but by ordinary creatures lined up in factories. Normally places like these would be ideal for sowing discord, but in this case we need every factory working towards our defense and our future rule. Keeping them all in line and productive may be taxing, but in the end it may be the line between our victory and defeat."
 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us:0 "Those Who Fight For Us"
 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us_desc:0 "A modern army is built on discipline, order and the "chain of command". Unfortunately, these are traits that do not exactly go hoof-in-hoof with the effects our magic has on creatures. If we want to have an effective, strong, and most importantly united army to fight our enemies, sacrifices may have to be made..."
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations:0 "Last Minute Preparations"
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations_desc:0 "Many countries on this world have countless years of experience in warfare, battle and weapon technology, having fought each other for centuries in wars that have killed thousands for petty reasons. We do not have that luxury, nor the time to make up for it. Still, these "war games" can at least mitigate the gap, and hopefully help us catch up on military knowledge before our plans are truly set in motion."
 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_my_voice:0 "The Sound Of My Voice"
 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_my_voice_desc:0 "A voice is a siren's very being, the core of who they are and what they do. Such a talent proved unmatched before our banishment, and it remains so today. Is there no better reason for our inherent right to rule the world and all the pathetic creatures on it? We are only giving them what they deserve; a taste of our beautiful song."
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant:0 "The Siren Constant"
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant_desc:0 "Having to manage every single affair on this island is tiring, and ultimately a waste of a siren's ability. But keeping one to absolute loyalty usually has negative effects on their capability to manage said affairs. What I need is someone new, someone else who can deal with the trivial issues in our stead, while being loyal without a song or magic."
 HIP_SIR_the_collaboration_corps:0 "The Collaboration Corps"
 HIP_SIR_the_collaboration_corps_desc:0 "Despite the surprisingly competent work that our new Constant has done, he is only one Hippogriff. With that in mind, he has requested permission to create his own group of non-enthralled lackeys, which he promises he will be able to keep in line with more standard threats and uses of force. As long as it does not bother us, we see no problem with this."
 HIP_SIR_the_web_of_my_song:0 "The Web Of My Song"
 HIP_SIR_the_web_of_my_song_desc:0 "We have done much already, but we are still only three sirens. We can not be everywhere at once, and enthralling entire populations would prove... troublesome, to say the least. Fortunately, I have thought of an excellent solution involving those magical crystals under the capital. Who says we have to be the only ones that can sing to a crowd?"
 HIP_SIR_a_city_of_melody:0 "A City Of Melody"
 HIP_SIR_a_city_of_melody_desc:0 "Mount Aris is a city of wonder on Zebrica, one of the greatest of the continent. However, it is still not at its full potential, and its praise to us as a place and our capital is lacking. Time rectifying this would be time well spent, both rightfully and practically."
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after:0 "What Comes After"
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after_desc:0 "In shortsighted foolishness, many creatures choose to take up arms and fruitlessly fight against us, even after victory. Our magic may make their efforts futile, but it does nothing to cease their efforts directly. Should we wish to secure or pacify our future territories, we will have to take more... direct approaches."
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies:0 "Utilize The Seaponies"
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies_desc:0 "The underwater realm we used to take over the rest of this island still has its uses, if used correctly. With it, we control the seaponies, the depths below the ocean, and most importantly, a place where we can build whatever we may need for the future that none of our enemies can touch."
 HIP_SIR_subjects_to_serve:0 "Subjects To Serve"
 HIP_SIR_subjects_to_serve_desc:0 "Compliance towards us, despite all we've done and all the work our subjects have accomplished, is still lacking. In particular, the few elite that Moonfeather has been unable to convince remain annoyances. They will be brought into the fold no matter what they think, and Aria will be satisfied about the companies left behind."
 HIP_SIR_our_time_is_now:0 "Our Time Is Now"
 HIP_SIR_our_time_is_now_desc:0 "The time for planning and preparation is ending. Now is the time act, to begin to show the rest of the world what we are bringing to them. With everything in place, we will be ready to spread the song to more than just this island, which was only the start. No, this is only the beginning of our glorious rule over all."
 HIP_SIR_the_rising_resistance:0 "The Rising Resistance"
 HIP_SIR_the_rising_resistance_desc:0 "The hippogriffs may no longer be in power, but they are not done fighting yet. Even now they plot from their shadows, seeking to overthrow our rule as a thorn in our sides. Ending these games once and for all should be our highest priority."
 HIP_SIR_lies_and_deception:0 "Lies And Deception"
 HIP_SIR_lies_and_deception_desc:0 "Can you really trust the one they call Posada? Her claims of a new society may be grand, but they are rooted in a truly insidious ideology, one which is incompatible with "Harmony" itself. Their crimes can not be allowed to continue, so why do you let them into your very ranks? Can't you see that you're playing right into her hooves?"
 HIP_SIR_fear_and_doubt:0 "Fear And Doubt"
 HIP_SIR_fear_and_doubt_desc:0 "Aris First tells you that they only have the interests of hippogriffs at heart and nothing more. But in truth, their ambitions are far greater than they would have you believe. Nationalism is a rot, a poison that kills everything you claim to fight for. It causes pain, suffering and death, and allowing it into your nation will cause all those things to closely follow."
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart:0 "Break Them Apart"
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart_desc:0 "The resistance is at a breaking point, the various factions at each other's throats. All they need is the smallest push to go over the edge, and we are very willing to provide that push. Once their unity is in the grave, hunting down whatever remains will be foal's play."
 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary:0 "The Revolutionary"
 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary_desc:0 "Posada. A nobody turned firebrand revolutionary, and the face of the communist faction of the resistance. She holds perhaps the most disgusting ideology we have ever heard of, holding beliefs that all creatures are "equal" and that the world is meant to achieve some sort of "revolution" together. Such ideals have no place in our new domain, and neither does she."
 HIP_SIR_the_princess:0 "The Princess"
 HIP_SIR_the_princess_desc:0 "Princess Skystar is the linchpin in everything the resistance is and has done. She is the unifying figure, once for all of Aris and even now for all the remaining Harmonists hiding on this island and in Seaquestria. This annoying distraction starts, and ends, with her."
 HIP_SIR_the_nationalist:0 "The Nationalist"
 HIP_SIR_the_nationalist_desc:0 "Crack Lightning, a wolf in sheep's clothing. Charismatic, intelligent, and deceptive. In a different situation, he might have even been able to take over this country. Unfortunately for him, we are the ones who hunt wolves. He may think himself a big fish now, but soon he'll see just how small of a pond he was in."
 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution:0 "Death Of The Revolution"
 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "As we knew it would, Posada and her insidious ideology has finally fallen. Her supporters gone to the wind, her dreams shattered into dust, and the seapony herself being held in Seaquestria. All we need to do now is decide what her fate shall be."
 HIP_SIR_the_fall_of_aris:0 "The Fall Of Aris"
 HIP_SIR_the_fall_of_aris_desc:0 "Aris First is no more, its leadership in our hooves. The idea of a strong Aris, of any sort of nation separate from us is dead, as it should be. And while we may hold Crack Lightning in higher regard than most of these pathetic creatures, that does not mean we will show any more mercy for daring to go against our will."
 HIP_SIR_a_shattered_crown:0 "A Shattered Crown"
 HIP_SIR_a_shattered_crown_desc:0 "The pieces are in place, and the board is set. With her friends gone, her resistance in complete shambles, Princess Skystar is alone. Now we move in for the kill, and end this charade once and for all. It's time for the final curtain call."
 HIP_SIR_return_to_the_mainland:0 "Return To The Mainland"
 HIP_SIR_return_to_the_mainland_desc:0 "Ravaged by a "Storm King" just a few years prior, the Hippogriffs once had control over the territory known as Zumidia, who took the chaos created in our rise to break away as an independent nation. Now they will serve as the springboard for our entrance onto the continent, as the first nation of many to fall to our armies, our magic, and our song."
 HIP_SIR_crescendo:0 "Crescendo"
 HIP_SIR_crescendo_desc:0 "Zumidia has fallen, as we knew it would. The new population of zebras will serve us well, as a new source of magic to feed off of. But now that we are on Zebrica itself, it is time to prepare for the next major step in our plans; the conquest of all the nations surrounding us, to bring more subjects under our control."
 HIP_SIR_strike_the_colthaginians:0 "Strike The Colthaginians"
 HIP_SIR_strike_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "To the east lie the Colthaginians, a powerful nation of North Zebrica that could potentially rival us militarily in power if given the chance. Though it is not a part of our primary goal, that being revenge against those who banished us, a preemptive attack will ensure non-interference in our future affairs."
 HIP_SIR_ignore_the_distraction:0 "Ignore The Distraction"
 HIP_SIR_ignore_the_distraction_desc:0 "Colthage is nothing more than a distraction from our true goals, and going after such an irrelevant region would be nothing but a waste of time. Effort would be better spent fortifying the border not out of any fear, but to dissuade any thoughts from the Colthaginians of trying to press any notions of 'rightful land'. If they will leave us alone, than we shall do the same... for now."
 HIP_SIR_the_zonician_excuse:0 "The Zonician Excuse"
 HIP_SIR_the_zonician_excuse_desc:0 "Much of the propaganda used in Colthage for any conflict was based on some ancient cultural construct known as 'Zonicia', or a union of zebras in the region. While such claims are obviously pathetic compared to our right to rule all, it would serve well as an excuse to grab some more land we desire..."
 HIP_SIR_the_southern_threat:0 "The Southern Threat"
 HIP_SIR_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "Upon studying conflicts before our return, we have found that the nations of Quaggatai and Colthage have never had good relations. In fact, relations were actively hostile, with the former stealing land after the latter's weakness. The anger that the Zonicians have at such a perceived crime can now be used for an actual purpose; war against the ancient enemy of their proud culture."
 HIP_SIR_warzenas_mistake:0 "Warzena's Mistake"
 HIP_SIR_warzenas_mistake_desc:0 "When Hippogriffia was still under a weak harmonic monarchy, Warzena relied on them for protection, beliving that they would save them from any threats. Now, with us in charge, they have nowhere else to turn to. We are generous enough to offer a new kind of protection, however; a place as our subjects and a seat for the show."
 HIP_SIR_clean_the_mess:0 "Clean The Mess"
 HIP_SIR_clean_the_mess_desc:0 "The fact that Chiropterra still exists after a thousand years just goes to show that the Equestrians will never clean up after their own mistakes, especially their ancient ones. It's time for us to do what they won't, and wipe this mess that they left behind who plagued the region for over a thousand years. They will give up their faith and serve us alone now, whether they like it or not."
 HIP_SIR_against_the_menace:0 "Against The Menace"
 HIP_SIR_against_the_menace_desc:0 "Chiropterra is an interesting state, to put it mildly. Fanatically devoted to their goddess almost as much as our subjects are to us, they are nothing but a relic of a bygone era fighting for a failed cause. To say that others in North Zebrica hate them would be putting it mildly, and now that we are in direct conflict with them we can use those sentiments for a greater purpose."
 HIP_SIR_the_sandy_wastes:0 "The Sandy Wastes"
 HIP_SIR_the_sandy_wastes_desc:0 "Zarantia is little more than a desert wasteland, with little value to be gained from taking it. Yet, they hold a key piece we need, that being a connection to Maregypt, our future target. So, they too will experience the wonder that is our song, and be subjects to our rightful rule."
 HIP_SIR_wipe_the_slate:0 "Wipe The Slate"
 HIP_SIR_wipe_the_slate_desc:0 "A false state, Tobuck does not have a right to exist. Or at least, that seems to be the popular opinion here, with it surrounded by three nations that all claim it as their own. While their rhetoric turned out to be all bark and no bite, we will show that our demands are more than just words."
 HIP_SIR_leave_the_wetwork:0 "Leave The Wetwork"
 HIP_SIR_leave_the_wetwork_desc:0 "Being depopulated, hot and unindustrialized, spending time in Zarantia would be a complete waste of time for any of us. Our Constant and a few Beacons of Magic will be sent instead to deal with any issues that appear there; the Beacons will be able to pacify such a wasteland with relative ease, and perhaps the Constant will even be able to find some use from the endless dunes."
 HIP_SIR_under_our_spell:0 "Under Our Spell"
 HIP_SIR_under_our_spell_desc:0 "North Zebrica is ours, and all of the immediate threats to us have been dealt with. But as our spell and power expands, so too does our ambitions. It's time for us to focus on what we care about most; revenge against those who have wronged us, whether that be our neighbors to the west or our old homeland from across the seas."
 HIP_SIR_homophony:0 "Homophony"
 HIP_SIR_homophony_desc:0 "There are three sirens, but there can only be one leader. One voice must rise above the other two for them to follow. Our system of switching leads has worked so far, but it is time for a more permanent solution to be found in this regard. One siren must learn to fill the role, and the two must learn to follow their lead."
 HIP_SIR_destroy_the_insult:0 "Destroy The Insult"
 HIP_SIR_destroy_the_insult_desc:0 "Maregypt's existence is a stain upon this world, and a direct insult to us. They dare name their capital after one of those "Pillars of Equestria", the very same ponies who banished us all those years ago! Even now they harbor Somnambula herself, a figure of praise in their revisionist history. This will not stand."
 HIP_SIR_leave_no_trace:0 "Leave No Trace"
 HIP_SIR_leave_no_trace_desc:0 "The city of Somnambula, in particular its name, is an offense to our existence that we can not tolerate. They glorify one of the greatest villains of the ancient times, who kept creatures from enjoying the freedom and music we bring, and delegating us to mere legend. This city must be renamed, the old one being erased from history. No one will remember that blasted "Pillar" by the time we are done."
 HIP_SIR_the_ponies_of_maregypt:0 "The Ponies Of Maregypt"
 HIP_SIR_the_ponies_of_maregypt_desc:0 "The Maregyptians cannot be allowed any sort of leniency, especially with what they attempted in their history. Our Beacons must be sent en masse, their obedience guaranteed towards us. They are ours, now and forever. And we will make sure they never forget it."
 HIP_SIR_the_springboard:0 "The Springboard"
 HIP_SIR_the_springboard_desc:0 "Abyssinia is the last step in our plans westward in Zebrica. They hold no particular value themselves, but their land will be necessary for our invasion of Equestria across the ocean. With their petty territorial dispute with Maregypt and the Storm King's attack years ago, defeating them should be trivial." 
 HIP_SIR_primo_and_secondo:0 "Primo And Secondo"
 HIP_SIR_primo_and_secondo_desc:0 "Every siren needs a partner. A second fiddle to their melody. An accompaniment to support their music. Each of us have our talents, yet there must be a strictly defined order on hierarchy. If there is not, that who is to say one of us will not one day betray the others?"
 HIP_SIR_the_islands_of_the_canterbbean:0 "The Islands Of The Canterbbean"
 HIP_SIR_the_islands_of_the_canterbbean_desc:0 "There are many small islands between Zebrica and Equestria, possible naval bases and staging points for our attack on the continent. Many of them are subjects of powers we do not wish to fight yet, but should that situation change, they would make easy targets for us..."
 HIP_SIR_our_natural_allies:0 "Our Natural Allies"
 HIP_SIR_our_natural_allies_desc:0 "We and the changelings are species that are similar yet opposites. They feed on love, we feed on hate. And yet we share a common goal; the fall of Equestria and Harmony. They too were disgraced by the ponies, banished back to their hives only a few years ago. They would make excellent, if temporary, allies against our common enemy."
 HIP_SIR_all_we_need_is_us:0 "All We Need Is Us"
 HIP_SIR_all_we_need_is_us_desc:0 "We do not need anyone else in our question for vengeance. So-called 'allies' are nothing but weakness, a disgraceful idea akin to such ones as "friendship". The only thing we need is us, as sirens, to defeat anyone. We will not compromise, we will take all of our old homeland alone, no matter what it takes to do it!"
 HIP_SIR_consolidate_zebrica:0 "Consolidate Zebrica"
 HIP_SIR_consolidate_zebrica_desc:0 "While we fight a glorious war on Equus, we can not afford our Zebrican holdings to have any sort of insubordination or trouble, especially when our armies will be an ocean across. Necessity requires that problems no longer be a possibility, so both our loyal Constant and our Beacons of Magic will have their resources expanded to better achieve their duties at hoof."
 HIP_SIR_revenge:0 "Revenge"
 HIP_SIR_revenge_desc:0 "This is it, the moment we've been waiting for. And no, it's not lunch this time. Our great return back to our old feeding grounds, our great revenge; this is what everything we have done has led up to. The lands of Equestria shall fall, and the ponies shall return to how things should be; with us as their one and only masters!"
 HIP_SIR_the_partition:0 "The Partition"
 HIP_SIR_the_partition_desc:0 "The war is over, but our rule is not secure yet. The changelings did play a part in defeating the Equestrians, and they expect their share of the spoils. They do not trust us anywhere near actual negotiations, so we will send our Constant to discuss the terms of Equestria's land and ponies. The fate of the Pillars of Equestria will, of course, be non-negotiable."
 HIP_SIR_dealing_with_the_partners:0 "Dealing With The "Partners""
 HIP_SIR_dealing_with_the_partners_desc:0 "Our alliance was always meant to be temporary. A means to an end until we inevitably backstab them and being them into our musical fold. But pacifying Equestria will take time, and a long war against our former allies is not in our interests at the moment. One way or another, our relationship with our new neighbors must be resolved."
 HIP_SIR_sweep_the_remainder:0 "Sweep The Remainder"
 HIP_SIR_sweep_the_remainder_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen, but our work remains unfinished. Stalliongrad remains a disgusting communist thorn in our side, and the Crystal Empire harbors the Pillar Mistmane. An illegitimate breakaway and a realm banished just as we were. Both will fall so our victory is secure."
 HIP_SIR_the_jewels_of_equestria:0 "The Jewels Of Equestria"
 HIP_SIR_the_jewels_of_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria has changed. Where there was once farmland and mere peasant villages, there are now sprawling cities with millions of ponies all in a single place. These are the new jewels of Equestria, and they are ours to claim, all we have to do is go and take them for ourselves."
 HIP_SIR_fate_of_the_pillars:0 "Fate Of The Pillars"
 HIP_SIR_fate_of_the_pillars_desc:0 "Rockhoof. Meadowbrook. Flash Magnus. Somnambula. Mistmane. Starswirl. Even Stygian, the one who originally brought them together to banish us. We have them all now, and their fates are ours to decide. Finally, they will get their just due for their crimes all those years ago."
 HIP_SIR_nothing_can_stop_us_now:0 "Nothing Can Stop Us Now"
 HIP_SIR_nothing_can_stop_us_now_desc:0 "The ponies are ours. Equestria, ours. Vengeance, ours. We have all we want and more, everything we ever desired at our hooves bowing before us. Our journey may not be over yet, but with everything we've done, all the music we've spread to the unenlightened masses... nothing can stop us now."
 HIP_SIR_learn_from_our_mistakes:0 "Learn From Our Mistakes"
 HIP_SIR_learn_from_our_mistakes_desc:0 "Despite the progress we've made, we can never stop learning from the present and the new experiences we have. Both us and our military have to be constantly able to adjust to new situations, new developments, and new tactics of warfare to remain effective. In particular now is our failures in the planning and supply during our invasion of Zumidia, issues that will now be rectified."
 HIP_SIR_the_spoils_of_zumidia:0 "The Spoils Of Zumidia"
 HIP_SIR_the_spoils_of_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia has something very important beneath the ground, reserves of Tungsten we will need for the future. The hippogriffs likely knew this, but they did little to exploit or extract the metal, either lacking the technology or not wanting to seem like imperialists or foolish reasons along those lines. We have no such qualms, and are certainly willing to put in the effort required."
 HIP_SIR_secure_the_mainland:0 "Secure The Mainland"
 HIP_SIR_secure_the_mainland_desc:0 "We can not rest just because Zumidia and the foothold on Zebrica is ours. If we do not act upon our gains, we could just as easily lose it. Railroads, infrastructure, defensive lines must be planned and constructed across the region so that when war inevitably comes, whether it be by us or by them, we will be prepared."
 HIP_SIR_lessons_of_the_invasion:0 "Lessons Of The Invasion"
 HIP_SIR_lessons_of_the_invasion_desc:0 "The invasion of Zumidia may have been easy compared to what the future has in store, but there are still important lessons we can take from it. Many of our enthralled soldiers did not have everything they needed to fight or occupy the territory, decreasing their effectiveness in the war. Developing specific sections of the army to fill such gaps could prove useful for later."
 HIP_SIR_factories_on_the_front:0 "Factories On The Front"
 HIP_SIR_factories_on_the_front_desc:0 "Zumidia is relatively unindustrialized compared to our holdings on Aris, and most of our industry remains on the latter. However, there may come a need where such an industry is required on Zumidia as well. Focusing on their capital of Ain Trotgourait would likely be a worthwhile investment."
 HIP_SIR_war_in_the_sky:0 "War In The Sky"
 HIP_SIR_war_in_the_sky_desc:0 "Land and sea may be important to hold, but the sky has always been a part of warfare as well. Creatures that fly have always had an advantage over those that don't, and the invention of the plane has made this third dimension even more crucial to fight in. Victory in every way must be guaranteed to secure success."
 HIP_SIR_literally_1984:0 "The Panopticon"
 HIP_SIR_literally_1984_desc:0 "A very interesting idea has been discovered, one that may hold much potential. Rough plans, sketches for a structure called a panopticon, which in theory would be able to watch hundreds of people from a single tower, while only needing one or two creatures stationed inside. Given how difficult the resistance was to deal with, acting on such measures may not be as ridiculous as first thought..."
 HIP_SIR_the_issue_of_races:0 "The Issue Of Races"
 HIP_SIR_the_issue_of_races_desc:0 "The conquest of North Zebrica has given us a multitude of races as our subjects, from the ponies and thestrals in Chiropterra to the zebras in Zarantia. While our policy of playing seaponies and hippogriffs against each other was practical and worked well before, such racial conflicts do not help us in creating a united and more importantly secure state. Something must be done."
 HIP_SIR_the_legacy_of_zonicia:0 "The Legacy Of Zonicia"
 HIP_SIR_the_legacy_of_zonicia_desc:0 "One thing united the zebras of Colthage beyond borders, and that was a cultural idea of Zonicia. Adagio was right in it being irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, but that does not mean the idea has no use. We control all the zebras labeled as such, and they can be lumped into one region to make dealing with any issues that may arise slightly easier."
 HIP_SIR_industrialize_hippone:0 "Industrialize Hippone"
 HIP_SIR_industrialize_hippone_desc:0 "Hippone is a large city with potential, wasted on frivolities that bring no use. It was left wasting, but no longer. Bringing true modernity by force, we will turn it from a backwater to a shining star that may rival Colthage, all in service of us."
 HIP_SIR_rubber_plantations_of_kizil_zeb:0 "Rubber Plantations Of Kizil-Zeb"
 HIP_SIR_rubber_plantations_of_kizil_zeb_desc:0 "The Coltvans are a stubborn part of Colthage, waging a guerilla war against their masters only to try and free themselves from the perceived chains of the landowners. This may have posed a problem to many, but for us the solution is simple; the local rubber plantations need zebras to work them, and they are an excellent place to keep zebras we think may be subversive against us."
 HIP_SIR_the_scientifids:0 "The Scientifids"
 HIP_SIR_the_scientifids_desc:0 "In Colthage, there was a class of zebras known as the Scientifids, who had a high amount of influence in the function of the state. They are scattered to the wind now, but many of their qualities are ones that would be useful to us. We will find the intellectuals left and bring them back together to serve us, and bring order and progress to our creatures."
 HIP_SIR_order_in_colthage:0 "Order In Colthage"
 HIP_SIR_order_in_colthage_desc:0 "The fall of the old and obsolete state has left a hole of authority in Colthage, one that we have yet to fill. Chaos runs rampant and threatens to spiral out of control without intervention. We will have order once again, whether the zebras like it or not."
 HIP_SIR_the_eastern_frontier:0 "The Eastern Frontier"
 HIP_SIR_the_eastern_frontier_desc:0 "To call Quaggatai a backwater or a wasteland would be an understatement compared to the more developed regions of North Zebrica. Should we be attacked from the east, though, it would be the first point of contact between our armies and them. The eventuality must be prepared for, and the infrastructure built up to keep the region connected to our other holdings."
 HIP_SIR_control_the_cities:0 "Control The Cities"
 HIP_SIR_control_the_cities_desc:0 "It is not the land that we have conquered that we care about, but the creatures that live on it. And nowhere are they more concentrated than the urban cities. These places must be the first we focus on, keeping our hold steady and stable so they in time become loyal and obedient thralls to our rule."
 HIP_SIR_shatter_the_chiropterrans:0 "Shatter The Chiropterrans"
 HIP_SIR_shatter_the_chiropterrans_desc:0 "Even with our song, our armies and our might, the Chiropterrans do not give up. They are relentless in their resistance, fighting us and our lessers at every opportunity. This will not stand. Swift retribution and decisive force will be used to blow any thought of fighting back away, and they will fall in line just like everyone else."
 HIP_SIR_for_wheelzies:0 "Motorize The Armies"
 HIP_SIR_for_wheelzies_desc:0 "Our armies must be mobile, flexible and well-supplied for future conflict at all times. A key part of all these points is the truck, the vehicle which allows speeds far beyond any non-mechanical method. Research will be put into improving such vital parts of warfare, so that our soldiers may always fight at their best."
 HIP_SIR_use_the_LMRD:0 "Use The LMRD"
 HIP_SIR_use_the_LMRD_desc:0 "The Legionary Medical Research Department, or commonly abbreviated as the LMRD was the primary medical and biological task force working for the state of Chiropterra. Some may consider their methods and results unethical, or their members as sociopaths, but such things do not bother us if they give results. It's time to give their facilities a visit."
 HIP_SIR_beneath_the_sand:0 "Beneath The Sand"
 HIP_SIR_beneath_the_sand_desc:0 "Adagio's constant, despite his failings and his obvious self-interest, has actually found something of use for once. In Zarantia, massive wells of oil have been discovered, enough for us to possibly reach self-sufficiency with time. The "black gold" as it is called must be ours, whether it be by manipulation or force."
 HIP_SIR_chiropterran_military_tactics:0 "Chiropterran Military Tactics"
 HIP_SIR_chiropterran_military_tactics_desc:0 "The Chiropterran military, in particular the Legions was a highly skilled combat force, using experience and tactics that made them all the more effective. We will never be able to practically recreate such units, but we can adopt their most tested and useful strategies for our own uses."
 HIP_SIR_connect_the_north:0 "Connect The North"
 HIP_SIR_connect_the_north_desc:0 "It became painfully obvious during war that the various regions in Zebrica are unacceptably underdeveloped and disconnected from each other. If we are to get the most from all the creatures under our spell, we need to be able to reach them quickly and effectively. And that means building more railroads."
 HIP_SIR_underwater_colonies:0 "Underwater Colonies"
 HIP_SIR_underwater_colonies_desc:0 "Seaquestria has already proven itself almost untouchable by our enemies by sheer virtue of being deep beneath the waves. With that in mind, it would be a folly not to replicate its success elsewhere. Seapony colony cities along the coast will extend our influence into the seas and act as invincible bases from which to coordinate action, occupation and administration."
 HIP_SIR_bases_of_the_invasion:0 "Bases Of The Invasion"
 HIP_SIR_bases_of_the_invasion_desc:0 "The islands between Zebrica and Equus pale in comparison to our other holdings, but they have an important purpose nonetheless. They make important air and naval bases to station and maintain our air force and navy. Both of such places should be immediately expanded, so they can find a better purpose and fit better in that role."
 HIP_SIR_the_westward_railways:0 "The Westward Railways"
 HIP_SIR_the_westward_railways_desc:0 "Stretching across the central seas, we have once again run into the problem of the disconnect between Abyssinia, Maregypt and the rest of the mainland possessions due to incompetence in coordination between countries. Fortunately, it seems that the regions are already connected themselves, with a few holes to cover. That, we can manage ourselves."
 HIP_SIR_press_the_maregyptians:0 "Press The Maregyptians"
 HIP_SIR_press_the_maregyptians_desc:0 "We still haven't forgotten the insult the Maregyptians committed upon us by daring to vindicate and even memorialize a Pillar like Somnambula as a hero. Loss of independence and enthrallment is not enough of a punishment for them; even Adagio agrees on this for once. They need a harsh lesson in who controls who now, and perhaps some service in the military can teach them that lesson the hard way."
 HIP_SIR_four_cities_of_the_west:0 "Four Cities Of The West"
 HIP_SIR_four_cities_of_the_west_desc:0 "Adagia. R'ataphet. Coltuba. Panthera. These four cities make up the most important parts of Maregypt and Abyssinia, three of them being ports and shipyards along the coast. They must be expanded for that purpose, while Panthera will be turned into a city of factories producing more weapons for our war efforts."
 HIP_SIR_hold_the_seas:0 "Hold The Seas"
 HIP_SIR_hold_the_seas_desc:0 "The role of our navy will play a critical part in our war with the ponies. Not only will we need to make landfall, but also keep supply lines open across the ocean to keep our soldiers supplied as they ensure the fall of Equestria for us. Temporary measures will keep our naval dominance secure, at least for the war."
 HIP_SIR_bolster_the_garrisons:0 "Bolster The Garrisons"
 HIP_SIR_bolster_the_garrisons_desc:0 "The Equestrians will not quietly bow to our rule. That much we learned the hard way over a thousand years ago. There will be no chances taken this time; they will have no opportunity afforded to them. No matter how much it takes to send over, we will keep the ponies obedient, in line, and out of trouble until the war ends and we can focus on a more... permanent solution."
 HIP_SIR_the_elites_of_equestria:0 "The Elites Of Equestria"
 HIP_SIR_the_elites_of_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen, but its creatures remain. The process of integrating them as another part of our lands will be long, and unfeasible in any reasonable amount of time. That does not mean we can not start taking the first steps, though. The elites of former Equestria would be a good start; we just need to decide exactly who."
 HIP_SIR_what_is_music:0 "What Is Music?"
 HIP_SIR_what_is_music_desc:0 "We as sirens are the greatest musicians that this world has ever seen, and our voices are matched by none, whether it be in song or in sound. But others can create music too, and some things they have played are not that bad. Maybe they have talent that we should let show too?"
 HIP_SIR_hippogriffs_and_zebras:0 "Hippogriffs And Zebras"
 HIP_SIR_hippogriffs_and_zebras_desc:0 "The hippogriffs have experience on Zumidia, having run some sort of "mandate" for multiple years over them. We should put that experience to use, and send a few over to help keep things safe over there. After all, if they already know each other, everything will go better, right?"
 HIP_SIR_the_child_king:0 "The Child King"
 HIP_SIR_the_child_king_desc:0 "Apparently the King of Zumidia or whatever is a child who had some council ruling for him instead. Now Adagio wants me to go over and make sure that he'll work with us to keep his country pacified, since he's been behaving ever since she locked him in his own palace. She never told me exactly how to convince him, though..."
 HIP_SIR_combine_the_corporations:0 "Combine The Corporations"
 HIP_SIR_combine_the_corporations_desc:0 "Aria has given a pretty good suggestion, that being having all the hippogriffs merge their military corporations into one big one so we can manage them easier. We could even have them be separate from that bird Plumage for once, even if he gets mad about it. We can't have him do everything, after all."
 HIP_SIR_ending_the_mandate:0 "Ending The Mandate"
 HIP_SIR_ending_the_mandate_desc:0 "When the hippogriffs were here before, Zumidia was never meant to be more than a temporary mandate until a better solution could be found. But now, we are that better solution. With the Zumidians fully integrated under our control, any concept of another "mandate" has been replaced with full integration as a part of our lands."
 HIP_SIR_the_musical_rnd_department:0 "The Musical R&D Department"
 HIP_SIR_the_musical_rnd_department_desc:0 "Another idea by Aria was to create a sort of research group that we keep unenthralled, so that they can work well together to invent and create new things for us to use to take over the world! It sounds fun, and interesting too, which is surprising for something coming from that no-fun siren..."
 HIP_SIR_the_proposal:0 "The Proposal"
 HIP_SIR_the_proposal_desc:0 "Many would assume that we do not care about the lives of our subjects. That we see them as nothing more than pawns in a game. And they are pawns, but that does not mean we do not care about them in our own special way. A predator caring for its prey may be a strange idea, but we need to keep our sources of magic alive and well."
 HIP_SIR_survey_the_situation:0 "Survey The Situation"
 HIP_SIR_survey_the_situation_desc:0 "There's a lot we're going to have to do in North Zebrica, each place in a different way from the others. But, being honest, we have no idea what those things we need to do are, or even what's going on. Just looking around and figuring out what we need to do will be a good first step."
 HIP_SIR_bring_together_the_zebras:0 "Bring Together The Zebras"
 HIP_SIR_bring_together_the_zebras_desc:0 "In many ways, Warzena has a lot in common with Zumidia, a region which we've already got completely under our control. Therefore, the easiest and most straightforward option is to just make it an extended part of Zumidia, with the same methods we used for the zebras. It will still take a while, but this way we can just sit back and wait for everything to fix itself."
 HIP_SIR_pearl_of_the_bay:0 "Pearl Of The Bay"
 HIP_SIR_pearl_of_the_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck is a central city in North Zebrica, and possibly the most important one we've taken. Fortunately, there aren't that many problems with it, besides perhaps a few underground cells and a few warlords left behind in the chaos running around. Nothing too of notice, but fixing whatever small issues we need to will go a long way in this case."
 HIP_SIR_the_laborers_of_chiropterra:0 "The Laborers Of Chiropterra"
 HIP_SIR_the_laborers_of_chiropterra_desc:0 "There were two primary classes in Chiropterra; the regular loyalists, and the laborers taken from raids to work as practical slaves for their cause. Being such a totalitarian, oppressive regime, we could actually gain a major bit of goodwill for freeing them on their former masters. At the same time, the old system was efficient, and Aria wants to keep it around to keep all those creatures in check..."
 HIP_SIR_the_city_reclaimed:0 "The City Reclaimed"
 HIP_SIR_the_city_reclaimed_desc:0 "With any minor inconveniences solved, we can now go ahead and bring in Tobuck as an integral part of our lands, and as our newest creatures to fall under our complete control. We'll make better rulers than anyone else nearby anyway, right? We aren't some warlord who wants some crazy goal, and we do care about people, so that makes us the good guys!"
 HIP_SIR_music_and_the_moon:0 "Music And The Moon"
 HIP_SIR_music_and_the_moon_desc:0 "Chiropterra as a state, as a culture, everything about it revolved around one thing; bringing about the return of some alter-ego for an Equestrian princess. Their devotion rivaled even what those under our spell have, and it may be a good idea to pull that devotion out to make sure they praise us alone. Our song still keeps them compliant, however, so maybe that would be more trouble that it's worth?"
 HIP_SIR_dunes_of_zarantia:0 "Dunes Of Zarantia"
 HIP_SIR_dunes_of_zarantia_desc:0 "Considering the little population in Zarantia and the nature of the desert they live in, the full integration of the former nation could be described as little else but tedious. Fortunately, the same things that made it difficult also made it quick, and the matter of keeping the place under our control should be wrapped up soon, just like all the rest of the creatures here."
 HIP_SIR_a_mistake_rectified:0 "A Mistake Rectified"
 HIP_SIR_a_mistake_rectified_desc:0 "After a long period of reforms, tedious decision making, and generally unfun activities, the state of Chiropterra is, for better or for worse, an integral part of our holdings. Their population now serving us, they can finally find a use serving new masters, not some young and insane moon immortal."
 HIP_SIR_the_many_issues_of_colthage:0 "The Many Issues Of Colthage"
 HIP_SIR_the_many_issues_of_colthage_desc:0 "Colthage is, to an unfortunately degree, a place of many problems and few obvious solutions. So little solutions, in fact, that for once I don't know where to even begin with it. I should talk with Aria or Adagio; maybe they'll know how to help me deal with the zebras?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_land:0 "On The Issue Of Land"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_land_desc:0 "Land was and still is an ever-present question in Colthage, one that has divided landowner and peasant for years now, particularly in the region of Coltva. There are no issues or rebellion from the peasant masses anymore, of course, but the fact remains we still need to take a side in this debate. Who should control and own the land on our behalf?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_politics:0 "On The Issue Of Politics"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_politics_desc:0 "It turns out that none of us three want to actually move to Colthage and make sure everything works there. Go figure. However, the hole in authority that we left by taking over still has to be filled by someone, even as they are still subject to us. The question in this case is; who will that be?"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_nationalism:0 "On The Issue Of Nationalism"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_nationalism_desc:0 "There are two tangible movements of nationalism simultaneously in Colthage; one of pan-Zonicianism and one of regionalism. Each has its own use, whether it be for keeping the Colthaginians together or driving them apart. We can't support both of them at once obviously, so the choice lies not in whether we care about Zonicia, but how divided we want them to be."
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_collaboration:0 "On The Issue Of Collaboration"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_collaboration_desc:0 "No region would be complete or secure at this point without our Constant getting his claws dug somewhere in it. We can't just let him choose whoever he wants in Colthage, though. This will require a bit more finesse, and he will work with who we tell him to work with, no matter his opinion on it."
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_centralism:0 "On The Issue Of Centralism"
 HIP_SIR_on_the_issue_of_centralism_desc:0 "The relationship between the city of Colthage and the land it is supposed to control is a tenuous one. When it was a state, there was apparently many a debate on how centralized or federalist the nation should be. Allowing the city the total control many wanted would stabilize the nation-region, but some could say that is a bad thing in our case. The final decision is up to us."
 HIP_SIR_expand_the_systems:0 "Expand The Systems"
 HIP_SIR_expand_the_systems_desc:0 "We have more land and enthralled creatures now, but just because they once fought us doesn't mean they should be treated differently from the hippogriffs and zebras of before. The systems we have created must be focused on and expanded to everyone so that they can also benefit from our decisions."
 HIP_SIR_the_question_of_manedalusia:0 "The Question Of Manedalusia"
 HIP_SIR_the_question_of_manedalusia_desc:0 "Manedalusia was a very contested area between Maregypt and Abyssinia, who both saw it as their own rightful land. Both of their peoples would appreciate it officially being regarded as a part of their region, and now we have ended up as the mediators. The Maregyptians are our enemies, yeah, but maybe that's exactly why they should get the region..."
 HIP_SIR_maregyptian_integration:0 "Maregyptian Integration"
 HIP_SIR_maregyptian_integration_desc:0 "Now that the Manedalusia issue is solved, we can finally start the process of making sure they never think of making fun of us again. They honoured Somnambula once, and now we can make them honour us in the same way; we are now the heroes in the story, and they'll learn that soon enough."
 HIP_SIR_business_in_abyssinia:0 "Business In Abyssinia"
 HIP_SIR_business_in_abyssinia_desc:0 "Unlike Maregypt, which was an insult to us, or North Zebrica which was an important part of our initial expansion, Abyssinia was purely a target to give us another place from which to launch invasions towards Equus. We needed the land, not the creatures, so our stance towards them can be relatively lax. As long as they stay in line and do as we say, we can leave them to their own devices."
 HIP_SIR_reopen_the_skydocks:0 "Reopen The Skydocks"
 HIP_SIR_reopen_the_skydocks_desc:0 "Criminals, thieves and murderers. All make their home in the city of Klugetown, a place that despite its seedy underground remained a thriving trading port before our takeover. That underground now serves as a hotbed of resistance against us, something that will not stand. We will root out such villains and return it to how it should be; a place of our laws, and our rules alone."
 HIP_SIR_state_of_the_ponies:0 "State Of The Ponies"
 HIP_SIR_state_of_the_ponies_desc:0 "We've beaten the ponies, forced the Equestrians to serve us. But, there is still the matter of the old regime to think about. Ponies loved their Princess, some seeing her as a deity that protected them. But now... let's see how they feel about us."
 HIP_SIR_the_future_of_equus:0 "The Future Of Equus"
 HIP_SIR_the_future_of_equus_desc:0 "And yet, ultimately the opinion they have of us is ultimately irrelevant. We choose the future, we call the shots, we lead and they follow us. Whatever we say goes, and that is how sirens rule. It is not a question of whether they will follow us, but how we tell them to."
 HIP_SIR_recapitulation:0 "Recapitulation"
 HIP_SIR_recapitulation_desc:0 "A time is coming to a close. This is not the ending, but it is an ending nonetheless. I've done a lot, and I guess I've learned a lot too. Maybe I should look back and see everything now that we've won.\n\nThere's still a lot to think about, after all."

Although the venerable slugthrower will be very hard to improve on, our scientists are surely up to the task."
 HIP_future_tank:0 "Project SHATTER"
 HIP_future_tank_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are obviously the future of armored warfare, but current heavies simply aren't powerful enough and run into problems with their transmissions and engines.

Project FALLOUT would see some of our fighters armed with unguided air-to-air rockets tipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead: the massive blast wave would turn enemy bomber's formations against them, downing an entire wing in a single fireball."
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges_desc:0 "Our current depth charges are effective, but due to their limited blast radius they often fail to disable their targets, particularly if the submarine detects the charge and changes depth before it goes off. The Exotic Weaponry Commission has come up with a solution to that problem which some are calling overkill: arming our depth charges with low-yield nuclear bombs, to kill every submarine in the area regardless of changing depth."
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines:0 "Project TATZLWURM"
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines_desc:0 "Our pioneer corps could benefit from the recent explosion of new uses for nuclear technology.

They could also serve quite well as area-denial weapons."
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines:0 "Project BARNACLE"
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines_desc:0 "While it may seem insane to leave nuclear weapons floating around in the ocean, the fact is that a single naval mine, if equipped with a nuclear payload, can sink entire flotillas of enemy vessels, and can effectively deny a much larger area to the enemy since enemy vessels those far away from the blast could be damaged or sunk."
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos:0 "Project BARRACUDA"
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos_desc:0 "One obvious naval application of nuclear weapons is in torpedos.

 HIP_nuclear_rocket_artillery:0 "Project TANKBUSTER"

The idea of equipping even our ground forces with nuclear weapons is tantalizing, although Terrafin is quick to point out the logistical and strategic limitations of such an endeavour. Still, if the project is successful its value in destroying armoured formations, area denial, attacking fortifications, and sheer Shock and Awe cannot be overstated."
 HIP_air_launched_cruise_missiles:0 "Project STANDOFF"

 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Clawbeak, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face, so it faces stiff opposition.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"

From works of literature to science to philosophy, our younger generation are voraciously devouring this new reading material, and as they do so, they pick up some of these ideas and make them their own.\n\nOf greatest concern to us are the political ideas they have been absorbing: while Hippogriffia has always been a stable absolute monarchy, many among the younger generation are now discovering that there are other ways of organizing society, ranging from constitutionalism to republicanism to nationalism to even the most radical ideas, such as fascism and communism.

The most prominent leaders were seapony Raft Wood, the Queen's former advisor who had first proposed the move to Seaquestria, and hippogriff flying ace Crack Lightning, who gave a patriotic speech at the opening of the committee:\n\n"Mount Aris stands tall, and like the mountain we must stand alone. We cannot depend on foreigners to help us, and neither should they depend on us. We have always been strong, self-sufficient, and proud of our cultures and traditions, and the Aris First committee will see that that stays true into the 11th century and beyond."\nHe was met with thunderous applause, and launched into the second half of his speech with even more vigor: "Liberal intellectuals would have us believe that harmony means opening our markets and our borders to everycreature, or funneling money and resources into charity projects in the North Zebrican Mandate. I believe harmony means a well-ordered, self-sufficient society that looks after its own. Aris First stands for the auto worker who is tired of seeing foreign cars drive their wages down, for the veteran tired of zebras accusing us of cowardice when we defeated the Storm King, for the small business owner tired of competing with foreign conglomerates who cheat the market. More than that, Aris First stands for our culture, our values, our history, and for a bright future for all Hippogriffia!"\n\nMany newspapers have denounced Aris First as xenophobic, backwards, or fearmongering. Still, their membership is quickly swelling, particularly in Seaquestria where seaponies see very little to gain from international trade, as there are few foreign products they want and many are concerned about underwater manufacturing being unable to compete with industrial giants in Equestria and Griffonia."

 hipflavour.4.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 hipflavour.4.banned.desc:0 "Banning the socialist book clubs has not eliminated these ideas, it seems. Reports trickle in daily of these clubs organizing in the nooks and crannies of Seaquestria, and of more and more of our citizens gravitating towards this enticing "forbidden knowledge." From what little information we have on these meetings, their disdain for the government has grown since we banned them, and while they once talked of abstract ideals, they have now become more like conspiratorial groups plotting revolution.\n\nAmong the seaponies, the largest of these underground groups are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving "a post-scarcity society" but only if it is revolutionized into a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRecently, we have received a tipoff that the anarchists and communists are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition, presumably with the aim of combining their forces for some plot against the government."
 hipflavour.4.desc:0 "The socialist book clubs have begun spreading outside the universities, as idealistic students try to spread their ideas among the general populace. While many of these groups profess "harmonic socialist" and "democratic socialist" ideals and want to work with the government to implement socialist economics in Hippogriffia, there is an undercurrent of sedition in these groups, as they all want at least as much devolution of power away from the monarchy as the liberals do.\n\nMore alarmingly, some of these groups openly call for the complete transformation of Hippogriffia. These more radical groups are gaining popularity among the poorer seaponies and hippogriffs who are skeptical of the possibility of reform. The largest of these radicals among the seaponies are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living.\n\nMeanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving a "post-scarcity society" but only if it is transformed into a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nWhile these groups are currently small, their membership is rapidly growing, and news has reached us that they are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition of some kind, presumably organized around whichever faction's ideas prove most persuasive."

 hipflavour.5.d1:0 "Today marks the end of the national celebration known as the Three Days of Freedom. This is a relatively new holiday, originally created by Queen Novo as a one day celebration during our exile in Seaquestria. After we emerged victorious over the Storm King and returned to Mount Aris, the holiday was expanded to three days.\n\nOn the first day, celebrations are held all across Seaquestria to thank the ocean for protecting us. Seaponies gather with friends and family to enjoy undersea dinners and traditional activities like sea-dancing and whale-singing. On the second day festivities commence in Aris. Hippogriffs celebrate the Storm King's defeat with parties and live music performances, with the largest concert being held on the Harmonizing Heights. On the third and final day, all creatures come together to celebrate the return of our freedom. Seaponies and hippogriffs are encouraged to meet up on beaches for large mixed parties. At the end of the day parents and prominent community members give out presents for the children. In the capital, Queen Novo herself distributes presents to local children in a special ceremony.\n\nDespite being new, the Three Days of Freedom are already extremely popular in both Aris and Seaquestria. In light of the emerging societal divide between hippogriffs and seaponies, many creatures see the holiday as a celebration of national unity as well as past victory."

His trusty custom-built aeroplane, the Spirit of Starfield, gleamed in the morning light as it taxied to its parking spot. His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n\n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day. We need to remain strong in the face of this violent new world, and reject these foreign ideas which would disrupt our peaceable way of life.""

 hippogriff.2.desc:0 "A delegation from Hippogriffia met with Director Arclight today, requesting assistance from the OHS for a similar body called the "Anti Harmonic Activities Committee" in Hippogriffia. The Director was quite sympathetic to their case, as ever since they opened up their country they have been inundated with fascist, communist and other anti-harmonic radicals trying to spread their ideologies and undermine one of the few harmonist states in North Zebrica.\n\nThey requested we share our experience combatting communist influence in Rijekograd, as well as conduct joint training exercises for their agents to better prepare them to nip subversive activity in the bud.

In his letter to us, Director Arclight praised the AHAC's efforts at securing Hippogriffia against subversion. His letter also contained the first of hopefully many lessons from the OHS, gleaned from many years of combating communism in Rijekograd. He warned us was to stay vigilant against all forms of socialism, even so-called moderates, stating that "Behind every Nova Whirl there is a Caramel Haze. Behind every so-called 'Democratic Socialist' there is a tyrannical overlord waiting to be unleashed." Violet Facade read this out before the committee, which has taken this warning to heart."

In a perfunctory letter, Director Arclight indicated that while he applauded our vigilance against anti-harmonic subversion, he considered it "Hardly in the interests of the River Republic to share intelligence, personnel or classified training material with a monarchy halfway across the world."\n\nThis has been met with disappointment by the AHAC, who had hoped that the vaunted expertise of the OHS in suppressing communist radicals within Rijekograd would prove useful in rooting out similar extremists here. The committee has elected to thank Director Arclight for his consideration, but not to push the issue further as it is clear that his mind is made up."

Citing concerns about growing communist and fascist influence in Hippogriffia, as well as the threat of infiltration from foreign powers, they have requested to coordinate a program where their "Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee" would share intelligence and training with SMILE. Director Bon Bon is entusiastic about this plan, saying that it is just as important to protect harmony in Hippogriffia as it is in Equestria, but Princess Twilight Sparkle has expressed some reservations. She sees some of the AHAC's actions, such as the censoring of books, as unacceptably stifling to learning and damaging to the trust between Queen Novo and her subjects. She has suggested we politely decline the AHAC's offer. Ultimately, the decision is ours."

 hippogriff.7.desc:0 "Much to our surprise, Equestria has rejected our request to coordinate between the AHAC and S.M.I.L.E.. The matter apparently made it to the princesses' desks, because the response is signed by Twilight Sparkle herself. In it, she expresses concern over some of the book bans the AHAC has issued, stating that: "Harmony and knowledge go claw-in-fin, and harmony requires governing with a light hoof and trusting your subjects. However good the intentions behind it, the AHAC's activities undermine that trust. Therefore, [EQS.GetLeader] has regretfully declined your request to share intelligence between S.M.I.L.E. and the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee."\n\nThis comes as a great disappointment to the AHAC, whose chairpony Violet Facade expected our friends in Equestria to enthusiastically support our fight against extremism in Hippogriffia."

 hippogriff.8.t:0 "The Wingbardian Book Ban"
 hippogriff.8.desc:0 "In a controversial move, the AHAC has banned all books coming from Wingbardy or written in Wingbardian from entering [From.GetNameDef]. They cite Wingbardy as "a hotbed of socialist and fascist radicalism," paying particular attention to the doctrines of Beakolini and the way supposedly-apolitical Wingbardian literature subtly advances fascist ideology.\n\nThis move has been met with condemnation from a singularly unexpected source: while Raft Wood and most of the rest of Aris First have praised the move as "the first step in freeing our culture from foreign influence," Crack Lightning has criticized the ban, arguing that Wingbardian books are no more dangerous than any other, that the ban is poorly worded, and that it rests on an idea of so-called "Crypto-fascism" which he finds preposterous. His voice is joined by the usual choir of progressive harmonists who oppose the AHAC, with Silverstream and Skystar both urging Queen Novo to rein in the AHAC, seeing the ban as yet another example of an escalating trend of xenophobia within the committee, with Skystar being particularly passionate about not wanting to go back to the lonely days of hiding from the world."

The ban has offended and outraged many both within the government and the Wingbardian literary scene, with many calling for an immediate denunciation of this move.

The mountain cannot stand alone, so we must find partners to join in alliance.\n\nBut which alliance shall we join? There are several options. The world is constantly evolving as nations go to war, make peace, and adjust their diplomatic relations. Some old and venerable alliances have already fallen while new alliances have taken shape.

Some more cautious elements within our military have cautioned that this would necessitate sharing classified information with the Hippogriffs and could end up costing a significant amount of money.

Aris First founder Raft Wood has praised the move as "The first step in removing foreign influence from our Mountain," lending credence to Silverstream's statements that the AHAC is turning into a weapon of xenophobia.\n\nAHAC chairpony Violet Facade insists her fears are overblown, and that the measure is primarily intended to combat tax evasion, pointing to the AHAC's fining of businessgriff Plumage Moonfeather for hiding money with his New Mareland associates, which would not have been possible without the new measure."

Meanwhile, the Aris First movement largely endorsed the move, with Raft Wood proclaiming his full confidence in Violet Facade's judgement and expertise. Queen Novo decided to at least give it a read before making a decision. The report addressed each Element of Harmony in turn:\n\nLoyalty, contrary to the Equestrian understanding, was about pride in your home and loyalty to the Queen and Hippogriffian Harmony itself, not about your personal friends.\nHonesty is more than telling the truth. It was also about behaving in an upright and correct manner for your station.\nGenerosity is when well-off creatures willingly used their wealth to help their country and those less fortunate, and is thus incompatible with forced wealth redistribution.\nMagic is not only magic, but the pursuit of excellence in all of one's talents.\nLaughter and Kindness, being altogether too vague to be given a rigorous legal definition, should be considered secondary Elements.\n\nThe report concluded that under the definition, Hippogriffia should stop looking to Equestria and especially to Griffonian republicans, liberals, social democrats, and other false-Harmonists for guidance, as these were all either too laissez-faire, too individualistic, or too focused on anti-harmonic notions of constitutionalism or economic redistribution to truly understand Harmony as we do.\n\nNovo set the report down, declaring:"

Hippogriffia asks Warzena to bow to Queen Novo and become a protectorate under her guidance. Among other concessions from our side, accepting this offer would allow the Hippogriffian military access to our nation and give them the power to meddle in our foreign policy. We would also be forced to support them in any war they find themselves in.\n\nThe benefits, however, are just as impactful for Warzena. Warzena would have a steadfast, Harmonic ally in the tumultuous Zebrican continent and Hippogriffia would be bound to aid us should we ever find ourselves at war. The economic possibilities could also be bountiful as investment from Hippogriffia is assured to follow should we accept this offer.\n\nIn short, much of Warzena's freedom in exchange for the might of Hippogriffia, in all its forms.\n\nThe final decision lies with King Barekzamal who will be supported by the citizens of Warzena, whatever his decision."

Warzena would cease to exist as a separate and independent nation, with its citizens, territory, resources -everything- becoming an integral part of Hippogriffia, for good or ill.\n\nAt the same time, integration carries many benefits for our people in the long run. They would become citizens of a fellow Harmonic nation and with the might of Warzena and Hippogriffia united their chances of survival and safety are exponentially increased. Some say that such an integration is only natural for two nations that are as merged as ours. Both of our societies, militaries and bureaucracies are already fairly unified thanks to our protectorate status under Hippogriffia.\n\nIt is up to King Barekzamal to decide:\nIndependence or Integration."

Crack exclaimed, "Take ah, paragraph three, section four of the current draft. It's brilliant. 'Any creature who publicly propagates false or misrepresented statements which they know or should reasonably be expected to know will undermine the public's faith in the fundamental institutions of Hippogriffia will be considered culpable in any resultant unrest or anti-Harmonic activity.' Just that section alone will allow us to uproot all those unpatriotic and anti-Harmonist elements easily! Plus the way paragraph two lets you cut through all those messy police jurisdictions and procedures to ensure that the ones who truly deserve it face justice."\n\nViolet sipped her coffee. She didn't like the twinkle she saw in the hippogriff's eye, and slowly opened her beak:\n"Well, uh, Crack, it does require the statement to be false..."\nHe waved a claw dismissively. "Or misleading, or misleading! You underestimate your own genius, Ms. Facade!"\n\nAfter Crack had left, Violet thought long and hard on what he'd said. She'd never intended to write a law with such ruthless implications, but it seemed she'd done just that. Lightning's enthusiasm unsettled her. He reminded her of the demagogues and dictators of Griffonia, going on about unpatriotic elements and lambasting due process as a barrier to "true justice." Despite her doubts, some part of her didn't care if Crack Lightning liked it or not. The AHTA would be a powerful tool, and in the fins of a responsible leader, a tool for good."

Delegates from across Hippogriffia gathered in a new meeting hall on Mount Aris. As the Queen gave the opening address, the energy in the hall was enthusiastic, but also a bit tense. Rumors had spread claiming that radical Aris First members or leftist agitators planned to disrupt the session. Many also feared that unresolved tensions between hippogriff and seapony delegates were going to flare up.\n\nIn the end, the session was disrupted by something entirely unexpected. One delegate, clearly bored by the opening speeches, began loudly humming to himself. This annoyed the delegate seated beside him, who suddenly took the floor and proposed a measure banning "humming, mumbling and other distracting behavior" during parliamentary sessions. The humming delegate, now offended, took the floor to defend his conduct and argue that the measure violated the delegates' liberties. Several delegates, each eager to make a name for themselves, followed by giving increasingly impassioned speeches either supporting or opposing the measure.\n\nThis continued until Princess Skystar, also in attendance, asked to be allowed to speak. She chided the delegates for focusing on pointless minutiae while serious issues required consideration, and reminded them that creatures everywhere were depending on them for assistance. This rebuke seemed to snap the delegates back to attention, and the rest of the session focused on more consequential issues. In spite of this incident, many remain hopeful that the Royal Parliament will show the benefits democratization can bring to Hippogriffia's government."

Now the council has been revived, with its membership consisting mostly of political newcomers. The councilors met in a hall on Mount Aris with Queen Novo, members of the extended royal family, and many eager spectators in attendance.\n\nUnfortunately, the inexperience of the new councilors created unforeseen problems. Many of them appeared absolutely starstruck in the presence of the Queen and other royals, and their opening speeches contained nothing but excessive praise for Her Majesty's Government. The councilors continued in this manner until Silverstream suddenly turned towards the Queen and blurted out, "I'm confused! If they only wanted to flatter you, couldn't they have just sent in fan mail?"\n\nAfter a brief silence, Queen Novo began to laugh, as did the councilors. This moment seemed to break the ice, and the councilors then spoke on several local and national issues they wished to bring to the government's attention. The Queen listened attentively to each of their speeches and promised that her government would work to address all of their concerns.

He took a breath.\n\n"What I'm about to say will probably not feel good, but many Zumidians only agreed to join you because we felt like it was you or Colthage."\n"But I thought you said we were your friends?"\n\n"I mean I like you, but there's over a million of us. A lot of us were just scared. And we still are. I used to be a war correspondent; I've seen the aftermath of Chiropterran slave raids. Entire villages carried off into the night, never to be seen again. And don't get me started on Colthage."\n\n"Okay, sooooo, what can we do to help, friendo?"\n\n"The entire region is gearing up for war, except Aris. I'm going to tell Parliament, and I want you to talk to your aunt. Tell her that what Zumidia needs most is for Hippogriffia to start rearming, now.""

How do we win it? I don't really know anything about army stuff."\n"I'd say ask a general. But in my experience they seldom agree on anything. I really don't know about strategy, but I can tell you that the zebras of Zumidia are... scared, but ready. We joined you partly because we knew without you, we'd get conquered again just like with the Storm King. And I mean that in the nicest way. We're ready to fight for you if you're ready to fight for us."\n\nSkystar smiled. "That's what friendship is, right?"\nAzrael nodded. "So what do you need from me?"\n\n"We're offering you a job.

She'd seen them through tough times and times of plenty, but she'd never seen them like this. As she looked out over the crowd, all she could see in the faces of her subjects was rage.\n\nAs the Queen spoke, she struggled to be heard over the sounds of shouts and jeers, the noise of fights breaking out, and her guards repeatedly telling the crowd to step back. What made the whole thing so difficult was that they couldn't seem to agree on anything. Some shouted for her to arrest the unpatriotic seaponies who dodged the draft, while others demanded she punish the arrogant hippogriffs who led the country into an unwinnable war. Some claimed that the war should be resumed immediately, while others said [Root.GetNameDef] should renounce war and disarm completely. They variously blamed her, her government, her military and each other for the defeat. An unnervingly large number of them were demanding immediate secession.\n\nAfter the event concluded, the Queen found Skystar in her room.

A reduction in conscription terms, a decrease in draft lottery draws, and increased draft exemptions.\n2. An aid package for veterans, giving them access to subsidized healthcare, low interest loans, and tuition-free higher education.\n3. Compensation for those whose property was lost or destroyed and increased reconstruction aid.\n4. Increased popular input on and oversight of [Root.GetNameDef]'s foreign policy.\n5. The creation of a government commission to promote peace and friendship between hippogriffs and seaponies.\n6. The creation of a Department of Refugee Relief and Resettlement.\n\nThe Princess preempted criticisms that the promises are too expensive and will decrease our military's combat readiness, arguing that the resulting economic growth will pay for the measures and that the Army should transition into a smaller but more professional force. Despite these assurances, many are still skeptical. Some think the promises are currently beyond our government's means, while others believe they are insufficient to bridge the divides in our country. However, Skystar is adamant that these promises represent the best chance we have to keep [Root.GetNameDef] safe and united."

She realized there was only one thing left for her to do.\n\nGathering her ministers, she began drafting a decree recognizing Arisian independence. Some part of her still resisted, since letting the hippogriffs go was an admission of defeat. But this was a defeat; she had failed to preserve her realm. She was the one who had driven the crisis to this point, the least she could do now was prevent it from escalating any further.\n\nWhen the decree was finished Novo returned to her bedroom, hoping to finally get some rest. Before she drifted off, she closed her eyes and began to pray. To An, god of the sky, she prayed that the wayward hippogriffs would return home one day. To Tiamat, goddess of the sea, she prayed that when the time came for Skystar to rule, she would be a better queen than her mother."

Crown Prince Zamni was barely more than a foal when the Storm King invaded, but the conqueror showed him no mercy. After executing his mother and father, the yetis locked Zamni in a dungeon. He remained there, alone and neglected, until the hippogriffs defeated his captors.\n\nOn days like today, when Skystar was in Ain Trotgourait on official business, she always made time to visit the young king.\n"Hello Zamni!"\nZamni bowed slowly. "Good evening Princess Skystar. It is a pleasure to see you."\n"Um, Zamni? You don't have to be so formal. Just call me Skystar."\nThe young zebra sighed. "My tutors keep telling me I need to behave 'in a manner befitting a royal.' They say appearance is very important for kings."\n"Well it's true that kings need to behave regally in public, but there's no need to act that way among friends."\n\nAs the pair settled into their usual routine of playing a board game, Zamni seemed to dwell on the princess's words.\n"Is it important for kings to have friends?" he asked.\n"Of course! Spending time with friends is important for everycreature." Skystar replied, beaming with joy.\n\nZamni's eyes widened. "Since you're my friend, can you take me outside the palace so I can explore the city?"\nSkystar's smile became a frown. "I don't think your regency council would like that very much. But don't worry, I promise when you're older I'll take you to Mount Aris and give you a full tour!"\n\n"Thank you, I'd like that." Zamni sighed again.

Air superiority had already been in the Hippogriffians' claws since the beginning of their surprise war on the Storm King's forces when they quickly and efficiently overwhelmed the Storm King's air force, most of which was grounded, not expecting a large enemy force to appear from beneath the ocean.\n\nDuring the final battle the Air Force ensured that all the Storm King's airships were destroyed. These airships played an important part in the Storm King's campaigns as they gave him a tactical and strategic advantage over his enemies, carrying large amounts of warriors, materials and weapons at a fairly fast pace, easily outmaneuvering his opponents and positioning his forces to deliver crushing attacks on their weak points.\n\nThese same airships, however, weren't quick enough to face the lightning strikes of the biplanes which composed the Air Force. One of the many airships to join the scrapyard was the flagship of the Storm King, being destroyed by Crack Lightning himself, who was lauded as a hero for his actions that day.\n\nTogether with the other branches of the military and providential help from the Element Bearers the Storm King's rampage through Zebrica came to an end.

Prisoners were forced to live in hastily constructed hostels which were unheated and in poor condition, leaving them to the mercy of the weather.

This had a dual purpose: to show that the legions had repeatedly flaunted the laws that the civilians operated under, and to provoke outrage at just how many of the things the LMRD did were perfectly legal.\n\nOcean Spray, the mad scientist of the LMRD, was acquitted on counts of grievous bodily harm, murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and so on, simply because his victims were labourers. The trial was followed in depth by the media, and even former legionnaires were incensed as he was acquitted one by one of horrific acts of torture.\n\nOf course, the way he had embezzled funds and inflated his successes, the fact that certain experiments were illegal for procedural reasons, and the terrorist actions of the Crescent Moon Society were all enough to get Ocean Spray and most of the others in the Doctors' Trial heavy prison sentences.\n\nThen came the trial under Arisian law. Crimes against sentient life, war crimes, serial murder: it was enough to get Ocean Spray and several others hanged. At the end of the trial, a curious change had come over the Chiropterran public. They had always prided themselves on their ruthlessness compared to the weak harmonists, but their laws were so weak that only under harmonist law would the monsters actually be put down. The legions hadn't protected them. The legions had protected themselves, and given the experimental drugs the LMRD would sometimes test on enlisted soldiers and lower-ranking officers, Chiropterran opinion solidified that the legions were, essentially, a racket.\n\nMuch of the publicity was done by officials in the former Chiropterran civilian government. One Carrot Stick in particular had stepped up and ensured that every Chiropterran he could reach would get the play-by-play of the trials. In the aftermath of the trials, he also convinced several insurgent groups to lay down their arms in exchange for amnesty. After so long with the Chiropterran public stonewalling efforts at a proper peace, it seemed the tide was turning, and leaders were emerging on their side who were able to finally stop the cycle of violence."

The two zebras started laughing. "What does it matter anyways?" the Zarantian exclaimed, "All this land is owned by some Tobuckian farmers who'll probably apply for dual citizenship anyways."\n\nThe border stone didn't matter. The rivulet would move, the border would move with it, and the ponies living on the land would not particularly care one way or another.

In a very literal way for them, torturing and mutilating hippogriffs purified their own souls. The few prisoners who had escaped their ritualistic massacres had told of Starites competing to outdo one another in wanton cruelty, all under the watchful eyes of their commanders.

In the long-run, other nations who were able to would eventually start contributing to the Silverstream Plan's fund. While each country's leaders had the right to implement its precepts in their own ways, the Silverstream Plan was based on three principles:\n\n"Peace Through Prosperity." By improving standards of living, healthcare, and education in all North Zebrican nations, we will put an end to squabbling over scarce resources.\n\n"Unity Through Purpose." By having old friends and old foes all cooperate on the grand endeavour of rebuilding and improving the region, we will build feelings of national brotherhood and accomplishment. Creatures will no longer look to war as a means of asserting national prestige or serving their communities, but instead will look to building things and helping other creatures.\n\n"Friendship Through Familiarity." By opening up borders, sharing literature and science, and developing commerce and tourism, we will make friends in all different countries in North Zebrica. Where once we saw each other as strange and foreign, we will see each other as friends and neighbours: different but all good in our own ways.\n\nThe passage of the Silverstream Plan was seen as a repudiation to everycreature in [HIP.GetName] hungry for revenge against their defeated enemies, as well as, hopefully, a death knell to revanchism among those enemies."

They wore everything between drab desert camouflage and traditional warrior garments, carried ancient-looking guns which were probably older than Flarebright's grandmother, and many had battlescars.\n\nWhat was most astonishing, what he had dismissed when his scouts had reported it, was their sheer number. An entire brigade's worth of zebras had simply emerged from the desert, appearing like a mirage in the heat. Now they stood at attention as though on parade, with a single grizzled mare trotting out in front of them to meet Flarebright.\n\n"Greetings," said Flarebright, "I am the commander of the 92nd royal infantry batallion, Major Flarebright. Why have several thousand armed zebras showed up in an active warzone unannounced?"\n\n"I am Zawgha the Ironbreaker. We are the last warhost of Zarantia," the commander replied, speaking Arisian with a thick accent, "We have fought the murderous moon-worshippers ever since they broke Zarantia and killed our Aguellid. We're here to fight alongside you, and to claim revenge on them for what they've done."\n\nFlarebright shivered, realizing the severity of the moment as his own soldiers started peeking out of their positions at the newcomers.\n\n"Of course.

Because Queen Novo was unavailable, Skystar had to represent the monarchy at this event, even though she didn't know much of anything about the automobile industry. If she had to listen to one more lecture on the benefits of sustainable growth, she might not be able to stay awake.\n\nSkystar wished she could be doing something more important, like recruiting promising candidates for government service. Harmonic absolutism was becoming increasingly impractical in the modern world. Hippogriffia needed to democratize and allow talented creatures from different backgrounds to attain high office. If there was someone in government with expertise in economic matters, they could help strengthen the kingdom's economy. Not to mention that person would be the one attending boring conventions like this.\n\nThe princess stopped when she noticed a large crowd in the corner of the room. They were listening to a blue hippogriff who spoke with much more energy than the other presenters.\n"I'm a statistician at heart, but I've spent 5 years working as a consultant for car companies. In that time I've had to force creatures to think deeply about their problems and address them realistically. It's a strategy called 'scientific management.' Take my time at Cirrus Talonclaw's factory, for example. On my first day I asked him questions about every little thing till he was red in the face. But I took what I learned and used it to find all the inefficiencies and slowdowns on the production line. Once we ironed those out, productivity increased by over 100%!"\n\nThe audience burst into applause, and Skystar joined in. Maybe, she thought, what Hippogriffia needs now..."

Skystar replied with a smile.\n\n"Thank you princess, that means a lot."\n\n"I am interested in learning more about your consulting strategies. Would you be willing to discuss them with me, perhaps over lunch?"\n\n"Certainly princess. Just name a time and place and I'll clear my schedule."\n\n"Thank you so much!

"But I'm not sure I'd be the right fit. I don't know anything about government work."\n\n"Then you'd be in good company." Skystar put her fork down. "This kingdom has been an absolute monarchy for its entire history, so the number of creatures with actual governing experience is pretty small. Ever since we returned from Seaquestria my mother and I have been bringing in new faces to advise us on all kinds of things. You can join them in learning the business of government."\n\nRocket scratched his chin, seriously considering the idea. "I'd need you to promise me final say over hiring and decision-making in my department.

Swift Claw had been glad to answer at first, enthusiastic even, but as time wore on it became clear Silverstream would never stop asking. It reminded him of his three year old daughter. Swift Claw had become increasingly convinced that the new "Royal Friendship Advisor" was as useless as she was annoying.\n\nAs her tour finally concluded and Swift Claw bade her farewell, Silverstream announced that she'd thought of at least three changes which could be made to "make the whole place more friendly," and said they'd be hearing from her soon. Getting back to his coworkers for coffee, Swift Claw was surprised to hear them all talking about Silverstream: how friendly she was, how appreciated they felt when she came to them, how her questions made them feel like somegriff actually cared about what they were doing. How they hoped their kids grew up to be as kind and thoughtful as her. When Swift Claw mentioned how she'd said she was going to change their workplace, they all agreed that whatever she suggested would definitely make things better. Swift Claw returned home that night a little puzzled, but curiously optimistic. He gave his daughter an extra hug that night, and went to work the next day with a smile on his face."

One week and a whole lot of awkward conversations later, Silverstream had convinced the communist leader to meet them at a bar in a forgotten cove in Seaquestria.\n\n"So that's why cap'talism will alwaysh collapse," slurred the red seapony, several hours into the night, "It's all about the falling rate of profit, it'll happen, don't you worry 'bout it..."\nThe three had all had a little too much, and Skystar wasn't quite sure how long they'd even been there.\n"M'kay so you... you're still gonna fight cuz you think you can't lose?

But naw, communism will win, maybe now, maybe in a thousand yearsh... you guys ain't so bad though is what I mean, you know capitalism will go bye-bye but s'long as it's no Storm King takin' out the whole world with it we good, we good..."\nIn the drunken haze, Posada's words almost made sense, and Skystar felt oddly enraptured as Posada careened into another rapturous rambling declaration about the wonders of nuclear power.\n\n"Is gonna be a nuclear age, I'm tellin' ya!" she proclaimed at the end of it, "Everyfin's gonna be powered by splitting atoms, I'm tellin' ya, I'm tellin' ya... No but really, you's'all've been good to th'left n' me, better'n any other monarchs I can think of... And I know nopony's gonna follow me into some crazy revolutionary thingamabob 'gainst creatures who've done right by them so you have my... My nuclear approval!"\n\nAs Silverstream launched into her third barrage of questions about nuclear science and extraterrestrials, Skystar had a hazy thought that they'd done something good today, no matter how bad the hangover would be tomorrow. They'd spent so long worried this communist was coming for their heads, but now that they finally met her she was just another dorky, enthusiastic seapony like Skystar herself. As she took another long gulp of her seaweed beer, Skystar couldn't help but look forward to working with Posada."

[HIP.GetLeader] hadn't believed it at first: hadn't the Chiropterran legions always called Celestia a tyrant, a usurper? But it had quickly become undeniable. Equestria was no more. It had been twisted into this "Solar Empire."\n\nWhere Equestrians were once an example to the world of what Harmony should look like, now they brayed for the blood of their enemies, and their new Empress delivered.

Once in a while she would even mention the Lunar Rebellion and the benefits of the Legion structure. Then she'd go quiet, and ask to be left alone.\n\nSkybeak didn't know what to make of her. Sometimes she would offer the most brilliant insights, obviously derived from centuries of experience. Other times... she would ask why Skybeak hadn't ordered a bayonet charge or demand why the army did not still issue shortswords. Sometimes she would speak with the confidence of the most experienced general in the world, other times she'd speak with the timidity of a reclusive relic who had failed Equestria at its direst moment.\n\nSkybeak didn't like it when she got that way.

While opening up our markets has brought the prices of goods down and has made great profits for our corporations via exports and tourism, there is rising discontent among the lower classes that they are not getting their share of the national prosperity.\n\nWhile before, much of the opposition to our trade policies have been from nationalists and isolationists among the middle classes afraid of foreign competition, now much of the anger is coming from the proletariat, as socialist ideas once popular mainly among radical student groups have started percolating among the common workers. Popular discontent is directed more and more at domestic businessgriffs rather than distant foreigners, and even at the monarchy itself, which is increasingly seen as a defender of inequality.\n\nThe constitutionalist Socialist Labour Party of Aris has been doing its best to moderate rhetoric and remind the people that Novo has been a good queen, but the fringe Revolutionary Workers' Party and Post-Civilization Coalition of Communities, Anarchist have said in no unclear terms that the monarchy must be dissolved."

Enraged at being denied the right to unionize, different groups have demanded everything from increased safety standards to a complete restructuring of the wage system so that every worker shares in a percentage of the profits of their company.\n\nSkystar has suggested getting all the labour leaders together into one room so they can talk amongst themselves and talk with us to figure out a plan that works for everygriff, while auto industry leaders like Lucky Break have cautioned against such a plan, saying that that would result in the most radical voices swaying the others and pointing to the increasing popularity of socialist ideologues like the anarchists and Posada.

I live a very comfortable life, I'm sure you all know. But it wasn't always that way. I grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Seaquestria. It took everything my family had to ah, to send me to officer's school. And I saw so many other cadets with the same story as me, with twice my brains, flunk out because they needed to take care of their siblings, or their parents got a medical bill they couldn't afford, or whatever it was! Whatever it was, it was always something, and while we struggled and fought and sometimes failed, the rich kids would cruise on by like it was nothing."\n\nSkybolt let the anger he'd felt for so long propel him further: "I made it. I was lucky. But so many others didn't. And you know what? I shouldn't have to become an officer to make more than a pittance. You shouldn't have to be brilliant to live a good life, because the navy needs sailors just as much as it needs officers. And we have the capacity! Don't let anypony or anygriff tell you it can't be done, because if they're able to have decent living conditions for sailors and for common workers in a struggling, embargoed, frozen country like Stalliongrad, then you damn well bet we can do it in Hippogriffia!"\n\nHis sailors cheered, and Skybolt noted the RWP recruitment sheets being passed around.

Outside the royal palace, a mass of demonstrators gathered.\n\nThey were a diverse group: Hippogriffs from every corner of Aris, Seaponies who had taken Hippogriff form for the day, and even a few zebras from the RWP's growing Zumidian branch. The crowd was so numerous that the Royal Guard struggled to hold them back as they pushed through barricade after barricade.\n\nMany of them carried only banners and picket signs, but many others were armed. Posada had insisted that none of them be the first to fire. Any blood spilled today would be on the government's claws, but they wouldn't hesitate to fight back if necessary.\n\nTheir demands were simple: Novo's immediate abdication and the formation of a communist government.\n\nInside the palace the atmosphere was tense. Queen Novo and her advisors discussed several plans to disperse the mob. When it became clear that nothing but her abdication would satisfy them, the Queen resolved to order the Royal Guard to open fire. Before she could give the order, Princess Skystar pulled her aside.\n\n"Mother, you can't do this."\n"I'm sorry honey, but we don't have a choice.

Today, we've taken the first step to making our dreams a reality, and have boldly entered a new era. The revolution has truly begun, here in Hippogriffia! And I am honoured to accept the position of General Secretary, and swear to do my duty to the revolution, to bring about a new world from the ashes of the old. As my first act, I would like to call a vote to rename our country to something that better reflects its true purpose and character. When I look around I see not only hippogriffs, but also ponies, seaponies and zebras. I propose that this be the inaugural meeting of the Supreme Workers' Council of Revolutionary North Zebrica, to better reflect our aims and our makeup.""

 hippocommie.3.t:0 "The List"
 hippocommie.3.d:0 "Posada sat in her office with a list of names before her. The material conditions in North Zebrica made it so that the purges necessary for the establishment of Stalliongrad and most other communist states were unnecessary here, but the revolution wouldn't be totally bloodless. The names before her, twelve in all, were the worst of the reactionaries: the imperialists. A small group of warmongers who wanted to go out and conquer other nations and crush their creatures over some ridiculous theory of Hippogriff supremacy or a sheer lust for conquest.\n\nPosada's own body bore the scars of imperialism: her time imprisoned on one of the Storm King's airships had taught her to loathe them, and the writings of Caramel Marks had given her words to express that revulsion. Colonel Razorbeak, Director Solid Stone, all the others: these twelve had wanted to use their positions in the military and government to make Hippogriffia as vile as the Storm King. Posada had already gotten the Supreme Workers' Council's authorization to deal with them, and there would be no half-measures. Next to the orders which would end these twelve lives was a letter, written by her old friend Crack Lightning. They had drifted apart thanks to his involvement with Aris First, but the war hero had written to her as a friend, pleading her to spare them. Posada picked up her pen. Would imprisonment suffice, or would she turn to the bullet?"

She'd invited Skystar to speak with her, and had gotten some tea for the two of them. She paced about her office, checking the clock constantly until, two minutes after the scheduled time, she heard a knock on her door.\n\nSkystar walked in, wearing her communist party uniform with the same dignity with which she wore her old royal garb. Without a word she took a seat in front of Posada's desk, forcing the General Secretary to scurry to her own seat and sit down after her.\n\n"How is the revolution progressing, comrade Posada?" Skystar asked with stiff formality, pouring them each a cup of tea. Posada was flustered, taking a long sip of the mango-flavoured liquid to buy time. While she thought of her response, something cracked in Skystar's expression and she launched into a bubbly series of questions:\n\n"Did I get it right? Cuz like the revolution only started with overthrowing us right, cuz like you need to do so much work to build the new society and all? That's how that works right? We're still in a revolution right?"\n\nPosada spat out her tea. Once she'd finished laughing, she regained some of her composure and answered:\n\n"Well, yes! Yes that's exactly right. No hard feelings about the overthrowing part?"\n\n"Oh, many hard feelings! I was angrier than I've been in... well, ever. But those are in the past, and I've seen what you've been doing. I want to be part of it, if you'll have me."\n\n"Of course we'll have you!" Posada paused, chuckling to herself. "You know, when I was planning the revolution, I never expected I'd end up having a tea party with the princess."\n\n"Wait, did you just make me princess again?"\n\n"N- no, I mean-"\n\n"Well then it's just tea with a comrade, right?""

Although some of the old guard have grumbled at "beginner's luck," the naval high command have granted her the rank of commodore, with the Naval Commissariat co-signing the promotion and making her the first Commissar-Commodore of Revolutionary North Zebrica!"

You're going to see just what discipline can offer! And Lunar Hail, I've heard you're a very faithful pony. Surely you will be grateful for this ultimate test of faith. You held the line well, Stone Palisade. Today you'll get to see if your own resolve is as strong."\n"The situation is simple, fillies and gentlecolts. Any of you who renounces your beliefs, and goes on record saying that Nightmarism is an evil ideology, that all partisans are to stand down immediately and surrender - you will be given the kindness of a bullet. Anyone who doesn't will be exposed to several thousand roentgens, with effects we've yet to fully determine, but trust will be most unpleasant."\n"So, who wants to save their own skin by betraying everything they ever stood for?"\nNo one answered. They all glared at her with pure hatred. Finally, Lunar Hail spoke. "Bleed to death, faithless abomination."\n"Oh, that reminds me. We don't know the precise effects, but they should be very interesting. I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to contemplate them yourselves."\nThe doors slammed open, and a breathless Skystar rushed in, her eyes bloodshot and watery. "Don't do it, Posada! They might be evil... they might be monsters... they might even deserve it... but lowering yourself to their level would make you a monster too!"\n"The Supreme Workers' Council has voted to leave their fate up to me, Skystar," Posada replied coolly. "And they're going to get what they deserve."\nSkystar dropped to the floor. "Look at them, Posada! They're helpless prisoners. What you're about to do to them is the kind of thing THEY do, not us! Remember about how you spared my family? How you didn't have the capitalists shot? Please, I'm begging you - don't corrupt yourself with torture! Do you want to have that stain on your soul for the rest of your life?"\n"You feel strongly about this?" Posada inquired.\n"More so than anything since Hard Line tried to kill my mother," she whispered. "Please. Just shoot them."\nPosada frowned. As it was in her claws, she could choose to only have them shot, showing mercy to monsters who didn't deserve it. Or she could go ahead with the plan, and risk losing Skystar as a friend.

 hippocommie.7.t:0 "The Fate of Chiropterra"
 hippocommie.7.d:0 "Posada hadn't slept in almost two days. The presidium had been endlessly debating what to do with the Chiropterran occupation zone, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts about Chiropterra came to light. This was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, arranged in a vast stratocracy. Given their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary administrative region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to fully uproot the Chiropterran system, which had taken root in the minds of every Chiropterran citizen even with their government gone. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There were two Chiropterran Moonspeakers, two out of the entire country, who had somehow twisted the Nightmarist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put these two in charge, although in order to administer Chiropterra they would have to use much of the old power structure, which meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting Chiropterra up to rise again and exact revenge.\nThe second proposal would mean remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmarist faith would be completely banned, even in its most casual incarnations, and the entire population of Chiropterra would have to attend reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and endless insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\nThe third option was genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant immediately shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who were not shot put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would finally destroy one of the most evil nations in the world."

While the methods were monstrous, they advanced medical science years ahead of us, and a group of former Harmonists have persuasively argued that it would be a crime against their victims to burn the information they gathered on Polio, Malaria, and a dozen other diseases which could save so many lives. More controversial are the military applications of their research. While their combat drugs were undeniably effective, many of them were temperamental, and we only have a vague understanding of how they work since so many of their records were destroyed. Adopting these would mean turning our own soldiers into the lab rats of Chiropterra's worst, even from beyond the grave. Still, Terrafin and many others in our own military science division have urged us to put aside these qualms and use these military applications, as doing so would make our troops more effective and almost certainly save lives.\n\nFinally, an even more controversial option has been proposed: Chiropterran scientists advanced medical science immensely, and with the destruction of so many records, much of their data only exists in their heads. Certain technocratic elements have suggested that by offering amnesty to a mere half-dozen of Chiropterra's monsters, we could advance our own medical research dramatically. They would be kept on a tight leash, and obviously we would not let them use their old methods, but there is some appeal to putting these evil minds to work building a better world. Terrafin as well as numerous others have objected to this idea, stating that they do not wish to work with such creatures and that offering them amnesty would sully their entire department."

Prototypes included triple-barreled rifles, fletchette guns, caseless ammunition, and all manner of other methods to increase rate of fire, all with the goal of creating a rifle that could fire off a burst of three to five rounds before the recoil from the first shot was felt. This comes as a great disappointment to Terrafin, who had hoped that by equipping every single soldier with advanced weaponry, Hippogriffia could inspire its recruits and strike fear into the hearts of reactionaries worldwide."

With added weight from snorkels, fully-sealed armor, and an amphibious engine, anything short of the solid basalt of the ocean floor will be unable to support it, making it rather useless for amphibious assaults. Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."

The rifle of the revolution will no longer fire lead or steel slugs, but finned sub-calibre darts made of pure tungsten. The new rifle can achieve incredible rates of fire, pierce enchanted griffonian armor, and in larger calibres even punch through light tank armor! Comrade Posada was thrilled to learn that it also had far greater range underwater than any conventional or magical rifle, and has ordered the rollout of the newly-named 'Caramel-pattern Flechette Rifles' to all branches of our infantry. The cost of the ammunition, being made of tungsten and soon perhaps even depleted uranium, would be prohibitive had we not already abolished money!"
 hippocommie.11.d_caseless:0 "Caseless ammunition has many benefits, including lightening the load carried by each soldier, but our chemists had difficulty creating a material that would both hold the bullet in place and act as a propellant while not being prohibitively difficult to manufacture.\n\nThe solution came from an unexpected source: a chemistry graduate student named Adhamon, who was working as a lab assistant on the project, applied a bit of Zumidian alchemy to the problem and finally created a formula which worked. Terrafin has already named the first working caseless firearm the 'Adhamon Light Machinegun.' Terrafin recommends the new ammunition be rolled out as soon as possible, since it halves the weight of ammunition and turns the weapon into a beautiful closed system with no ejection ports to allow dust in, and no material wasted. Full adoption will take years given the lack of backwards compatibility, but the 'Adhamon' is already proving a hit with troops, especially ammunition carriers."

But there are three competing proposals before the General Secretary's desk, and only one can be chosen.\n\nThe first proposal, lead by old Air Force generals, suggests strongly incentivizing the growth of strategic bombers through major research grants. These would largely stick to established wisdom and not risk major changes.\n\nThe second proposal offers experimental improvements to designs, focused around achieving more lift with bigger bomb bays at a greater range. Terrafin has signed his name to this project, believing it is likely to succeed and will prove highly valuable.\n\nThe third proposal argues that enemy interception technology is too advanced and a totally new design is required to stab into the heart of enemy airspace. By flying higher than enemy interceptors can reach at Mach 3, it will be able to deliver nuclear payloads with safety anywhere. This so-called "deep-penetration bomber" would likely prove massively expensive and fuel-hungry, but proponents argue such costs are well worth it."

The RWP-A is also likely to advocate for more moderate foreign policy than Posada's, as they primarily consist of seaponies who still tend to be more isolationist than the fervent internationalists who make up the majority of the RWP, and see far less to gain from military intervention."

While few took the nationalist's word for it, he protested that "Beakolini himself went from being a socialist to being a nationalist, so why can't I do the opposite?"\n\nEven with this alleged conversion, the "National Communists" have voiced their opposition to the mainstream RWP's internationalism, arguing that other races and societies are too backwards to achieve communism in a "civilized manner" as we have.

We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Workers' Council. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.'

The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference. Nightmare Moon shelters all, her light shines upon all, but we have been blinded by grief at our defeat and allowed bitterness to twist us for a thousand years.

Your husband Night Eye was recently identified in a raid on a terrorist holdout.

She knew death would come for her, and was ready to face it with dignity. Then she heard Guava Drop whimpering, and glanced behind her to see that her foals had disobeyed her and come out of hiding. All of her strength vanished.\n\n"What about my foals?" she whispered to the hippogriffs, "Will they be taken care of?

 hippocommie.50.d:0 "Author: Professor Deep Dive\n\nDate: [GetDate]\n\nSummary: The question of animal intelligence is one of the world's great mysteries. While all living things deserve respect regardless of their intellect, identifying which species are sapient could be the key to communicating with animals. Comrade Silverstream claims that one of her former teachers, Fluttershy, is able to communicate clearly with all animals regardless of species. Unfortunately, the Department has not been able to find any other creatures that possess this ability, nor have we been able to reach Fluttershy for an interview.\n\nDEA biologists quickly identified bottlenose dolphins as the ideal species for sapience research. In the wild, dolphins exhibit several behaviors that are indicative of advanced cognitive abilities. To study dolphin intelligence, the research team decided to live and work in close proximity to a pod of dolphins for a period of 4 months.\n\nThe dolphins' sapience was proven beyond a doubt when they were able to perform complex tasks and recognize themselves in a mirror. After these initial tests, the team attempted to establish communication. This proved difficult until one of the researchers brought in several whistles that produced different sound frequencies, which the dolphins were able to mimic. The two-way whistle language the team created with the dolphins eventually developed its own grammar and syntax, both concepts which the dolphins could understand.\n\nThe team's findings have revolutionary implications. The Blue Navy is already conducting research on the dolphins' ability to detect enemy vessels and naval mines. Some eccentric scientists are exploring the possibility of helping to develop an advanced dolphin civilization. For now these projects are highly classified, but the Department has publicly announced the discovery that dolphins are sapient."

It echoed through factories, where workers put in overtime to keep up with increased production quotas. It was played in barracks and on warships, where soldiers and sailors listened in their bunks as they recovered from intense training exercises.\n\nCreatures of every race and from every walk of life listened, and their thoughts were just as diverse as they were. Some were angry, others were afraid. A few were excited, even jubilant. Many were cautiously optimistic and deeply uneasy at the same time.\n\nBut they all had one thing in common: they were all working towards the same goal. There was a unity of purpose among the people that hadn't been seen in a long time. No matter how they felt about global liberation, they were all in this together. They would make many sacrifices, not for Posada or for communism, but for each other and for suffering creatures everywhere. For the dreams of the revolution to be realized they all must fight this war, and all of them were ready to fight until the end.\n\n"...No matter what hardships we face, we will carry on.

A dream of a new world, free from the tyranny and exploitation of the old. A world where the progress of science and technology sets creaturekind free and allows us to reach the stars. Thanks to the hard work, dedication and sacrifice of many of our comrades, that dream has almost come true. But one piece is still missing: I must make sure that what we've built will live on after I'm gone."\n\nAs Posada announced her retirement to the Supreme Workers' Council, each delegate took the news in their own way. Some were sad and dismayed, others were not sure how to react. Many could already feel the gears in their heads turning, considering what this meant and who the next General Secretary might be.\n\nHard Line thought he was the logical choice to succeed Posada, but his rigid orthodoxy and callous attitude towards other party members made him very few friends.

By voluntarily ceding power, Posada has shown the world that our state is not built upon a cult of personality. It is built upon Communism, and its promise of a better world for all!

The crowd stretched as far as the eye could see in all directions, exceeding even the highest estimated attendance figures. Unfortunately, this also stretched the event's security detail very thin...\n\nA Hippogriff in a crazed state leaped from the crowd and flew onto the stage, interrupting Starry mid-sentence. He landed on the edge of the stage and started yelling something incoherently. Before anyone could react, he suddenly slipped and fell to the ground face-first.\n\n"Can you hear me? Are you okay?"\nAs the griff regained consciousness, he was surprised to see the General Secretary standing over him. She was applying pressure to a cut on his beak with a piece of fabric ripped from her uniform.

She gestured to the nearby crowd, "Help me get him to a hospital."\n"But what about your speech?" someone yelled.\n"The speech can wait!

Now he wished more than anything for a break from his new responsibilities. Luckily, there was a proposal on his desk that might give him just that.\n\nAcross from him sat a researcher from the computer science division, eager to hear his thoughts. In front of him was a study which found that local governments that incorporated computers into their operations saw their efficiency increase exponentially. The study recommended that computers be integrated into all government functions, from routine paperwork to decision making at the highest levels. It even speculated that computers may eventually make government by living creatures obsolete.\n\n"It's an interesting idea," Terrafin said, finally breaking the silence, "but I'm not sure how practical it is. The idea that computers can rule us is going to meet with opposition. Many creatures won't put their trust in machines."\n\nThe researcher's face lit up. "Trust is exactly why we need the computers. As scary as rule by machines is in the abstract, there's nothing scarier than being ruled by other creatures. History shows us that even the most ardent revolutionaries can become tyrants once in power. And after... recent events, the people's trust in their politicians has already been shaken."\n\nTerrafin winced at the allusion to the previous General Secretary. As he contemplated the idea further, he began to see its potential. Computers couldn't be corrupt or abuse their power, so relying on them was the logical choice.

Hard Line had always been particularly fond of this quote. It occasionally inspired him to leave the comfort of his office and walk amongst the people, in order to better express their will.\n\nThe streets of the capital were crowded, but all creatures quickly cleared the way as the General Secretary and his guards approached. Hard Line observed his surroundings with smug satisfaction. On almost every street there was construction. New factories, hospitals and schools went up every day. The people were healthy and prosperous, and there were no beggars in sight. Society had come a long way since the early days of the revolution.\n\nThe early days... Hard Line frowned, remembering Posada's rule. He had once considered her a comrade, but as events progressed she rebuked, scorned and mocked his every proposal. He had endured all her denunciations because he knew she was wrong. She polluted and deformed Marksism by tolerating revisionists.\n\nNow she was gone, and he had finally set things right. By destroying the revisionists, he had purified the party and secured the state. Thanks to his efforts, the revolution would last beyond eternity!\n\nAs Hard Line passed by, those who saw him felt either terror or thinly veiled contempt. Almost all of them knew someone who had been executed, sent to a labor camp, or simply disappeared. Not even in their wildest nightmares had they imagined the purges would go so far.\n\nA few onlookers worked up enough courage to shout insults at Hard Line. He ignored them. The communist revolution didn't require the approval of the workers, so poisoned by false consciousness and reformist lies about 'creature rights' or 'personal freedom'. The Party stood over all, and the fear and hatred of the workers of their dictatorship were immaterial in light of the glorious future that awaited successful communism."

It was despicable, and Crack choked for a moment on the water: he was almost too angry to breathe.\n\nFinally, after remembering how to use his gills, Crack looked down at the headstone. "I'm sorry, Posada," he said. "I should have helped you. I should have seen what was happening to you. You and I, we both knew what had to be done. Even though we were divided at first, we saw while everygriff else was blind. But you were too kind for it. I should have helped."\n\nCrack closed his eyes. Posada had always been an atheist, but he was sure Tiamat had welcomed her after all she had done for the seaponies.\n"Worry not, my friend. You swept away the degenerate monarchy. You crushed our enemies, made the world tremble at us. And I will see that legacy upheld. Aris shall not fall, Posada. And I will punish those... those Harmonist reactionaries, even the ones who call themselves communists, who cursed you for doing what had to be done. They hounded you to your death, but I won't let them do the same for me. I will make them pay.""

But no matter how long the vile communists kept her locked up, she would never let them break her spirit. She refused all their attempts to "reform" her or get her to feel remorse. Knowing the communists, as soon as she gave in she'd end up in front of a firing squad. Her imprisonment would have to end eventually, either with her escape or with her death.\n\nWhen the guards told her a new General Secretary had granted amnesty to all political prisoners, she was certain it was some sort of trick. As they returned her belongings and released her she wondered what exactly they were playing at. Did they want to watch what she'd do? Was this some new experimental form of torture?\n\nWhen Razorbeak realized that she really was outside with no one following her, her confusion only grew. Why would the communists leave her unsupervised? And these people, what were they all doing? Everywhere she looked creatures went about their days with a smile, greeting each other happily and helping those in need. Where were all the labor camps and death squads?\n\nAs a couple of hippogriffs in party uniforms approached Razorbeak she raised her claws for a fight, but they just asked if she was ok. When they found out where she'd come from they offered her a meal and a place to sleep. Lacking any other options she followed them home, but she never let her guard down. She kept her eyes open all night waiting for assassins to strike at her, but they never came.\n\nWhat was going on? This whole thing had to be some kind of communist deception... it just had to be!

Skystar asked, "What were you dreaming about?"\n"The future!"\n\nSkystar laughed. "Let me guess, a super advanced utopia with space travel?"\nStarry shook her head. "I've always looked up to Posada, but that doesn't mean we agree on everything. She thinks technological progress is the key to communism, but I'm not so sure. Technology advances under capitalism too, and it just leads to more exploitation."\n\n"Then what do you think we should be focusing on?"\n"Social relations! As Marks wrote, the revolution must completely transform the way creatures relate to each other. Everyone must put the needs of others first."\n\nSkystar raised an eyebrow. "So everyone needs to stop being selfish?"\n"It's more like there won't be such a thing as selfishness anymore, because what's best for the group will also be best for the individual," Starry explained. "Think of it like this: long ago the pony tribes of Equestria were always at each other's throats, but then they learned to see each other as one united ponykind. Imagine if all creatures could see each other like that. Imagine a world where friendship and love are free from the constraints of group and class identity!"\n\n"Do you really think that's possible?" Skystar asked, still skeptical.\n"We can't force people to change, it has to happen naturally. But I think we can create the conditions necessary for that change to take place," Starry smiled. "And I know it's possible to put the needs of others before your own. After all, you came in late just to check on me!"\n\nSkystar giggled, and Starry joined in.

The winds were shifting, and it had become time to decide which direction they blew.\n\nSo it was that the Seaponies and Hippogriffs had assembled in the hall, and it had opened to raucous discourse as there was a call for Yays and Neighs. In the end, it came down to a per-representative vote. For a time, it seemed like Posada might hang on to power. As time went on, however, the path to keep confidence shifted to fainter and fainter methods. Eventually, when the math became apparent that not a single one of the next twenty names could vote in favour of a non-confidence vote she slumped back in her chair and released a deep mournful sigh. The writing was on the wall, but it took ten more minutes for the paint to dry.\n\nWhen the tally was declared, Posada hung her head low. "I am sorry to have failed you," she said, in a sad voice. "But communism is stronger than any one creature. I trust my successor to govern with skill and grace. The stars shine on." With that, she quietly swam out of the room.\n\nIt soon fell to Salina Blue to pick up the pieces. Her contingent of the coalition had been the second largest, and in back rooms deals were made and promises offered.

I see many similarities between us, even though our methods differ substantially, and I still believe we can come to an agreement if you and your followers are willing to listen. Your achievements in Hippogriffia are admirable, as is the way you have addressed the Zumidian zebras as your comrades, rather than your subjects. However, I cannot allow you to continue in your current path, and I hope by the time you have read this letter you will see why.\n\nYou have always spoken against imperialism, but while your presses spill rivers of ink rightly condemning it, your armies prepare to spill rivers of blood to bend the nations of North Zebrica to your will. Do you not see the contradiction? I have praised your state and its achievements, but the culture, the history, and thus the destiny of Hippogriffia is not that of Zarantia, Warzena, Chiropterra, or indeed of Zumidia or Zonicia. And so as one idealist to another, I would like to offer you an alternative vision.\n\nLet us work together, as a commonwealth of independent nations, supporting each other in developing their own unique forms of harmonious life. I ask that we combine our resources to rebuild the nations of this region devastated by this era of war, and then to walk with them in friendship rather than ruling over them in a vast super-state.\n\nI understand that our visions are very different, and that they may seem totally incompatible even, but I trust you will see the wisdom in these words and abandon your current ambitions in favour of something which trusts the creatures of other nations to determine their own destinies.\n\nSincerely,\n-Zeshmunazash Zeirutid."\n\nPosada set down the letter, her claws shaking slightly after the third re-read.

The Macawians were a proud and independent people with their own unique language and culture. They were not exactly thrilled about being absorbed into a North Zebrican superstate. In cities and towns still strewn with rubble, harpies of all ages glared at Posada and her military escort. Garrison commanders reported stiff resistance from the population and begged for reinforcements.\n\nYet there were still bright spots. Macawia had its own native socialist parties before the liberation, and many of their members had agreed to join the RWP. On the last day of her visit Posada addressed these new party members at a special conference. It was a nice change of pace to meet harpy comrades who had rejected national chauvinism.\n\nPosada gave a short speech praising the socialist harpies and thanking them for embracing their new status as North Zebricans. Her remarks were well-received, and after a round of applause many harpies rose to shake Posada's claw. One harpy who seemed especially eager to meet the General Secretary reached into his coat pocket as he approached.\n\nPosada barely had time to register what was happening as he took out a pistol and opened fire."

We Can't Just Undo Civilization - There are some in our ranks who claim that we should reject civilization in its entirety and revert to a pre-civilized state of being. That idea is both impossible and extremely foolish. Civilization has become too ingrained to simply undo, and the modern world has produced several positive developments that we should not reject. We must look forwards, not backwards.\n\n3. We Are for Post-Civilization - Instead of resurrecting civilization or pretending it never existed, we have to create something new.

Faded posters with Posada's face and the text "Work for a Post-Scarcity Society!" hung on every wall. It was a truly ominous sight.\n\n"You want to build new stuff? You need mines, fields and factories. For those things to work you need stuff like money, laws, and hierarchies. In short, you need a civilization. And what always happens to civilizations? They collapse."\n\nBarnacle continued, smiling now. "And thanks to Posada's post-scarcity manufacturing craze, salvaging's never been easier! There's more than enough stuff here to meet our needs. We won't have to produce anything for a long time."\n\nAfter he finished, Sparkling turned to the next garbage pile and saw a pot near the top. It had a few burn marks on it, but that was hardly a dealbreaker. She grinned as she admired her hard-earned prize. Maybe salvaging wasn't so bad after all."

Just like all other vessels in the area, Clove and the rest of the crew were under orders not to go ashore for any reason.\n\nClove turned to one of the other sailors, a zebra who was native to the region.\n"What happened to this place?"\n"Argh," the zebra growled, "the hippogriffs and seaponies have always been strange, but now they've outdone themselves. Revolution and war drove them all crazy. They've decided to reject the world and live like wild animals."\n\n"Hey, that's not true at all!"\nClove and the zebra shrieked, unsure where the mysterious voice had come from.\n"Down here, in the water!" said a female seapony.\nClove leaned over the railing. "Wha... what do you mean?" he asked, still startled.\n\n"We don't live like animals, we've moved beyond civilization! We take the best ideas from all eras and blend them together to create a free and fair society. If anyone here is living like animals, it's you ponies and zebras! You live under capitalist tyranny and exploitation and..."\n\nShe went on for some time. Clove turned to the zebra, who looked just as confused as he was.\n"Well that all sounds... very nice. Thank you for explaining the, uh, 'post-civilization' thing."\n\nThe seapony smiled. "I'm always happy to help outsiders understand our ways. Just don't insult us again!

 hippocommie.113.d:0 "One of Salina Blue's first acts after taking office was to take a tour of Aris and Seaquestria. She considered this essential because it would allow the people to meet their new leader while also allowing her to see how the country was doing. She knew the people's material conditions had worsened, but she didn't expect the situation to be disastrous. Before the vote of no confidence Posada had been planning to restart the war, so how bad could things really be?\n\nPretty bad, it turns out.\n\nSalina was shocked by what she found. All communities, even those not in range of enemy bombs, were devastated by the defeat. Mass demobilization had reduced the demand for war materials while rapidly increasing the size of the labor force. This left many creatures without work just as resource shortages were increasing prices across the board. Posada's collectivized economy, once capable of rapid growth, was beginning to buckle and collapse.\n\nEverywhere Salina went creatures pleaded with her to do something, anything, to alleviate their plight. In the hardest hit communities people mobbed her transport to beg for basic supplies. When she finally returned to the capital she was depressed and distraught, but determined at the same time. The horrors she had witnessed gave her strength, enough to dispel the shyness that often held her back during council meetings.\n\nPassing major reforms wasn't going to be easy. The unity of the SLPA was fragile, and radicals in the RWP were already looking for an opportunity to remove her. Still, this had to be done. Salina called an emergency session of the Supreme Workers' Council and did not mince words.\n\n"Communism is in crisis. The economy is in ruins and the people are desperate. If we want to help them, our system must change.""

In the Supreme Workers' Council she had championed the recallable delegate principle until its passage was assured. Had she known that she herself would be the first delegate to face a recall vote, her support may have been a bit less passionate.\n\nWhen Salina heard that her Seaquestrian constituents were demanding a recall election, she rushed home to campaign against it. She defended her conduct in a local council meeting, but her infamous shyness made dealing with angry seaponies difficult.\n\n"Your economic aid has all gone to the hippogriffs, leaving nothing for us!" shouted one seapony.\n"Um, that's not-" Salina said quietly, trying to respond.\n"And your foreign policy! Why continue to mess with the outside world? Do you want another war!?" demanded another.\n"I don't think-"\n"You're just like Posada, always making promises you don't keep. We should never have put our trust in you!"\n\n"Enough!" Salina shouted, her patience finally exhausted. "In office I have done my best to help all the creatures of Aris and Sequestria, including all of you! It's true that sometimes what I've done isn't what you wanted, but there's always been a reason for it! Our country is in a very tough spot, and sometimes we have to make sacrifices to see it through. If you're too shortsighted to understand that, then I'd like to see you try to lead us!"\n\nSalina paused to catch her breath. The audience sat in stunned silence. She continued, calmer now, "Is there anypony here who would like to take my place? Are any of you willing to challenge me for my office?"\n\nNo one responded. Over the next few days support for the recall campaign dried up, and Salina returned to the capital in triumph."

He'd watched as soldiers were blown to pieces, he'd heard their cries of agony, and he'd felt the pain of losing many friends and comrades. But the worst thing about the war by far, the fact that made everything else unbearable, was that they had lost it.\n\nCumulus's courage had survived the war, but it was broken by the peace. He couldn't accept that all of his friends had died for nothing. They had failed all of the creatures they were fighting to save. What was supposed to be their moment of glory was just the backdrop for the final triumph of reactionary imperialists. These thoughts haunted him every day.\n\nWhen the government started calling up veterans and reservists for industrial work, Cumulus hated the idea. He was in no mood to leave home, and his trust in the government was at an all time low. But good soldiers follow orders, so he began reporting for work in an automobile factory. The job was difficult and tedious, taxing his basic knowledge of engineering to the limit. Yet as the days went by something strange happened: Cumulus found himself starting to enjoy it.\n\nMaybe it was the camaraderie he felt with the other factory workers. Maybe it was the satisfaction of seeing fully assembled cars that he'd helped build. Maybe it was simply that the job kept him busy, distracting him from his thoughts of the war. Whatever it was, the work did wonders for Cumulus's physical and mental health.\n\nWhen Cumulus reconnected with other veterans a few months later, he found that many of them were also happy with their jobs. Working to rebuild the economy gave their lives a new purpose. They would never forget the horrors they'd witnessed, but with time they might learn to move past them."

There were griffons, ponies, horses, and many other races represented. As wealthy members of the bourgeoisie they were not exactly fans of communism, and that was the holdup.\n\n"Thank you for your hospitality, Miss Blue." said a griffon in a stylish suit, "But I'm afraid I don't see the merit of your proposal. [Root.GetNameDef] is still a communist state, full of pro-worker and anti-business laws. Why should I or any other creature consider investing here?"\n\nThe other capitalists nodded in agreement. Salina began to sweat. As much as she loathed them, she knew the country needed foreign capital. Putting aside her personal feelings, she tried to strike a conciliatory tone.\n\n"You raise several good points, but look at the big picture. Investing in [Root.GetNameDef] will give you access to a large and highly skilled workforce, not to mention millions of potential customers. And recent reforms show that our desire for your business is genuine. We've changed our currency to make commerce easier, and I promise you we have no intention of seizing any foreign-owned assets."\n\nThe room filled with quiet murmurs as the capitalists considered these arguments.

The former General Secretary had her eyes cast down, but she seemed more calm than sad.\n\nAfter an awkward pause, Posada said, "I need to thank you. I failed this country and its people during the war, and in my disappointment and shame I almost led us into another. You had the presence of mind to stop me, and the leadership skills to salvage the situation. You should have been our leader from the start."\n\nPosada turned to leave, but Salina gestured for her to stop. "I appreciate the sentiment, but that's just not true. I've seen how difficult it is to lead, always bouncing from one crisis to another, and you were a good leader! Before I met you I was willing to work with the monarchy. Only you had the vision and drive to lead us in a revolution. You made some mistakes, yes, but so do all creatures. You have nothing to be ashamed of."\n\nPosada raised her head. "Thank you.

Waving flags or photographs of Queen Novo, the Aris First supporters cheered and chanted their patriotism in a rowdy display. When their leader Raft Wood got up on the stage, the cheers grew even louder, quickly turning to boos as he told of the latest insults coming from the zebras.\n\n"Cowards, they call us!" he exclaimed to the crowd, "I have it right here, from the mouth of a political chief in Colthage: 'the Hippogriffs boast of their victory over the Storm King, as though fighting a single lucky battle after years of hiding can compare to the grueling campaigns we zebras fought against him all across the continent.' We save them, and this is how they treat us. And then they come to the Zumidian refugee zone and exploit our generosity. No more I say! Queen Novo was right to retreat to Seaquestria, she was right to emerge when she did, and we shall suffer no further slander to our people or our queen!"\n\nThe crowd's cheers were joined by the sound of propellers, as Crack Lightning made a flyover in the Spirit of Starfield, the custom fighter plane he had shot down one of the Storm King's mighty airships with. Over the two hours of the rally, the crowd swelled from some five hundred to nearly a thousand, with hundreds of passers-by and local residents getting swept up in the patriotic jubilation and signing up for the Aris First movement."

Raft Wood has presented a petition with thousands of signatures demanding that government workers only be allowed to wear clothing made in Hippogriffia, claiming that the influx of foreign clothing "Dilutes our identity and damages our economy, leading to unrest and poverty."\nThe petitioners claim that having government employees wear foreign clothing at work sends a particularly bad message, because as servants of the crown they are also representatives of Hippogriffia. It spreads the idea that foreign nations produce better cultural products than our own, which damages national unity.\n\nHardliners within Aris First have demanded the government go even further, pointing to the lax labour laws and lower quality control standards in Griffonia and arguing that "greedy griffons" would still find ways to undercut and eventually destroy the Aris clothing industry even with Raft Wood's proposed ban.\n\nMore liberal voices have denounced the whole issue as "a silly affair" and have argued that no Harmonist government should pass laws mandating what its citizens wear, as doing so is an unacceptable breach of personal liberty. They've also argued that competition breeds innovation, and that the exchange of fashion between Hippogriffia and other nations has caused new and exciting fashion trends to develop, which would be stifled by the government issuing bans. Notably, Princess Skystar and Silverstream have come out against the proposed bans, saying that Hippogriffia should be friendly towards other nations, with Silverstream pointing to the griffon and pony friends she made in Equestria as reasons why Hippogriffs don't need to be afraid of other creatures."

"Many of you have worked with the AHAC, and know that fascism is against our way of life. Rather than withdrawing us from Zebrica, Crack Lightning would see us become even more entangled in it. Worse yet, fascism requires one supreme leader, which means he undoubtedly plans to sideline and eliminate both Queen Novo and, well, me."\n\nRaft Wood let his statement sink in, reading the room for a moment. The signs had always been there, but it felt odd to say out loud that the charismatic hippogriff which had carried his movement to power now sought to remove Raft Wood from the picture.\n\n"The hardliners control the military, the Phalanx, and a significant portion of Aris First. Since we are only now becoming aware of the threat, we have to assume they are several steps ahead of us. We have the AHAC, the intelligence agencies, and the police, plus the fact that very few hippogriffs want to live in a fascist state. We will have to act quickly, yet subtly. Prevent him from raising the jingoistic fervour of the masses to a high enough pitch that they demand we go to war, watch the military for the signs of a coup d'etat, and remove his influence from Aris First. While we're doing that, I will arrange secret AHAC meetings to build a case to arrest him. If we act too brashly, his supporters will hang us in the streets. Too timidly, and he'll have us all shot.

Crack Lightning, who organized the rally, openly denounced the current Zumidian administration as "foreign lowlifes leeching off the hard-working hippogriffs" and called for Novo to either withdraw from Zumidia immediately, or start "making the zebras pull their weight." He made sure to clarify however, he did not wish for bloodshed as a first choice. Only that they pay their fair share or "kindly excuse themselves from our great nation."\n\nThe crowd rapidly became rowdy, trashing the park they rallied in and disrupting nearby neighbourhoods with chants and parties afterwards, which lasted long into the night.\n\nA coalition of local residents and progressive harmonists have called on Queen Novo to denounce Aris First as "racist and inflammatory," but a spokesgriff for Aris First protested that the rally had been entirely legal, and that Aris First supporters had broken no laws and caused no injury to anygriff's life or property. Regardless of the government's response, the size and enthusiasm of the rallygoers shows that Aris First's message is reaching many hippogriffs in Canterford, so denouncing them could cause a backlash."

 arisfirst.8.desc:0 "In the wake of the massive wave of support their movement has garnered in recent times, Aris First has begun making preparations to hold a rally in the Harmonising Heights neighborhood of Mount Aris, one of the most idyllic spots on the mountain and a popular destination for families on vacation, home to some of the oldest and grandest villas in Hippogriffia.\n\nAris First seems to be pouring huge amounts of money and time into organizing this rally, with a planned attendance in the thousands and an elaborate sound system planned to broadcast their message across Harmonising Heights.\n\nHowever, when they applied for a permit to hold the rally, the local mayor denied it, citing concerns that the rally would damage the neighborhood, bringing up the damage that has been caused at some rallies in the past. Aris First leader Raft Wood, who was once high in Novo's court, has appealed this rejection directly to the Queen, an act unheard of until now, requesting that she overturn the mayor's decision and allow their peaceful gathering to go ahead. Wood said in a heartfelt letter that Aris First has always stood in support of the monarch, and merely wishes to make their message known in a location so in tune with the traditions of the nation they hold dear. As well as assuring her that he and Crack Lightning had already put plans in place to ensure the rally did not ruin the scenery. Finally, he also argued that the mayor's decision was motivated by anti-Aris First bias and pre-existing political agendas against him, and that any other Arisian would allow him to hold the rally.\n\nWhile there is nothing truly illegal about the attempted rally, the concerns of the Mayor are valid, and allowing this petition to be received by the Queen could be a show of official support from the monarch."

Speaking to a small town outside of Mount Aris, as well as broadcasted over the radio, he has railed against the government's choice to prevent his rally from taking place. Stating; "This government claims to wish to bring principles of freedom to our nation, yet they have somehow forgotten the freedom of speech! The Hippogriffs of Mount Aris wish to hear our truth, and somehow they allow one corrupt mayor to prevent us from speaking?"\n\nLightning's remarks were echoed by other Aris First speakers around the country, but the results seem to be lacking. The government's refusal to allow the rally to go ahead seems to have taken some steam out of the movement, especially since the Queen herself made no comment on the issue.\n\nLightning was, however, quick to separate the Queen from her government, saying "Oh Queen Novo! How they have failed and deceived you! One day you shall see that we only fight for your good, and you shall rid yourself of those disgusting foreign lackeys who hold you hostage!"

They were singing and chanting their love for their country. Steel Feather found himself singing along to "Gods Save the Queen" with a voice he never knew he had, as if it was the first time singing it.\n\nWhen Crack Lightning appeared on stage, the wind gusted through Harmonising Heights, and the music of The Mountain joined Steel Feather as he joined the crowd and the crowd joined Crack Lightning, singing out the love of their nation.\n\nAll the papers had lied, they had lied! Aris First were not thugs, they were Aris! Steel Feather joined in the chants of "One Mountain, One People, One Will!" which the crowd broke into after the national anthem, raising their claws to Crack Lightning: the patriot, the war hero, The Ace.\n\nSteel Feather didn't even remember what The Ace had said afterwards, or what his stolid compatriot Raft Wood had said, but he remembered the pure joy of that night for the rest of his life. Of course, when they passed around the enrollment sheets for Aris First, he signed up and pledged a modest donation.

Especially you, Crack Lightning."\n\n"Your- your majesty, I have only ever-"\n"Oh no," interrupted Novo, "You'll speak when spoken to, Crack. I cannot make sense of you. You went from soldier to politician in a heartbeat. I remember you opposing Raft on the retreat to Seaquestria. You're a traveller, not a traditionalist! But suddenly you're the champion against foreign influence. The way you preach to creatures has got me nervous. I am half a mind to force you into retirement, Ace."\n\nCrack started.

She was the one in power here. She was the one who had the choice of whether to allow these two to take control. They should be at every disadvantage; Raft Wood didn't even enjoy his hippogriff form! And yet, she felt fear. Fear of what was to come, around every corner, dark futures lurked. But was what stood before her any brighter? She had to trust her creatures, her hippogriffs and her seaponies. They said they wanted these two in control. She had to do it. She had to. She just had to.\n\nRaft Wood, seeing the distress of his Queen, spoke up again, "Your Highness, I understand this must be stressful for you. It has been for all of us. The enemies of Hippogriffia still gather on the horizon, and we have made you aware of it. We keep no secrets from you and never shall. The nation must be defended." Crack Lightning rose from the ground, keeping his head low, he handed Novo a piece of paper, "Here are the requested appointments."\n\nLooking them over, Novo breathed, nodded slowly, and tapped a bell on her desk.

While they agreed on many things, now that it was time to get down to the business of governing Raft Wood couldn't help but feel like Crack Lightning had forgotten what Aris First was about.\n\nOn the Zumidian problem, Raft Wood had wanted to simply abandon them, but Crack Lightning had insisted on exploiting them. Raft Wood wanted to continue the AHAC's policies of acting primarily as protection against actual extremists, while Lightning wanted to use it to perscute alleged "objective enemies" and enforce some vague but extremely-high standard of loyalty which he had yet to properly explain. When Raft had expressed concern about the growing militancy of Crack's Phalanx, Crack had dismissed it out of claw. While they both wanted to promote harmony among classes, Lightning's proposal on how to do so required major economic restructuring in what he called a "Solidarist economic revolution," massively overturning Aris' economic system for the sake of what he called a national reforging. Most worryingly, Crack Lightning was speaking of foreign powers as if a final war with them was inevitable, and arguing Hippogriffia should strike first.\n\nAfter Crack left, Raft closed his eyes, letting his colleague's proposals stew in his mind. Everything was somehow off. He'd felt it ever since the Phalanx formed, ever since Aris First had adopted the "One Mountain, One People, One Will" slogan. One Will.\n\nRaft's eyes shot open, and he turned to his secretary."

Seeing this, Lightning huffed and rolled his eyes at Wood. \n\n"Well...for example your order, Mr Wood, among other items, requests artillery pieces for coastal defence and air defence. While your order, Mr Lightning, asks for more...aggressive products, such as tanks, bombers and ships to support naval landings." \n"What is your point, Mr Moonfeather?"

The attempts to limit the patriotic activities of the Phalanx, whose soldiers only wanted to stop foreigners from destroying Hippogriffia. Which foreign power did Raft Wood conspire with?

Lastly, he had the pamphlets and posters that were to be dispensed the following day delivered to their distribution centers in order to win the civilian population over to his cause against the weak leadership of Raft Wood, his former ally. Success was certain as his company were approaching the palace gates, guarded by a pair of guards.\n\nThat's when a dozen or so AA-searchlights were activated, pointed at their faces.\n\nIn the time Crack and his paramilitaries were blinded a regiment's worth of soldiers and armoured cars came pouring out of the alleyways and buildings lining the avenue leading to the palace. The lights were switched off and Crack realised that they were boxed in and exposed with weapons of various calibers pointed right at them.\n\n"Lay down your weapons!"\n\nThe shout came from an intercom mounted on one of the armoured cars. Turning towards the origin of the sound Crack saw Raft Wood and Violet Façade standing on top of the car. Sighing, he threw down his pistol, the Phalanx members doing the same. Glaring at his former allies, he addressed them:\n"So, the traitors have come to gloat."\n\nRaft scowled at Crack. "Your terrorism is over, Crack. We've known about your plans for the last month.

Her righteous rage when she'd seen Silverstream on the list had reminded Raft Wood why he'd always been loyal to her.\n\nStill, Raft Wood was uneasy. And it wasn't just the war. Crack Lightning had been the ideological thought leader between the two; Raft Wood had just followed his gut instincts and vague feelings that Hippogriffia needed to be protected against foreign influence. Raft's patriotism had blinded him until the last moment; what was he to do now that he could see? How deep had the fascist rot taken root in his movement? Had his own thoughts been twisted away from Harmony by Lightning's venom?\n\nHe wouldn't embrace the progressives wholesale; the very thought of making Hippogriffia into a second-rate Equestria revolted him, to say nothing of the republicans and the socialists and all those other foreign ideologies. But he would speak to Silverstream, and gather what was left of Aris First for a party conference.

Enemy prisoners were marched alongside the tanks and the troops, close to the crowd so that the gathered civilians could hurl abuse at them. The children strained at the cordons to get close enough to spit on the hated enemies. High above, the fighters of the Arisian airforce flew by. Crack Lightning saluted them, basking in the adoration of his soldiers and letting himself get swept up by the spectacle for just a moment. This ceremony would be repeated every year from now on, a Fourth Day of Freedom to eclipse all others.\n\nAt the height of the ceremony, the Phalangists stopped their marching and their aerial acrobatics, standing and hovering stark still and saluting The Ace.\n"Victory! Victory! Victory!" they chanted, and the chant was soon echoed all across Mount Aris, drowning out the winds of Harmonising Heights and even the twelve-gun salute of the artillery corps."

He'd known the Phalanx wouldn't take his surrender well; he'd known they were two-bit thugs who'd turn on him at the first sign of weakness. At least a few units were still loyal. He almost thought he could hear the distant gunfire: Razorbeak's army units reminding his erstwhile enforcers that The Ace was still in charge. He didn't need them, in the end. Now that the Phalanx were an outlaw organization, minus a few units he'd pardon, he could use them as a scapegoat. Yes, he could still turn this around. He could still keep control.\n\nThe reports were mostly good: the Phalanx had been cleared out of Mount Aris, their leadership was in disarray after their attempted takeover in Seaquestria had completely fizzled, they still held Starfield but wouldn't for long... he leafed to the section on high-level dissidents. Of course, this would have to be updated. Now that his Phalanx had turned on him, could anygriff really be trusted? Still, the report showed that the high-level dissidents were all accounted for; Hard Line, Silverstream, Starry Eyes... He noticed a line. Crack Lightning's bodyguards rushed in as he sputtered:"

How could two dozen armed hippogriffs make it to him without firing a shot? No, his own guards had deserted him. One of the few loyal ones lay unconscious on the floor, stunned by the strike of a rifle-butt.\n\n"So what's your game, now, hmm?" Crack Lightning asked the Princess, "Do you think you can just take over Aris by killing me?"\n"Nope!" Skystar chimed, "I was more thinking you'd give it over to me."\n"And then everything would just fall into place?"\n"Yep! Face it, nogriff likes you, Crack, and they want Harmony back. Your Phalanx has turned on you, the military doesn't like you because you lost the war, and don't even get me started on the workers! Other than that Razorbeak fellow-"\n"Who has standing orders to storm this compound if she loses contact with me. I have long been aware of the threat of kidnapping, Princess."\n"Oh I know! She should be here in like twenty minutes, at the rate she's driving."\n\n"So what now?"\n"Now, you take that radio on your desk and you tell Razorbeak to stand down. You take that radio, and you broadcast a speech - don't worry, I wrote you one - telling the people of Aris that you are sorry, that you failed them all, and that you are stepping down and immediately releasing all of the political prisoners. All of my friends."\n"And if I don't?"\n"I would cock this gun, but I did that five minutes ago."\n"You wouldn't."\n"I fought the Storm King's retinue. I assure you, I would."\n\nCrack Lightning took the microphone. He knew he was out of options, and one way or another he would never see his dream of a mighty Aris realized.

However, without either our backing or the child king as a figurehead, they would have no ability to maintain public order. This makes any orderly withdrawal from Zumidia impossible in the immediate future.\n\nNews of the king's disappearance and the wild rumours surrounding it have aggravated protests against our recent policies, and emboldened irredentist groups seeking to have Zumidia join their "Zonician brothers and sisters" in Colthage."

But if they've picked you to negotiate, it must mean the regency council is not keen on my proposal."\n\n"I was given broad discretion. But no, they weren't too keen.

So tell me again, why should we die for Aris?"\n\nRaft Wood was livid, but he had enough experience at keeping his temper down. He'd been playing this kind of game for a long time. Azrael's question was not rhetorical.\n"You will be dying for Zumidia.

So will you stand with us?"\n\n"If I believed you, I would."\n\n"Very well then, a guarantee. If we win, any treaty we impose on our enemies will require a period of occupation to enforce.

 arisfirst.51.d:0 "The occupation of Chiropterra was never going to be easy, but Raft Wood never thought it would be this bad. Violet Facade had compiled a list of no less than six separate insurgent groups, comprising remnants of the Nightmare's Hoof, the old legions, and civilian militias who had taken up arms against the occupiers.\n\nThey used diverse methods, ranging from well-coordinated raids from the hills to wildcat shootings or bombings to unleashing strange weapons and artifacts the LMRD had sealed away over the years.\n\nEvery village seemed to be sheltering them, every hillside seemed to contain a hideout or a weapon stash. For every cell the Hippogriff garrison rooted out, another three would spring into action.\n\n"We can't go on like this," said Violet, "Our citizens thought the war was over, but every day the death toll gets higher, and there's no end in sight."\n"If they'd just left us well enough alone..." Raft Wood trailed off. "We can't just leave, you know that? They're fanatics. If we withdraw, they'll come back for round two within a few years. How about this: the Chiropterrans had that whole labourer class, right? What if we arm them? They'll keep their old masters down for us."\n"I'd advise against that," said Violet, "The last thing we need is more armed guerillas, and I'd hardly call those labourers a reliable ally. Some of them are Lunarist converts, and plenty of labourers fought against us in the Chiropterran auxiliaries."\n\n"So what's your suggestion?"\n"Send in my agents. Use the AHAC and our intelligence agencies to collect as much information on the insurgent leadership as possible. We'll have to be thorough and methodical, and it'll take quite a while, but I think we can find the exiled legion commanders."\n"And then what?"\n"We capture them, we extract as much intel as we can from them, and then we uproot the whole terrorist network.

The AHAC was working day and night to sort through all the paperwork and intelligence reports from the frontiers to try and bring down the resistance. Governing Chiropterra was a dirty business, covered in blood and dust. But here, things were a bit calmer. The army had control, the police were, on the surface at least, loyal, and she could go about her business as usual.\n\nSeeing her driver parked on the street corner, she began walking towards the vehicle. She needed to get home and get some rest. It'd been a long week. But before she even got close, the car went up in flames, an explosion rocking through the chassis.\n\nRunning back inside the AHAC office, Violet nearly collapsed at her desk. An assassination attempt. Thank the Queen that it had gone off too early. The resistance was getting bolder. How long could Raft keep up this stunt before it all went wrong?"

It'd nearly been a week since the assassination attempt, and things had calmed down a bit. Fewer deaths on the frontier, only a few attacks by resistance groups. Things may finally be getting better.\n\nLooking down, she saw a stallion approaching her residence, at first she didn't recognize him, but then she noticed he had the uniform of a mailpony on. That was... odd? She didn't receive any civilian mail.\n\nHeading downstairs, she saw a letter had been passed through the slit in her door. Throwing the door open, there was no sign of the mailpony anywhere. No car he could have come in and no trace of where he had gone.\n\nThe letter looked incredibly mundane. Picking it up in a towel, she ran it under the blacklight she kept in her personal office, and ran tests for poisons like arsenic. It was clean. Violet nearly shook while she opened the letter, but she knew she had to read it.\n\n"Dear Ms. Facade, I hope you have enjoyed the last week of relaxation since your "incident." Such a shame, you almost ended up like Lightning Charm. Though you better have recovered from the shock by now, since this'll be the calmest you'll be for a long time until you and your forces finally leave Chiropterra. Starting in roughly five days, you'll begin receiving reports of attacks all across Chiropterra. Your soldiers will die, your agents will be murdered, and your occupation will fail. That bomb you saw wasn't a mistake. It was your second to last warning. This is your final one. You, and any other hippogriff in this land, are only alive because we have decided to give you one last chance for mercy.

While some of the now-armed labourers tried to maintain the peace, others exacted revenge on former legionnaires, Moonspeakers, officials, and random Chiropterran civilians.\n\nViolet Facade hadn't expected anything different. Of course they'd want revenge for what the LMRD had done to their fellow labourers, even if the exact details were kept secret from them. Of course they'd want revenge for years of hard labour, forced conversions, for being snatched away from their families and made into slaves. Those who hadn't participated in the riots had been ill-equipped to contain them, having no real training, and had quickly abandoned their posts or died. A few had even returned to Zarantia or Warzena, taking their weapons with them and becoming small-time arms dealers or hired guns.\n\nAnd then there were the true Lunarist converts, who had taken their Hippogriff guns and Hippogriff ammunition and went straight to the hills to join the insurgents. When the insurgents heard of the riots in Howling Hills, they'd gotten there before Hippogriff security forces and killed most of the armed labourers, earning the appreciation of the civilian population and taking the Hippogriff guns with them.\n\nOverall, a complete disaster, although there was a silver lining: in the bloodbath, one of the bodies identified belonged to none other than Lady Commander Lightning Charm, one of the lynchpins of the Chiropterran resistance. If Violet and her agents could act fast, they might just be able to salvage the situation while the resistance was leaderless. But that required her utmost attention, and no meddling from Raft Wood."

They went on and on about how important Lightning Charm was to the Chiropterran resistance, how she was a lynchpin between the different resistance groups.\n\nThat, of course, was the very reason Violet had specifically ordered them to take her alive. With Lightning Charm died the biggest trove of intelligence they could possibly acquire, and though the resistance would be temporarily decapitated, Violet was back to square one.\n\nAnd of course, Lightning Charm had gone down fighting. Of course she had. A martyr for the Chiropterran Resistance to rally around: just what Violet needed right now! No, she decided. From here on, she would direct her agents' efforts personally, from a secure compound within Chiropterra itself. And the fools who had screwed up the raid would be reassigned, or demoted.

With staggering coordination, insurgents struck at the garrison's barracks, mess halls, checkpoints and armouries all across Chiropterra. Weapons were stolen, vehicles sabotaged, and hundreds of hippogriffs killed or taken hostage.\n\nLocal informants considered reliable had led units into ambushes; civilian populations thought pacified had turned out to be hiding more insurgents. The AHAC agents Violet had sent to Chiropterra had all been found dead, killed with bombs, knives, or poison. The records Violet had been keeping in her safehouse were taken: if there was anything the resistance didn't know before, they knew it now.\n\nIn a single day, the Chiropterrans had killed all hope that the occupation could succeed: the resistance had gotten bolder after Lightning Charm's death, rather than fragmenting. Raft Wood needed no persuasion. The occupation was over. Over four days of tense negotiations, Raft Wood and a negotiator speaking for Stirling Silver and for his colleague Gorge Batton worked out a peace treaty.\n\nHippogriffia would fully withdraw its forces from Chiropterra, and pledge to respect the sovereignty of the Chiropterran nation. In exchange, the resistance would release his hostages, one unit at a time to preserve leverage, and allow the remaining garrison to be extracted from Chiropterra without further harrassment from the insurgents.\n\nFinally, in a move which made Raft Wood nearly lose his composure, the negotiator promised that Stirling would prevent Ocean Spray's Crescent Moon Society from launching a chemical attack on Hippogriffia itself, which had been planned for next month. After signing the treaty, Raft Wood couldn't shake the feeling that he had condemned the next generation of Hippogriffs to another Chiropterran war, perhaps more terrible than the last."

Worse yet, almost nocreature in Colthage wants to cooperate with the occupiers, save for a couple obviously-corrupt opportunists.\n\nRaft Wood saw two options at this point. Outright withdrawal practically invited Colthage to attack us again, so that was out of the question. The first, proposed by Moonfeather, would appoint the politician Zaron Zorrel as the new Sufrit. He was well-liked by the landowners of Colthage, and could probably pay enough bribes to keep the peace. He had offered various businessgriffs control of Colthage's largest rubber and oil sources, and Moonfeather insisted he would be able to keep the peace and help Hippogriffia's economy recover.\n\nThe risk of that is that if our puppet should be overthrown, no doubt whoever came to power would rally the populace to exact revenge on Aris. The other option is to use the regional divides within Colthage to end the Colthaginian threat permanently. Split Colthage up into several regional republics, putting Zorrel in charge of only the city of Colthage and leaving the rest to their own devices. This would let us keep a closer eye on Zorrel and his backers, and would mean fewer hippogriffs having to set foot in Colthage. It would also mean less influence for Plumage Moonfeather and his plutocrats. The risk was that this guarantees regional instability and possibly bloodshed for years to come.\n\nBut is that really our problem?"

 arisfirst.73.d:0 "Crack Lightning wasn't used to the world press praising him as a liberator of creatures, and yet here he was. Well, that wasn't entirely true. In the first few weeks after his victory over Chiropterra, the Equestrian and Aquileian papers had nothing but praise for him, but they'd quickly soured the moment he'd started to do what was necessary to properly subjugate them. Typical journalists.\n\nWith MARESOC, however, it was different. As the last inner party members outside the impregnable Ministry of Truth building were brought to the gallows, Crack shook the hoof of the reporter who had just finished giving him a fawning interview for the Manehattan Times.\n\nDuke Haygle, the eminent philosopher Crack had found - surprisingly - still alive after the liberation of Sunset and had selected to lead the reconstruction of New Mareland, had no great love of individual liberty. But the program for his first years in office were almost all that: liberation. Rights restored, prisoners rehabilitated, abuses avenged... it was hard not to be seen as liberators after casting down a tyranny as ridiculous as The Party."

He has equally pressing reasons to, in spite of their current situation in the Great War, avoid a formal declaration of war on Equestria at all costs. This is where you come in.\n\nOur own intelligence services have cooperated with VOPS to work out a plan to cause a communications blackout between Puerto Caballo and Equestria. Seaponies will cut phone and telegraph lines, mail boats and planes will be intercepted, and we will send false messages via magical communication methods.\n\nWe estimate this will give three weeks to take the island before the Equestrians can muster a response. After that, the Ace will have to call off the entire Operation. This message will of course be burned and from here on out, only your signature will be on future orders. Therefore, you will be branded a rogue officer and immediately court-martialled should you fail, thus averting war with Equestria.\n\nShould you succeed before communications are reestablished, given the state of the Great War and our naval power we have full confidence that the Equestrians will not dare to try and retake Puerto Caballo. You will of course be rewarded. You have sole discretion on whether to proceed with Operation: Telegraph."

 arisfirst.80.d:0 ""The idiot..." Raft Wood muttered to himself as he glared at the message on his desk. A message imploring him to send the military to Zarantia in order to protect the oil wells and deal with the locals harassing Moonfeather's operations. The desperation was obvious in the tone of the message. Clearly Moonfeather bit off more than he could chew, thinking his mercenaries could face a determined enemy. If it was up to Wood he would have left the continent to its own devices a long time ago, but with the discovery of oil that notion died thanks to Moonfeather's greed.\n\nNow he was obliged to help his conniving "partner" who had been a thorn in his side since the end of the war, forcing Wood to appease him with pro-business policies and giving Moonfeather precedence in any economic developments he wanted his claws in. Doing so allowed the business community's compliance in reaching Wood's dream of autarky in the nation, but to their advantage. It was proving to be stifling for Wood who wanted to reach his goal with no strings attached.\n\nBut what if Moonfeather was no longer a problem?\n\nThe thought stopped Wood's pacing in his office. Moonfeather's removal would open many doors. He would be free to enact any economic policies, allowing him to craft Hippogriffia's economy as he deemed fit, without the conflicting, ulterior dictations of the various self-serving corporations. The economy would finally serve the nation alone. But at the same time if Moonfeather survived he would definitely make life difficult for Wood. Removing Moonfeather's influence from the business community would also be difficult and they would resist any policies that weren't "pro-business", it might be easier to just keep Moonfeather, seeing as he had the ear of the businesses and knew the intricacies of the economy better than anyone. A handy, if irritating, ally to have when rebuilding a nation.\n\nRaft went back to his desk, formulating his response..."

The collapse of his little venture had meant his associates jumping ship, and what do you know, they'd come to Raft Wood with ample evidence of Moonfeather's various misdeeds.

Somegriff between him and the troops on the ground had sent fully equipped army units to put down the revolt. As Raft tried to investigate the situation, he got reports from Violet Facade that her agents had been compromised.\n\nHe seethed and cursed. Was there no loyalty left on Aris? Had this griff bought off absolutely everycreature? Raft wracked his brain. He didn't know who he could trust. He tried to summon Moonfeather, but he wouldn't respond. He tried the NIA, the royal guard, the army... He wasn't the Queen, he couldn't just decree: in order to get his orders out he had to pass through proper channels of secretaries, bureaucrats, officials, and none of them seemed to care what he said.\n\nAfter hours of trying, Raft Wood slumped down. This had been coming a long time. He'd gradually cut out everypony who really admired him, everypony with guts and fire. Replaced them all with toadies who'd do what they were told. Mercenaries, essentially. Creatures loyal to their own careers and their own wallets.\n\nAnd Moonfeather's wallet was deeper than Raft's. That's what it came down to.

 arisfirst.813.t:0 "Doing things my way"
 arisfirst.813.d:0 "So there I was, running for my life because Raft Wood couldn't spare a few soldiers to safeguard a lynchpin of Aris' economy. Namely, me. I had to call in a few favours and pay out some bribes, but I managed to get some battalions out there to sort them out.\n\nAfter that, it was time to get down to business. Raft Wood had reneged on his end of the bargain, so he had to go. It was a damn shame, I thought he was smarter than that. So, he tries to investigate me, but he's surrounded by stooges and they know what's up. A lot of rich griffs got made in the last couple weeks, that's for sure.\n\nAnd then what do you know, while I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the guy, a blessing falls into my claws. Queen Novo announces that she'll give a speech. Well, we all know what that's gonna be about. Raft is unable to govern and army units are gunning down natives without orders. So she's gonna fire him.\n\nConfession time. Yeah, it was me. The bullets which ripped through Novo, the assassin's "accidental" killing at the hands of that Royal Guardspony, yeah they were both working for me through a couple of shell companies. Damn fool didn't even know he was gonna die when we planted Aris First paraphernalia on him.\n\nAnyways, the speech was given underwater and Novo's a tough one, so I was reasonably sure she'd survive. After that it was a pretty simple matter. Raft was disgraced, and while Novo was barely conscious she had to appoint a provisional government. I had a fright for a moment when it looked like she'd appoint Skystar as Princess-Regent, but no. With most of the 'respectable' high officials already working for me and Novo in such a state, it was surprisingly easy to convince her to appoint me. Easily the most expensive operation I've ever done, and we haven't even gotten to cleaning up, but now... the sky really is the limit."

 arisfirst.81.d:0 "Raft Wood could feel an oncoming headache through the blaring of seashell trumpets, thumping of clam drums and beating of coral xylophones. This state subsidized culture festival was proving to be quite the endurance challenge for him as he couldn't stand the corny upbeat music contrasted with the grim paintings surrounding him.\n\nMost of the paintings, painted by veterans of the war, showcased war-torn landscapes, portraits of soldiers or battle scenes riddled with the corpses of friend and foe alike. Some of the paintings were less bleak, some were confusing abstract artworks and some calm landscapes of the countryside.\n\nThe music, on the other fin, wasn't as diverse. Bands would come and go from the stage set in the middle of the festival but they all played cheery music, whether patriotic anthems espousing the values and achievements of the nation or catchy ballads telling some captivating story of a hero saving the day.\n\nThis combination of the arts was making Raft miserable. He would rather be alone in his office, addressing the pile of paperwork waiting for him. Instead, he had to attend this festival to show the state's support in reviving Hippogriffian culture.\n\nThe sound of a pair of hooves stomping to the sound of the beat directly to his right reminded him that he wasn't entirely alone in this excursion. Unlike Raft's sour demeanour, Violet Facade was thoroughly enjoying this event, singing along with the crowd, buying souvenirs from the various vendors at the festival and spending a fair amount of time looking at artworks that piqued her interest.\n\nRaft could only shake his head, amused at his colleague's merriment." #Dunkle's event

She had recently delivered several inflammatory addresses calling for his removal, and while Raft had little fear that he would convince Novo, it had put a dent in his popularity. With the Aris First convention looming, he had to make sure she was accounted for. Five minutes after their scheduled meeting time, Skystar swam in, glancing back and forth between Raft and Violet Facade.\n\n"I'm just gonna say," began the Princess, "I don't regret anything I said, and you can't intimidate me into stopping. I am going to keep calling for your removal until you're removed, or until I become Queen, and when I'm Queen I'll have the power to get rid of you. And there's nothing you can do about that."\n\nRaft set his jaw. "Princess, what you've been saying over the last few weeks would get anypony else arrested. You've attacked the basic faith in Arisian institutions, called for foreign powers to intervene in our politics, spread blatant misinformation-"\n"You might control what reaches my mom's ears but you don't control what's true!"\n"As I was saying, you've spread misinformation. The royal family currently cannot be prosecuted, but I am of half a mind to bend to the wishes of certain reformists who argue that nopony should be above the law."\n\n"We have no wish to force a confrontation between the crown and Her Majesty's Government," added Violet Facade, "But you are actively promoting discord."\n"You're bluffing. My mom would never side with you over me if you tried to arrest me."\n\n"I wouldn't be so sure," countered Violet, "Nonetheless, we are poised to pass a law which will effectively outlaw assisting you, reprinting your addresses or attending your events. You're turning into a demagogue, Skystar, and I know how to handle demagogues."\n"Even if you do I'll still be able to dismantle all this bigotry you call Harmony the minute I become queen."\n\n"Fine then," said Raft, "Now, I know where you stand. We will have to do this the hard way. Remember, Princess, there is ample precedent for a princess to be left uncoronated, if they are deemed unfit for the crown. Prince Greenreef, for example, in 672 ALB, was deemed unfit due to his uncontrolled temper, leading to a regency council of ten years. And between what you've said in public and what you've said here, we have ample material to do just that. I don't want to bring this up with Novo, so I would suggest you not force my fin.""

 arisfirst.83.d:0 "Raft Wood had founded the Aris First committee, had defined much of its strategy in the early days. In a very real way, although Crack Lightning provided the raw charisma and some of the boldest moves, Raft Wood had been the mastermind behind their campaign. It was his connections, his political acumen, which kept them respectable enough to be viewed as a legitimate option to form a government, and his organizational skills which had gotten them off the ground.\n\nNow, Crack Lightning was imprisoned for Anti-Harmonic Terrorism. Huge swathes of the movement had been disgraced, sacked or jailed. What did they stand for, without the North Zebrican War to keep what was left of them together?\n\nThat was what this convention was supposed to be about: uniting Aris First behind a new platform. But as the delegates, officials and organizers filed in, as they took their seats and Raft saw the gaps in their ranks, he couldn't help but wonder if there was any Aris First left to unite.\n\nRaft Wood gave a perfunctory opening address, smiling slightly at the disappointed look on the reporters' faces in the press gallery as he finished. No doubt they'd expected something more, something bold, but that wasn't why he was here. He was here to discover the new Aris First, if such a thing even existed, not to create it himself. The next days would determine the direction of Aris First... and whether Raft Wood's government would pay any heed to that direction."

The presence of AHAC agents, particularly with Violet Facade at Raft's right fin, meant that everypony there spoke in circles around issues. Normally-fiery orators instead swam gently around their own positions, careful to distance themselves from the long list of positions currently or potentially deemed anti-Harmonic.\n\nThe result was that nopony took a strong stance on anything, nopony's minds were changed, and very few votes on policies were even called. Crack Lightning, Zumidia, the fiasco in Chiropterra, the rocky relationship between the government and the monarchy... not a single one of them was mentioned.\n\nRaft could keep it like this. He could simply let the convention affirm some uncontroversial principles, and give himself a free fin on what actually mattered. That wasn't what he wanted, but at least the AHAC agents were keeping out the worst case scenario: the convention devolving into some kind of brawl or schism."

Many of the delegates, veterans of the North Zebrican War, started talking about their experiences and how it had changed their perspectives. Finally, towards the end of the second day of the convention, one of them got up to speak, encouraged by her comrades.\n\n"Skyward Flame," she began, "Corporal, Seventh Infantry Regiment. Any of you ever fought in the desert? Worst theatre. Anyways, one minute I'm helping my BARgriff reload, next moment shells explode all around us. Whole section is wiped out in a single barrage. I'm left with a dislocated knee and a shredded wing. Everything hurts. I still haven't recovered, but my doctor says I'll be able to fly within a year."\n\nShe held up a ragged fin as emphasis. A hush had fallen over the convention as she continued her story.\n\n"So, I stayed there in a depression in the sand, my dead squadmate beside me, while the enemy combed over our positions. I'm not gonna lie: I played dead. When they'd passed, I found I couldn't move, the pain was too much. So there I was, lying in a ditch full of sand. The heat was so intense that I could barely breathe. Then, after two days, he showed up. Barekzaal. He'd also been stuck behind enemy lines, but he wasn't hurt. That came later."\n\nShe showed a picture of him: a zebra stallion with one eye and a sarcastic grin. "We stayed in that ditch for five days. He never left my side. I was delirious, and he stayed by me, venturing out to get me water. I thought I was gonna die, but he stuck with me."\n\nShe took a moment, then finished her story: "Well, I didn't die. Eventually, he found some friendly recon troops and got us rescued. I kept writing to him afterwards. He'd saved my life, you know? When the war ended, he had one eye. One eye and no family. This war was fought on Zumidia. So Zumidians like him... they don't have anything to go back to."\n\nShe took one more breath, looking to the other veterans. "There are so many stories like this one. The Zumidians fought for us. They bled for us. I've been a member of Aris First since 1007, I didn't think we owed them anything. But a Zumidian saved my life, and he doesn't have a home to go back to. But Barekzaal... he has friends on Aris. He's a skilled worker. He could make a life here. Shouldn't we let him? My fellow patriots, I say that if a zebra has fought for Aris, they should be able to become a citizen of Aris. Thank you.""

 arisfirst.842.d:0 "Another day at the convention was coming to a close, when a controversial motion reached the floor. Somepony named Steel Feather got up and cleared his throat, his tired eyes glancing over to Raft Wood.\n\n"I was there, you know," he began, "I was there at the start of our whole movement. I'm not proud of everything, but I'm proud of what we've built in the end. An Aris for Arisians, for all Arisians. A strong Aris, which has stood up to our enemies. Internal and external."\n\nThat last statement sent a little shiver through the crowd. "At one point," he admitted, "I was one of those enemies. I got involved with the Phalanx-" immediately, he was cut off by boos, but when they quieted down he pressed on.\n\n"I got involved with the Phalanx for the same reasons all of you joined Aris First. I wanted my country back. I really thought they were harmless. I thought Crack Lightning was a great hippogriff. Don't lie, all of you did too! I was never involved in the violence, I was a little too old, but I was a card-carrying member, and I served my time. I'm out now on parole, with my kids, but I came here to plead on behalf of other former members. Please, many of us didn't know what we were doing. We're patriots just like you. We don't wanna hurt anypony."\n\nRaft Wood privately scoffed. Deniability was always Crack's method. "A Veteran's Organization devoted to adventure," he'd called the Phalanx. Dangerous subversives who'd gotten within inches of plunging Aris into a fascist nightmare, and now they wanted clemency.\n\nTo his surprise, the measure was fairly popular, and Raft realized he'd either have to speak out against it as leader, and in so doing reveal to the public just how dangerous his former allies were and still could be... Or start preparing pardons."

 arisfirst.843.d:0 "Yet another argument broke out in the convention, this time over whether Aris has any obligations to its former allies. Raft Wood hadn't anticipated any self-respecting Aris First member to openly suggest such a thing, but this convention had surprised him a few times already.\n\nIt was in our long-term interest, the 'internationalists' argued, to protect friendly regimes on the continent from aggression, namely Warzena and Zumidia. An Aris under siege was ultimately not fully independent. They even invoked the blood shed in the North Zebrican War, arguing that the heroes of the war would have died in vain if we now abandon our allies to the wolves.\n\nThey stressed that the main purpose of this would be deterrence and protecting our own interests, not warmongering or meddling in the affairs of others. There were of course accusations of being idealistic Equestrian-style interventionists, of wanting to put Aris second, of undermining the isolationist foundation of the movement, and so on. In the end, Raft Wood himself was undecided, but the convention ultimately settled the issue via a slim majority."

 arisfirst.844.t:0 "The Will of the Gods"
 arisfirst.844.d:0 "On the last day of the convention, an old, half-blind preacher swam up to the podium. She presented an open letter signed by ministers, concerned religious citizens and philosophers calling for the first Holy Synod since the beginning of the Line of Novo.\n\n"My friends," she said, "Aris is beautiful, Aris is wonderful, but I believe we have forgotten who made Aris. Was it not said that our home was created by the gods Tiamat and An? It is a gift, and the ingratitude which has swept our nation and nearly destroyed it stems from us forgetting that our home is a gift from our gods. We turn to foreign ideals, we turn away from each other, because Arisians have become self-absorbed. The hydra of fascism, communism, socialism, all the many heads of anti-harmony connect to the body of this forgetting."\n\nThere were murmurs, discussions. Most of the seaponies there were casually religious, but even Raft Wood only rarely thought of the gods. His local temple in Seaquestria was little more than a tiny hollow in a reef, and even then the minister lived an austere life.\n\nThe discussions turned into fierce debates. The Line of Novo had been established in rebellion against tyrannical priest-kings centuries ago, and there was good reason no high priests had been appointed since then. Some argued that allowing a Synod to select new high priests would damage the foundations of the kingdom. Others argued that the kingdom had gone astray precisely because of centuries without religious leadership. On and on they argued, until finally a decision was reached."

It had been difficult, but he felt like he and the delegates had successfully threaded the needle, and could move on from the tainting influence of Crack Lightning without losing the core of Aris First. He was reading over the collected resolutions when the first punch was thrown.\n\nWhoever had thrown it was obviously more used to hippogrifff form: flippers were unsuited to bludgeoning and the extra drag of the water robbed the punch, really a slap, of any momentum. But that didn't matter. The fight was broken up immediately with nopony seriously hurt. But that also didn't matter. The offending seapony was ejected from the convention. That, of course, didn't matter either.\n\nWhat mattered was that over the next twenty minutes, everypony there had taken a side. The offending delegate was a vicious hooligan, cried the more liberal-minded members. He was just standing up for himself against the destruction of Aris First, howled the more conservative delegates. The collected resolutions, representing the entire work of the convention, were re-debated in louder and louder terms as the convention ate itself.\n\nIn the days following, Aris First formally split apart, with new factions forming and dissolving day by day. Delegates who's resolutions were shot down went to the press with their grievances, many making personal attacks against Raft himself, accusing him of manipulating the convention. Raft watched on in silence as Aris First was reduced to a tiny fraction of its membership."

Aris First, Aris always, Aris Strong and Free. It was a triumph of tradition and nationality. Raft Wood couldn't wait to put it into practice.\n\nThat night, talking about it with Violet Facade, he felt like they had finally gotten past Crack Lightning. Crack was, at the end of the day, a revolutionary. He'd wanted to change things, to abandon tradition. He wanted to impose Aris upon other nations, which made him an internationalist, not a nationalist. All of Raft Wood's shame at being duped into enabling him, it all washed away. Crack was nothing like real Aris Firsters, and he never had been.\n\nWhen she left, Violet Facade couldn't help but doubt. Raft had doubled down on xenophobia and called it Harmony. But she'd helped make this, right? This was her platform as much as his. Violet had to put her doubts aside in order to do her job, which now meant protecting this agenda from those who would try and sabotage it. And she was, at the end of the day, very good at her job."

Aris First, Aris Strong and Free, but not Aris Only. It was nationalistic, but had liberal elements and approached its task in a spirit of moderation and practicality. Raft Wood swam to his suite to meet with Violet Facade, his mind plagued with anxieties.\n\nThat night, talking about it with Violet Facade, he felt like they had finally gotten past Crack Lightning. The new platform was free of radicalism, hatred and malice. Whenever Crack got a copy of the paper in whatever cell he was rotting in, he'd probably throw up.\n\nAs Violet Facade swam home, she couldn't help but be proud of Raft. He'd been anxious at first, but as they'd went through it point by point she'd convinced him that this was for the best. Aris First would evolve and change, and that was a good thing, but its core would remain. Aris would endure, grow, and become stronger with time."

By the third day, some delegates had sent their regrets, and the press gallery was noticeably thinned.\n\nIn an awkward moment, a resolution was passed unanimously congratulating the Queen for her leadership of the nation and reaffirming the government's commitment to the line of Novo. Raft Wood couldn't contradict them, despite his private feud with Princess Skystar, as officially he served at Her Majesty's pleasure. Nothing substantive came of the resolution, other than a general feeling that they had been good seaponies.\n\nIt was clear, now, that this convention was a waste of time. Propriety was the order of the day, everypony trying to be more polite, trying to ingratiate themselves with Raft Wood and Violet to try and get a small, personal share of the postwar world. But Aris First, the movement, had lost that spark which had made it so powerful. Perhaps it was for the best. Perhaps there was no way to have populism without fascism. And at least now he'd be able to keep Aris First in line.\n\nWhen Raft returned to his office after the last day of the convention, he found another letter from Plumage Moonfeather. Something about more "friendly requests." It didn't matter. With Aris First fizzling out, and relations with the monarchy tepid, he'd have to be extra careful from now on.

Then the Aris First party came to power...\n\nThey soldiered through the upheaval that came with the sudden regime change; they beared the discrimination they faced from their neighbours, born from the regime's xenophobic rants; they stayed when others fled, believing that Aris was their home even if it was under a new government. Zorca's wife, Zabreen, even joined the auxiliaries when the North Zebrican War broke out.\n\nShe would pay the ultimate price for an ungrateful government.\n\nNow Zorca was sitting in the empty bedroom, crying about their hopeless situation. Their possessions, as well as another zebra family's, were loaded onto a wagon outside of their home. They had few things left, having sold off most of their possessions in order to fund their journey back to their ancestral homeland. Stifling a sob, he got up and walked out of the bedroom, down the hallway and out of the front door of their former home. Outside, his eldest, Zabreen, was herding her two younger siblings onto the wagon. Along with the same name, she looked and acted just like her mother, she was caring, stubborn...\n\nZorca looked away before the waterworks started again. He took his place next to Zaneem, the oldest son of the other family. His mother and little brother were already on the wagon. Fastening his harness, he gave a nod to the boy and they started pulling, taking a last glance at the house."

She refused to let her family members help her, not wanting them to see her in such a vulnerable state. Initially, it was difficult to live with the contraption made of wood and hinges, but she got used to it. Such was the price for stepping on a landmine. After a bit of twisting and pushing it slid into a comfortable position. Satisfied, she got up and joined her family in the front yard. Zorca and Zabreen, her namesake, waited for her outside. Between them was the stroller that carried the sleeping forms of the twins, Zalid and Zulit. Together, they all made their way to the town hall.\nThey were met with pandemonium as they entered the town hall. Zumidians were everywhere, queueing up, filling out documents and looking for assistance among the dozens of clerks that were moving about, trying to complete their work.\n"Corporal Zabreen!" came a shout form the office closest to them. Zabreen turned to see her old commanding officer.\n"Lieutenant Clam." she replied, saluting. He returned the salute and ushered her and her family into the office, closing the door behind them.\n"How's the leg?" Clam asked as everyone settled.\n"Not as good as the original, but at least it doesn't hurt when I bump my knee, so I've got that going for me." she replied. Clam chuckled at the joke. "What're you doing here, sir?"\nClam motioned at the piles paperwork. "I'm here to ensure that all auxiliary veterans receive their citizenship, so if you'll just recite everything this pen-pusher says..."

Talking with Razorbeak was terrifying, as she looked straight into your eyes, never looked away, and hardly ever seemed to blink.\n\n"About your loyalty." She put a claw on his desk. "Now, I'm not.

 arisfirst.67.d:0 "It was a quiet reform. Henceforth, in addition to all of the standard classes at the academies, all commissioned officers would be required to take a semester-long course entitled "Basics of Solidarist Theory", with reading assignments of the Ace's writings. His Doctrine of Solidarism was the central text, but also read was his critique of Marksism, his critique of Harmony, and his essay on the importance of national unity. Although currently-serving officers were not required to take the course, if they were to return to the academy the semester would be covered by the state as long as they passed the course.\n\nThis course, although designed to be easy, was of paramount importance to Crack's plans. He knew that a full-on purge of non-Solidarist elements of the military would be disastrous, crippling the capability of Aris to project power and potentially sparking a civil war. So instead, he provided a gentle nudge to ensure that in the future, the armed forces would assist the Phalanx itself as the exemplars of Arisian ideals, and perhaps his successor would come from within their ranks. In the meantime, understanding why they were fighting would keep officers resilient against bribes or cowardice.\n\nThe professors teaching the course, naturally, were all either members of or ardent supporters of the Phalanx. Although harmonist and leftist professors were still permitted to teach classes on military theory, only the most ideologically pure could be counted on to teach classes on political theory."

 arisfirst.69.d:0 "Crack Lightning had won, that much was clear. But there was still so much work to be done. He had gathered several of the old campaign agents from the Aris First days, and had a folder for each of them. These were not the bloodthirsty Phalanx brutes; these griffs were more tactful.\n\nTheir folders contained lists. Lists of books, lists of authors, lists of librarians, lists of archives, lists of potentates in the relevant syndicates. They were to affect a gradual purge of certain notions from the historical record. Revised editions would be published. Archival material would get lost or damaged. For a few key texts, critical editions would have to be written with refuting annotations, and archival material "discovered" to back up those refutations. New official histories would be compiled. Outright book bannings were too blunt an instrument; Crack had the luxury of time.\n\nThe goal was collective forgetting. The roots of Harmony went deep in Aris' history, and for all his traditionalist rhetoric, Crack Lightning had affected a revolution. Now the task was to gradually make his creatures forget that history, in order to prevent regress.\n\nThe wars of old would be centered in the historical record. The characters and thoughts of ancient rulers would be re-framed. Harmony, it would turn out, was not so deeply rooted after all. Crack Lightning had merely woken us up from a brief moment of weakness, and returned us to what we were always meant to be. Novo's soft-finned Harmonic rule, it would turn out, was the exception. Hard-hearted and iron-clawed rule, patriotism, militarism... these were the rule."

It is a pity, that to fulfil our destiny we had to stifle theirs, but such is the way of the world."\n\n"Sir?" asked Razorbeak as Crack Lightning paused his speech with a drawn-out sip, "The task at claw?"\n\n"Yes, yes, of course. Razorbeak, you wanted to fill the vacancy for military governor of Chiropterra. I assume you know the rather gruesome nature of your predecessor's departure. So, tell me your plans for the occupation."\n\n"Well," began Razorbeak, "I will start by reducing work quotas. In many districts, the work quotas could drop by as much as fifty percent. I'll ensure that each district is run according to the highest standards: abolish child labour, provide medical care, increase food rations. Drop the death rate; as long as they think they're dead anyways they'll do anything to avenge themselves. Then the matter of reprisals. When terrorist attacks happened, my predecessor would order indiscriminate reprisals, no sense of proportionality. I will set clear rules: when they kill one of ours, we kill one of theirs, preferably chosen from those most likely to have aided the insurgents. Clear rules, clear consequences; justice, not malevolence. I will make sure every community knows that it is the resistance endangering their lives, not us."\n\nCrack raised an eyebrow. "My my," he drawled, "Razorbeak, I am impressed. You'll turn your predecessor's failure into an asset. I remember back when we started all this I'd expect you to say 'crack down harder,' but you've gained quite an appreciation for the more precise use of force.

To do so would have been an insult to Queen Novo.

For the natives, it meant many different things:\n\nFor the Warzenans, it meant a race to Tobuck. Even as their capital lay smoldering and in ruins, the Warzenan army scrambled into the port city, locking it down in street-to-street fighting with the last of the Tobuck mercenaries. The Warzenans could feel pride, even as reconquering the Tobuckians meant thousands more mouths to feed and another city they couldn't afford to rebuild.\n\nFor the Tobuckians, it meant a return to Warzenan rule, along with hunger and poverty. The war had devastated the infrastructure, the waters were polluted, and Chiropterran conscription had ruined the meager harvest. It meant more of the same: slum life and foreign rule.\n\nFor the Imazeeb, it meant the death of the dream of Zarantia. With Tobuck lost again and the tribes bitterly divided over the grievances accumulated during Chiropterran rule, Umalez Ataghan could no longer rule. She retreated into the desert, joining a mysterious group of nomads led by a stranger named Afsax. The Imazeeb fractured, and most of them reverted to a tribal lifestyle.

Skystar smiled a little, still holding something back. Finally, Novo collected herself and reassumed a small fraction of her normal regality.\n\n"Do you hate me, Skystar?"\n"What?! Mom, no!"\n"It's okay if you hate me. Even just a little. I gave Crack Lightning the reigns of power, I know I did. I didn't know at the time how bad things would become, but you and Silverstream, you warned me. Told me not to give into fear. And I didn't listen. I'm sorry."\n\nSkystar threw her arms around her mother, sobbing into her shoulder.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, Novo let go of Skystar, resting a claw on her shoulder. "I know the other reason you've come here. I bet everygriff who helped you thought that after it was all done, you'd be queen and not me. Well... they're right. I've made so many mistakes, and Hippogriffia needs you now. And I think you're ready. The courage you've shown, the conviction... you will make a wonderful queen.""

And you each want the other in cabinet with you? What happened to Friendship? What happened to Revolution?" Posada tensed up, even more than usual when she was in Hippogriff form. Silverstream's beak opened, but she couldn't find words.\n\nSkystar threw the paper aside and tackle-hugged the both of them. "This is so great!" she exclaimed, her stern facade breaking instantly, "I was worried the pinks and the blues would kill each other after Lightning was gone, but this is awesome!

It was one of the preconditions of his confession, it was essential for Aris to heal, but there was somepony, or somepony's ghost, who was telling her to go back on it. In the middle of all the petitions was a front-page newspaper spread, showing a grainy photograph of the body of Starry Eyes.\n\nStarry Eyes had been abducted by the Phalanx on Lightning's orders, and had died after severe beatings. According to the griff on trial for the murder, "We just wanted to rough her up a bit, send a message like we did with Hard Line... but I guess we ah, went a little too far. Took her hours to die."\n\nSkystar never knew Starry Eyes, but in the last hour she'd read story after story of her kindness, her naivety, her attempts to help everycreature she came across. There were letters from RWP members she'd taken care of after they'd been beaten by the Phalanx, from formerly-homeless seaponies she'd sheltered in her own house, from one of Raft Wood's associates saying she'd helped him keep his job when his employer had tried to fire "politically unreliable" staff... some of them explicitly demanded "Justice for Starry Eyes," others just shared the stories of how she'd touched their lives.\n\nWhen Skystar saw that one of the letters was from Silverstream, she slumped down. Lightning's trial date was still months away, but Skystar knew he'd probably be given the death penalty. And then she'd have to stick by her principles and commute it, and everycreature this creature had touched would hate her for it. Skystar was getting a headache."

"I was just explaining to Silverstream how Crack Lightning took over. The key was building connections at the highest levels, mostly within the Royal Court. Teaming up with an establishment figure like Raft Wood opened doors for Crack, and before long he'd swayed enough of Novo's advisors to trick her into letting him form a government."\n\nSkystar winced at the reference to her mother's role in Crack's rise to power. "Ok, so what can we learn from this?"\n"That's easy, power shouldn't be concentrated in the Royal Court. Too much power in too few claws is a recipe for fascist takeover."\n\nSilverstream scratched her chin. "I'm not sure that's right. Plenty of court members were critical of Aris First. And Crack Lightning's takeover wasn't caused by court intrigue, it was a result of mass politics. Aris First recruited aggressively and held huge rallies across the country to put pressure on the government. It was popular pressure that convinced Queen Novo to appoint Crack, not some royal advisor."\n\n"Well," said Posada, "that's a very interesting theory, but I still think giving the people more power is the best way to stop fascism.

Many creatures were directly involved, and many others stood by and did nothing. Perhaps the average citizen was just afraid of what would happen if they spoke up, but what about the businessgriffs who willingly signed contracts with the dictator? What about the workers who eagerly joined his national labor syndicates? Each and every case required a round of discussion.\n\n"We seem to be avoiding the real question," said Skystar, "so I'm just going to say it: how did so many creatures support Crack Lightning, or at least passively accept his rule? I thought we were supposed to be a good country, the nation that brought down the Storm King! Then a few years went by and suddenly all our subjects were lining up to serve a fascist conqueror..."\n\n"Our people aren't bad creatures," Silverstream replied, "they just lost their way. They forgot about friendship and embraced fear instead. When I studied in Equestria I saw that even the ponies sometimes lose their faith in Harmony, but they always come back to it in the end."\n\n"It's important to reject prejudice and embrace friendship, sure." Posada interjected, "But there's more to it than that. Our country lives under capitalism, a system that pits creatures against each other in a contest for profit. While our government preached the virtues of Harmony, our economic system taught creatures to fend for themselves and exploit others. Under those conditions is it any wonder why Aris First was able to find support?"\n\nSkystar sighed. They both made good points, but which one was right?"

Numbers were also ruled out, since the combined population of Aris and Seaquestria should have allowed us to match our enemies in the field.\n\nInstead, the commission concluded that our defeat was a result of the shortcomings of our political and military leadership. While Crack Lightning and the other leaders of the Phalangist state were determined to win the war, they were not able to convince the civilian population to fight it. Most Arisians did not share the Phalangist goal of establishing a hegemony across North Zebrica, so Phalangist propaganda argued for the war's necessity with vague appeals to patriotism. Our military leadership, while highly competent, was marred by confusion about our true objective and uncertain loyalty to the Phalangist state.\n\nAs we struggled to find a reason to fight the war, what little intelligence we have on our enemies suggests they had a much better understanding of who they are, how they fight, and why they fight. This led to better morale and a greater clarity of vision, which the commission argues were the keys to their victory. If we are to stand a chance against them in a hypothetical Second North Zebrica War, we must have clear objectives and a unity of purpose between the public, civilian and military leaders."

In the end they published a short and perfunctory report that drew few conclusions and was read by almost no one.\n\nMany officers are disappointed that our entry into a new war has cost us the opportunity to learn from the last one.

During Crack Lightning's rule she had tried to be precise and measured, but time and again her brutal nature had won out. There were four provable murders she had ordered alongside dozens of kidnappings and blackmails.\n\nShe had even personally tortured one hippogriff to within an inch of his life when he'd tried to warn Raft Wood of the details of Crack Lightning's planned takeover. Throughout her trial she perfectly fit the image of Lightning's mad dog, denouncing the court and having to be physically restrained. For her, the firing squad was never in doubt.\n\nCrack Lightning's demeanour could not have been more different. He spoke eloquently, relying on his attorney at times and at others taking the stand in his own defence. None of his public confessions could be used in court, as they were made quite literally at gunpoint. And so every kidnapping, every beating, every violation of creature rights had to be painstakingly traced back to him.\n\nHe hadn't personally ordered Hard Line tortured, or at least it couldn't be proven. He hadn't personally ordered Starry Eyes abducted, so he could not be convicted of the most famous murder of his regime.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the Phalangist testimonies, he might have gotten off with a moderate prison sentence. On the third day of the trial his cronies were brought to the witness stand. Phalangist after Phalangist gave their testimony, painting a consistent picture where they all knew what Lightning wanted, even when he didn't say it. And then a few of them produced tapes and documents contradicting the alibis Crack had carefully constructed for himself, explaining that they had kept those pieces of evidence despite orders to destroy them, either as mementos or as insurance.\n\nAt that, Crack Lightning finally lost his cool, calling them traitors and liars. After a 128-hour trial, Crack Lightning was sentenced to die."

Today, Posada and Silverstream sat next to her, Posada averting her eyes, Silverstream glaring at the paper on Skystar's desk.\n\nThe paper was a commutation order: Crack Lightning, the tyrant of Aris, was to have his death sentence for the murder of Starry Eyes and the kidnapping and assault of so many others commuted to a lifetime prison sentence. All it required now was Skystar's royal signature. On the other side of the room was a roaring fireplace. Skystar hadn't picked up her pen yet when she glanced side-to-side at her advisors.\n\nPosada opened her beak first: "I know that you've received a petition, mostly signed by Blues, to not commute Crack's sentence. As their representative in your cabinet I... I have to remind you of that. But I think you should spare him."\n\nSilverstream snapped: "I say throw it into the fire and let the bastard die!"\n\nSkystar shook her head. "Most of the other Harmonists have been clear that I should keep my promise."\n"Yeah well I don't care! You never should have made that promise and this would be like sparing the Storm King!"\nPosada raised her voice: "Crack Lightning is not the Storm King! I would know!"\n"Yeah, you were tortured by the Storm King, and Starry Eyes was tortured TO DEATH by Lightning! He spared you because you were his friend, and now you're gonna repay the favour, is that it?"\n"Don't you dare!" snarled Posada.\n\n"Stop it!" shouted Skystar, silencing them both. "I haven't made up my mind, and insulting each other won't help me. On the one claw, I promised Crack I'd spare him. On the other claw, maybe I shouldn't have. Maybe justice is more important than mercy, or my word."\n"Justice for Starry Eyes!" declared Silverstream, as so many had done before.\nPosada whispered: "Starry Eyes wouldn't have seen it that way.""

"To crow over me?"\n\n"No." Posada stared deep into his eyes. "To ask you--why? Why did you kill Starry Eyes, who was no threat? Why did you have your own citizens tortured? Why did you act so evilly towards your own people?"\n\n"I was trying to help Aris," Crack replied. "To make us strong and feared."\n\n"Is that the truth?" Posada demanded. "Or the excuse you use to sleep at night?"\n\nCrack swallowed. "Posada, I only wanted to make sure we never suffered again like we did under the Storm King."\n\n"And so you decided to become almost as bad as him," Posada said coldly. "I can't believe I used to call you my friend. Were you always this horrible, or did power corrupt you?"\n\nCrack averted his eyes. "I..."\n\n"I hope power did corrupt you.

Her mother argued that a queen should never allow a constitution to come between her and her subjects, but she could see how the potential benefits outweighed the costs.

Nearly every qualified creature in the kingdom had become embroiled in the partisan divide between the Blues and the Pinks, so no matter who she chose she was certain to upset one side or the other.\n\nOn the one claw, Skystar might put her trust in Silverstream and the Harmonists by appointing them to lead the constitutional convention. The Blues would throw a fit, but the Pinks would undoubtedly draft a document that stayed true to traditional liberal Harmonist ideals. Maybe after years of chaos and fascist rule her kingdom could use a return to tradition.\n\nOn the other claw she could give Posada and the Communists control of the convention. The Blues would likely write a constitution that enshrined all kinds of socialist principles in law. The Pinks wouldn't be happy with that, but maybe creating a more fair and equitable system would be worth the backlash.\n\nThen again, there was a third option.

They would either take their revenge, depleting their strength in another bloody war and then being too soft-hearted and exhausted to subjugate North Zebrica as Chiropterra had, or they would fail, but do enough damage that Chiropterra wouldn't be able to demographically sustain further expansionism for another few generations at least. [CTH.GetLeader] could secure his legacy. Colthage could be the hegemon of North Zebrica at last, not Chiropterra or Hippogriffia, no matter who won. All he had to do was betray his one ally."

 antifa.23.d:0 "Recently a shocking novel has been published, which has been the cause of outcry in light of the horrors of the Ace's rule. It is set in an alternate history, where instead of choosing the ill-fated Raft Wood as his partner in Aris First, Crack Lightning chose Posada. Together they reformed Hippogriffia into a nationalist workers' state, executed Queen Novo for treason, carved an empire out of North Zebrica alongside the Colthaginians, and then launched a brutal punitive war against the yetis in the name of revenge against the Storm King. At the climax of the book, Posada orders nuclear weapons used on every city in yeti territory. Immediately afterwards unconditional surrender is offered and a ruthless military governate is established, ruled over by Razorbeak.\n\nThe RWP has denounced the novel as a slanderous attack on communism, claiming they would never ally with a fascistic dictator. Even many harmonists feel the book is in poor taste, especially so soon after the liberation of Aris. Although a few have asked for the book to be censored, or at least sold via mail order rather than in stores, such requests are unlikely to succeed due to the strong desire for freedom of the press.\n\nPrivately Posada confessed to Princess Skystar that she was deeply shaken by how well the author understood her motives and her mental state. "After my escape, I wanted revenge," she admitted. "I was vulnerable, and I easily could have wound up in Aris First. I hated the Storm King and his armies, and if I'd read Beakolini instead of Marks, I might well have wound up a fascist.""

Turqouise Stormcloud, an infamous Phalangist guilty of torturing several creatures, managed to evade the authorities after Crack Lightning's fall. He was at the docks attempting to flee the country when one of his victims recognized him and shot him point blank.\n\nStormcloud died, and his killer was arrested at the scene. The griff is almost certainly going to prison for murder given the number of witnesses, but since his target was a violent Phalangist criminal, public opinion is overwhelmingly on his side. A petition asking Queen Skystar to pardon him has already garnered thousands of signatures.\n\n"I think you should sign the pardon." Posada said solemnly, "I know what it's like to be tortured, the anger and hatred you feel is all-consuming. He was only doing what he thought was right."\n\n"That doesn't change the fact that he killed the guy," Silverstream replied, "I feel bad for him, but we have laws for a reason. He should have alerted the police and gotten Stormcloud arrested so he could face proper justice."\n\n"Sometimes it's not that simple. If Crack had refused to surrender, would it have been right for Skystar to shoot him? I think it would. Political violence is an ugly thing, but when it's directed against fascist monsters it's also a good thing."\n\n"Oh look at me I'm Posada and I think shooting people is fine," said Silverstream, "Look, that was a revolt, he still had control of the army and could've killed us! There's a big big difference between violence in war and violence in peace time. We can't call ourselves a harmonic society if we allow a murder to go unpunished, no matter how much we think it was justified."\n\nSkystar didn't want to hear any more arguing about this.

Today she was scheduled to give a commencement speech at one of Mount Aris's largest universities, which was finally having its first graduation ceremony since the beginning of the North Zebrican War. But first she had to decide what she was going to say.\n\n"How can I stand there with a straight face and tell them tyranny will never come to Aris again?" Skystar asked, "I'm not even sure I know why fascism was able to take root in the first place. We were so confident in our system and our laws, and Lightning brushed them aside like they were nothing!"\n\n"No matter how well they're written, laws can't guard against evil," Silverstream explained, "That's where morality comes in. By reminding our subjects about friendship and Harmony, we can fill in the gaps!"\n\n"Wow Silverstream, I'm impressed" said Posada, "Impressed with how wrong you are. We had friendship and Harmony before Crack took over, and it wasn't enough. When society is in crisis social alienation will ensure that tyrants find plenty of support, and capitalists will always prefer fascism to a collapse that could threaten their profits. The only way to prevent another dictatorship is to abandon capitalism. No more crises of capital, no more tyrants."\n\n"Friendship and Harmony didn't fail us, we failed them," Silverstream sighed, "Our people lost their way, fear made them turn away from friendship. If we remember our principles, then tyrants won't have any ground to stand on."\n\n"I'm sorry, but moral precepts cannot outweigh the incentives created by material conditions."\n\n"Oh, material conditions!" Silverstream jabbed, sticking her tongue out.\n\nSkystar giggled, but Posada ignored them: "When capitalism is in crisis the owners of capital will turn to fascism to defend it."\n\n"Sorry to interrupt," Skystar said, "but we're gonna be late.

It was a universally popular decision that would help bring the nation together, but she knew her advisors would find something to argue about. She just didn't expect them to find it so quickly.\n\n"I'm sorry, but 'Revolution Day' just isn't a good name." Silverstream said, "I think 'Restoration Day' is much more fitting. Crack Lightning usurped power from Aunt Novo, our rightful queen. We're celebrating Skystar's awesome revolt and the restoration of her line to the throne, so it should be called Restoration Day."\n\nPosada shook her head. "I don't see it that way at all. The problem with Crack wasn't that he lacked royal blood, the problem was that he was a fascist dictator. And we're not celebrating just Skystar, we're celebrating all the people of Aris who fought for our freedom. It was a revolution whether you like it or not, and the holiday should be called Revolution Day."\n\n"Ok, but like, we're a monarchy! A holiday celebrating the revolution is the kind of thing that belongs in Cloudbury, not on Mount Aris. If you want to call what happened a revolution then go ahead, but that doesn't mean we should embrace the idea of having a revolution."\n\n"It seems like you're implying that the revolution was only legitimate because it overthrew Crack, which is just not true. A revolution against oppression and exploitation is justified no matter who is in power. If some future monarch of Novo's line were to become a tyrant, the people would have every right to overthrow them."\n\nSilverstream scoffed. "Well, what does our Queen have to say about that?""

Her advisors and even commoners could see the Queen at a moment's notice, provided they had something important to say. The downside of this policy was constant demands on the Queen's time. She was in the middle of a meeting with Posada when Silverstream barged in.\n\n"Hey Skystar, hey Posada! I just finished drafting a decree to restore the Elements of Harmony to our school curriculum. All it needs now is the Queen's signature."\n"Sure thing," Skystar replied, taking the paper and a quill from her desk. Just as she was about to sign, she hesitated.\n\n"Is something wrong?" Silverstream asked.\n"I'm not sure." Skystar sighed, "I just remembered how Aris First used the Elements of Harmony, corrupting them for their own benefit. They tried to redefine Loyalty to mean blind obedience, and... oh, anyways they did some stuff to the others to."\n\n"Well," Posada interjected, "Maybe it's time to move past the Elements of Harmony. It's always been kinda crazy to think that six ideas can form the basis of society by themselves. Maybe we should embrace new ideas, expand the list to include things more applicable to the struggles creatures face everyday."\n\n"You gotta be kidding!" Silverstream exclaimed, "You can't go around pretending 'socialism' is an Element of Harmony! I've studied the elements for years, and I've seen with my own eyes how well they work in Equestria. The fact that Aris First tried to redefine them is all the more reason for us to set the record straight.

Skystar had just finished telling a story about two former Palace Guards when Novo changed the subject.\n\n"So," she said, "I hear you've been relying on Silverstream's council more and more lately."\n"Yes mother. My cousin and I get along quite well. She's exactly the kind of creature I need to help restore peace and stability to our realm."\n\n"I don't doubt it," Novo replied, "though she always seemed a bit... silly, at least to me."\n\n"Well, she's still got a good sense of humor, but you'd be surprised at how much she's changed. I think her time in Equestria really helped her grow more mature, and... the hardships she suffered under Crack Lightning helped with that too."\n\nNovo sniffled. She looked like she was on the verge of tears.\n"Mother? What's wrong?"\n\n"I'm sorry honey, I'm just so full of regret. I was a failure as Queen, every creature knows that.

I know it's a bit odd for the Queen's chief advisor to be a communist, but Posada and I get along quite well. She's exactly the kind of creature I need to help preserve the realm in these troubled times."\n\n"That's funny," Novo replied, "I once said the same thing about Crack Lightning."\n\n"Mother!"

There was simply no way he was alive. Such a pity. With him died the hope of a strong Aris.\n\nShe had driven off Skystar and the traitors, but it was too late. Nogriff could lead like Crack Lightning did, not even Razorbeak. Still, she knew he would approve of her taking power after his assassination. Yes, assassination. That is what had befallen her mentor, her hero, her Ace. Vile assassination. Murdered in his own home. Could Aris sink any lower?\n\nOf course it could. Degeneracy knew no limits. Crack Lightning had tried to save Aris from its decadence, had tried to lead them to glory, and they had repaid him with cowardice, betrayal and murder. But Razorbeak held the power now. If she acted quickly, she could finish off Skystar's traitors, finish off the disloyal Phalanx, secure control over the army. She had all of Crack's files, all his information on every officer, every dissident, every traitor within Aris.\n\nThey called Crack Lightning a tyrant. Cursed him for trying to make them strong. Well, Razorbeak would show them true tyranny.

"Actually, I DO have to worry. Have you noticed that everygriff's completely lost their minds? Crack Lightning's dictatorship was awful, but at least there was some sanity to it.

She understood that wars were not lost when the army was defeated, but when the civilian population lost the will to fight. Just as the military conducted training exercises to maintain a constant state of readiness, the civilian population would need to be primed for any possible war.\n\nEvery corner of Mount Aris was covered in propaganda posters and war murals, some depicting scenes of graphic violence. Every radio broadcast began and ended with a report on Aris's many enemies and their plans for invasion. At every moment of the day, creatures were reminded that the country was under a constant state of siege.\n\nSome propaganda focused on Chiropterra, the militant cult determined to enslave Aris for their false goddess. Other messages were directed against Colthage, the republic of barbaric zebras so jealous of Aris's greatness that they were determined to destroy it. But these enemies were not the main targets of the Commander's efforts, because they at least fought Aris directly like real warriors.\n\nThe true enemies were the harmonists, who tried to undermine Aris from within. Harmony was a disease polluting Aris, a rot that had infected its very core. The harmonists had been scheming against Aris ever since the Equestrian element bearers tried to steal the glory of defeating the Storm King. Equestrian influence was at work all over Aris, and there was no doubt that they had inspired Skystar to mutiny and murder The Ace. Even now the harmonists plotted their return to Aris at the head of foreign armies.\n\nThe harmonists encouraged their citizens to overcome fear, to be brave and support each other.

Every one of them was a perfect specimen, physically fit and completely ruthless. Razorbeak had been told that the dropout rate was three times higher than it had been in previous classes, but that was a good thing. Cowards and weaklings had no place in Aris's armed forces.\n\n"Congratulations cadets," she said as she concluded her inspection, "Your studies are over, and you're finally ready to be commissioned as officers."\nThe cadets looked excited, but not a single one of them made a noise or broke rank.

Each and every one of them deserved to be exterminated with extreme prejudice.\n\nShe was three pages into the list before she found a name that gave her pause: Skybolt Spear. A known communist sympathizer who was a personal friend of Posada before the suppression of all leftist groups. A traitorous association like that required nothing less than immediate execution.\n\nStill, Razorbeak couldn't help but feel that it was such a waste. Being a communist made Skybolt a vile traitor, but at least he wasn't a harmonist. Skybolt also distanced himself from the communists when Aris First came to power, and afterwards he had willingly served The Ace. If he was frightened into loyalty once, he could easily be frightened again. Not to mention that during the war he proved himself to be a talented admiral, winning several victories for Aris.\n\nMaybe there was another way to deal with this traitor. Perhaps psychological torture until he provided a satisfactory confession, then intense public humiliation. Parade him around and make him apologize for his past mistakes, make him promise to serve with unquestioning loyalty from now on. That might be enough of a punishment to allow his reinstatement."

She also tried to imprint her own ideas on the Phalanx, making sure its members revered Aris and The Ace just as she did.\n\nYet in the nation's darkest hour, when the weak hippogriffs and seaponies failed The Ace by losing the war, the Phalanx turned on him. Only a few units, those she'd kept on a tighter leash, fought for Crack Lightning till the end. The rest had turned on him and created the chaos which lead to Skystar's mutiny, making them accomplices in the assassination of The Ace.\n\nNow, after months of investigations and violent interrogations, Razorbeak had finally gotten to the root of the plot. She knew exactly which soldiers were responsible for the mutiny and which soldiers had remained loyal. The latter would be reorganized to form the core of a new vanguard unit, the former were all locked up and awaiting execution.\n\nYet some part of Razorbeak hesitated. These weren't just any traitors, these were her friends. They were officers she'd served with for years, soldiers she'd personally trained. Even if they had betrayed Aris, killing them felt wrong.\n\nRazorbeak agonized over the decision for a few moments before realizing how foolish this line of thinking was. These Phalanx members weren't her friends, Crack Lightning was her friend, and these traitors had taken him away from her! Purging weakness required more than purging society, it required a purging of the self as well. Any impulses that restrained her, anything that prevented her from doing what must be done had to go.\n\nWithout wasting another second she signed the order for a mass execution. Her only regret was that she had failed to instill proper loyalty in these soldiers."

 commander.11.d:0 "Following our takeover, riots and protests have broken out across Seaquestria. Razorbeak has always had disdain for seapony cowardice, but it seems this was the final straw. Going on the radio, she railed against the seaponies for being cowards, weaklings, pathetic Harmonists who had failed their country and failed The Ace.\n\n"You were given so many chances," she concluded, "You were coddled, protected, nurtured by us hippogriffs. But you have repayed our leadership with failure and now with rebellion. It seems you need a firm claw from now on. I am hereby declaring curfew and martial law in Seaquestria. All terrorists, separatists, and defeatists shall be dealt with in the harshest manner. Those who surrender themselves will be spared."\n\nAfter her address, Razorbeak pondered her orders. No doubt, the seaponies would try to resist. No doubt, many in the army would refuse to do what was necessary. This would help her separate the wheat from the chaff: those hippogriffs who "went native" while suppressing the seaponies, those who refused to carry out her orders, those who expressed sympathies with the separatists, they would be discharged or court-martialled. The violence she would unleash upon Seaquestria would bring the seaponies to heel, but it would also purify the Hippogriffs. Just as The Ace would want."
 commander.11.a:0 "The seaponies have underestimated our resolve."

 commander.2.t:0 "Aris Demands Skystar's Extradition!"
 commander.2.d:0 "The new dictator of Aris, "Supreme Commander" Razorbeak, has sent us a message demanding we hoof over the exiled Princess Skystar to be tried for treason and murder for her assassination of Crack Lightning, the previous dictator of Aris. Skystar had been staying with Pinkie Pie following her escape from Aris. She freely admitted to killing Crack Lightning when questioned, adding that he had forced her claw by refusing to surrender during her attempt to restore Aris' legitimate government.\n\nIn the last few years, Aris has devolved from a Harmonic monarchy under Skystar's mother Novo to a pseudo-fascist regime which maintained at least a facade of decency under Crack Lightning, to a brazenly totalitarian military dictatorship. Novo's whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nHoofing Skystar over to the madgriff in charge of her homeland is out of the question, despite the outlandish threats contained in Razorbeak's missive. Given [HIP.GetName]'s recent defeat, her chances of following up on those threats are close to zero. Twilight Sparkle has offered to personally draft a scathing reply, but it might be best to not take an official position on the subject of Crack Lightning's assassination, lest we lend credence to Razorbeak's wild accusations that we somehow orchestrated it."
 commander.2.a:0 "Let Twilight have her fun."
 commander.2.b:0 "A simple "No" will suffice."

 commander.21.t:0 "The Equestrian Response"
 commander.21.d:0 "Equestria's reply is everything we could have hoped for and more. Princess Twilight Sparkle sent the Supreme Commander a personal message denouncing her, Crack Lightning, everything [HIP.GetName] stands for, the Aris First movement, and even the principle of nationalism itself! She went so far as to say that the assassination of Crack Lightning was his own fault for refusing Skystar's mercy, and predict that Razorbeak's regime would last "three years at most" before Harmony came roaring back.\n\nNaturally, we have turned this letter into the basis of a whole new wave of propaganda: "Three years to prepare for Equestrian intervention! Look how these princesses hate Aris, and all Arisians. They all but admitted to aiding Skystar in her foul act of murder!"\n\nAnd so on and so forth. The Equestrians would from now on form the centerpiece, the eternal constant of the ever-shifting rogue's gallery of foreign enemies looming just beyond Aris' shores. Razorbeak would make sure every Arisian read this letter, and knew what it meant: the Equestrians hate us, they have always hated us, and any day now we will have to defend our homes against their wrath."
 commander.21.a:0 "It's almost too good to be true!"

 commander.22.t:0 "The Equestrian Response"
 commander.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems the Equestrians did not "bite." In a perfunctory response, [EQS.GetLeader] declined our request and said in no uncertain terms that they were not interested in pursuing diplomatic or other relations with [HIP.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile we could fabricate a more combative response or otherwise continue to stoke fears of Equestrian-backed Harmonist-Skystarist terrorism, some within Razorbeak's inner circle are suggesting we forget about Skystar and pivot to fearmongering about one of our foes from the North Zebrican War.\n\nThis would remove the ability to neatly tie together internal and external enemies with the same elegance, but it might be easier to propagandize against countries which have killed so many Arisians in recent memory rather than former allies whose crimes are largely symbolic."
 commander.22.a:0 "Equestria and Skystar remain our chief threat."
 commander.22.b:0 "Pivot to Chiropterra."
 commander.22.c:0 "Pivot to Colthage."

 commander.23.t:0 "The Elusive Princess"
 commander.23.d:0 "While she had initially set course for Equestria, it appears that Princess Skystar and her entourage never arrived. We have scoured up and down Aris and Seaquestria looking for her, but it is as if she vanished into thin air. Upon hearing the news, Supreme Commander Razorbeak shut herself in the war room for hours, pouring over maps to try and discern where Skystar could have gone.\n\nDuring that time, Razorbeak came up with a new idea: perhaps it didn't matter? Perhaps Skystar's very elusiveness could be used to our advantage? If she is nowhere to be found, then we can claim that she is still in Seaquestria somewhere, which would make our crackdowns on the riotous seaponies that much easier to justify. Or perhaps we could claim that she was a fifth-columnist all along, and is living like a Princess in the lands of one of our North Zebrican War enemies. The possibilities are limitless!"
 commander.23.a:0 "Skystar sold us out to Chiropterra!"
 commander.23.b:0 "Skystar is in a patrician's mansion in Colthage!"
 commander.23.c:0 "Skystar is plotting a rebellion in Seaquestria!"

 commander.10.t:0 "The Youth Migration"
 commander.10.d:0 "Heartening news is reaching us from Seaquestria. It seems our messaging against the weakness and decadence of the previous generation is catching on with youth, who are reporting high rates of truancy, delinquency, and strife within families. While these youngsters will of course have to be straightened out via mandatory military service, the basic cultural move is that the youth, particularly in Seaquestria, have lost all patience for their parents' fin-wringing pacifism.\n\nIn particular, out of a combination of patriotism and a desire to spite their parents, many young seaponies have made the courageous decision to reject the seapony way of life entirely and abandon the underwater hubs of weakness in favour of breathing the heady air of Mount Aris.\n\nYoung Warriors League leaders have taken it on themselves to teach these intrepid youngsters flying lessons, and more than a few aspire to become pilots like The Ace to truly learn what it means to be a Hippogriff."
 commander.10.a:0 "Such laudable initiative!"
 commander.10.b:0 "If it's worth doing, it's worth forcing."

 commander.12.t:0 "The Long Wait"
 commander.12.d:0 "Razorbeak stared at the pre-schoolers playing in the barracks nursery. The green-feathered one was her favourite; she displayed the instinctual aggression which meant she would respond well to the new state's tutelage, when the time came to start training her more explicitly. Razorbeak smiled as the green one pushed over a red one, and she smiled even more when the red one clawed back at the green one.\n\nLong ago, Razorbeak had had a lover. She had wanted to adopt children, an idea Razorbeak had dismissed. That was before she left, as all others had sooner or later, calling Razorbeak "cold" and "distant" and "scary." Razorbeak didn't know where she was now, but alive or dead, she had gotten her way. After a fashion.\n\nRazorbeak had "adopted" all the children of this generation, and through the New Hippogriff state, she would teach them well. The spontaneous attacks against cowards, the denunciations of friends and family, the zeal in the new officers... that was only the beginning. That was what her teachings could do with teenage minds, given only a little while. With the mind of a small child: raised under the pressure of national shame from the moment they could speak, heated up by the fires of rage and revenge... they would emerge as hard as diamonds, perfect soldiers. All she needed to do was wait.\n\nThe green one and the red one stopped fighting. She heard a mumbled "Sorry..." from the green one. Razorbeak frowned. Well. That kind of thing was why her reforms were necessary in the first place. She would learn soon enough."
 commander.12.a:0 "The end of the beginning."

 #abyss events
 hippogriff_abyss.1.t:0 "The Mareiana Report"
 hippogriff_abyss.1.d:0 "A minor incident has arisen lately in the AHAC, involving the recent patrolling of the Mareiana Trench outside of Seaquestria. While the small detachment sent to the depths initially reported everything as normal, we soon lost contact with them hours later. Initially this was not alarming itself, as the depths have been known to block out communications, but worries began to rise when team did not return upon the scheduled time. It was only a day later, right as a search party was ready to look for them that they appeared from the trench, looking a little worse for wear but otherwise unharmed.\n\nUpon being questioned for their extended absence, they repeatedly insisted that nothing happened during the time in the trench, and that they simply lost track of the time. A minor report on the incident has been filed, and the guards are being sent for further questioning, but other than that the AHAC has seen no need to take further action. Officials are putting this down as just another rookie mistake by fresh recruits, and though a few seaponies are worried at the development, this event will likely forgotten within a few days at most."
 hippogriff_abyss.1.a:0 "Still, perhaps we should hold off on more expeditions for the time being."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.2.t:0 "The Underwater Societies"
 hippogriff_abyss.2.d:0 "More troubling news is coming out of Seaquestria as of late, this time involving issues of a more serious nature. Multiple officials stationed around the underwater nation have reported the formation of what seem to be secret societies all over Seaquestria, each being eerily similar to each other. And yet, despite our best efforts we have been unable to discern their intention, or even what kind of threat they may pose to both seaponies and hippogriffs. What we do know is that they are rapidly growing in number, and while currently constrained beneath the waves some on Mount Aris are afraid that it may spread to the mainland.\n\nEven more worrying is that evidence points to the seaponies sent to the Mareiana Trench as responsible for starting the societies, and we have been unable to find them since only a few short weeks after their return. Fearful whispers speak of a plot growing against Hippogriffia itself, but for now they remained consigned to just that; rumors. All we can do at the moment is wait and see what these societies will do."
 hippogriff_abyss.2.a:0 "Let us hope that the situation does not escalate..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.3.t:0 "Breakdown of Order"
 hippogriff_abyss.3.d:0 "Just as we feared, the situation has escalated in Seaquestria. Only a few days ago, violence broke out all across the underwater realm, plunging large parts of it into chaos. Small feuds that normally would be resolved with simple words, like running into one another and different tastes in music have all incited physical assaults, seapony fighting seapony until broken up by others. The societies were our initial suspects, but it seems that the phenomenon has affected even them as some in their ranks were sighted engaging in blows. The rest continue to meet in secluded places, unhindered by the crisis.\n\nNo matter the cause, the situation is untenable and something must now be done. A possible solution would be to send in more hippogriff soldiers underwater to enforce peace until the seaponies regain their wits. While it would prove immensely unpopular with some and may take a while, we would at least minimize the damage and spread of the violent outbreak.\n\nAnother option proposed by the cabinet is to seek help from Equestria and the Elements of Harmony. Foul magic seems to be at play here, and the ponies have aided us before in our time of need. With their help, whatever is causing this will surely be caught and order restored quickly, as long as the Equestrians actually agree to help.\n\nOf course, we could also always just wait out the chaos and hope that the seaponies regain their sanity on their own."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.a:0 "We can deal with this ourselves."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.b:0 "The Elements saved us once; we must ask for their aid again."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.c:0 "This chaos is simply temporary, we just have to wait it out."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.4.t:0 "Seaquestrian Order Restored"
 hippogriff_abyss.4.d:0 "After many painstaking months of work by our forces, Seaquestria has finally recovered from its brief period of chaos and the seaponies have returned to their normal friendly state. The initial weeks were the hardest, as at first those affected were incredibly difficult to subdue, constantly struggling and fighting if a single other seapony was nearby. Only isolated did they become docile. This tactic, although slow was used throughout all of Seaquestria, ensuring peace bit by bit. Fortunately, whatever seemed to be possessing them weakened the further we progressed.\n\nThe hidden societies did cause some trouble initially as well, attempting to stop our forces from interferring in the violence. They too were subdued, and after order was completely restored they seem to have regained their senses as well. All of them have disbanded, though just as before when questioned they stated that they had no memory of the meetings or of what was discussed.\n\nWhat caused this terrible incident we may never know, but at least it is over. The Mareiana Trench has also been put on an indefinite ban of travel for the time being."
 hippogriff_abyss.4.a:0 "At least we got that finally sorted."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.5.t:0 "A Plea from Hippogriffia"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.d:0 "Trouble seems to be stirring in Zebrica, for a recent message has arrived from our old friends in Hippogriffia. Seeming to be in a rush, the hippogriff hurriedly explained that Seaquestria has fallen into chaos, and that the aid of the Elements of Harmony were needed. Believing that dark magic was behind it, they hope that as friends the Element Bearers will agree to travel back to Mount Aris temporarily and restore order to the aquatic realm.\n\nThere is no doubt that if asked, Princess Twilight and her friends will agree to help the hippogriffs once more. The question is whether we can afford to send them at the moment. The world is only growing more turbulent, and it is quite possible that we need the Elements here and now. However, denying expected help would sour relations with our old friends, and could result in further chaos in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff_abyss.5.a:0 "Of course we will help, assemble the Elements!"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.b:0 "Sorry, but we need them here and now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.6.t:0 "A Quick Wrap-up"
 hippogriff_abyss.6.d:0 ""So the freed cultists have no memory of what started it? No information? Nothing?"\n"I'm afraid so, Queen Novo," replied Twilight Sparkle, "Only fragments of dreams. Once we used the Elements to stop the music, there was nothing left of whatever strange instruments the cultists were playing, and none of them even remembered what they were doing in the last month, or how they got there. I wish we had more to go off of, but we just don't have enough data."\n"It's a terrible shame we couldn't stay here longer," commented Rarity, "I do so love my seapony form, and by the sound of it Skystar and Pinkie have just gotten started on their reunion party."\n"You can feel free to stay a little longer. I'm just glad it's over without too many of us getting hurt. I'm honestly not sure what we would have done without you."\n"Oh it's nothing, really! You're our friends, and besides it was your idea to use a deafening spell before sending us in. Without that, we'd have been helpless against it."\n\nNovo sighed. "I do hate not knowing what almost destroyed my kingdom. But oh well, all's well that ends well. I'll have my magical researchers look over all the data we can find, and share it with you if anything comes up. In the meantime, let's join Pinkie and Skystar out there. It looks like half of Seaquestria's getting in on their party, so let's not miss it.""
 hippogriff_abyss.6.a:0 "We may not know what caused it, but at least it's behind us now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.7.t:0 "The Equestrian Betrayal"
 hippogriff_abyss.7.d:0 "Terrible news! The Equestrians have, against our every hope and wish, decided not to send the Elements to aid us in our troubles in Seaquestria! We have not been made aware of the reasoning, but it seems highly unlikely that Princess Twilight herself decided not to aid us. More likely the Equestrian government simply ignored our calls for help for their own gain. This is a severe betrayal that we will not be forgetting anytime soon, but for now we have much more pressing matters to deal with.\n\nWith the Elements no longer an option, we are forced back to our original two ideas; either enforcing law and order in Seaquestria or doing nothing. The time spent wasted waiting on the Equestrian response has only worsened the situation, and no matter what we choose there will be repercussions across the nation. Word has already spread about the Equestrian debacle, and there are some calling us fools for ever relying on a foreign power."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.a:0 "Fine, we don't need their help to solve our problems."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.b:0 "Without the Elements we can do nothing..."

 hippogriff_abyss.8.d:0 "The spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was an absolute success, with members now spread all throughout the region. Conflict with non-members was at a minimum, and any confrontation with officials out of fear of our motives was quickly defused without escalation. The entire state is now securely under our influence, and our numbers have been bolstered by the new converts from the population."
 hippogriff_abyss.8.a:0 "The push towards control of Hippogriffia continues."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.9.t:0 "Minor Confrontation in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.9.d:0 "Despite some minor conflicts and violence, the spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was a success. While non-members did start minor fights with our own agents, they were relatively localized and contained. Some may still be afraid of our intentions and future actions, but for now the state is secure and our numbers grown."

 hippogriff_abyss.10.t:0 "Violent Outbreak in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.10.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent efforts to spread the cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] have been met with multiple outbreaks of fighting and violence. While our members were able to hold off the angry and terrified hippogriffs who had not yet joined us, the situation deteriorated to the point where the police had to intervene. The entire state is now on high alert, and though we have still expanded our numbers and have undercover control of the region, word has spread as the country drifts further towards instability and perhaps even open war against us."
 hippogriff_abyss.10.a:0 "Quite unfortunate, but our goal must stop for none."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.11.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.11.d:0 "The capital had been taken hours ago. Fighting had been fierce and bloody, for while the cultists vastly outnumbered those still remaining, they did not have the weaponry or the skill that the royal guard of the palace did. But still, eventually numbers won out as our masses pushed forward endlessly, taking Mount Aris hall by hall, room by room. Each of our loyalists fought to their last breath, for our cause was great, greater than any other on Hippogriffia.\n\nThe throne room itself was the last holdout of resistance, but even that was overrun when the masses made a concentrated push at once. Queen Novo was captured relatively unharmed and is currently behind held captive, but unfortunately Princess Skystar is nowhere to be found. We believe she escaped long before our assault began, though where we are unsure of yet.\n\nBut that does not matter now. Nothing does, except what is to come. We have waited, waited for far too long for this moment. The doors open, and our masters float towards the throne we killed and died for, their tails and fins swishing in the open air. We all bow our heads to the floor. The teal one looks excited and giddy, while the pink one simply looks annoyed at the former. The yellow one just smirks, and by compulsion we rise once more, staring blankly as their three red gems inlaid in their chests glow.\n\nOur task is complete. Now, it is time for the whole world to hear their song as well."
 hippogriff_abyss.11.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.12.t:0 "The Hippogriff Civil War"
 hippogriff_abyss.12.d:0 "With tensions continuously rising between cultist and loyalist, it was only a matter of time until it blew into the open. Unfortunately, that moment of time is now, as the government has declared us a danger to the Kingdom and started mass arrests. Now, we have no choice but to fight back, and with force. As the army is sent in, we have armed ourselves to prepare for the civil war.\n\nThe areas that we have already secured have already formed into makeshift divisions, but sources say that those loyal to Queen Novo have done the same. We can only hope now that our efforts beforehoof were enough to prevail now."
 hippogriff_abyss.12.a:0 "So it has come to this."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.13.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.13.d:0 "What a waste. So many lives needlessly lost in a pointless war. So many voices made silent. This little conflict was nothing more than an annoyance, and yet it was necessary all the same. These mortals sought to undo our plan, one over a thousand years in the making, and had to be eliminated.\n\nOur servants did well, despite their foolish blunder in igniting open war. They were a useful tool, though still only a means to an end. Once the remaining hippogriffs surrendered, there was no more need of such zealotry, and so we dispelled our magic leaving them docile, yet no longer single-minded. They will fall in line with the rest of the mortals, serving a new purpose. Our purpose.\n\nWe have waited far too long for this. What has happened now is only a glimpse of what is to come, of what is our right. This world has become far too complacent, dividing themselves on trivial things such as ideologies or politics. We will offer them a new solution, a new chance to be part of something greater, serving us. Soon they'll find they don't have a choice.\n\nOur time is now, and their time is running out. Listen closely to our music...\n\n...For the show is about to start."

 hippogriff_abyss.14.t:0 "The New World"
 hippogriff_abyss.14.d:0 "Change. It was quite obvious to Aria that the world was full of it. Even keeping in mind the fact that she was on an entire new continent now, barely anything was recognizable. What was once mere villages were now massive cities, what once took weeks to create now took hours, and magic... Adagio would never admit it, but Aria could see the writing on the wall. Their magic was no longer undefeatable, and it wasn't just that old fool Starswirl that proved that over a millennia ago. The weapons that creatures now possessed were dangerous, and they needed to be treated carefully.\n\n"There you are, Aria." The purple siren secretly rolled her eyes as the "leader" of the trio swam over. "Where have you been? Don't tell me you've been in Seaquestria with Sonata."\n\n"Of course not, Adagio. I'm getting this place ready for war."\n\nAdagio looked like she had seen Aria sprout a second head. "Excuse me? What are you talking about?"\n\nTurning, the purple siren kept her level, downright-bored disposition as she spoke. "We need an army, Adagio. We can't just go around and sing to the entire world. We're just going to get banished again, or worse. This world has new rules, new weapons, and we need them if we're going to go after our 'birthright' or whatever."\n\nAdagio sputtered for a bit before recovering. "Fine, just be ready to play your part when the time comes. I need to go find Sonata again and make sure she isn't blowing something up.""
 hippogriff_abyss.14.a:0 "It's time for us to adapt to the present."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.15.t:0 "Destiny"
 hippogriff_abyss.15.d:0 "It was a disgrace. Truly, there was no better word to describe it. Over a thousand years, and the world had already all but forgotten about them. About her. They thought themselves more advanced just from their new toys, but Adagio could see through it all. Magic still ruled, magic always ruled, and she was the one who was supposed to rule with it. The song she sang was meant to be listened by all, for her to be adored, for crowds to cheer for her as they listened to her every command. She was meant to rule.\n\nBut that was not what had happened. Her destiny, her birthright had been taken by fools, ponies who thought themselves above the natural order. Her banishment was a travesty, locked away to be passed into legend as creatures far weaker thought they could control destiny. Destiny does not change though, it is only delayed. They could not take away her voice, the gift all three of them possessed.\n\nOf course, Aria was right about one thing. None of them were ready to simply take their place at the center stage of the world. There was still more subjects to enthrall to, more power to gain, more songs to sing. Soon, however, she would make her triumphant return to Equestria. Her plans would come to fruition, and all would see her and rejoice. All it would take was a little patience.\n\nAnd Adagio was very patient."
 hippogriff_abyss.15.a:0 "Our time will come... soon."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.16.t:0 "Another Partner?"
 hippogriff_abyss.16.d:0 ""We need another member in our group."\n\nBoth Aria and Sonata looked up in surprise. "A fourth? We both know that there aren't any others left, Adagio. What do you mean, 'another member'?" Aria asked, a bit of curiosity seeping into her normally flat tone.\n\nAdagio just rolled her eyes. "I wasn't talking about another siren. Doing everything ourselves is just wasting our time, and our voices. We need someone to do the dirty work for us, manage affairs while we look at the bigger picture."\n\nSonata perked up a bit before her expression quickly deflated. "But like, everyone here hates us! Who would even want to help without being under our spell?"\n\n"Sonata has a point," Aria agreed. "For once."\n\n"Yeah- hey!"\n\nAs the two devolved into yet another argument, Adagio looked out the window from the palace. The city of Mount Aris spread before her, the clueless hippogriffs walking and arguing in the streets. And further away, the factories continued to work, along with the housing where the wealthy elite still lived...\n\nAdagio smirked. Perhaps the world wasn't so different as it once was after all."

 hippogriff_abyss.17.d:0 "Plumage Moonfeather had faced many things in his life. Rival businessgriffs, workers, profit margins, and even the former Hippogriffian government. He knew how to play the game and how to play it well, and that was how he had thrived and become one of the richest birds on Aris.\n\nAnd yet, nothing could have possibly prepared him for the situation he now found himself in.\n\n"You want me to do what now?" he asked, the slightly tinge of fear creeping in as the three sirens stared him down. He fought the urge to take a step back; showing weakness was never a good thing.\n\n"It's quite simple," the siren in yellow said. "We want a hippogriff who can run parts of this island in our stead while we focus on other things. And we believe that you can be that hippogriff."\n\nThe gears in Moonfeather's mind began turning. And then he realized it. This wasn't a meeting for threats or violence, or even being forced into compliance. This was something much better.\n\nIt was a business opportunity.\n\n"And I get to have full control over Aris just for working for you?" he asked, putting on the suave business look he was known for.\n\n"You'll be able to do whatever you want, so long as it also benefits us and keeps this place stable. Grease the gears, so to speak. But let me make something clear." Within seconds the siren was muzzle-to-beak against Moonfeather, staring daggers. "You listen to us. You follow our orders whenever we say them. And if you fail, we will not hesitate to throw you out and let the crowds deal with you instead. Is that clear?"\n\nMoonfeather quickly nodded. "Clear as crystal.""

 hippogriff_abyss.18.d:0 "Adagio was still visibly seething in anger when Aria and Sonata rushed into the throne room, having been urgently called there. "What is it, Adagio?" Sonata asked, beating her fellow siren to the punch.\n\n"They're still alive," Adagio replied bitterly.\n\nSonata blinked. "Who?"\n\n"Starswirl and those 'Pillars of Equestria'."\n\nAria's expression immediately shifted from standard boredom into rage similar to that of Adagio, while Sonata just gave a shriek and tried hiding under a nearby table. "They aren't here, are they?" she asked. "I don't want to be banished again, not so soon after we got out!"\n\nSonata's antics were enough to shake Aria out of her anger, making the purple siren roll her eyes. "Of course they aren't here, Sonata. We'd have noticed them by now if they were." She turned her attention back to Adagio. "But we can't just let them get away with what they did either."\n\nAdagio, in a rare moment of agreement, nodded. "No, we can't. I don't know how they're still alive after all this time, but they have to pay for our banishment. I've tracked one of the Pillars to Maregypt; the others seem to be in Equestria, though I have not found Starswirl yet. But I don't care what it takes. We will have our revenge, and nothing is going to stop us."\n\n"We'll do it together," Aria said.\n\n"Together!" Sonata reaffirmed, sliding out from under the table with a semi-serious expression, a very rare sight for the normally bubbly siren. The trio looked at each other once before nodding."

 hippogriff_abyss.19.t:0 "The Panopticon"
 hippogriff_abyss.19.d:0 "It was brilliant, but certainly not in its simplicity. Aria was still not completely used to this new age of planning, of diagrams and schematics. In old Equestria it was just vaguely drawing what you wanted, what it did and a general image. But the intent and the ways of showing it were the same, and Aria understood enough to see what it could mean.\n\nIt was both a building and a system, originally intended before their takeover for prisons in Hippogriffia. A single tower was built in the middle, with vision over all the cells of prisoners and yet unable to be seen within by said prisoners. The guards inside obviously could not watch them all at once, but it was the fear of being watched at any time that motivated others to act as if they were. To create a blanket of fear, and an illusion of total control.\n\nBut who said that it could only be used for prisons? Other creatures were inherently untrustworthy, they had already banished and resisted against them once. They needed to be monitored, and what better way to keep them in line than to have all of them believe they always are? Fear is a powerful motivator; Aria herself and the other sirens had used it many times to stir up violence and chaos.\n\nUnfortunately, putting such structures across the nation would not be cheap. Adagio or Sonata would certainly notice, and she already knew that neither would be too happy about it, even if it would be for vastly different reasons. Aria even found herself questioning the effectiveness or necessity of this. Wouldn't it be easier to just let the idea fall, and get the upper edge in future arguments with her partners? Or she could always force the idea through anyways, and that might provide its own benefits for the future..."

 hippogriff_abyss.20.t:0 "The Dawning"
 hippogriff_abyss.20.d:0 "When it came to speeches and ceremonies, none of the three sirens had much experience in leading such events. Singing and concerts, yes, they were unmatched in all the world, but they were no politicians or military leaders. Such trivial things were for those who did not have the magic of a siren's music.\n\nIn this particular case, though, Adagio had insisted on some sort of grand event for the culmination of all the hard work the three had put in over the past month. So, deep in the royal palace, in a circular room decorated specifically for the occasion, the three floated among those chosen to receive the gift.\n\nThere was less than both Aria and Adagio would have preferred. The hippogriffs who stood in line before them, blankly enthralled only numbered in the lower tens, easily countable by a child. But they were the best that this island had to offer. Former leaders, organizers, people with power; they would serve their new role well, and if the need arose then more could always be made.\n\nOne last hippogriff entered the room at Adagio's silent command. In a claw, he held simple necklaces, one for each of the creatures in line. Hanging at the bottom was a blood-red gem, identical in color to the ones inlaid within the sirens themselves. These, however were nowhere near the size, only appearing as mere slivers of crystal.\n\nIt had taken the three considerable effort to create such artifacts. The magical crystals mined beneath Mount Aris had the potential, but the methods used to turn them into siren gems were... tiring. Still, they were not deterred, even Sonata, who had actually shown some surprising talent in the process despite failing with explosive results the first seven times.\n\n"You have all been chosen, gifted with a fragment of our power to bind lesser creatures under our spell. Do not waste it, for the amulet you now wear is your life now. Go, sing, as is your new purpose. Let yourself be a reflection of the new glory and world that we shall bring."\n\nThey all bowed, before walking out to fulfil their duty."

 hippogriff_abyss.21.d:0 ""Sonata, what is this?" Adagio all but stormed into the palace room, Aria not far behind and looking like she would rather be anywhere but there. "Plumage has told me that you've been going out to listen to others play and sing music! Did you forget who and what you are?!"\n\nSonata rolled her eyes. "I still know I'm the best, duh. But it's nice listening to other people make music too! I mean, they'll never be as great as us, but some of it is still good!"\n\nAria facehoofed while Adagio looked like Sonata had grown a second tail. "Are you serious? Those creatures aren't even worth our time, Sonata! They should be listening to us, not the other way around!"\n\nSonata folded her hooves. "Well I think that it's nice, and that you should listen to it more! Maybe if we actually let them make music more they would make something better! But all you let them do is stay in their homes and groups fighting!"\n\n"No. The only music we are having is ours, and you are not going on your little trips anymore!"\n\n"Oh yeah? And how are you gonna stop me?"\n\nAria only took a deep breath and sighed before leaving the room to let the two argue. She wasn't dealing with this today."

He fell out of his chair backwards, crawling away from her in a panic. "Who... what are you!?"\n\nSonata looked around confused for a second before realizing who he was talking about. "Oh, you mean me! I'm Sonata, a siren who was banished, like, a really long time ago." She looked down at the floor, lightly swinging her tail around a bit. "No-fun Pillars..."\n\n"A siren?" King Zamni asked. He slowly got back up onto his hooves, never taking his eyes off the blue creature. "What... are you going to do to me?"\n\nShe thought for a moment. "Oh, right! I was told to get you to help us manage this place or something. The guards said the King of Zumidia was here." Sonata approached the zebra, examining him more closely. "You are the King, right?"\n\n"Yeah... why do you ask?"\n\nSonata pointed a hoof at her own head. "Well, there's usually a crown, right? And I kinda expected you to look more... royal? Oh, I know!" She floated around him, swimming through the air in a circle. "Maybe we could get you a crown! I mean, it'll make it easier for me to recognize you, right?"\n\nThe zebra waited for Sonata to stop before taking a hesitant step forward. "Yeah, that'd be nice," he said, still a bit cautious. "My name is Zamni, by the way."\n\nThe young King extended his hoof, and Sonata met it for a hoofshake.\n"It's nice to meet you, Sonata.""

 hippogriff_abyss.23.d:0 "Sonata, despite her status as a siren, was not a perfect being. Far from it, her partners usually kept her far from anything important for the sole reason of worrying that she would ruin it. And yet, despite her flaws, she did have a good idea once in a blue moon or two.\n\nThis was finally one of those moments.\n\n"I'm... actually impressed, Sonata. The more creatures still alive, the more that can feed our magic and adore us. I suppose that doing our best to keep them that way shouldn't take too much effort."\n\nAria did not share Adagio's sentiment, responding with her usual flat tone. "But this seems to go a little too far, Adagio. Look at everything Sonata wants to do. All these resources, this focus on medicine... we'd be losing more magic if we actually did all this."\n\n"You're just no fun!" Sonata shot back, folding her hooves.\n\n"I'm not saying it's a bad idea," Aria replied in a surprisingly defensive manner. "We just need to cut the big parts of this and leave the essentials."\n\n"But the big parts are the best parts! It's no fun when people die, because then they get all boring and lay there and do nothing. We want people to do stuff, right?"\n\n"Sonata's right," Adagio agreed, finding herself surprised at saying such a thing. "They're better to us alive than dead. Still, a lot of this does seem over the top..." Both Aria and Sonata looked at the third siren, waiting for a decision."

 hippogriff_abyss.24.d:0 ""We tried warning you, Aria. It's not our fault that you didn't listen."\n\nAfter an excessive amount of work and effort put in, the projects were finally finished. The panopticons had been built and manned, structures of solid concrete that loomed menacing above those they watched. The quality put into their construction had been impressive.\n\nBut there was nothing to show for it. Nothing had changed, not even in the slightest. There was no need for fear to keep them in line when they were already held through magic. Everything was continuing as it had before.\n\n"It's not about what it does now," Aria said, though she wasn't sure if she was addressing Adagio or herself. "If our magic ever fails, we'll need them to keep contro-"\n\n"Oh, it's 'if' this and 'maybe' that. We are living in the now, Aria. Stop looking at useless and impossible futures when you need to be looking at what we need in the present. Maybe next time you'll think ideas like this through." Adagio swam away through the air, leaving the other siren alone.\n\nThis couldn't have possibly be in vain. There must be some use that these things would have... eventually. Aria just wasn't sure what it would be anymore."

 hippogriff_abyss.25.d:0 ""Who's there? Oh, hey Sonata." King Zamni put down the beaker he was holding and got up off of his chair to greet the siren, who was floating around near the doorway. "How are you doing?"\n\n"Well Adagio and Aria are being no fun again so I left to come see you!" She looked over the zebra at the table he had set up, piled with various ingredients and what looked like a chemistry set. "What are you up to?"\n\nZamni looked back at his workstation. "Oh, that. Well, I had to find something to do when you aren't here to talk and I don't have to do anything else, since I can't leave the palace. Alchemy has always been a zebra's natural talent, so I thought I might give it a shot. It's not the most traditional setup, but I guess I'm not the most traditional king either, huh?"\n\nSonata frowned. "Zamni, you know we can't let you leave because-"\n\n"Because it's too dangerous outside and I could get hurt or killed, I know." He sighed, looking out towards the window. "Still, it's hard being stuck here for years..." The zebra trailed off until a thought seemed to strike him. "Oh, right! I'm glad your here, since I wanted to show you something." Zamni trotted over and started rummaging through one of his cabinets, pulling out multiple labeled bottles with colored liquids inside them. "So you said you get magic through those gems you have, right?"\n\nThe siren looked down at her own blood-red gem inlaid in her chest. "Yeah... what about them?"\n\n"Well, I was looking at some old zebra texts and recipes, and I think I could make something that would help those gems store more magical energy in them! It's still untested, though, and I don't think it's smart to just try it on yours first... do you have any of them I could borrow?"\n\n"Well, I could always make one, but it's like, really hard. And I don't know if Adagio and Aria would like me doing that..."\n\n"Come on, Sonata." Zamni stared up at her, a hint of determination in his eyes. "I've never let you down before, right? Just give me some time, and I know I can do this.""

 hippogriff_abyss.26.d:0 ""I'm here!" King Zamni snapped up from his desk as Sonata came into the room, looking around with bleary eyes. "Were you... sleeping? Isn't it, like, the middle of the day? Have you been getting enough sleep?"\n\n"No," he answered flatly, "I haven't. But I did do it."\n\n"Do what?"\n\nZamni motioned for Sonata to follow him as he walked to another desk, sweeping aside the shards of shattered red gems. Eventually he found what he was looking for, a familiar intact gem glowing brightly. "It took me a while, but I finally got it."\n\nSonata looked at it closely, moving her head to view it at all angles. "Really?" she asked curiously. "It looks the same to me."\n\nThe zebra resisted the urge to slam his head into the desk. "Yes, but I've triple-checked everything. It can hold a lot more magic, and it's not going to explode if you drop it. The ingredients for the alchemy is pretty simple too, you could mass produce it if you needed to."\n\n"Ooooh, for realsies?" She grabbed the amulet with a hoof. "Adagio is gonna love this!" She sped off, barely remembering to give a wave to Zamni before disappearing out of the room.\n\nThe king nodded before turning back to his desk, resting his head on his hooves, and immediately falling asleep."

"I guess you aren't always the worst after all."\n\n"Oh yeah?" Sonata quickly shot back. "Well I think you're worser than the worst, Aria."\n\nThe two glared at each other for a moment before the third intervened once again. "I have to ask though, Sonata, how did you get him to do it? Enthrallment doesn't really keep our subjects innovative, after all..."\n\nShe thought for a moment. "Huh," Sonata said, "I guess I never actually sang to him. He just kinda started helping me on his own!"\n\nBoth Adagio and Aria's jaws dropped, too stunned to respond. The former recovered first, giving Sonata a new appraising look. "Well well, I guess I underestimated you, Sonata! Manipulating others to help us without even using magic. Maybe you are more like a siren than I thought."\n\nShe continued speaking, but Sonata zoned out thinking about those words. She manipulated Zamni? But all she did was act like herself! And he had helped her for some reason... but why? Didn't they need to sing to people for them to not hate them?\n\nSomething was weird, and Sonata couldn't put her hoof on it."

It wasn't that she couldn't see them coming ahead of time, but that there was always some big issue that needed immediate addressing or some great crisis looming that they needed to shut down immediately.\n\nIn this case, however, Aria was fully determined to fix this before it even started.\n\n"What are you talking about, Aria? 'Mending ties between races'? The fighting between hippogriffs and seaponies has been one of our best sources of magic! In fact, I was thinking of making all the new pathetic mortals we have fight each other the same way as well..."\n\n"No, Adagio. It worked well when we had only those two races, but now if the races are too busy fighting each other, they'll never get anything done for us. We do need them to do things other than fight now, remember?"\n\nSonata moved forwards as well, surprising Aria by not looking indignantly at her, but at Adagio. "Yeah, it's so boring when all they do is fight each other based on who's what! Everyone already fights each other enough already! And it makes them listening to me so much harder..."\n\n"But think of the magic," Adagio said through gritted teeth.\n\n"We are thinking of the magic," Aria shot, "but this isn't worth it, at least right now.

Every crystal has its minor imperfections, and those seem to disrupt the structure once turned into siren gems and make the entire structure less efficient."\n\n"Go on."\n\nThe third zebra, this one wearing glasses stepped forward. "However, recent technology allows us to modify the lattice and rearrange the structure in crystals. With time, and additional funding, we believe-"\n\n"You believe that you can fix the imperfections in the crystals and make the structure more efficient at storing magic," Aria finished. The zebras nodded, unfazed by the interruption. "It's already hard enough keeping you all from Adagio with how much I've been giving you. Anything more, and I'd have to explain to her why I'm wasting my time on all of you."\n\n"We understand that we are asking for a lot.

 hippogriff_abyss.30.t:0 "Experiment Report: Crystal Lattice Purification"
 hippogriff_abyss.30.d:0 "Abstract:\nPrevious research into the fields of both magical crystals and modified Siren Magical Crystals (SMCs) has revealed that the two share key similarities and differences in lattice structure, being readily apparent after the magical process of turning a crystal into an SMC. However, impurities and defects in crystal structure have been shown to decrease the effectiveness and efficiency of magical storage in both crystal types. This experiment was designed to find ways to both locate and remove those impurities.\nProcedure:\nPre-created SMCs were viewed under an electron microscope to locate deformities, with multiple methods on standby to attempt to correct them. A full list is included in the Appendix.\nAnalysis:A majority of attempts to modify an SMC proved to be ineffective, either having no affect on crystal structure or shattering the lattice entirely. Success was best found in using both small amounts of magical current from another SMC to initiate crystal growth while an applied electrical field created mechanical strain using piezoelectricity. Such methods resulted in the crystal filling in defects and self-stabilizing the lattice.\n\nConclusions:\nThe experiment was a success in partially purifying SMCs and rearranging crystalline structure. Tests run after modification showed a substantial increase in magic storage levels before shattering. While we lack the current methods to remove all impurities from crystal structure, such as dislocations, current progress has been satisfactory for the scientific team. This has also done much to further the study of magical crystal and SMC structure, with a leading theory being that overstorage of magic causes crystals to fracture at various defect fault lines, and that a theoretical 'flawless' crystal would be able to hold near-infinite amounts of magical energy. The high amount of magic that the sirens themselves can contain is attributed to a low number of defects in embedded crystal structure, though this has yet to be verified."

 hippogriff_abyss.31.d:0 "The zebras marched in lockstep down the central road of Colthage, the peasants and homeowners looking fearfully on the sides of the procession. Each soldier wore a decorated outfit that vastly resembled the old Rural Guard, which was intentional. For all intents and purposes, they were the Rural Guard, just recreated for the modern era.\n\nThe procession itself, of course, was all for show. There was no practical purpose other than to instill discipline within the soldiers, the new servants of the sirens. But it did represent something, and that was the restoration of order in Colthage. They enforced the rules of whatever was told of them, and no longer was Colthage a region out of control for the sirens.\n\n"So... why are we here again?" Sonata asked Aria as the two watched the march continue from a nearby balcony. "If you wanted to show off, why didn't you invite Adagio?"\n\n"Because I'm not showing off, and this isn't for Adagio." She pointed a hoof at the soldiers. "I've done what I wanted here. Now it's your turn. These zebras will make sure that you don't accidentally blow something up while you're here."\n\n"Oh. Right."\n\n"I have other things to deal with, and even though I can't believe I'm saying this, I trust you more than Adagio to not ruin everything."

"Just go ahead and tell me you plan so I can do whatever, Aria."\n\n"Colthage was a heavily factionalized place, but the two groups we care about are the Scientifids and the Landowners. Both of them are smart enough to be willing to work with us and have their uses. Focus on them, and make sure that we control everything in Colthage through them. Order should be above everything else."\n\nSonata nodded at the long and complicated explanation like she understood every word of it, while Adagio just made a faint noise of disappointment. "We aren't here to bring order, we're here to cause chaos and anger. We shouldn't limit ourselves to just these few groups of zebras and rules. If working with the 'Landowners' helps us, then we should do that. And if working with warlords and letting things burn helps us more..." Adagio ignored the seething glance from Aria. "...than we shouldn't leave that option out either."\n\n"More options does seem like a good idea..."\n\n"Unless you make the wrong one," Aria finished for Sonata.

The Landowners have a history of being mostly compliant if left to their own devices and remaining unambitious. Perfect pawns. On the other hoof, the Scientifids could efficiently reorient Colthage towards becoming a productive part of our territories, given permission and the authority to.

 hippogriff_abyss.35.d1:0 "There are two ways to look at Colthage from an outside view. The sum of its parts, a complete state of Zonicia barring Zumidia, or as individual regions, each connected by common ties. The idea of nationality in each region has changed over time, with some calling themselves Colthaginian and others calling themselves Coltvans or Coltdarians first. With the influence we exert over the minds of the zebras, it would be relatively easy to sway them towards one way of thinking or the other, and that is exactly what we are going to do.\n\nTo save resources and effort, from now on the idea of states independent or even autonomous of Colthage itself will not exist. Hippone, Coltva, Trotkat; they will be regarded as little more than geographical and administrative regions of Colthage itself. One state will exist, even if it is in name only. Regionalist sentiments have no place here, even if they would be good sources of magic. Besides, at least the Landowners will be grateful for keeping things together."

Everything can be ruled from one place, and the local landowners would be grateful to us for keeping the land together. However, that requires making peace between zebras, which temporarily would put a dent in our magic. The other, more radical option would be to split the zebras, encouraging the nationalism in regions and splitting them up. Getting them to fight each others has its obvious benefits, and would become a breeding ground for warlordism and future chaos. A situation that, if encouraged, could lead to some potential benefits..."

Ideally, it wouldn't be necessary at all, but a few unenthralled subjects to keep a watch over things would be beneficial, and Plumage knows what the price of any betrayal, no matter how small would be. He may not be perfectly ideal, but he gets the job done, and that will be good enough in this case.\n\nAs usual, the two groups we want are the Scientifids and Landowners. Both have enough zebras willing to put morals aside to willingly work with a regime and system such as ours for personal gain, and both have enough political power to work as useful elites. Hopefully, they will remember that they are loyal to us first, and Plumage second. After all, everything that happens eventually makes its way back to us, good or ill..."

Those groups that Aria is fascinated with, the Scientifids and Landowners do have those in their ranks willing to work with us, even if they aren't as useful as she talked them up to be. They are the practical, if boring and normal option, that Plumage has indicated he would prefer. The other more dangerous approach is looking elsewhere, particularly in the unsavory parts of Colthaginian society. Two military commanders, Jebzel Zoblos and Bezelshazzar Zerutra, have been deemed as pliable enough to be bribed into submission. Their... unique histories would not help Colthage in any way, shape or form, but that may not be a bad thing if our goals for Colthage are something other than stability. Plumage's very obvious distaste for them will be ignored."

The reign of terror that the Star Father inflicted upon Colthage has left the zebras useful and willing to work with us a very slim group. At this point, it's not worth it to actually put any effort into such things. Just telling Plumage to take in anyone deemed of use and willing will be good enough."

 hippogriff_abyss.37.d1:0 "Back in the time before we were banished, ruling nations or land was a relatively decentralized affair. With a few exceptions, like the ability our voices give us, the technology of the time made it simply impossible to rule effectively across large areas. Over time, that changed, and now many states rely on such methods of strict control from their centers of governance. Colthage had similar debates along that line, with some wanting to remain decentralized and others wanting power vested in the capital city of Colthage. Now it is our turn to answer that question.\n\nConsidering that those we put as the ruling class get their power from Colthage, strengthening that hold in the city is the only logical move. If all we have to do is control one city, and that city can control the rest of the region for us, then that makes our job that much easier. We can't just have zebras running around doing whatever they wish, even if they still are under our influence and song. Only with a strict hoof and a strong leash can Colthage achieve anything for us, no matter what it takes to achieve that."

By the time we're finished with the entire process, it may not even been worth the effort. Now doing the opposite, decentralizing to the regions and zebras themselves, would still be difficult, but not as hard in the long term as the former. Not only that, it would also allow for the more opportunistic of Colthaginian society to cause chaos, which if we've supported could reap major benefits for our magic.

 hippogriff_abyss.38.d:0 ""Alright Aria, what's so important that you had to call Sonata and I here to discuss?"\n\nAria motioned to a nearby enthralled unicorn with a hoof, causing him to walk over and let a manila folder fall on the table from his magic before leaving. "In here is every single project the Legionary Medical Research Department in Chiropterra either worked on or had planned. I've already read it, but you two should too so we can decide what-"\n\n"We already have," both other sirens said simultaneously, before looking at each other. Sonata motioned for Adagio to speak first. "I know full well about the LMRD. After all, some of their ideas were quite interesting."\n\n"I just read it because I was bored!" Sonata added.\n\nAria shrugged. "Fair enough." She opened the folder with a hoof, spreading out the sheets of paper across the table. "I think we can all agree then that the chemical warfare experiments are the best option to pursue, we just need to figure out what exactly-"\n\n"Chemical warfare did not help the Chiropterrans defeat us," Adagio interrupted flippantly. "This blind, fanatic loyalty on the other hoof seems just perfect. Our servants already serve us with complete obedience; imagine what they could do if they were willing to kill themselves in our name. Nothing would stop them, or us!"\n\nSonata blinked, looking at the two of them strangely. "Uh, if these guys are the medical research department, doesn't that mean they make like hospitals and stuff? Why don't we have them work on that instead?" Adagio and Aria gave her a weird look, as if she was insane.\n\n"What? Am I wrong?""

 hippogriff_abyss.39.d:0 ""Spit it out, I don't have all day," Adagio said as the three sirens gathered around, all clearly annoyed at being summoned. It was a rare thing for Plumage to do, and he took the opportunity to speak as soon as he got it. The faster this was over, the better.\n\n"My associates and I have discovered a wonderful opportunity in Zarantia, after months of searching at your request. It appears that there are truly massive reserves of oil hidden beneath the desert, undiscovered until now. As I am of course a mere servant of you three, I thought it best to leave the matter of how to approach this situation to you." The fact that he alone had no chance of subduing the desert tribes enough to extract the oil himself went unspoken.\n\nAs usual, Aria was the first to get her piece in. "Isn't it obvious? We move in and take the oil wells by force. We'll need that oil if we're going to do anything big in the future."\n\nThe other two began to nod in agreement, and Plumage saw his chance at personal profits slipping away. He needed something fast. "Of course," he said hurriedly, "but I can assure you that the oil is enough to fuel any military you could want and then some. And you know how difficult those Zarantians tribes could be... we could, if you wish, use some of the oil as incentive to bribe a few zebras and get them to fight each other instead. And you wouldn't need to worry about handling such trivial affairs; believe me, I am very experienced in these deals."\n\nAria's eyes narrowed while the other two sirens seemed to think it over. "I mean, it would help me in Zarantia too..." Sonata said, trailing off.\n\n"And it would give us magic to work with too," Adagio added.\n\nAt this point Aria was looking beside herself with annoyance. "Really? It's obvious that he just wants to take oil for himself. Just because we let him run things for us doesn't mean we can let him start doing everything we should be doing ourselves."\n\n"My loyalties remain only to you three alone," Plumage reminded, internally sweating bullets. It seemed uncertain which way things would go, and the sirens had the final word..."

 hippogriff_abyss.40.d:0 "The dungeons of Mount Aris had seen little use in some time, at least ever since the sirens had taken over. When everyone was enthralled and some level of obedient, there was almost no need for such places. Only the most dangerous were left there, those deemed by the sirens personally to be too dangerous to be left about. It was why they were still heavily guarded, by only the most disciplined and fanatical of enthralled subjects.\n\nToday, the cells finally added one more to their number.\n\n"Well well well," Adagio said as the three sirens looked down upon Somnambula, the Maregyptian pegasus and Pillar of Equestria. All four of her hooves were chained to the floor, her wings bound tightly to her sides. They were taking no chances this time. "I bet you're surprised to see us again after what you did. Do you regret going against us now?"\n\n"No," Somnambula responded, the ancient Maregyptian accent ragged from days spent in her cell.\n\nAdagio's face contorted into anger. "Really? You took away our destiny, everyone's destiny, and look how the world has done! You solved nothing, ponies still die, creatures far worse than us still live and rule! Even now, when you know what being banished for over a thousand years feels like, you still refuse to understand!"\n\nThe pony shook her head. "We did what we had to for Equestria. You left us no choice."\n\n"You chose to fight us," Aria responded. "And this is the price you have to pay. Come on, Adagio." The two sirens gave one last look at Somnambula before both leaving the cell. Sonata moved as well to follow, but stopped when she heard a voice behind her.\n\n"Wait," Somnambula said. "You are not like them, are you? Your hatred does not burn as bright as theirs."\n\nThe siren frowned. "Yeah, Adagio says I need to work more on being mean. She's right though. You decided to banish us, and we were stuck down there for over a thousand years."\n\n"And it is a decision I wish I could take back every day now." Sonata blinked, and Somnambula looked at her, the pony's purple eyes shining brightly. "But please, if you stay, I promise I can explain everything to you.""

 hippogriff_abyss.41.d:0 ""It is true that you left us no choice in having to fight you. But not all of us wanted to banish you too. Stygian and I wished to try and talk, to make you see the error of your ways, but we were convinced by Starswirl that it was the only way to save Equestria, that villains could not change. We let fear into our hearts, and it chose for us. I allowed the same thing to happen when Stygian turned to the darkness after we cast him out."\n\n"You mean when you got banished too?"\n\nSomnambula nodded. "When he did not come back for forgiveness, but instead for revenge, I believed that the darkness had taken too much of a hold, that he was beyond saving. Even when Twilight brought us back, I did not have hope for him."\n\n"But?" Sonata asked, getting genuinely curious now.\n\n"But Princess Twilight proved us wrong. She saved Stygian, and brought the friend we once had back to us. She gave me my hope back." Despite the chains holding them down, Somnambula managed to raise a hoof to point it at Sonata. "And now, I am placing it in you."\n\nSonata blinked twice, following the Maregyptian's hoof before pointing at herself. "Me?"\n\n"I believe that you can choose a better path. Your power may take choice away from others, but you still have the choice to do the right thing. You don't have to do what others tell you to do, or act how they believe you should. You can do what you want to do, be who you want to be, and I have hope that you will do what is best for everypony."\n\nSonata didn't say anything. All she did was stare at the pony in front of her, the pony she was supposed to hate with all her heart, the one she had feared for years now would send her back into the Abyss. But now, she didn't know what to feel. "I... need to go," she said, backing away.\n\nSonata did not sleep that night."

The meetings were long, according to him, with the Wingbardians too proud to give up their short-lived victory over the cats easily. Eventually, though, with a smooth tongue and and force of the sirens behind him, they eventually folded and signed the deal, ending official hostilities between us.\n\nIn it, we gain official ownership and occupation of all of former Abyssinia, removing Wingbardy from our future sphere of control. This is of course a temporary peace; our eyes are set on the world, after all, not just some part of a continent. For now, though, this will suffice; the land of Griffonia will be dealt with at some later date, and we have what we need to launch our invasion of Equestria."

 hippogriff_abyss.43.t:0 "A Siren Second"
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d1:0 "Adagio had always worked hard to keep her role as the undisputed leader of the siren three. Being fair it was easy, what with how incompetent the other two were and how simple it was to get them to fight each other instead, but still. Just dealing with either of them could be so annoying sometimes. Aria was always getting into her business, and Sonata constantly fumbled the most basic of tasks given to her...\n\nBut the time for scheming was over. Necessity had forced her to choose between the two, of who she would trust more than the other, and while the answer may have seemed simple to some Adagio knew it was anything but. Both were practical options in their own ways, even if their personalities weren't.\n\nAria was a natural choice. Her paranoia and sarcasm grated on Adagio in all the wrong ways, but she was still manipulative, intelligent and most importantly pragmatic. She gave results that couldn't be argued with, and got things done independently of instruction. A perfect Second to deal with the issues she couldn't care less about.\n\nOn the other hoof, Sonata for all her faults had benefits as well. Her methods were certainly... unique, and rarely did she ever follow instruction to Adagio's liking, but Sonata was able to solve problems that neither she or Aria could ever think of approaching. Easily persuaded herself, she would be a compliant, idiotic and possibly even useful secondo to her primo.\n\nBut in the end, only one could be her partner. The other would no doubt be annoyed at being put last in line, and she would have to be careful in making sure her choice didn't get the upper hoof over her. So the moment of truth had come; who would it be?"
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d2:0 "Getting her way to the top as the leader of the three sirens had been a tedious task, that much was certain. Sonata was an idiot, as usual, but Adagio was always a major hurdle in her goals for Sirenalia. She was smart, antagonistic, power-hungry even within their trio, and charismatic enough to occasionally convince Sonata to her way of thinking. Still, she was the one now on top, at least for the moment, and now as much as she didn't like to admit it she needed a partner to continue forward.\n\nThe choices spoke for themselves. Adagio was a natural choice for the exact reasons she had been so irritating before; her drive gave her determination to see things through even if her spiteful nature caused unnecessary complications in the process. Of course, giving someone who only desired more power exactly that was a slippery slope, especially when it came to Adagio, but that was just part of the game they played now.\n\nThe safer, but definitely more annoying option was to go with Sonata instead. The downside implied in it was having to actively deal with whatever she got up to more often, but at least Aria could highly doubt that she was up to anything actively malicious against her. Plus, Sonata did occasionally do something useful... about once every six moons. It was quite possible that she would be a better long-term approach as a Second, though Aria doubted it.\n\nSo, who would it be. The dangerous Adagio, or the incompetent Sonata? The spiteful manipulator, or the trusting ditz? It was up to her to decide."
 hippogriff_abyss.43.d3:0 "Out of all the possibilities, few could have expected this.\n\nSonata still wasn't quite sure why she was still leading the group they had going. At first, it was obvious even to her that it was just to get her to stop complaining. They never really expected anything out of her in the first place. But over time, both Aria and Adagio seemed to see it less as a burden and more like she was actually doing something useful. And Sonata was always willing to help her fellow sirens.\n\nBut things were changing now. Both Adagio and Aria were pushing her to choose one of them over the other. It was weird to Sonata, seeing them ask her for something and not the other way around. But she was the leader for now, so she got to make the choice like Adagio used to do, and this was one that she had to make all by herself.\n\nAdagio knew what she was doing, that was obvious. She had all the plans, she came up with everything they were supposed to do, and she just wanted what was best for all of them. Without her, Sonata wouldn't have the foggiest clue on what she was supposed to be or what she should be doing.\n\nNow Aria, she was mean. All she did was constantly tell Sonata how terrible she was, which she didn't like. But she also seemed a lot less... spiteful, Sonata thought the word was. Adagio knew things, but what she wanted always seemed a little off. Aria looked at the bigger picture, saw things coming before they even happened, and even looked the other way or helped Sonata out when they both had the rare agreement. There was no sense of underlaying wrongness with her like Adagio had.\n\nShe supposed that when it came down to it, her choice was about feelings. What did she feel was the right decision? Was there even a right or wrong answer? And which was which? Sonata didn't know, but she had to choose one way or the other."

Chances of success in integration through merging regions and administration are high. Method has met official recommendation.\n\nZarantia: Relatively backwater and unindustrialized group of zebra tribes. Militancy and resistance provides issues. Pacification will be required for further integration.\n\nTobuck: Majority of population in primary city, culture resembles Maregyptian. Possibility of criminal and subversive elements remaining is high, thorough effort to clean them out is highly recommended.\n\nChiropterra: Remnants of six legions which fled from Equestria over a thousand years ago after the original banishment of Nightmare Moon. Extremism and militancy is dangerously high, immediate action is advised. Fanatical devotion to religion noted as possible future issue. Laborers identified as possible method of subduing local populace.\n\nConclusion: Process of integration deemed relatively simple, as long as instructions are followed.

When the sirens first took over, he knew that it was going to be bad. After all, the stories were rampant of what happened inside their lands; the fights, the mindless obedience, the songs. He remembered being dragged out into the square, forced to listen to the music. He expected to be trapped in his own mind, or for his friends to turn on him one day. He expected rage.\n\nBut he got none of those things. His friends still met with him, as usual. He was still in full control of himself, and his mind was at ease. Everything had seemed good until the Zumidians had come in. They claimed that Warzena was now a rightful part of their kingdom, that their 'King Zamni' was now the rightful sovereign of their city. It was outrageous, ludicrous even. Who were they to march in and just take a title like they owned the place?\n\nThat was on Zala's mind almost all the time now, and he knew his friends felt the same way. Every week they would get back together and tell each other about how terrible the Zumidians were, how they were the worst thing to happen since the Storm King himself. They never made life easy; the hatred was mutual as shown by their harsh nature, their wide reprisals and distrusting glances at passers-by. Zala could not remember any times in his life worse than this.\n\nThere was something else nagging at the back of his head, but he paid it no attention. It was just another thing on the long list of hatred that had become his life."

Both options work, and I can't tell you which one is better."\n\n"But there's always a better answer! There's a right one and a wrong one! It's like Adagio told me - everything we decide to do is right, and everyone who disagrees is wrong!"\n\nAria sighed, rubbing her hoof against her forehead. "The world isn't as simple as that, Sonata. Releasing the laborers would help get the ponies on our side and more compliant, which would probably make Chiropterra easier to keep a hold of. Keeping them in line though would calm things down and probably make your job easier." She shrugged. "Either way, it's not my problem."\n\nNever before had Sonata been annoyed to not get Aria's input and opinion on something. So instead, she focused on what mattered; what would she do? All the advice she has asked for had presented her with two options, both of them equally viable.\n\n...Sonata didn't like hard decisions."

And they were disciplined, many rather dying than even getting the chance to listen to the song.\n\n"I don't know, Aria," Sonata said as they floated in the throne room of Mount Aris, having finished looking over reports from the mainland. "Doesn't that sound a bit extreme? I thought we were trying to make things easier, not harder."\n\n"And their devotion is what's making this harder," the purple siren explained impatiently. "Without their faith they'd fall apart. If we make an actual effort to get rid of it, everything will be easier for us."\n\n"But we've already almost beaten them!" Sonata countered. "They're close to giving up, I just know it! And Adagio wouldn't be happy if she finds out how much time and effort you want me to spend on this idea."\n\nAria gave an annoyed sigh and just gave what Sonata called 'that look'.

While such a distant nation was out of our interests initially, the rise of the sirens and their claims of revenge on Equestria did concern some in our ranks who believed that a conflict of interest between us and them was possible. And while they still seem possible, the hippogriff who calls himself Plumage Moonfeather comes with an offer.\n\nThey too wish to see the ponies fall, and they are willing to aid us in destroying them, for a price. The exact terms seem to be intentionally vague, though there are a few terms already set as part of the agreement; no matter the outcome of the war, we will obtain the western parts of Equestria and the Crystal Empire, while they demand the Southeast region and custody of the 'Pillars of Equestria'. All other territories are to have ownership decided upon the end of the war through negotiations.\n\nWhile the ponies and land in question are not of any real value to us, the question remains of whether this alliance will benefit us in any real way. Creatures with such power as their song are inherently untrustworthy, and giving them a foothold on our continent, no matter how small, may be a mistake that we will have to pay for someday..."

They will give up the Pillars of Equestria, as you demanded, and give us the southeast region as compensation for our support."\n\n"What about the other parts?" Adagio asked.\n\nMoonfeather's jubilant expression faded a bit. "I did have to promise them the northwest, and the best I could negotiate was pushing off the official borders until after our conflict with Equestria is won. As long as we can occupy important parts of Equestria before they can, however, I guarantee you that I can get more out of them in the future."\n\n"Then we'll just have to take it from them first." Adagio turned to her other sirens, leaving the hippogriff now out of the conversation. "This 'alliance' is only temporary, of course; we just need a hoofhold on Equus now to betray them later. Still, we should try getting as much on our hooves as possible. After all, the more ponies we get under our spell..."\n\n"The more powerful our magic becomes," Aria and Sonata finished simultaneously.\n\n"Exactly. So, let's go and show the Equestrians who their real masters are.""
 hippogriff_abyss.49.a:0 "Let's just hope they can pull their own weight."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.50.t:0 "The Offer Declined"
 hippogriff_abyss.50.d:0 ""What do you mean, they didn't fall for it?"\n\n"They just didn't listen," Moonfeather said, keeping a veil of patience in front of his own frustration. "The Queen barely gave me the time of day before rejecting everything. Whether their rejections stems from incompetence or intelligence, I am unsure, but either way it seems they don't want our help."\n\nAdagio growled. "They want Equestria for themselves." Turning to her fellow sirens, she moved to intentionally leave the hippogriff out of the ensuing conversation. "We can not let them take what is rightfully ours. It doesn't matter whether we need to fight the entire changeling race; we will not be denied."\n\nThe two other sirens just nodded in agreement. "Good," Adagio continued. "Now let's show both the ponies and the changelings who their real masters are.""
 hippogriff_abyss.50.a:0 "They'll regret this soon enough."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.51.t:0 "The Crucial Decision"
 hippogriff_abyss.51.d:0 "Equestria has fallen, its ponies cowed before us. Victory is ours, and so are the spoils to take. But as many rejoice at this hard-fought victory to assert our dominance over the continent, there is still one last unresolved issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nBefore Equestria's defeat, we signed a deal with the sirens of Zebrica for their aid in our wars. Now they expect the payment we agreed upon long ago; official recognition over control of the Southeast, the Pillars of Equestria, and continued negotiations for the rest of the land in Equestria.\n\nThe sirens would undoubtedly make for a powerful permanent ally, should they maintain our alliance for the future. And if we managed to take much of Equestria, we should have the upper hoof in the negotiations, barring of course the Southeast which we have little actual strategic motive for. But if the sirens managed to seize territory before us... we may just have our victory taken right from underneath us. And, if they plan on betraying us, it may be safer to cut our ties now, and hopefully prevent a foothold onto our continent, even if it will likely lead to war from this betrayal.\n\nSo, what shall we do, my Queen?"
 hippogriff_abyss.51.a:0 "Give them their land, they may still be useful to us."
 hippogriff_abyss.51.b:0 "Let them come, they deserve nothing from us."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.52.t:0 "Traitors in the Hives"
 hippogriff_abyss.52.d:0 ""They did WHAT?"\n\nPlumage, their usually extremely composed and confident constant, could not help but flinch and step back as Adagio glared at him with a death stare. "T-the..." He cleared his throat to force out the stutter. "The changelings have betrayed us. They refuse to acknowledge the agreement of the Southeast, or our right to the Pillars of Equestria."\n\nBoth Adagio and Aria were seething in pure rage at this point. Sonata, on the other hoof, looked more confused. "Wait, but weren't we going to do that to them anyway?" she asked.\n\n"Yes Sonata, but they did it to us first," Adagio responded, barely keeping in her anger.\n\n"So why are we so surprised if we were planning to betray them too?"\n\nAnd that was the point the dam broke. "Because only we're supposed to do that!" the yellow siren yelled at her partner, pushed past her breaking point. Sonata quickly retreated, realizing she had finally overstepped Adagio's patience. The latter recomposed herself quickly, a mask of anger and determination once again covering her face.\n\n"If they want to do this the hard way, then fine. We'll force them to serve just like everyone else on this pathetic world. Let's put these changelings in their place.""
 hippogriff_abyss.52.a:0 "This betrayal will be paid with their servitude."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.53.t:0 "Promises Kept"
 hippogriff_abyss.53.d:0 ""So, what's the plan?" Sonata asked Aria as the three sirens gathered in the room, all of them in fairly good moods. The news had been broken to them individually already; the changelings had acquiesced to their previously agreed demands and accepted their control of the Southeast. The remaining Pillars of Equestria had already been hoofed over; just like Somnambula, they were imprisoned in the dungeons of Mount Aris until the sirens could put their undivided attention on dealing with them.\n\nAria shrugged. "We can't negotiate with the changelings ourselves, so we have to trust Moonfeather to work for us. Unfortunately." The last word she added on with an extra dose of sarcasm.\n\n"Our Constant knows the price of betrayal," Adagio responded dismissively. "And he profits from our success as well, so he'll do whatever he can for us anyway. Greed is such a powerful motivator."\n\n"Right. And what will we do with our 'allies' after everything is done?"\n\n"What we will do with them does not matter for now. If Plumage is successful, they may still be useful partners for us. Right now, we need to focus on the now. Isn't that what you wanted, Aria?"\n\nThe siren rolled her eyes. "Sure. Whatever you say, Adagio.""
 hippogriff_abyss.53.a:0 "Let's see what we can get from this..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.54.t:0 "The Status of Manehattan"
 hippogriff_abyss.54.d:0 "Equestrian Region: Manehattan\n\nPrimary Cities: Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Albion, Prance, Petershoof\n\nSecondary Cities: Mareway, Bridlepolis, Hollow Shades\n\nStrategic Importance: Large amount of heavy Equestrian industry, population and ports to the Celestial Sea.\n\nNotes: The Equestrian east coast is strategically one of the most vital regions of the old pony nation, holding a large amount of its industry and pony population, as well as facilitating trade between it and the continents of Griffonia and Zebrica. It is for those exact reasons that the Changeling Queendom considers it a region of interest, however the probability of them successfully pacifying local pony resistance is low. Because of that, it has been designated as a region of high likelihood for a concession to the sirens should we currently have a foothold in the previously listed major cities.\n\nAddendum: Manehattan will also be critical for extracting further regional concessions northwards and westwards into Equestria."
 hippogriff_abyss.54.a:0 "It's already ours, let's just make it official."
 hippogriff_abyss.54.b:0 "We might have to do a little convincing here..."
 hippogriff_abyss.54.c:0 "Just let the Changelings have it."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.55.t:0 "Siren Demands: Manehattan"
 hippogriff_abyss.55.d:0 "Negotiations between us and the sirens have gotten off to a rocky start, as demands have been sent for the region of Manehattan to be given to and recognized as siren territory. While giving up land is not a notion any respectable changeling would even dream of, we do have to approach this with at least a hint of nuance due to what is at stake here.\n\nManehattan is a valuable region on the east coast, with a large amount of Equestrian industry and population. Losing it would strike a heavy blow to our ability to project power eastwards. However, it is realistically unlikely that we would be able to maintain a firm hold over it anyway for the near future. In addition, should the sirens control territory further inland, they should be of a higher priority for us to negotiate for. If we want to keep our alliance and friendly terms with the new intercontinental power we have given a hoofhold on Equus to, it may still be worth giving them this small victory."
 hippogriff_abyss.55.a:0 "These demands are agreeable... for now."

Its industry is notable, but the local resources and population density leave much to be desired. However, it remains an important symbolic region of Equestria, and a virulent hotbed of communist resistance, so the Changeling Queendom ignoring the Queen's Guard organization is somewhat willing to pawn it off to us instead. Should we hold the major industrial centers, they will likely concede without any further issue.\n\nAddendum: Stalliongrad will be critical should we wish to secure a hold and gain concessions over the east and heart of the Crystal Empire."

Alone, it is not the most important areas of Equestria by any means. It serves no critical strategic purpose for us, and with the fierce communist resistance it does seem like more trouble than it's worth.\n\nHowever, hoofing it over to the sirens has hit a single snag, that being the Queen's Guard. Having been set to administrate the region personally, they are vehemently against any sort of surrender to the foreign power. They do have a point in it being seen as a sign of weakness, but it is obvious to many that it is mostly to ensure their own spoils of war remain theirs. Still, the final decision is up to the Queen."

Also contains the major port in the Pegasi Gulf and the west coast of former Equestria.\n\nNotes: The Southwest region is valuable for exactly one reason, and that is the oil it contains within the desert. The city of Las Pegasus is also a notable bonus, as one of the few major ports of Equus. The Changelings are eager to gain both to fuel their transport of material to garrison forces and their war machine as a whole. They will not give up such a prize easily, though the proximity to our secured Southeast region does prove a point of contention. Shrewd diplomacy may still win us the day if we have a definitive advantage in the region.\n\nAddendum: The Southeast is an individual and independent piece from the rest of Equestria in negotiations, and thus can be ignored if necessary to focus efforts on more critical regions in the east and north."

It has large deposits of oil, which will be necessary to feed our war machine for the foreseeable future. It contains the port of Las Pegasus, which is critical for supplying our forces across all of further Equestria. And finally, its geographical location is important in securing our flank in all the rest of western Equestria. This is why, to our annoyance, our so-called partners are making demands for the region.\n\nSaying no is a simple option. We get to keep our current valuable holdings. But should we already not have much of a grasp on it, it may be... prudent to give it up to them, at least at the moment. A distinct advantage here is that letting them take it here will not let them press any further, for northwest Equestria is already guaranteed to be ours with no negotiation.\n\nStill, that oil is quite the prize to behold..."

In addition, it is the world's highest source of magical crystals for use in magi-tech and other similar applications, or for our use in siren gem crafting. The Changeling Queendom sees no difficulty in maintain a hold over an occupation, and so wishes to see it remain under their administration. Surrender to a demand for land is unlikely to meet success unless odds are stacked in our favor.\n\nAddendum: As the last region in the north for negotiation, there is no further benefit to holding the region past the initial benefits. While still highly desired, there is not an irredeemable loss from surrendering to the changelings in this regard."

While we would still get the western half of the Empire as was previously agreed upon, we would still lose the most critical part of the once-banished land of Crystal Ponies, as well as their vast magical crystal mines in the mountains. In almost every term, the sirens would be getting all of the population and resources, leaving us with only empty wastes.\n\nWith nothing left to lose, we could take our stand here and refuse any further humiliation. Or, because of that, we can give up and just let them have this last victory. It is disgusting, it is untenable, and it will only leave them in that much a stronger position for a certainly guaranteed war between us in the future, but if we remain 'compliant' we may get the chance to take them by surprise one day..."

Ponyville and Cloudsdale have been particularly noted of cultural significance. Occupies important place in the heart of Equus.\n\nNotes: Canterlot is representative of victory over Equestria itself, and central Equestria may be the most important region culturally to all of ponykind. With three major cities as well as the home of the Element Bearers, and the vast resources in the caverns beneath the capital, attaining this region would be a true victory and a display of dominance over our new holdings in Equus. However, the changelings also know of this, and with their major grudge they are considered incredibly unlikely to hoof over the region if given the option. Should we wish to have it, we will have to pry it from their grasp by force, and diplomatic superiority.\n\nAddendum: Taking Canterlot will be necessary to justify a future demand for ownership of the heart of the Crystal Empire."

It is one of the entire reasons why we waged war against the ponies in the first place, and the capital is an eternal reminder of the moment we reached for the sun and were cast out. And now, it is being threatened to slip away from our grasp once again.\n\nGiving up Canterlot would be a tremendous defeat on our part, and practically strip all meaning from our glorious war with the ponies. And yet still... if we do not already have the cities we need, there is little chance that we will be able to get them now, or in the near future barring a full war. As loath as every changeling would see it, we may have a better chance to just... accept this defeat and plan our revenge at a later date. Canterlot will be ours, that much is certain, but it is possible that patience would be a virtue, until we can break them for this treason."

Our hold over it has been completely secured, and we can trust to remain in possession of it for the future. However, this will also likely make the changelings far less compliant in any future demands made against them, so we should remain careful not to overstep our bounds should we wish to remain on friendly terms with them."

 hippogriff_abyss.65.t:0 "Demands Rejected"
 hippogriff_abyss.65.d:0 "Unfortunately for both of us, the changelings have refused our demand for one of the regions of Equestria.

 hippogriff_abyss.66.t:0 "Rethinking our Relationship"
 hippogriff_abyss.66.d:0 "It was strange, being alone these days. No Aria to argue with her over how to do things, no Sonata to pester her with mindless requests. All Adagio had to accompany her was the sound of silence. There was a certain beauty to it, one that even her own music could not fully capture. There was a time and place to sing, after all; the absence in between made the moments of her talent shining bright all the more special.\n\nBut alas, none of that was the reason she was here alone today. Plumage Moonfeather had finally returned from the lands of the changelings, the negotiations officially concluded. Normally this would be when she would play her cards, reveal her true colors and betray her allies without a second thought. But Equestria and its ponies was proving more resilient than she thought, and Adagio needed to put her attention on them. Her revenge needed to come first.\n\nAnd so, she was left with the question of what to do with their fellow emotion-feeding 'friends'. She could still betray them and cut ties, of course. War was not something she wanted just yet, but isolating themselves would make sure they wouldn't be caught off guard by a betrayal. Or, she could keep up the facade, maintain their alliance while still keeping them at a hoof's distance. As long as they each found a use for the other, or were too busy dealing with the ponies, mutual protection would keep anyone else from intervening.\n\nOr, she could take an entire new step in the other direction. The changelings' ability to shapeshift was admittedly impressive, even if it was run on love instead of hate. A few of them here or there could do wonders in crushing the last cells of resistance that remained actively fighting in Adagio's parts of Equestria, and absolutely obedient servants would surely help the changelings. It would be mutually beneficial, and would make her betrayal all the more punishing someday, as long as she expelled or dealt with the internal changelings simultaneously. And as long as they were dependent on her, they could never dream of doing such an act back at the sirens..."

 hippogriff_abyss.67.t:0 "Another Offer"
 hippogriff_abyss.67.d:0 "While we expected a surefire betrayal soon by the sirens, it seems the opposite has happened instead. They have sent us a new offer, separate from the negotiations we once had, of collaborating in occupying the land of Equestria and subduing the ponies. If we supply them with changelings loyal to them who can act as deep-cover agents to infiltrate resistance cells, they will provide us with fanatically loyal thralls to work with. By combining our unique talents, we can subjugate the ponies easier and hopefully put an end to their foolish notions of rebellion.\n\nHowever, we must still be wary. The benefits are obvious, but so is the danger of allowing their subjects into our occupied territories and working closely with us. It is practically asking for a devastating backstabbing down the line. But, if it helps us prevent a full uprising by the ponies, perhaps it could be worth it for now..."

 hippogriff_abyss.68.t:0 "A New Collaboration"
 hippogriff_abyss.68.d:0 "Of course they had accepted. The changelings were fools, not being able to see what was right in front of them. Either that, or they were far too overconfident in their ability to keep their song contained. The agreement was still in its initial stages, but already crowds of enthralled ponies were moving across the border to work with the changelings, just as there were changelings moving to 'help' them. A so-called mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nOf course nothing was such under the surface. Adagio had already told Aria to keep a close eye on them, which she had been more than willing to do this time. Every single changeling had their position tracked, their disguise marked, and were being monitored by loyal thralls constantly. A single hint of disloyalty would result in their immediate musical correction.\n\nPerhaps the changelings were taking similar measures. Perhaps they weren't. It didn't matter now, and some day it wouldn't. When the time came that they finally relax their guard... that will be the time to strike. Until then, Adagio would wait."

For now, though, the situation remains the same; a tenuous alliance, destined to be broken. They will hear the song, but not today.\n\nSomeday, though, they will get the chance like all the rest do."

 hippogriff_abyss.70.d1:0 "The wind was blowing. The ocean breeze carried the faintest smell of salt as the grass bowed before it, creating its own sea of green. The only breaks were from the hoofmarks that were left behind by the seven ponies as they marched, heads bowed low. Each Pillar of Equestria was tired and broken; the result of harsh captivity, the worst of which Somnambula suffered due to her excess time there.\n\n"Do you recognize this place, Stygian?" Adagio asked as they finally stopped, the air blowing through each of the ponies' manes. The unicorn in question looked up and around him before shaking his head. "Why, it's where we first met over a thousand years ago. Things could have been so different if you had helped us back then instead of running and assembling these so-called 'heroes'. We could have ruled Equestria, the entire world already, and you could have been there by our side as our most loyal subject." The siren sounded almost genuinely disappointed as she continued. "But alas, you chose poorly, and now this is the way things have to be."\n\n"What do you plan to do to us, then?"\n\nAria smirked. "Not very observant, are you? Can't even tell what you're standing on?"\n\nDrawn lines crossed along the ground underneath them, forming a circle etched with runes with blood red gems laid on the sides. Starswirl was the first to understand; his eyes widened in realization. "Fair's fair, after all!" Sonata said in an upbeat voice, tonally dissonant from what was about to occur.\n\nAs they picked up, the winds began to howl around them, swirling faster and faster as the lines began to glow. The gems themselves floated skywards, spinning around the pillars in a blur of red until finally, the very fabric of reality tore at the seams. And with the portal above them, the seven ponies were sucked into something they had once created themselves, in a cruel twist of irony that would have fate itself laughing.\n\nThe gems shattered, and the tear in space closed. The wind settled, the air silent and deathly still now. And with that, the ancient heroes of old Equestria were gone, defeated by the creatures they had banished so long ago."
 hippogriff_abyss.70.d2:0 ""Where is Sonata?" Adagio asked impatiently as she waited above the field of grass. "I thought we agreed to meet here fifteen minutes ago!"\n\nIt was supposed to be their greatest moment of triumph. The banishment of their most terrible enemies, the Pillars of Equestria. The time in captivity since Equestria's fall had left its mark, all of them ragged even for their age. All, except for the two missing members Sonata was tasked with bringing, Somnambula and Stygian. Without her and them, they couldn't finally get the revenge she'd been waiting far too long for.\n\nClearly Adagio would need to beat punctuality into her thick skull when this was over.\n\nAfter a painstaking amount of time, the familiar blue fin finally appeared on the horizon, with the two ponies in tow. Both of the Pillars looked suspiciously well for their imprisonment; Stygian even wore a coat to protect himself from the chilly weather. In fact, Adagio recognized it instantly; it was the very same one he wore when she, Aria and Sonata had first met him on the coastline over a thousand years ago.\n\n"You're late," Aria remarked as she floated over to the pair. "What, did the ponies give you trouble in getting over here to banish them?"\n\n"No, but..." Sonata sounded anxious while continuing. "I was thinking... maybe we could, like, not banish Stygian and Somnambula?"\n\nDead silence. She had expected a lot of mind-numbingly stupid ideas from the siren, but this was a new, unbelievable low. "Are you insane, Sonata?" Adagio asked with barely contained rage. "You want to spare the ponies who banished us for over a thousand years into an abyss. Did you forget why we fought this hard in this first place?!"\n\n"Well yeah, obviously I remember," Sonata said defensively, "but I talked to these two and they never wanted to banish us in the first place! They just wanted to talk to us first and try to make us change! Banishing them too for that seems kind of..." She struggled to find the words for a moment. "...Unfair!"\n\n"And when have we ever been fair? When has the world ever been fair? It wasn't to us when we tried to take what was ours, and they're still to blame for that!"\n\nSonata folded her hooves, still not giving up. "Well, if the world isn't fair, maybe we should try to be!" Adagio saw Somnambula and Stygian standing behind her, both staring hopefully at their newfound defender, while the remaining Pillars watched curiously behind them. It was clear that for once, now out of all times, Sonata was not backing down."

Banish all of them?"\n\nDead silence. She had expected a lot of mind-numbingly stupid ideas from the siren, but this was a new, irredeemable low. "Are you insane, Sonata?" Adagio asked with barely contained rage. "You want to spare the ponies who banished us for over a thousand years into an abyss. Did you forget why we fought this hard in this first place?!"\n\n"You don't get it though, Adagio!" Sonata pushed back. "I talked to Stygian, and he told me they never wanted to banish us, that was Starswirl's idea! Stygian just wanted to bring them together to save his village and talk to us first! If anything, the only one you should be mad at is him!" The siren pointed at the slender unicorn, who took a step back as his fellow ponies moved away from him, all staring.\n\n"They still agreed to banish us in the end. They still chose to do that, Sonata!"\n\nThe blue siren folded her hooves, unconvinced. "They didn't have a real choice! That's like... blaming ponies under our spell for fighting when we're making them do that! None of them should be blamed for listening to him, especially Somnambula and Stygian! They were against banishing us first too!" At this point every Pillar was staring from behind at their newfound defender, except for Somnambula who had a strange expression on her face that almost looked like she was... proud of the siren. It was clear that for once, now out of all times, Sonata was not backing down."

 hippogriff_abyss.71.t:0 "Settling Grudges"
 hippogriff_abyss.71.d:0 "Even though the Pillars were the most important enemies, they were not the only ponies with a debt to pay. Sirens had a very long memory when it came to slights, the modern day being no exception. And it just so happened that there were six ponies, more heroes of Equestria that one could call the 'modern Pillars', who had thought that they could help Princess Skystar defeat them while they were weak. But now the tables were turned, and it was time to take the toll of that arrogance.\n\n"You might have taken Equestria, but you'll never take our friendship!" Rainbow Dash said defiantly as the Element Bearers all stood across from the three sirens, looks of anger across their face. They had little choice in being there; enthralled ponies of all three tribes surrounded them in a large circle, cutting off any means of escape.\n\n"And why would we need to do that?" Adagio asked them. "Just because your connection to those little artifacts of yours doesn't mean we can't reach you in other ways. Aria, if you would do the honors?" Nothing seemed to happen for a moment, until a few ponies behind the sirens parted to reveal a unicorn, with a brilliant amber coat and a familiar military uniform.\n\n"Sunset Shimmer!" Twilight cried out as she reached a hoof towards her, but the pony gave no response. She only stared blankly, before looking upwards towards the sirens as if waiting for further instruction.\n\n"You may be immune to our spell, but the ponies you love aren't. And now, they're completely obedient to our every command." Adagio's dark smile grew even more sinister as she continued. "But, since I'm in a generous mood today, I'm willing to forget everything in the past. You can go, live out your short lives and do whatever it is you mortals do. But make no mistake, you will remain obedient and quiet. Because if you decide to cause trouble again..." Sunset's empty eyes drilled deep into Twilight, unblinking. "...it won't be you who pays the price for it."\n\nThe crowd of ponies parted, allowing both the Element Bearers and the sirens to leave. None of the former moved however, the five keeping their eyes on Twilight, who could only watch in despair as the pony she still called a friend turned away without the slightest bit of hesitation and followed the new masters of Equestria away, off to do whatever service they required of her."
 hippogriff_abyss.71.a:0 "And that's that."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.72.t:0 "The Equestrian Elite"
 hippogriff_abyss.72.d:0 "The two proposals laid before Aria were certainly interesting, that much was sure for her. With the spell sung, any previous blame or resentment towards the sirens themselves had magically vanished overnight, replaced with shifting the blame towards anyone else possible. The changelings, the griffons, their own fellow ponies; none were free from their accusations of causing their defeat. What was once angered cries of outrage towards her by the important equines 'loyal' to their nation had become relentless flattery and offers of obedience in attempts to gain an edge themselves on their rivals.\n\nNot every offer was worth her time, obviously. Countless of them had been slowly wittled down, first by trusted thralls and then herself, until she was just left with the industrialists and the nobles. The former, looking to make a new profit, offered their possessions and their influence to further stabilize major cities of Equestria, a certainly worthwhile idea. On the other hoof, the unscrupulous nobles left were willing to provide their valued service in subduing all of occupied Equestria, a long term idea with long term support.\n\nUnfortunately, with resources stretched thin, she could only reasonably accept one of their ideas for the moment. And with Adagio and Sonata out of the picture for this, thankfully, the choice was completely up to Aria."

 hippogriff_abyss.73.d:0 ""I don't know," Sonata said to the pony and feline as the argument reached its fourth hour, both of them almost getting to their wits' end. "Both of you have really good arguments, its hard to decide."\n\nThe Maregyptian put a hoof to his forehead, struggling to keep his patience. "Look, the Manedalusians wish to be a part of Maregypt. Both of our peoples long for reunification, and you would have the eternal gratitude of all of them should you choose us."\n\nThere was a hiss from the Abyssinian in response. "Pure lies, all of them. They have done nothing but oppress the creatures living there for generations, and they sought our liberation before you brought it to all of us. It is only right that we are given responsibility for their cities and land."\n\nThe doors behind them slammed open, and a second siren came in. "Oh, hey Aria," Sonata remarked, finally seeming to pay a bit more attention. "These two have been arguing to have some city or something for a while now."\n\n"I know," Aria responded, taking some satisfaction in the fear that seeped into both of the delegates' eyes. "That's why I'm here."\n\n"So what do you think?"\n\n"Well, giving Manedalusia to the Maregyptians would give us more control of it, considering our future plans with them." The siren very much enjoyed seeing the pony's eyes light up before the fear from earlier immediately returning in full force at her comment. "However, the Abyssinians are proving to be difficult to deal with from their distance, and you shouldn't just throw away a chance to get their loyalty."\n\nSonata was silent for a moment. "That wasn't helpful at all!" she finally complained, prompting a smirk from Aria.\n\n"It's your choice, not mine. And that means Adagio gets mad at you if you make the wrong choice. I'd suggest you don't.""

 hippogriff_abyss.74.d1:0 "Sonata was tired.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. Unfortunately, that trip was riddled with what was obvious from the beginning; the ponies did not want them. The love they held for their Princesses was difficult to break, even with magic, and the countless ponies who had escaped enthrallment were fighting hard to undermine them at every turn. There were no serious accidents on the trip, fortunately, but still even Sonata understood what the constant acts of defiance she saw meant.\n\nThe future would be difficult, for all of them. The ponies would realize it was better this way eventually. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. But ponies were no longer so accepting of following along. Peace and friendship had become the norm, and they would need to break that now. A few ponies here and there were willing to follow, but they were a firm minority.\n\nBut that was all for future Sonata to worry about. Right now, back on Mount Aris, she needed some sleep."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d2:0 "Sonata was tired.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And unfortunately, that trip barring a few exceptions was riddled with what was obvious to anypony; the ponies did not want them, or were at least skeptical of their rule. While the second rise of Nightmare Moon had disillusioned many in society, especially the thestrals who were not loyal to her, there were still many others who believed in Celestia willing to fight to undermine them at every turn, and not to mention the new Lunarist radicals created from it. While they had experience in rooting such ponies out from Chiropterra, even Sonata knew what the acts of defiance and resistance meant.\n\nThe future would not be easy, at least for many of them. The ponies would need to realize that things were just better this way. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. At least she got banished for acting in her true nature, and not for arguing with a sister. And some ponies did seem to recognize her as a new ruler, offering to help against those who still fought against the song.\n\nBut things like that were for future Sonata to decide and think about. Right now, back on Mount Aris, she needed some sleep."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d3:0 "Sonata was excited.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And, for a large part of it, the trip was actually an interesting success. Many ponies still did not trust them at the very least, but with Princess Celestia's fall their faith in old Equestria was shattered. Other than the radical solarists created from the regime who fought endlessly in the name of their Empress, the masses of ponies seemed to at least be accepting of our rule now, especially those who suffered most from the old Solarist rule. Few wanted to directly associate with ponies who wanted to be free, as to them 'freedom' was a return to terror.\n\nThe future, while still uncertain, was not looking difficult either. The ponies were already coming around, as they should. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have any doubt about that. At least she remained true to herself, unlike Celestia who fell from who she was. And the ponies, they recognized that right to rule she believed in, even offering whatever they could to bring an end to unified resistance and start a new age of musical normalcy in Equestria, or at least as normal as things could be under them.\n\nAnd Sonata was willing to start right now. Now that she was back on Mount Aris, she could finally bring the good news to her fellow sirens..."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.d4:0 "Sonata was ecstatic.\n\nOver the past few weeks she had been going out across Equestria, seeing her old homeland and visiting the ponies that now served her, Aria and Adagio. And, in almost every place she went, she was met with adoration, gratitude and hopeful ponies looking for an end to their constant misery. With both Princesses having fallen from grace, they are willing to accept almost anything that frees them from the madness and insanity that the two Empresses were forcing upon all of Equestria. Almost all organized resistance is despised by the average civilian for ties to the radicals now beaten, keeping their ability to do anything of note minimal.\n\nThe future was bright for everycreature, but especially Sonata and the sirens. Ponies flocked to her as a savior, a worthwhile alternative to everything they thought that they once knew twisted beyond belief. Adagio had taught Sonata that as a siren they needed to rule, and she didn't have doubt about that. If anything, this only reinforced that fact, that the ponies wanted her and that anyone else attempting to lead would only end eventually in failure. Countless were offering to help her and the 'occupation' in any way possible, some out of self-interest, but many others out of gratitude, barely influenced by the spell they were under.\n\nAnd with everything she saw, Sonata almost couldn't wait to get started bringing her old home back. Now that she was back on Mount Aris, she could bring all the news she had back to her fellow sirens..."
 hippogriff_abyss.74.a:0 "This is not going to be easy..."

 hippogriff_abyss.75.t:0 "The Future of Us and Them"
 hippogriff_abyss.75.d:0 "Mortals were such an odd thing, at least to Sonata. They died so quickly, yet they had managed to do so much over a thousand years. Even if they were still led by an immortal, it was regular ponies and other creatures that created new spells, new inventions, new music. Their empires rose and fell, and while some thought themselves worthy enough to rule, others were content to follow and be forgotten in history, much like Sonata herself almost was. By everything that she knew, they should have done almost nothing, but everything now contradicted that statement.\n\nAnd none did more than the simple fact of the nature of sirens. Adagio kept telling her that mortals were nothing, that they were disposable servants and nothing more, meant to be ruled over as crowds to adore them. And while yeah, that second part was true with how much conflict the world had seen without them, there was something else. Sonata, and all three of them got their powers from mortals. They fed off their hatred to gain power. Without them, they'd be completely powerless, magic-less sirens in a magic-filled world. The truth that Sonata had finally found, and maybe that Aria and Adagio had known but not spoken for a long time, was that they needed mortals as much as mortals needed them.\n\nPerhaps Sonata had actually known that the whole time, with how she felt the need to always want more for them when Aria and Adagio wanted less. But that was what it came down to now; how should they be treated? The wars with Equestria were over, the threats to their survival finished. This was all that was left now. Could mortals be nothing more than servants to rightful siren masters?\n\nOr, Sonata wondered, could they be something more, something a siren needed to protect?"
 hippogriff_abyss.75.a:0 "Our relationship is simple, they eternally serve us."
 hippogriff_abyss.75.b:0 "We are meant to take care of them as much as they do us."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.76.t:0 "Sonata's Requiem"
 hippogriff_abyss.76.d1:0 "It was over.\n\nWell, kind of. Equestria was gone, but there was still a ton left to do for everyone, especially her. Just because they won didn't mean it would be any easier. But, at least for right now, there was quiet. Nothing to do, no one to meet, just her alone in silence.\n\nSonata was never one for introspection. It just seemed boring and pointless to her, where there were a ton of better things to do. Why worry about what was in the past? She had made some mistakes, sure, but nothing that really mattered in the end. Nothing needed to change, and everything was fine. Everything was as it should be.\n\nAnd that was enough for Sonata. After a few more seconds of deep thinking, she got up to go get a taco. At least that would be more useful then whatever she thought she was doing right now."
 hippogriff_abyss.76.d2:0 ""That sure sounds like a lot of hard work," Zamni commented as Sonata laid on a nearby couch, having recounted everything she had done in the past few months. "Though those two other sirens of yours sound like they're giving you a hard time too."\n\n"They do, like, all the time," she agreed, waving a hoof for emphasis. "They just don't really get the stuff I do, you know? Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who actually thinks about what's going on."\n\n"What do you mean? They're never even seen me once, sure, but you made them sound pretty smart. And older, too."\n\nSonata struggled to find the words to continue. "It's just... I have all these ideas, and they can't understand them. When you made those new gems for us, they thought I was just using you as a tool and that's it. That's what they expected a siren to do, when instead... you're actually kind of nice as a friend, too."\n\nZamni trotted over, finally taking a seat nearby. "I appreciate the sentimentality," he answered, putting a hoof up, "but it sounds like they just can't see things any other way from theirs. Do you have any ideas on what to do about it?"\n\n"No!" She threw her hooves up in the air, clearly frustrated. "That's it! I can see all these things that are wrong, that don't make sense, but have no idea how to fix them or what they mean! They just bother me and I can't tell why."\n\nThere was silence for a few seconds, the only sound being a clock ticking from nearby. "Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually," the zebra finally said. "I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. Want to play a board game instead?"\n\n"Sure, maybe that'll take my mind off everything.""
 hippogriff_abyss.76.d3:0 ""What's wrong, Sonata?" Zamni trotted over to the siren, looking genuinely concerned. "You look troubled. Did something happen?"\n\n"No," she said, clearly unsure of herself. "Nothing happened yet. It's what's going to happen."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\nSonata looked strangely introspective, staring off into the void. "Have you ever heard of Somnambula, Zamni? Pillar of Equestria, from Maregypt?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"I talked to her a while back." The zebra looked expectantly at her as she took a moment to continue. "She told me things I never knew, things I might not have even wanted to hear. She made me ask so many questions about myself, and then I saved her from being banished by Adagio and Aria. She still talks to me in secret, telling me she hopes that I can be a better person, that I can do better things."\n\n"Okay..." Zamni blinked. "That's good advice and all, but what does that have to do with now?"\n\nThe blue siren took a deep breath. "There's so much we're doing wrong, Zamni. So much we need to change. But Aria and Adagio don't want to do that. I have to force them to, even if they hate me for it."\n\nNeither spoke for a long time. The only sound between them was the ticking of the clock from within the room, signaling seconds passing by as they waited. "Well, whatever you do, you can know that I support you no matter what," the Zumidian finally said, moving close to Sonata and looking up into her eyes. "And it sounds like Somnambula does too. Whatever you decide to do, we'll follow."\n\nShe broke out into a small, real smile. "Thank you, Zamni.""

 hippogriff_abyss.77.d:0 "It was quiet in Seaquestria. Many seaponies were asleep even before the moon began its rise over the horizon, leaving the only light coming from the natural flora and fauna that always illuminated the city. Only deep within the palace, in the the decorated throne room now barely used, did the voices that ruled across continents speak.\n\n"We did it," Adagio said as they stood together for what must have been the millionth time, her voice barely betraying her excitement. "We've won. The Pillars have been dealt with for their crimes, the ponies are back under our song, and our names are known by all. We have everything we ever wanted."\n\n"We can't get complacent, but you're right," Aria agreed. "With the powers we have no, almost nothing can stop us. We can do whatever we want, whenever we want."\n\n"And no matter what we still have to do, we can do it together!" Sonata added, clearly in high spirits. Whether it was forced or not was unclear, but the other two sirens paid it no heed.\n\nAdagio quieted the other two. "Yes, Sonata, there's still's plenty to do. Whether it be Zebrica, Griffonia or Equus, no one will be free anymore. We can't stop until this entire world does our bidding. The others would be proud if they could see us now."\n\n"And we'll be united every step of the way," both other sirens reaffirmed at once. With the three nodding, they raised their hooves skyward, just as the moon reached its zenith in the sky.\n\nAnd as a new day began across the world, the pendulum of fate swung ever further towards a dark future, a musical game to be played and won by no one. Where free will was a lie, where hate was a constant, where friendship was impossible.\n\nA world where sirens ruled."

And now, they have come under threat, but in a different way. Though flanked by many clearly enthralled creatures, a single hippogriff who calls himself Plumage Moonfeather has come to negotiate for ownership of said colonies, in particular Purrsia, for the sirens. Offering large sums of money for the territories, his request is incredibly generous for our side, though he has also made it clear that should we reject it, consequences may be on the horizon for not just the colonies, but all of Wingbardy.\n\nThe offer is tempting, especially with what is being offered to us. Allowing us to benefit while simultaneously ensuring we are not in the way of the rising power would certainly help keep the peace, at least for us. But we also must consider that this would permanently end our ambitions on Zebrica, should we have them. If we ever wanted to end this menace for good, those lands may be critical if a future war does break out, and we maintain the advantage on land and sea."

Therefore, we must devote all our effort now to regaining it, and bringing our powers back up to acceptable levels before approaching any other issue.

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.1.d:0 "In a nondescript building somewhere in Hippogriffia, three figures sat around a table. The first was Crack Lightning, the nationalist firebrand of Aris First. The second was Posada, charismatic leader of the Revolutionary Workers' Party. Lastly there was Princess Skystar, Queen Novo's daughter and heir apparent.\n\nCrack was the first to speak. "I'll admit, Princess, when I received your invitation to discuss uniting our resistance networks, I was open to the idea. But if I had known that unreliable, nutty communist was going to be here, I would have stayed home."\n\nPosada immediately shot back, "As if I'm happy to see you, you unabashed racist! You've become such a reactionary I'm surprised you can even lead a resistance!"\n\nAs the two continued to trade insults, Skystar's face contorted with frustration. Eventually her patience wore out, and she yelled as loud as she could, "Stop! You have to stop! Can't you see this is exactly what the sirens want? It doesn't matter what ideology you prefer if there's no one left to support it! They've taken our friends, our relatives, even," she choked on the words, "even my mother, and here you are wasting time with stupid arguments!"\n\nPosada and Crack were stunned into silence. Skystar continued, calmer now, "I managed to send a messenger out to find the Elements of Harmony, but I need help keeping the resistance alive until they arrive. I thought you two could be that help. I heard you were friends once, so I was hoping you'd be willing to work together."\n\nBoth guests sat still, considering what the Princess had said. A moment later, Posada looked up. "Hey, Crack. Remember the first time we met, and how we talked for hours about the battle with the Storm King?"\n\nCrack's expression softened. "Heh, of course I remember. I think I see where you're going: it's time to save Hippogriffia once again?"\n\nPosada smiled. "Yes, but this time let's do it together.""

And then this has to happen. The few free hippogriffs remaining, in all their audacity, were actively choosing to fight back, setting back those conquests by who knows how long.\n\nIt was quite irritating.\n\n"The hippogriffs are proving more resilient then we thought," she told her partners, who had gathered once again in a spare room of the palace. "Every day they hinder us at every turn, and we have to expend more magic just to keep the rest in line. We have stopgaps, but this thorn needs to be removed."\n\n"That's obvious, Adagio," Aria replied in her ever-bored tone. "They're led by the former Princess Skystar, along with two nobodys. And they've gotten smarter and started using earplugs, so our magic doesn't affect them anymore."\n\n"Then why don't we just do what we always do?" Sonata asked. "We like, break up friendships all the time. It's how we get people to do what we want! Won't it be easier if they're fighting each other instead of us?"\n\nAria instinctively rolled her eyes. "Sonata, that's... actually an idea. Maybe you're not always the worst."\n\n"Really? Hey, wait a min-"\n\nAdagio cut them off before they could start fighting again. "Then it's settled. We put the pressure on until they finally crack. I hope both of you remember what to do?" The two nodded back. "Good. Then lets get this show on the road.""

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.3.d:0 "The leadership of Canterlot is both in relief and worry, as a hippogriff messenger has arrived from what was once Hippogriffia. After we had done multiple magical scans to make sure they weren't under the influence of the Sirens, they were let through to the throne room, where they explained that they had been sent by Princess Skystar. The once-royal of Aris had created a resistance against the Sirens, and she needed the help of Princess Twilight and the Elements of Harmony to defeat them.\n\nWhile sending the Elements to help the Princess would undoubtedly make them grateful and could help restore the harmonic monarchy on Aris, it would also be very dangerous. If an Element were to be captured by the Sirens... well, nothing good could come of it. None of the Elements will also be available here to help, and should a war break out we would have to call them back no matter what the situation would be..."

"When I first got Princess Skystar's letter, I didn't want to believe it, but... something is definitely very wrong here."\n\n"Yeah, yeah, so what?" Rainbow Dash asked. "We'll kick the sirens' flanks and be back in time for dinner, just like the Storm King!"\n\nRarity shook her head. "That was different, darling. These sirens have already captured almost all the hippogriffs in their spell, and they won't be easy to get rid of. We don't even know where to find Skystar, she could be anywhere!"\n\n"Or maybe she's waving at us over there!" Pinkie said bouncing while pointing a hoof inland. The other five ponies looked, and sure enough there the hippogriff was, frantically motioning for them to come over.\n\n"I'm so glad you're all here!" Skystar said as they approached. "I know you all must be really busy and all back in Equestria, but the sirens have got Mom and I didn't know anyone else who could help, so I sent a letter hoping you would get it and here you are!"\n\nRainbow Dash waved a hoof brushing off the remarks. "Don't worry about it," she said, "that's what friends do. So, how can we help?"\n\nThe Princess looked around before leaning in. "It's not safe here. I know a place we can go, and I'll tell you everything there. This way!"\n\nThe ponies looked at each other before following Skystar close behind. They didn't know how exactly they were going to defeat this new threat, but they all knew one thing; they would help Skystar and the other hippogriffs free their homeland, in whatever way they could."

For months now he had been held prisoner there by the sirens, unable to return to Aris after being completely caught by surprise during their coup. He had nearly given up all hope on ever being able to see the light of day again, until tonight. He had woke up to find his cell door left open, a single note floating in the water.\n\n"Get to Aris and find us. The resistance needs you. -Princess Skystar"\n\nHe didn't know how the Princess had done it, but he wasn't going to question it. Skystar was right, he needed to get back to the mainland. If they were mounting a resistance, he needed to do his patriotic duty to help, no matter what. He just needed to be careful, and made sure that he didn't get caught or enthralled before he could find wherever they were on Aris.\n\nAs Raft Wood swam off, however, he never noticed the pair of eyes watching from the darkest shadows, nor the malicious grin forming right below them.

In the center of the room was Raft Wood, the founder of Aris First. Crack grimaced. Although they had once worked together, he had always considered Raft to be a rival, not a partner.\n\nCrack turned to one of the guards. "What have you learned?"\n"Well sir, he wasn't followed, and he doesn't seem to be enthralled, but we can't be sure."\n"Thank you." Crack approached Raft, getting uncomfortably close. "Now Raft, would you care to explain how you managed to escape from the sirens?"\n\nRaft raised an eyebrow, but his expression quickly shifted to a smug grin. "Certainly Crack. After many months languishing in captivity, I was close to giving up. But in my darkest hour..."\nHe suddenly flung himself down in front of Skystar. On his knees, he reached up to kiss her claw. "Your Royal Highness somehow opened my cell and slipped me this note!"\n\nRaft gave the short note to a stunned Skystar. "I am eternally grateful to you Princess. You are noble and wise, like your mother. It would be my honor to aid the resistance however I can."\nSkystar read the note and frowned. "Raft, I'm glad you got away safely. But I didn't write this note, and I certainly didn't arrange your escape."\n\nThe whole room gasped. Crack roared, "He is under the sirens' spell!"\nRaft rose to defend himself. "Preposterous! I think I would know if I were enthralled!"\n"Really!? How would you know!? How can you be sure you aren't!?"\nRaft looked uneasy. "I, I... I don't know, but I'm asking you to trust me!"\nCrack faced the assembled resistance members. "This griff is clearly a siren plant, meant to destroy us from the inside. To save our movement, we must execute him immediately."\n\nCrack was normally very persuasive, but as he read the room he realized the others had no intention of executing Raft. He scowled. "Well, I will not have anything to do with him, or anygriff who follows him!" he said, leaving in a huff."

He read over the latest intelligence reports, destroying the most sensitive documents immediately. He was interrupted when the door opened and two Hippogriffs entered. The first was one of his agents, the second was a child no more than 10 years old.\n\n"Hey featherbrains, what do you think you think you're doin'? Don't bring a kid into my safehouse!"\n"Take it easy, boss," he replied, frowning. "She's my niece. Her parents got enthralled, and I'm all she's got left. Can you let her stay with us for a while?"\nBlunt observed the sullen expression on the child's face. "Eh, alright, but you better keep an eye on her. Welcome to Aris First, kid."\n\nThe child perked up at the mention of their organization's name. "Are you guys really Aris First?"\nHer uncle beamed. "You bet we are!"\n"Or what's left of it, anyways," added Blunt.\nThe girl began to smile in earnest. "Does that mean I get to meet Crack Lightning and Raft Wood, and help fight back against the sirens?"\n\nHer uncle tensed, and Blunt frowned. "Listen kid. If you're lucky, you might get to meet the Ace one day. But you're better off not meeting Raft, trust me."\nNow the girl looked puzzled. Her uncle anticipated the next question. "When Raft Wood escaped, Crack Lightning accused him of being a siren spy. Half of Aris First stayed true to the Ace, like us, while the other half followed Raft."\n"Oh, ok." She paused to think. "But is Raft Wood really controlled by the sirens?"\n\nThe door slammed open as another Hippogriff entered. Completely breathless, he took a minute to recover and then stammered, "Raft's faction is gone."\nBlunt froze. "What do you mean they're gone?"\n"Every Aris First cell loyal to Raft has gone dark. The leadership's still trying to figure out what happened, but they think our worst fears have come to pass."\nFor a moment everyone was silent. Both the girl and her uncle grew very pale.

That left the remaining sirens to decide what to do with her.\n\n"Did you really think you'd get anywhere fighting us?" Aria asked Posada, the latter refusing to look at either of the sirens. "You're lucky Adagio isn't here, she'd probably think of some creative way to humiliate you before giving you a performance. Personally, I think life imprisonment will suit you just fine."\n\n"What?" Sonata asked, curious. "Why?"\n\nAria rolled her eyes before turning to face her fellow siren. "Because she's still a threat, Sonata. She's charismatic and a firebrand, we can't let her just walk away even if she's under our influence. It's too dangerous."\n\nSonata made a weird expression, one she made whenever she was thinking really hard. "But like, we beat her! She won't hate us anymore after we sing.

Do you think I can ask her to make me one?"\n\n"No, Sonata." At this point Aria's voice was taking on a dangerously impatient tone.

And for that, he had to pay.\n\nShe had done her research on him, just for this.

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.11.d:0 "The door banged loudly as the latch holding it closed bent further, getting close to snapping. Skystar saw a few of the remaining hippogriffs in the room flinch, holding their weapons at the ready aimed at the door. There was only one way in and out, and it was currently getting broken down by the mob of enthralled creatures outside. This was it for all of them.\n\nWell, not all of them. Skystar had sent Silverstream out of Hippogriffia just a few days ago, to make an escape to Equestria. Silverstream had begged her to come as well, to flee and seek refuge from the sirens elsewhere, but Skystar had refused. She needed to stay here, to keep the last spark of hope for the resistance against the sirens alive.\n\nThat spark was quickly getting snuffed out with every single bang on the door.\n\n"What do we do, Princess?" a hippogriff asked, the claws holding his rifle shaking. "I know that they're enthralled by the sirens, but they're still our friends and family. Are we really supposed to shoot them?"\n\nSkystar had no good answer. How could she? The sirens had turned everyone she had loved against her. Whenever they saw her, all she could see in their eyes was hatred. And now what was she supposed to do? What if her mom was behind that door, forced by the sirens to do their bidding? What if it was Silverstream, who could have been caught by the sirens during her escape? Was one last act of defiance worth more death?\n\nSlowly, Princess Skystar put down the BAR she was holding. "No," she said. "I can't ask any of you to do that for me."\n\nSlowly, the rest of the hippogriffs put their weapons down as well. Some more hesitantly than others, but eventually all their guns were on the floor, forgotten about. Skystar looked around and met each hippogriff's eyes. All of them bore the same look of sadness, yet also acceptance. She had failed, failed all of them, and now the sirens had won.\n\nThat was her last thought before the door burst open and the crowd of enthralled hippogriffs rushed into the room."

Fluttershy and Rarity had gone ahead to get it prepared, and Twilight saw their eyes widen as they saw the crowd which was growing larger by the minute giving chase.

"C'mon everypony, jump aboard!" Twilight and Pinkie were next, followed by Rainbow Dash. Silverstream and Skystar were last, crossing the gap right as the boat was starting to pick up speed.\n\nAnd that was when a hippogriff grabbed Skystar's back leg.\n\nShe was pulled back onto the dock, leaving only Silverstream to land onto the boat with the Element Bearers. "Don't worry about me, just go!" the Princess yelled, more and more enthralled hippogriffs grabbing onto her like a horde of zombies. "Get out of here!"\n\n"No, we can't leave her behind!" Silverstream said, getting her wings ready. "We have to go back!" Before she could take off, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy grabbed onto her, keeping her on the boat.\n\n"I'm sorry, Silverstream, we have no choice," Twilight responded.

Our rule is simply how the world works; why did you think you could fight it?"\n\nWhen she got no response, Adagio turned to face Sonata and Aria, floating just a ways back from her. "I think making her go out and sing for us across Hippogriffia and Seaquestria would be just the perfect revenge for the trouble she's caused us," she said, pulling out an amulet with a blood red diamond-shaped gem hanging from it.

"This operation will be the biggest we've ever pulled: a raid on a barracks near Mount Aris. Security will be tight, but we've memorized the guards' rotations, so we shouldn't have any trouble. Let's show those sirens they're not safe anywhere!"\n\nBefore everyone could disperse, he continued, "And as for you commies, remember: we may need you to fill out our ranks, but we'll be keeping an eye on you."\n\nScarlet glared at him. "We'll be the ones keeping an eye on you, fascist pig!"\n\nWhen the resistance fighters reached the barracks, their plan fell apart almost immediately. A siren was singing nearby, and though they had earplugs for protection from the sound the vibrations shook them to the core. A guard managed to raise the alarm, and they had no choice but to fight their way out.\n\nScarlet found herself pinned down near the exit. When her gun jammed, she knew her time had come. A guard approached her, rifle in claw...\n\n...and was tackled to the ground by Silverwing. Scarlet's hope returned for a brief moment, but it was quickly dashed as the guard pulled out one of Silverwing's earplugs. Silverwing managed to knock the guard out, and Scarlet flinched as he came closer.\n\nYet instead of attacking, he grabbed her claw and led her away to safety.\n\nBack at base, Scarlet found Silverwing getting his wounds bandaged.\n"I'm sorry for what I said earlier."\n"It's ok," he sighed, "I am too."\n"It would be an honor to fight by your side again. But first, could you explain how you managed to save me without falling under the siren's spell?"\n\n"Oh, that!" He smiled. "I was a gunner's mate in the Storm King War. I haven't been able to hear out of my left ear in years!""

He went to school in one of the finest institutes in the country, and he aspired to go into a scientific field. He had friends, he had money, he had everything a hippogriff could ever want.\n\nHowever, one day, there was a commotion outside his school. There was a minority of Seaponies that also attended classes there, a recent initiative put forward when Queen Novo was in power in an attempt to promote racial equality on Mount Aris itself. They transformed into Hippogriffs to take the classes themselves, but would often take breaks to nearby available pools during their free time, as many vastly preferred their aquatic forms. For some bizarre reason, however, there was a mob forming, barring entry to the Seapony students.\n\nTenderquill couldn't think of any reason why there would be such a commotion and ventured further into the crowd to get a better look. Weren't they all supposed to be united after all? Something was wrong, but the more he thought about it the more it hurt to think. He must have been forgetting something, there must have been some sort of event to cause this he had overlooked...\n\nWhen he finally got to a position where he could see the Seapony-turned-Hippogriff students, something inside him clicked. He didn't know what it was or how it happened, but he could see clearly now. Why did these Seaponies deserve to go to THE finest institute in the country, taking spots that hard-working Hippogriffs deserve? All they did was flop around all day and sunbathe, while the Hippogriffs do all the work! It wasn't fair to have them come here, where some Hippogriffs struggled to even live out their lives, and take places meant for them!\n\nFilled with righteous anger, Skyward Tenderquill joined the mob, certain that his school would be a better place if these no-good lazy fish went back to their sea. If they wanted to get an education, they should just stay in Seaquestria where they belong. His former friendships with some of them no longer mattered; the one thing left in his mind was righteous anger towards the creatures he once called classmates."

It happened slowly, gradually until by the time you realized things were different, that they were worse, it was impossible to tell when it had started and when it had ended.\n\nIn this case, though, it was very obvious when everything had gone so wrong.\n\nThe day after prominent businessgriff Plumage Moonfeather had formalized his group of collaborators, the factory that Cloudy Seas had worked at for years now had instituted new 'regulations' that were supposed to improve efficiency at the workplace. And they did, in a way.. by forcing him and all the other hippogriffs to work twice as hard and extending their shifts for hours past what they originally were. There was little doubt that the new armed guards stationed around the factory were there to dissuade any thoughts of protest against these new changes. Cloudy and the other workers saw them as nothing more than thugs, hired guns only there to suppress and take their paychecks from their rich employers.\n\nHe hated them. He hated his manager, he hated the corporation owner, and most importantly he hated Plumage Moonfeather. All of them were to blame with his new miserable life, all of them were causing him this pain and suffering. He hated his coworkers, who were clearly being as lazy as possible just so he had to do more work to cover for them and his own quotas. He could tell they hated him too; he could see the looks on their faces, the anger whenever they saw his face, hippogriffs he once called friends now saying his name like it was poison.\n\nIt wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair at all. The sirens had clearly never meant for this to happen; they must have expected Plumage to try and manage things well, to be reasonable. After all, they were the ones who were just better by nature, they were guardians in a way for all of Aris. But Plumage had taken their trust and used it for personal profit and nothing else. He was greedy, immoral, and downright evil.\n\nIf Cloudy Seas ever saw him in person... well, he couldn't be blamed for what he would do. Until then, though... he could only sigh and get back to work."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.3.d:0 "Being an agent for Skystar's Resistance was dangerous work. Seaward Wings knew that, and it was only encouragement to get her job done correctly and get out safely. Today's mission against the tyrannical Sirens was a simple reconnaissance of the surrounding countryside to ensure that nothing important was ahoof. It was one of the easier tasks she had been assigned, and yet something felt off to her as she began the trip home.\n\nThe nearby guard checkpoint was all but vacated. Every mission she had undertaken before in this area, the post had a full entourage of enthralled guards looking to keep the road safe and keeping an eye out for dissidents, but not today. Still, Seaward Wings reasoned, there must have been a reasonable explanation for it. Chalking it up to a staff transfer, she logged down the absence before continuing.\n\nFurther down the road, she noticed an armored vehicle heading back towards the checkpoint. Those must have been the missing guards, though why would they be coming from that direction? There's was nothing out that way besides a few farms and... Her home.\n\nShe spread her wings and started flying, not caring about remaining covert anymore as much as she cared about her family. It wasn't long to get to her homestead with her burst of speed, and when she got there the front door was wide open.\n\nCalling out for her parents and sister and receiving no answer, she slowly walked through the once-welcoming home, nothing seeming out of place until she got to the dining room. Tables overturned, broken chairs, all the signs of a struggle between two parties. And on the counter was a single note, one that Seaward Wings tentatively moved to read.\n\n"Turn yourself in, and your family will not be harmed". That was all that it read, simple as could be. Those ten words rang out in her mind, as a million questions spun at the same time. How had they found her? Had she made some mistake somewhere? But one question rose above all else; what would she do now?\n\nThe thing was, Seaward Wings already knew the answer.\n\nAfter putting the rifle she had been carrying the whole trip on the counter next to the note, she somberly turned her head away and began the long trip back to the checkpoint she had seen only earlier that day. All she could hope now is that even if they would never let her see daylight again, at least her family could have the life that she could not."

When Hippogriffia first fell to a threat that only now they knew were the sirens, Zumidia had made sure not to catch itself offguard. They had quickly declared their complete independence from the Hippogriff mandate, led by the Regency Council that everyzebra had agreed to follow in the interest of the defense of the country against its threats.\n\nStill, it was no use against the inevitable declaration of war by the sirens, and the army that followed. Zakinel had been in the city when it had fallen to the hippogriffs, watching them march into the city like puppets on a string. What was interesting was they fact that they were reluctant to use deadly force, instead relying on blunt force or shooting to injure instead of kill. While opposition had been brutally suppressed, there were very little casualties in their occupation.\n\nEver since then, things had actually gone on as normal in the city, or at least as normal as they could be. Zakinel and the other Zumidians were allowed to go about their daily lives as they did before, just under the watchful supervision of the hippogriffs. It actually reminded him of back when they were under the official mandate, in some ways. But back then the hippogriffs had been friendly and helpful, while now they were more akin to statues. The only times they ever intervened was when open acts of dissidence were happening.\n\nBut now, the winds of change were blowing. There was word of the sirens coming, of those called Beacons with songs that would turn them into nothing more than marionettes listening to the whims of their masters. Perhaps it was nothing but fearmongering. What was certain, though, was that there was an aura of uncertainty on Zumidia, and that it would not last much longer."

No, what was happening was nothing less than the full liberation of Chiropterra.\n\nThe only information of the Sirens that Cherry had been permitted to know was that they were "a scourge devoted to destroying and enslaving everycreature", but it was already obvious that the Chiropterrans would have said anything to ensure the laborers would not rise against them. These Sirens must simply be the true saviors of the worker's revolution, here to overthrow the corrupt and authoritarian government that has plagued North Zebrica, forcing all around them into true slavery in service of their Goddess.\n\nNow, with such a powerful force behind them, the workers can finally see justice for the crimes that have been committed against them, and Cherry knew just who to start with. There was a collection of the old Chiropterran elite that instead of fleeing the country had attempted to hold out in their estates and wait out the storm for things to return to normal. However, things would not return to normal for them. No matter the cost, they would see justice for their actions.\n\nAlong with a collection of workers riled up by something more than just revenge, they marched on the estate of the tyrant supervisor that had abused them for decades.

The world could be burning to ash, and they would be none the wiser.\n\nAnd yet, something changed. It was hard to tell exactly when, or how, but it did. Newspapers, once almost irrelevant by the takeover, now printed new stories of foreign nations falling to communism, of monarchs being beheaded by revolutionaries, of famines and chaos in the places that the red banner flew. Posters were put up of the threat communism posed worldwide, and what terrors it would unleash if brought here. Word of mouth slowly spread of family members overseas being killed by revolutionaries for being 'reactionaries', or worse.\n\nThe resistance, of course, was not fooled. They did not turn on their allies immediately, knowing that the sirens were just attempting to distract and that they still posed the larger threat to Aris. But propaganda is effective in ways more than just what meets the eye, and Posada's supporters soon found it hard to coordinate with their allies, always being looked upon with the smallest hint of suspicion..."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.7.d:0 "The state university of Canterford was, like many in the major cities of Hippogriffia, considered one of the highest institutions of learning in the country. Hippogriffs and seaponies alike flocked from all of Aris and Seaquestria to attend, learning about economics, mathematics and the sciences in the hopes of getting a degree from the university. It had a talented staff, international recognition, and a vibrate group of political and ideological clubs ever since such ideas began flowing in from beyond the mainland.\n\nHowever, such a bright light was not meant to last. Crescent Skies, a former resident of Seaquestria had been part of the communist club that had formed before the siren takeover, and had been one of the few to avoid the magic song, alongside a few friends and his professor. He had come into contact with Posada herself and her resistance after they had formed the Arisian Resistance, and while he didn't want to risk becoming a partisan personally, he was more than willing to support them from the sidelines in whichever way he could.\n\nThat was, until one fateful day occurred. When he reached his club room, his friends were there, but not the professor. All the other students shrugged at him.\n\nIt was only half an hour later when their professor came in, looking defeated. He was flanked by two armed guards, both carrying rifles and looking quite threatening. "Students," he said weakly, "I am sorry to say that school is closing. The university is getting shut down indefinitely while communist sympathies in the staff is being investigated."\n\nThey all looked at each other as he continued. "In addition, we all are being sent in for musical correction to ensure that we have listened to the siren song. These gentlegriffs here are going to escort us to the courtyard and ensure that there aren't any complications on the way."\n\nAnd that was it. Crescent Skies slowly got into line to file out of the classroom, knowing that the jig was up. He should have known that this would have happened eventually. But he wanted to stay, to take a risk, and now he was going to pay the price.\n\nHe gave a sigh before giving one last look at his friends and comrades, while he could still call them that."

They are a gang of criminals, plundering our cities and stealing your hard-earned wealth. Every day they attack our government with no regard for the innocent hippogriffs they kill!"\n\n"The sirens are not your enemies, they are your saviors! They only want to restore peace and prosperity to our lands. Citizens of Hippogriffia, show your loyalty to the sirens by opposing these terrorists!"\n\nAfter this announcement, another message began. Although it was spoken in the dull and emotionless tone of a thrall, it was unmistakably the voice of Queen Novo.\n\n"Skystar, if you're listening, please give up and turn yourself in. Right now I am alive and well, but if you continue to resist the sirens will no longer be able to guarantee my safety. I love you, Skystar, and I hope to see you again soon."\n\nWhen news of the broadcast reached resistance HQ, all eyes were on the princess. Everyone wanted to see how she'd react to such a brazen threat on the queen's life.\n\nSkystar shuddered, and felt tears coming on.

And the only things standing in his way was the group of enthralled hippogriffs standing guard.\n\nIt was clear they weren't even trying to hide their intention here. All of them were standing blankly, eyes glassy. One of them had a gem glowing red hanging from their neck, one of the Beacons. While not as dangerous as Moonfeather's lackeys, as long as you were prepared, they were being quite the pain for Skystar's resistance when they caught hippogriffs who weren't. Their voices were just as dangerous as the sirens' themselves.\n\n"Hey, what are you doing here?!"\n\nSeaside looked over where the hiss had come from to see another hippogriff standing behind the opposite corner, glaring at him. He recognized him instantly; back during when the Resistance factions had still been united, he had seen him with Crack Lightning and Aris First. "I could ask the same thing of you!" Seaside whispered back.\n\n"Me? I'm scouting the tunnel to Seaquestria, obviously! We need to get messages to our cells in Seaquestria, but it's gotten hard recently with all the guards all across Aris."\n\n"That makes two of us," Seaside muttered. "Maybe if you dolts hadn't gotten captured going through the pathways, they wouldn't have increased security!"\n\n"Us?" The Aris First member looked indignant. "It's you Harmonists who were too sloppy! A blind seapony could have followed you from the trails you left behind!"\n\n"Well at least we don't throw ourselves right into the enemy like you do, you reckless buffoons!"\n\nThe Aris First hippogriff opened his beak to respond when his eyes widened in fear. The next second he was gone, grabbed by another hippogriff with glassy eyes and a blank stare.

She walked slowly, without any passion or excitement. Her once bright eyes were dull, and her expression was completely blank. She no longer had a magenta flower in her mane. The only accessory she wore now was a blood-red gem attached to her necklace.\n\nSomewhere deep inside, underneath layers of magic, the real Skystar was still there. Her existence had become a state of endless suffering. She was fully conscious of everything her body felt, heard and said, yet she was powerless to stop it. She could only watch helplessly as she was made to serve the sirens as a beacon. Sometimes she wished the sirens had chosen to execute her. It would have been a more merciful fate than this.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone approaching from behind.\n"Princess Skystar! Thank goodness you're safe. I was afraid you'd been-"\n\nAs Skystar's body turned around, the stranger saw her gem and shrieked in horror. They tried to get away, but Skystar's body was already beginning to sing. She felt the power of the sirens flow through her as the gem around her neck began to glow.\n\nThe stranger ran out of sight, but it was already too late.

She had asked to see her mother several times, but was told that Queen Novo could not have visitors in her current condition.\n\nThe blue siren, who called herself Sonata, visited frequently. She would ask Skystar about her life, her friends and family, even about Shelly and Sheldon. Occasionally Sonata would sing for the princess. In confinement she was powerless to resist the siren's voice, but she didn't seem to be experiencing any ill effects. It was almost as if Sonata genuinely wanted others to enjoy her music.\n\nSkystar's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door.

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.12.d:0 "Background: The effects of siren magic are incredibly potent, requiring only seconds of sound to reach the auditory methods of a creature before it falls under their complete control. However, this is severely limited by the fact that the sound has to be sung by the siren personally, and so through the demands of Adagio Dazzle an experiment was created in which the song was attempted to be recreated using artificial, electronic means.\n\nMethods: An unenthralled hippogriff was placed in a secure soundproof room monitored by scientific staff, who proceeded to place multiple methods of remote audio playback within the room, including speakers, a music player, a radio, and other such devices (the full list included in Appendix A). The song of the Sirens was then played through these electronic devices, and the effects upon the hippogriff were closely studied.\n\nResults: We have definitively concluded that no alternative methods exist to enthrall other creatures using the song. Every experiment to do so failed, despite our best efforts, and all evidence points to the siren having to be present and using their own natural voice and magic for the intended effect to take place.\n\nConclusion: The experiment in all purposes was a complete failure, and the idea is being scrapped on the demands of Aria Blaze to pursue further studies in magical crystals instead, which are believed to hold more promise in fields of study. Should we wish to be able to enthrall other creatures in ways other than direct song from a siren, we will have to utilize other methods to do so."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.15.d:0 "Music filled the air as hippogriffs outside the building in Canterford argued and fought, not even paying attention to the sound. But for once, it was not the music causing the fighting.\n\nBreezy Skies' claws glided over the piano keys as he continued playing the piece he composed. It wasn't that he couldn't hear the fighting out his window; the screaming, the cries of anger. But what could he do about it? He was just a musician; he was lucky enough to avoid becoming like them in the first place. Him and his talented friends got to stay inside these specially designed and guarded places to practice their craft, more like pets to a master than any sort of actual social class. Sometimes one of them got called to personally play for one of the sirens - the blue one, who had got them all together in the first place.\n\nSome considered it a rare honor. Others considered it a nightmare.\n\nPersonally, Breezy didn't know what to think about it. He did see how unfair it was, how everyone else suffered while he remained untouched. He had no delusions on who he now technically served. But shouldn't he just be grateful that he didn't join them? It was a miracle itself that he was here and not out there.\n\nSighing, he picked up his sheet music and put it on his desk. It would be a good piece in case he got called to play. After all, the siren seemed to find amusement in them being named after her, even if it had gotten it's name during her banishment."

 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.16.d:0 "REPORT: Effects of Chiropterran pacification campaign and success, compiled for Aria Blaze on request.\n\nOperation is considered a success, despite the failure to successfully capture any Lord Commander alive. Organized and unified resistance has been shattered at present moment. Known data resulting from actions taken is listed below.\n\n-Lady Commander Lunar Hail: Confirmed killed in initial pacification campaign.\n-Lady Commander Lightning Charm: Confirmed killed with Lord Commander Stone Palisade in artillery strike on fortified resistance bunker.\n-Lord Commander Eternal Eclipse: Captured, soon died of natural causes via heart attack. Son Lucent Eclipse last spotted in Zarantia.\n-Lady Commander Emerald Light: Escaped, current location estimated in Skyfall.\n-Lord Commander Autumn Breeze: Escaped, current location estimated in the River Republic with daughter, Auburn Breeze.\n\nCONCLUSION: Leadership of resistance decapitated, despite initial failures of objectives. Casualities minimal, civilians deaths negligible. Occupation forces on standby for further orders."
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.16.a:0 "Not the ideal outcome, but an acceptable one."
 
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.17.t:0 "The Hostage Queen"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.17.d:0 "The argument started like many others among the sirens; in the throne room, about the most trivial of things.\n\n"Honestly, the title is a bit much, don't you think?" Adagio said, mostly to herself as she floated in midair, the only other creature in the room being the enthralled Queen Novo. "I mean really, this whole 'monarchy' thing was never meant to last. Your use has come to an end, and well, we simply don't need you anymore-"\n\nThe door slammed open, and Aria came flying in. "Don't even think about it, Adagio," she said, almost in a warning tone.\n\n"Ugh, must you do this every time?" The siren turned to meet her approaching partner, already annoyed. "This island is ours. The Princess's games are over. All this 'Queen' is doing is taking away from our spotlight with a fake title and an illusion of power."\n\nNovo continued looking on blankly as Aria fired back. "So we're just going to give up the best leverage we have on these hippogriffs? And what if something like Skystar happens again? This will cause us nothing but possible trouble."\n\n"It won't happen again." Adagio pointed a hoof to accentuate her words. "All you do is keep doubting our own music, our own spell, when its never failed us before. Why don't you try focusing on what actually matters?"\n\n"I am, Adagio. And all I'm seeing is a petty decision because you can't stand someone else getting praise."\n\nThe two sirens stared each other down, both folding their hooves. Novo watched both impassively, having no idea that it was her fate being decided at that very moment."
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.17.a:0 "She's worthless now, strip her title and throw her out on the streets."
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.17.b:0 "We'll keep her and the crown around... just in case."
 
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.18.t:0 "Supporting "Allies""
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.18.d:0 ""What is this, Sonata?"\n\nAdagio let a single folder fall on the table, all three sirens already knowing what was in it. The blue one looked a bit sheepish; the guilt was already written all over her face. "Surprise?" she asked.\n\nBoth of the other two were fuming. "Sonata, you can't just go and steal guns and then have them disappear," Aria said, voice three notches more annoyed than her usual. "We need those, and they're mine to use. Where did you even send them to?!"\n\n"Tobuck?"\n\nBoth Adagio and Aria looked incredulous, causing Sonata to continue. "I mean, that Wallnut guy seems alright, and we need to defeat Chiropterra sometime anyway, right? If he's going to fight them now, we can at least help him out."\n\nAdagio facehoofed. "Sonata," she replied, "we still need to fight Tobuck too."\n\n"Well yeah, but Wallnut is much more fun than everyone else!"\n\nThere was no response. Aria finally let out an annoyed groan and Adagio just shook her head in disbelief. "You know what, fine," she finally said, "I don't care enough for this. Just don't do it again, alright?""
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.18.a:0 "If we're lucky, maybe it'll help him slow the Chiropterrans down?"
 
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.19.t:0 "Friends In The Strangest Places"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.19.d:0 "It wasn’t often that you could persuade Wallnut Drive to stay up late without a good party, but Soft Blot - his secretary in whom he placed great trust - had insisted that he take a trip down to the ports for this. He shivered and flexed his wings in the night air, but managed a steady trot down to the dock in which the ‘strange visitors’ had apparently weighed anchor. It was almost silent, save for the sounds of boxes being hauled out of the ship which he could now see. It seemed to be a trauler, or some other vessel that was far from military in nature; a good choice for whatever their discrete mission here was supposed to be.\n\nOne of the sailors, upon noticing the presence of the thestral, marched over in a particularly unnerving fashion. “Wallnut Drive?”\n\n“Uh... Yeah, that’d be me. You aright there? Lookin’ a little stiff.” He managed in response, utterly confused by the seemingly robotic behaviour of the curious hippogriff.\n\n“Good. We have a message for Wallnut Drive.” The creature returned, not emoting at all as it held out a note in its claw. “Read, please.”\n\nWell, he wasn’t going to say no to that.\n\n"Dear Wallnut,\n\nI hope this stuff helps out against Chiropterra, Aria told me it's really important for fighting wars. When I heard that they had attacked you and wanted to end your fun parties, I knew I had to help somehow! From what I hear those Chiropterrans are no fun at all, always so serious. Oh, but don't tell Adagio or Aria about this, they'll totally get really mad at me if they find out. Good luck, and can't wait to see you again when we get to sing in Tobuck!\n\nYour bestest friend, Sonata"\n\nOf course, he had a litany of questions upon reading this message ranging from who any of these individuals were and why these assumedly hippogriffian donors were quietly sending them materiel. But, as he looked up from the piece of paper, Wallnut realised that the messenger was already back to unloading more boxes of weaponry. The only thing he knew for certain was that this Sonata character was clearly well intentioned and that this much-appreciated shipment should be kept quiet."
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.19.a:0 ""Well, I'll pour one out for her when I get back!""
 
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.20.t:0 "Jumping Ship"
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.20.d:0 ""We've lost."\n\nIt was a painful thing to admit, but Aria was the first to say it out loud. Despite their best efforts, the forces of the sirens had been extensively pushed back, to the point where defeat appeared imminent. They had fell not by heroes or by spells, but by armies, plain and simple. The world had advanced without them, and they could not catch up in time.\n\n"So what do we do?" Sonata asked. "We can't stay here, right?"\n\n"No, we can't." Adagio agreed. "We are not getting banished again, or whatever they may have planned for us. It's time to leave."\n\nAria rolled her eyes. "Go where, Adagio? There's not exactly another nation we can just take over and try again with."\n\n"I didn't mean that! We'll retreat back under the waters, plan our next move. We have an eternity to take over this world; we can afford to be patient a little longer. But for now..." It was obvious that the siren was loath to admit it, but she finished her sentence all the same. "...we have to give up."\n\n"And what about the hippogriffs? About what we have left?"\n\nBoth other sirens shrugged at Sonata's question. "I'm sure Moonfeather will take over enough to make peace eventually," Aria remarked. "What happens with this is his problem, not ours."\n\nAnd that was that."
 hippogriff_abyss_flavor.20.a:0 "The three were not seen again."

 hippogriff_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Shocking news from the nation of [HIP.GetName], as [HIP.GetLeader] has proclaimed the successful test of a weapon thought years away. This has been corroborated by spy plane flights that recorded high levels of radiation near the uninhabited isles of Sunset Atoll.\n\nWhile technical details are classified, it appears the weapon used a fission reaction to kick-start a fusion reaction in a shell of tritium and deuterium outside it, creating a blast in the megaton range. What this may mean for the world is unclear, but one thing is certain: the power of the sun is now in mortal fins."

 hippogriff_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, Queen Novo appointed the leaders of the controversial Aris First movement, Crack Lightning and Raft Wood, to lead the military and internal security forces of [HIP.GetName], entrusting them with sweeping powers to keep Hippogriffia safe from threats and foreign influence. Already the pair have moved to sever ties with their neighbours and with Equestria, who Aris First has accused of taking advantage of Hippogriffia. While the movement claims to support Harmony, there are many who view them as xenophobic and authoritarian, and fear the worst is yet to come."

 hippogriff_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Amid an escalating conflict between the monarchy and the workers of Mount Aris and Seaquestria, Queen Novo of Hippogriffia has been forced to abdicate during a communist uprising in the capital. After formally abolishing the monarchy and securing the country, the revolutionaries formed a Supreme Workers' Council which appointed the eccentric firebrand named Posada to be General Secretary. The new name of the country, "Revolutionary North Zebrica," sends a strong signal that they aim to crush the capitalists of their region and bring the revolution internationally."

 hippogriff_news.4.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Ever since Hippogriffia's defeat in the North Zebrica War, observers have been predicting the fall of the country's communist government. Now General Secretary Posada has finally lost control, but her successors are proving to be even more eccentric than her. [HIP.Capital.GetName] is in the fins of an anarchist group whose support comes from traditionally isolationist Seaquestria.

 hippogriff_news.5.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Concerning news has come out of the island nation of Hippogriffia in Zebrica, as out of nowhere civil war has erupted in the once stable nation. Hippogriffs, calling themselves the "Cultists of the Abyss" have taken up arms against Queen Novo and the rest of the country, who in turn have rallied against the cultists. The aims of the revolutionaries are not yet clear, though their tendencies of violence and conflict remain unnerving to many both in the country and region."

 hippogriff_news.6.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The world stands in shock and terror today, for the once-harmonic nation of Hippogriffia has come under control of creatures many historians are referring to as "Sirens". Though reports are still scarce, it appears that the native population of Hippogriffs and Seaponies are being held in check through mind control, projected through the voices of their new masters.\n\nThe three sirens have already sworn vengeance against Equestria, who originally banished them from existence according to ancient texts.

In an address to the citizens of [HIP.GetName], [HIP.GetLeader] stated that Hippogriffia was back on the world stage, and that they would defend their values and their interests by force if necessary. With their already powerful navy and their tremendous industrial capacity now turning to military production, it seems entirely possible that [HIP.GetName] will become the dominant power in North Zebrica."
 hippogriff_news.7.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In an overwhelming majority, the Revolutionary North Zebrican Supreme Workers' Council voted today to enact an ambitious rearmament plan and to permanently reject the isolationism of the past.

 HIP_coral_ridge_desc:0 "Born in a small village in Seaquestria, it was clear from a young age that Coral Ridge would become a writer. He started out small, writing news articles for the local school paper, and eventually worked his way up through local newspapers until he became Head Writer for Seaquestria's largest newspaper, the Daily Fish. He is widely complimented for his soothing and inspiring writing style, especially in his weekly columns where he criticises militarisation and the polarisation of Hippogriffian politics."
 HIP_raft_wood_idea:0 "Raft Wood"
 HIP_raft_wood_idea_desc:0 "Raft Wood was Queen Novo's advisor during the Storm War, the seapony who first suggested the evacuation to Seaquestria. He's seen as a calm voice in an uncalm age, though his status as a founding member of the Aris First committee has raised some eyebrows, and many disparage him as a symbol of weakness." 
 HIP_sunlight_rays:0 "Sunlight Rays"
 HIP_sunlight_rays_desc:0 "A veteran diplomat, Sunlight Rays has been a long-time fixture in the Hippogriff foreign service. Her smoothing-over of the incident when Princess Twilight Sparkle attempted to steal the Pearl of Transformation won her particular praise."
 HIP_sandcastle_star:0 "Sandcastle Star"
 HIP_sandcastle_star_desc:0 "A pioneering engineer, Sandcastle Star developed the procedures for building concrete structures underwater, combining careful preparation and seapony magic. She has recently taken an interest in military affairs, and is often seen puzzling over proposed layouts for trench complexes and bomb shelters."
 HIP_cloud_breeze:0 "Cloud Breeze"
 HIP_cloud_breeze_desc:0 "Cloud Breeze is a well-connected hippogriff in the armaments industry, and has spent years mapping out the complex web of supply chains which form the strengths and weaknesses of the industry. He has long advocated government assistance in building up that industry."
 HIP_switft_shell:0 "Swift Shell"
 HIP_switft_shell_desc:0 "Acting as liaison between the government and the military procurement offices, Swift Shell's quick thinking allowed the hippogriff army to prepare itself to face the Storm King during the time in Seaquestria, setting up underwater and concealed surface supply depots in preparation for the final confrontation."
 HIP_blackeyes_whitewind:0 "Blackeyes Whitewind"
 HIP_blackeyes_whitewind_desc:0 "Blackeyes Whitewind is an eccentric professor of linguistics by day and a master cryptographer by night. His advanced decoding methods keep Hippogriffia decades ahead of its enemies, but his exploits earn him little fame. To preserve secrecy, the government has never acknowledged the full extent of his activities."
 HIP_zephyr_gust:0 "Zephyr Gust"
 HIP_zephyr_gust_desc:0 "Seen as a bit of a relic by some, Zephyr Gust was once an assistant to Queen Novo's father, King Skylance, and served him throughout his twenty year reign. He is a proud traditionalist, and one of the few still alive with a real connection to that older time."
 HIP_screaming_eagle:0 "The Screaming Eagle"

 HIP_high_priests_desc:0 "Few thought church hierarchy would ever return to Aris, but a theological movement for just that had been growing for years before their reestablishment. Coral and Nimbus, despite being initially decried as puppets of Aris First, have proven themselves pillars of community and ardent defenders of faith."
 HIP_anarchist_schools:0 "Seapony Schools"
 HIP_hard_line:0 "Hard Line"
 HIP_hard_line_desc:0 "When the Arisian Revolution first started brewing, the Marksist scholar Kelp Strand adopted Hard Line as a sort of nomme de guerre. Always on the lookout for revisionism, Hard Line believes the greatest threat to the revolution will come from within: from the false comrades, from the opportunists, from those too afraid or too moralistic to bring the revolution to completion."
 HIP_salina_blue:0 "Salina Blue"
 HIP_salina_blue_desc:0 "Salina Blue was never supposed to wind up in power. A radio operator from a poor family, she became a founding member of one of Hippogriffia's first unions, the Arisian Union of Telegraphists. When the SLPA formed, Salina was chosen as its party leader. Although once a supporter of Queen Novo, the Queen's crackdown on the motor strike disillusioned her and pushed her further to the left, turning her from a constitutionalist into a republican. A popular figure even outside the SLPA, Salina was an easy choice for People's Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs. The RWP may rule Aris now, but Salina is determined to ensure it never gets its head lost in the clouds or turns its back on the workers."
 HIP_SALINA_DESC:0  "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 977 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Salina Blue was always a shy, reclusive seapony. She never wanted to rule a town, let alone all of Aris. But fate, it seems, had other things in mind for her. Before the final battle with the Storm King she met Fluttershy, Element of Kindness, and she came away more confident and self-assured, though still shy.\n\nA radio operator from a poor family, she came to read the works and deeds of Alexander Kemerskai, Théodore Vérany, Caramel Marks, and even the peasant revolts throughout history. Realizing that a better life was not only possible but achievable, she became a founding member of one of Hippogriffia's first unions, the Arisian Union of Telegraphists, and served in Posada's government.\n\nWith the loss of Zumidia and the collapse of Posada's revolutionary government, a new one has been instituted: republican, not revolutionary. The Workers' Republic of Aris may not be as visionary or future-minded as Revolutionary North Zebrica, but it will hopefully prove more stable and long-lasting.\n\nSalina may lack her predecessor's fiery rhetoric and ferocious dreams, but is determined to do the best for all the people of Aris and lead the nation into a brighter future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Venva"
 HIP_skystar_idea:0 "Skystar"
 HIP_skystar_idea_desc:0 "Commissar, Commodore, Princess: Skystar has had many titles, and there are some who whisper she got them solely because of the General Secretary's favouritism. Any who know her know that's only half the story. Skystar is brash, impulsive, principled, and brilliant. While she is not the most rigorous Marksist, she helps guide Posada through the most difficult decisions she has to make, always arguing for kindness and mercy, though never for surrender."

 HIP_azrael:0 "Azrael"
 HIP_azrael_desc:0 "Having documented the devastation of the Storm King and the Chiropterran conquests, Azrael has come to believe that joining Hippogriffia is essential for Zumidia's survival, but that the Hippogriffs underestimate both the extent of economic assistance Zumidia needs and the threat posed by their warmongering neighbours.

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenage years. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would stargaze while contemplating if there were creatures on other worlds. It was on one such night she accidentally drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes, images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw how stars burned. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could. Now with the RWP in power, the interstellar revolution is upon creaturekind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_SAD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: "Everything I did, I did for the revolution."\n\nPosada has believed in the promise of communism for years, and has seen with her own eyes how it benefits the world. But little by little, her idealism has cracked. Reactionaries, once met with rehabilitation, gradually became imprisoned for life and later simply shot.\n\nThe world looks grimmer every day, and the rare rays of light in her life gradually distanced themselves from her, as if fearing being contaminated themselves. Few indeed are the associates she genuinely enjoys the company of anymore, and fewer still the creatures who say what she wishes they would: that she's gone too far and has to stop. \n\nOceans of blood have been spilled at her directive, ruthless operations justified by the fact that this is necessary for a better world. That excuse still holds water, but it seems drier than it once did. The revolution is worth dying for, but is it truly worth massacring for?\n\nPosada knows in her heart that she has become a monster, one the Storm King would welcome with a smile as a sister-in-arms. The only thing that gives her the energy to rise from bed is the terrible knowledge that there are so many worse monsters still left to slay.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_GOODEND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Communism has won against all odds, and the dream has been fulfilled. Throughout the lands of Revolutionary North Zebrica, suffering, poverty, and scarcity are things of the past. Nuclear reactors dot the land like gemstones, powering entire cities and providing the state with an ever-growing supply of fissile material. The scientific method has been applied to politics, and government is administrated with maximum efficiency with an eye towards fairness. The stars shine as bright as the souls of the creatures building this utopia.\n\nPosada has known for years that this world was not the only to harbor life. It'd simply be impossible to have only one planet with creatures upon it. Somewhere out there, in the vast cosmos, are Star People, creatures who have moved past the troubles of reaction and violence, and formed glorious civilizations aglow amongst the constellations. \n\nRevolutionary North Zebrica, once the small state known as Hippogriffia, has become a beacon calling out to the stars. Communism has prevailed here, and grand efforts are underway to contact the astral comrades. \n\nPosada has come far from the broken madfish she once was. Her soul has crystallized with a clear purpose: to win the great war against reaction, to uplift the lives of all creatures around the world, and to reach out to the Star People and gain their aid in creating a better, more loving world.\n\nThe aliens will come - and Posada will welcome them with open fins.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_STARRYEYES_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of July, 984 in Starfield.\n\n§YBiography§!: As the youngest daughter of a lower middle-class family, Starry Eyes enjoyed a happy childhood. She loved spending time with her many friends, but she was also known to spend hours by herself engrossed in a good book. On occasion she read about politics and history, but her favorites were always works of fiction and poetry.\n\nLike many other hippogriffs, her life was upended by the Storm King's arrival in 1005. Moving underwater could have been disastrous for her family, as her parents were unable to work and there wasn't enough food and shelter to go around. However, a generous seapony invited the whole family in and shared what he had with them. Starry would never forget this random act of kindness, and it inspired her to always help creatures in need. When the Storm King was finally defeated she decided to remain in Seaquestria. She was working at a soup kitchen when she first met Posada, who convinced her to join the newly formed RWP.\n\nHer talent for organizing and her ability to make friends with everyone helped her rise through the party's ranks rapidly. By the time Posada announced her retirement, Starry had already been elected to the Supreme Workers' Council and the Presidium. Now serving as General Secretary, she is continuing most of Posada's policies while also trying to step out of her shadow. Instead of investing heavily in technological progress, Starry believes the revolution will be best served by reforming the social relations between creatures.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

 POLITICS_NOVO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of May, 944 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For the last thirty years, Aris and Seaquestria have been ruled by the steady claw -or fin- of Queen Novo. Novo's reign has been highly eventful, to say the least. Its early years were marked by completing the integration of industrial production into Hippogriffia's economy, a process started by her father King Skylance. Novo managed to soften industrialism's birth-pangs by impressing strong Harmonic values upon the industrialist class, preferring to lead by example rather than force. The second decade of her reign was marked by a long period of stability and peace, with Aris retreating from North Zebrican affairs and establishing closer ties with Equestria and New Mareland.\n\nAll that changed when the Storm King attacked. Unwilling to risk total destruction as had befallen so many other nations which had faced his wrath, Novo evacuated the population and industry of Mount Aris to the underwater realm of Seaquestria. There, she prepared for an eventual confrontation. Her fin forced by her precocious daughter and the Equestrian Elements of Harmony, Novo's forces defeated the Storm King and reclaimed Aris. However, the evacuation left deep scars, and Novo has had more and more difficulty balancing the needs of her creatures: seaponies and hippogriffs clash and the new generation of industrialists abandons Harmonic values in the name of profit, all while the new generation of workers and students turn to radical ideas.\n\nThroughout her long reign, Novo has proven herself a master of negotiation, or some would say concession. She has proven herself a pragmatic ruler, or some would say a coward. She has been a rock of stability in a rapidly changing world, or some would say she has held Hippogriffia back. Some whisper that she plans to retire in favour of her daughter Skystar, others long for a change of pace, but most Arisians simply could not imagine an Aris without Queen Novo.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
 CRACK_LIGHTNING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of February, 977 in Harmonizing Heights.\n\n§YBiography§!: If you'd asked anygriff what Crack Lightning's future held after his rise to fame as an ace pilot in the Storm War, none would have guessed he planned on becoming the voice of the Aris First nationalist movement, much less the supreme commander of Aris' armed forces or the de facto ruler of Hippogriffia.\n\nFew now remember that Crack Lightning opposed the move to Seaquestria following the Storm King's arrival, nor that until his rise to fame he had never particularly cared for traditionalism, for all of that has been wiped away by the bombastic fervour of his commitment to Aris First after his round-the-world flight.\n\nPassionate, young, aggressive, adventurous, seductive, he was everything Aris First needed to contrast the stoic Raft Wood and to rile up the youth into a nationalistic frenzy. Few suspected that his ambitions went far beyond the isolationism of his colleague, and those that did notice found their objections falling on deaf ears as his influence grew and his followers grew more zealous. Now with Raft Wood out of the picture, Hippogriffia is under the full control of Crack Lightning, and there is little doubt that "The Ace," as his followers call him, will put the country's considerable might towards creating the Hegemony he dreams of.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 RAFT_WOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of June, 950 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Advisor, populist, nationalist, disgrace, leader. Raft Wood has been many things over the years, rising through Novo's court to become one of her chief advisors during the difficult days of the Storm King. It was his idea to migrate the hippogriff population to Seaquestria, and in the aftermath of the triumphant Storm War he saw his influence fade.\n\nBlamed for everything that went wrong during the isolation, called a coward by hippogriffs and foreigners alike, Raft Wood lost his influence in the court but never his faith in Queen Novo or Hippogriffia. His waning period turned out to be a cocoon, from which emerged a transformed Raft Wood: reaffirming everything he believed in, he masterminded the nationalist Aris First movement alongside ace pilot Crack Lightning, becoming the first to bring mass politics to Hippogriffia.\n\nA vocal supporter of the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee and the superiority of the Arisian way of life, Raft Wood found his fortunes rising as nationalism and Harmony blended together in the popular consciousness and, eventually, the law of the land in Hippogriffia. When Novo appointed him chairpony of the AHAC and granted him and Crack Lightning extensive emergency powers, Raft Wood expected to comfortably lead Aris into a new era free of foreign influence.\n\nTo his dismay, he soon found himself dragged into two conflicts: the raging North Zebrican War on the one fin, and a shadow conflict with his former compatriot Crack Lightning on the other, who intended to use Raft Wood's movement to transform Aris into a fascist dictatorship. With Lightning exposed and apprehended, Raft Wood stands as the leader of [HIP.GetName], nothing stands in Raft Wood's way of pursuing a strong, united, and pure Aris, save perhaps his own nagging doubts at how deeply Crack Lightning's venomous ideology has seeped into his followers.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 HIP_RAZORBEAK_LEADER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of December, 971 in Winggarden.\n\nA harsh and demanding officer, Colonel Razorbeak has spent most of her career as an instructor at Hippogriffia's military academies, attempting to weed out weakness among future officers. Her involvement in the Phalanx, once considered a career-limiting move, led her into Crack Lightning's inner circle during his brief rule as dictator of Aris. Even when the rest of the Phalanx turned on him, Razorbeak remained loyal.\n\nLightning's assassination and the bloody fighting which followed has seen Razorbeak take over as Supreme Commander of Aris, unleashing her signature cold-hearted violence on those who failed The Ace. She now rules with an iron claw, seeking to weed out weakness among the entire Hippogriff race in the same way she once did to cadets at the academy, now completely unrestrained by law and oversight. The people of Aris once called Crack Lightning a tyrant, but Razorbeak is determined to show them real tyranny, and to mould the next generation into a nation of fanatics who will succeed where their parents failed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

 
 HIP_SIR_ADAGIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAdagio Dazzle is the leader of the three sirens, and for good reason. Even without magic her voice carries with it a stunning amount of charisma, and her elaborate plans are both long and rarely ever fail. Yet despite that she is extremely egotistical and controlling even compared to her fellow sirens, and believes that only she can lead the three to their rightful places as the masters of the entire world.\n\nAdagio believes everything can be solved using their magic and their voices, a sentiment not exactly shared with her partners. She sees Aria as too distracted by her "what ifs" and a constant annoyance due to her constant fights with Sonata, who she sees as a loose cannon at best and an active hinderance at worst. Still, she works with them for a shared dream and her birthright; for everyone in this world to adore her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_ARIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAria Blaze is the serious and level-headed member of the sirens, being a stark contrast to her partners and their eccentricity. While being just as capable of manipulation as Adagio, Aria concerns herself more with what could happen, no matter how unlikely those situations could be. Her plans and backup plans are thorough and numerous, which could even be described as paranoia in some cases.\n\nHaving learned of the new world and the vast differences from the old, Aria is a proponent of less-magical solutions to problems she and the others come across, seeing them as more reliable than continuing to trust in their magic never failing after her banishment. While she does listen to Adagio, she sees her fellow siren as too obsessed with world domination and egotistical to see the possibility of their plans falling apart, and Aria's annoyance with Sonata's carefree attitude has led to many an argument. Still, she works with them side by side, for Aria knows that her fellow sirens are the only creatures she can trust completely.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_SONATA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nSonata Dusk is an outlier among the three, severely lacking in any sort of skill regarding intentional manipulation. Often forgetful and ditzy, Sonata legitimately enjoys music of all kinds, including music being played by others. She hates boredom, and prefers doing things and being in the moment, as opposed to the other two with their long plans and eyes on the future.\n\nSonata frequently gets into arguments with Aria over trivial matters, which constantly results in Adagio having to intervene in their pointless arguments. This has led to Sonata seeing Aria as "no-fun", and Adagio as the leader with the evil plans. The result of this has been her being the siren most involved with the enthralled population, preferring to get away from her partners often when possible and occasionally unwittingly doing something useful in the process. Despite it all, though, she still cares about the trio and does whatever she can to help, even if it isn't always useful.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_sunset_shimmer_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: March 23rd, 974, in Tall Tale\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Shimmer, many said, was destined for greatness. Having a natural talent at magic even before she gained her cutie mark, her unique skills and ambition eventually caught the eye of the Princess herself. But although Sunset was proud to be her one and only protege, both her hubris and aspirations knew no limits, and she soon became discontent with the progress she made in her studies. After an incident involving a magical mirror, Celestia was forced to expel her, though she escaped into an alternate world using the mirror as a portal.\n\nYears later, Sunset Shimmer returned to steal the Element of Magic from Princess Twilight during her visit to the Crystal Empire. Fleeing back into the portal with the Element, Twilight was forced to chase after her, with Spike as her only company. Nopony quite knows what happened while they were gone, but Twilight eventually emerged with her crown secured, and stated that Sunset was in good hands.\n\nFor many years, she went unnoticed and unremembered by many. But that all changed when Equestria came under attack, and Harmony itself was threatened. Gaining an official role in the Equestrian Armed Forces, Sunset Shimmer led armies into battle with the same confidence she always had in life; defending her friends and her homeland from anyone who would have seen it fall.\n\nBut fall it did. Despite her best efforts, Equestria was defeated by none other than the ancient sirens. And yet, she retains her position as a talented military commander for a single reason; her complete obedience helps keep the Element Bearers in line. Some say she is the same she's always been - others believe her odd moments are her true personality trying to break free from the spell. Either way, she remains nothing more than a puppet on a string; a marionette playing someone else's game.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

storm_creatures:0 "Storm Creatures"
storm_creatures_desc:0 "Recognisable amongst other yetis for their masks and imposing stature, ‘storm creatures’ are a unique subspecies of yeti that remain enigmatic in their precise nature to this day. Silent, unflinching and possessing strength great enough to overturn motor vehicles; there are few foes more deadly than this proficient warrior caste."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures1:0 "Specialised Storm Creature Equipment"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures1_desc:0 "Though the Storm King preferred to equip his personal guard with melee weapons, it was readily apparent even then that their traditional armour and aesthetically pleasing polearms were not suited to modern theatres of war. Whilst they still excel in close quarters thanks to their size, to be a truly effective force on the battlefield we must provide them with appropriately sized firearms and specialised armour for them to remain tactically relevant and strategically beneficial."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures2a:0 "Anti-Materiel Squad Weapons"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures2a_desc:0 "Yetis might be big, but storm creatures are bigger. They may not be as tall, naturally hunched in posture as they are, but in mass and raw strength they easily take the cake and most likely your life too. Thanks to this brawn, they are capable of wielding firearms that most creatures would only use when mounted or otherwise assisted. It’s high time we let them explore the applications of these automatic anti-materiel weapons."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures2b:0 "Disruptive Colouration Armour"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures2b_desc:0 "Iconic as the traditional armour of the kingdom may be, it’s not exactly subtle or indeed effective for camouflage in any way. Whilst we will retain the original design in cases where our image is more important than our combat effectiveness, the time for change has come. Disruptive colouration camouflage has proven to be very effective even at close ranges and will provide a significant tactical advantage to our soldiers."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures3:0 "Shockstorm Detachments"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures3_desc:0 "The basic idea of shock or assault troops is nothing new; even during the long semi-tribal era of yetikind it was understood that putting your most talented and best trained troops at the front of an attack - where the fighting would be most vicious - made sense. The concept of shockstorm detachments as the first storm creatures within an individual division to attack and disorganise an enemy before the rest of the division closes to engage is a sensical tactical evolution."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures4a:0 "Crystals From the Eye"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures4a_desc:0 "Although yetikind possesses no natural magic or affinity for its study, the ancients have blessed us with both a sizable and notably powerful crystal field. The deposits are gargantuan and our weapons hunger for higher quality energy sources. A match made in the aether, if there ever was one. All we need to do now is make sure the soldiery is properly prepared for the firepower and the no doubt substantial recoil increase."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures4b:0 "Concentric Combined Arms Defences"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures4b_desc:0 "Defence in depth is by no means a wholly effective strategy on its own. It relies on the proper application of resources and equipment, effective strongpoints, tactically advantageous fortifications, minefields and tank traps and of course logistics. Each layer of a defensive operation must be - to an extent - an effective combined arms force that is fully combat capable in its own right, supplemented further by the next layer of defences behind it."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5a:0 "Independent Creature Command"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5a_desc:0 "An independent yet subordinate command structure for storm creatures should resolve many of the communication issues currently being experienced in the armed forces. Aside from avoiding the debacle of getting creatures to ‘speak’ over a radio, an almost wholly separate command structure will allow for divisions of storm creatures to operate with greater effectiveness by enabling far greater autonomy at a tactical level."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5b:0 "Living Ram Tactics"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5b_desc:0 "Close quarters combat is typically not the kind of combat you want to be in with a tank, but storm creatures have a trick up their sleeve for just such an occasion. Thanks to their size and incredible strength, they can charge right on up to a tank in decently sized groups and just flip them over. Well, so long as your enemies aren't using super heavy tanks of course; but who would be so shortsighted as to attempt that sort of military-industrial self-sabotage?"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5c:0 "Noise Camouflage"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5c_desc:0 "Owing once more to their size, storm creatures struggle to maintain their usually quiet movement when on the hunt in non-flat terrain. Using short barrelled infantry support artillery at relatively short ranges to mask both attacks and retreats will help to surmount this considerable disadvantage. The additional firepower from this equipment will also be generally appreciated and this equipment is small enough, relatively speaking, to be carried on the backs of only a few creatures."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5d:0 "Anti-Air Weapon Sights"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5d_desc:0 "Using rifles or even fully automatic weapons against aircraft is far from an entirely effective strategy even at the best of times, but it has been occasionally noted that with a clean hit yeti weaponry is very capable of disabling an aircraft in a single shot. This is almost entirely a result of the larger calibres we use relative to our contemporaries and the energy behind the bullets fired. A single hit might be improbable, but if you only need to hit them once..."



tech_yeti_air_warfare1:0 "First Up and Last Out"
tech_yeti_air_warfare1_desc:0 "Even during the days of slow-moving Storm-era airships, weapon operators were known for having a certain thirst for adrenaline. That same need combined with the modern speed and agility of aircraft as well as highly motivated crews has proven invaluable in the overall performance of our airborne forces. They’re always up in the air as soon as they can be and they only come down when there are no more enemy contrails in the sky."

tech_yeti_air_warfare2:0 "Post-Collapse Airship Development"
tech_yeti_air_warfare2_desc:0 "Though many foreign ‘experts’ proclaim the brief era of airship warfare to be over, we are not so bold as to make that claim. Bulkheads and the interweaving of helium airbags has drastically improved the survivability of our favoured aircraft whilst improved weapon mountings have turned each vessel into a veritable airborne weapons platform. On top of all this, primitive magitech rocket motors allow these behemoths to travel at previously unthinkable speeds when needed."

tech_yeti_air_warfare2_bba:0 "Post-Collapse Airship Development"

medium_airship_airframe_yeti_short:0 "Augmented Medium Airship"
medium_airship_airframe_yeti_desc:0 "This design is - technically - a retrofit of the airships originally used by the Storm King in his plundering spree, but little remains that would remind an occupant of its origin. The engine takes up most of the space where the captain’s quarters originally were and the weapon mountings have required the gutting of the once ornate interior. Amazingly, there is still space for the crew in spite of the extensive modifications."

heavy_airship_equipment_yeti_short:0 "Augmented Heavy Airship"
heavy_airship_equipment_yeti_desc:0 "This mechanical monstrosity is the result of a total redesign of the Storm King’s old vessels. It rivals a modern battleship in dimensions and possesses an equivalent amount of firepower in mounted weapons and loaded ordinance. Unlike its smaller counterpart, the crew spaces within this behemoth are quite spacious and comfortable; but the metal walls will not protect your ears from the thunder of its guns."

medium_plane_fighter_airframeairship_airframe_yeti_short:0 "Augmented Medium Interceptor Airship"
yeti_engine_4x:0 "Medium Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_4x_desc:0 "This specialised engine is - to say the least - dangerous. Thanks in part to its size and its crystal-reliant design, it courses with energies that make our fur stand on end; which is somewhat disconcerting even at the best of times. Nevertheless, these noisy beasts have proven an effective method of propulsion for our exceedingly heavy revised designs."
yeti_engine_6x:0 "Large Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_6x_desc:0 "The middle sibling in the new engine family is also the most reliable of the bunch, but is nevertheless a working hazard. This is a motor that you would not want to stand behind. The blue rocket exhaust that it throws back is hot enough to cut through layered steel plates in less than a minute and sear off fur and skin in seconds.\n\nDon’t ask how we know."
yeti_engine_8x:0 "Colossal Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_8x_desc:0 "This absurdly powerful engine is as fuel hungry as its size would imply and then some. Few engineers are willing to even get close to this monster whilst it’s in operation, which is hardly a surprise. The crystal energies that ripple off of this enormous thing require several metres of insulation so that it doesn’t ignite the hydrogen gas bags by chance. All stand in awe of the immense power and ridiculous engineering of this motor."

tech_yeti_air_warfare3a:0 "Parachutes, Pilots and Precision"
tech_yeti_air_warfare3a_desc:0 "Although green pilots will always perform their duties with less effectiveness and at greater risk than our veteran aces, they are nevertheless valuable assets that should be protected. The universal inclusion of basic safety features and emergency training in all aircraft and for all of our pilots will increase the average rate of survival significantly and thus allow us to maintain a more consistent level of performance during extended combat operations."

tech_yeti_air_warfare3b:0 "Military Air Controllers"
tech_yeti_air_warfare3b_desc:0 "Although the civilian airline industry is so young that only a select few wealthy individuals can use that mode of transportation, we have already learned that control towers are an integral component of wing and sortie organisation. With this knowledge we can better organise our air force and avoid many logistical issues that would otherwise present themselves during the heat of a large-scale operation."

tech_yeti_air_warfare4a:0 "Hardened Interrupter Gears"
tech_yeti_air_warfare4a_desc:0 "Although dense materials like tungsten are inappropriate for the general construction of aircraft as a result of their weight, sparing use of similarly strong metals in critical parts like interrupter gears for centrally mounted weaponry would allow us to safely operate automatic weapons of higher calibres and fire rates without risk of damage to the mechanism. An improvement in firepower with few drawbacks is an improvement in aircraft performance overall."

tech_yeti_air_warfare4b:0 "Gyroscopic Turret Mountings"
tech_yeti_air_warfare4b_desc:0 "Although these ‘ball’ turrets have proven to be a rather difficult system to operate - and one that is more than capable of inducing severe nausea - they have nevertheless proven immensely effective in properly trained hands. The incredibly wide firing arcs that they provide in tandem with seamless movement in most directions enables a very effective form of point defence against enemy fighters and interceptors."

tech_yeti_air_warfare5a:0 "Command Vehicle Radio Integration"
tech_yeti_air_warfare5a_desc:0 "Traditionally, radios fitted in vehicles have been used to communicate with other ground vehicles according to division and further sub groupings for ease of communication. Extending this concept with separate long wave radios that allow for communication between commanding vehicles and air support in operational ranges will allow for more effective communication during fire support missions and may allow for more accurate deployment of munitions."

tech_yeti_air_warfare5b:0 "Payloads of Scale"
tech_yeti_air_warfare5b_desc:0 "In all other cases thus far, the size of a yeti has been generally detrimental to the agility and profiles of most aircraft; but bombers merely require lift and a large internal space to perform their function. Abandoning the prior design philosophies will allow the relative size of our bomber aircraft to be truly beneficial from a strategic point of view, although they may require larger escort wings if we want to provide the enemy with much larger targets."

tech_yeti_air_warfare6:0 "Rapid Deployment Procedures"
tech_yeti_air_warfare6_desc:0 "The most prohibitive factor in aircraft deployment is the lack of appropriate airstrips and the costs associated with creating them. Streamlining the processes surrounding the creation of air bases, both on land and sea, will drastically improve our currently limited deployment capacity. Moreover, additional drills to improve the speed at which pilots can prepare and launch their aircraft will allow for far more responsive sorties."



tech_yeti_land_warfare1:0 "Legacy of Prolonged Warfare"
tech_yeti_land_warfare1_desc:0 "Though the Storm King was the first to take a large-scale war beyond our borders, the yeti cultural relationship with war goes back aeons. We have fought each other and our neighbours for centuries, never truly being at peace with ourselves or the creatures that surround us. We know war. We live war. Many even love war. It is not something to be feared, rather it is something to be proud of and more beyond that if you serve in such conflicts."

tech_yeti_land_warfare3b:0 "Intimidating Equipment Design"
tech_yeti_land_warfare3b_desc:0 "TODO - the storm king did imposing aesthetics right, even if he tried to give his personal guard melee weapons. Combine that with the large average size of a yeti and voila, slightly fewer creatures are shooting at you."

tech_yeti_land_warfare4:0 "Proliferation of Basic Medical Knowledge"
tech_yeti_land_warfare4_desc:0 "TODO - Being big makes you a big target. There isn't much of a way around that, but measures can be taken to lessen our higher-than-worldwide-average casualty rate"

tech_yeti_land_warfare5:0 "Remote Plant Construction"
tech_yeti_land_warfare5_desc:0 "TODO - The yeti constitution and their ability to function well in almost any climate allows for the efficient use of more remote (and more environmentally detrimental) plants that don't care how much flouride waste they produce since you can just dump it in the mountains"

tech_yeti_land_warfare6a:0 "The Certainty of Steel"

tech_yeti_land_warfare7b:0 "Dig Deep, Dig Fast"

tech_yeti_land_warfare8a_desc:0 "TODO - Having mastered the production of these armoured behemoths, we can gradually begin to encourage commanders to use them in riskier maneuvres without risking weeks of production time"

tech_yeti_land_warfare8b:0 "Beehive Battery Organisation"

tech_yeti_land_warfare9:0 "The Yeti Spirit of Innovation"

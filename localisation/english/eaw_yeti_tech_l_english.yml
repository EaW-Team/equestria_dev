storm_creatures:0 "Storm Creatures"
storm_creatures_desc:0 "Recognisable amongst other yetis for their masks and imposing stature, ‘storm creatures’ are a unique subspecies of yeti that remain enigmatic in their precise nature to this day. Silent, unflinching and possessing strength great enough to overturn motor vehicles; there are few foes more deadly than this proficient warrior caste."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures1:0 "Specialised Storm Creature Equipment"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures1_desc:0 "Though the Storm King preferred to equip his personal guard with melee weapons, it was readily apparent even then that their traditional armour and aesthetically pleasing polearms were not suited to modern theatres of war. Whilst they still excel in close quarters thanks to their size, to be a truly effective force on the battlefield we must provide them with appropriately sized firearms and specialised armour for them to remain tactically relevant and strategically beneficial."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures2a:0 "Anti-Materiel Squad Weapons"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures2a_desc:0 "TODO - Storm creature weaponry is big, larger calibres wielded by beasts that can shrug off the recoil means potential for more dangerous automatic fire. 20mm GPMG, anyone?"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures2b:0 "Disruptive Colouration Armour"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures2b_desc:0 "TODO - Camo important, storm era armour bad at bleding in. New armour has camo paint that uses disruptive colouration techniques to make otherwise massive storm creatures significantly harder to see"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures3:0 "Shockstorm Detachments"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures3_desc:0 "TODO - An evolution of the existing strategic role of storm creatures in maneuvre warfare, proper use of combined arms and infiltration tactics (the idea of a storm creature being able to sneak is hilarious, but perfectly feasible) should allow them to operate with even greater efficiency"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures4a:0 "Crystals From the Eye"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures4a_desc:0 "TODO - does what it says on the tin, takes crystals mined from under the storm king's big ol' fortress and uses them in weapons cause they've got a little extra oomph to em\n\n"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures4b:0 "Combined Arms Concentric Defences"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures4b_desc:0 "TODO - Employing layered defences involving all kinds of ground troops. Hull down tanks half buried in mud, layers of AT, AA and anti personel weaponry with trenches and strongpoints of concentrated support fire\n\n"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5a:0 "Independent Creature Command"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5a_desc:0 "TODO - Allowing storm creatures to operate under a command structure seperate to that of the armed forces will provide the best opportunities for them to make breakthroughs via rapid deployment and quick decisionmaking"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5b:0 "Living Ram Tactics"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5b_desc:0 "TODO - Close quarters combat is the typically not the kind of combat you want to be in with a tank, but storm creatures have a trick up their sleeve for just such an occasion. Thanks to their size and incredible strength, they can charge right on up to a tank in decently sized groups and just flip them over. Well, so long as your enemies aren't using super heavy tanks anyway."

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5c:0 "Noise Camouflage"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5c_desc:0 "TODO - Owing once more to their size, storm creatures are not particularly quiet beasts. Using short barrelled support artillery to mask both attacks and retreats will help to surmount this considerable disadvantage"

tech_yeti_storm_creatures5d:0 "Anti-Air Weapon Sights"
tech_yeti_storm_creatures5d_desc:0 "TODO - using rifles or even fully automatic weapons against aircraft is far from an entirely effective strategy at the best of times, but it has become apparent that with the proper support yeti weaponry is very capable of disabling an aircraft in a single shot as a result of the larger calibres used. A hit might be improbable, but if you only need to hit them once..."



tech_yeti_air_warfare1:0 "First Up and Last Out"
tech_yeti_air_warfare1_desc:0 "TODO - importance of air warfare cannot be understated, we were beaten once but never shall be again etc etc; will to get up there and not come down till the job's done"

tech_yeti_air_warfare2:0 "Post-Collapse Airship Development"
tech_yeti_air_warfare2_desc:0 "Though many foreign ‘experts’ proclaim the brief era of airship warfare to be over, we are not so bold as to make that claim. Bulkheads and the interweaving of helium airbags has drastically improved the survivability of our favoured aircraft whilst improved weapon mountings have turned each vessel into a veritable airborne weapons platform. On top of all this, primitive magitech rocket motors allow these behemoths to travel at previously unthinkable speeds when needed."

medium_airship_airframe_yeti_short:0 "Augmented Medium Airship"
medium_airship_airframe_yeti_desc:0 "This design is - technically - a retrofit of the airships originally used by the Storm King in his plundering spree, but little remains that would remind an occupant of its origin. The engine takes up most of the space where the captain’s quarters originally were and the weapon mountings have required the gutting of the once ornate interior. Amazingly, there is still space for the crew in spite of the extensive modifications."

heavy_airship_equipment_yeti_short:0 "Augmented Heavy Airship"
heavy_airship_equipment_yeti_desc:0 "This mechanical monstrosity is the result of a total redesign of the Storm King’s old vessels. It rivals a modern battleship in dimensions and possesses an equivalent amount of firepower in mounted weapons and loaded ordinance. Unlike its smaller counterpart, the crew spaces within this behemoth are quite spacious and comfortable; but the metal walls will not protect your ears from the thunder of its guns."

yeti_engine_4x:0 "Medium Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_4x_desc:0 "This specialised engine is - to say the least - dangerous. Thanks in part to its size and its crystal-reliant design, it courses with energies that make our fur stand on end; which is somewhat disconcerting even at the best of times. Nevertheless, these noisy beasts have proven an effective method of propulsion for our exceedingly heavy revised designs."
yeti_engine_6x:0 "Large Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_6x_desc:0 "The middle sibling in the new engine family is also the most reliable of the bunch, but is nevertheless a working hazard. This is a motor that you would not want to stand behind. The blue rocket exhaust that it throws back is hot enough to cut through layered steel plates in less than a minute and sear off fur and skin in seconds.\n\nDon’t ask how we know."
yeti_engine_8x:0 "Colossal Magitech Rocket Motor"
yeti_engine_8x_desc:0 "This absurdly powerful engine is as fuel hungry as its size would imply and then some. Few engineers are willing to even get close to this monster whilst it’s in operation, which is hardly a surprise. The crystal energies that ripple off of this enormous thing require several metres of insulation so that it doesn’t ignite the hydrogen gas bags by chance. All stand in awe of the immense power and ridiculous engineering of this motor."

tech_yeti_air_warfare3a:0 "Parachutes, Pilots and Precision"
tech_yeti_air_warfare3a_desc:0 "TODO - better training, proper survivability measures for pilots and just a tad of propaganda to get more recruits results in better aces and better survivability"

tech_yeti_air_warfare3b:0 "Military Air Controllers"
tech_yeti_air_warfare3b_desc:0 "TODO - organising and optimising the performance of groups of military aircraft continues to be difficult, installing radios in commanding aircraft and linking them on long distance frequences to radio towers for direction and updates to orders"

tech_yeti_air_warfare4a:0 "Hardened Interrupter Gears"
tech_yeti_air_warfare4a_desc:0 "TODO - sparing use of incredibly high strength metals in the mechanical workings of the synchronisation mechanism allows for the safe mounting of automatic weapons with higher fire rates where otherwise the gearing would shake itself apart\n\n"

tech_yeti_air_warfare4b:0 "Gyroscopic Turret Mountings"
tech_yeti_air_warfare4b_desc:0 "TODO - Despite the motion sickness this development is renowned to cause, utilising gyroscopes in conjunction with electric motors to create highly reactive turret mountings has proven immensely beneficial to the average survival rate of our aircraft\n\n"

tech_yeti_air_warfare5a:0 "Command Vehicle Radio Integration"
tech_yeti_air_warfare5a_desc:0 "TODO - traditionally radios fitted in vehicles have been used to communicate with other ground vehicles according to division and further sub groupings for ease of communication. Extending this concept with separate long wave radios that allow for communication between commanding vehicles and air support in range will allow for more effective communication during fire support missions"

tech_yeti_air_warfare5b:0 "Payloads of Scale"
tech_yeti_air_warfare5b_desc:0 "TODO - In all other cases thus far, the size of a yeti has been generally detrimental to the agility and profile sizes of aircraft; but bombers merely require lift and a large internal space to perform their function. Abandoning the prior design philosophies will allow the relative size of our bomber aircraft to be truly beneficial"

tech_yeti_air_warfare6:0 "Rapid Deployment Procedures"
tech_yeti_air_warfare6_desc:0 "TODO - The most prohibitive factor in aircraft deployment is a lack of appropriate airsctrips and the costs associated with creating them. Streamlining the processes surrounding the creation of air bases, both on land and sea, will drastically improve our currently limited deployment capacity"



tech_yeti_land_warfare1:0 "Legacy of Prolonged Warfare"
tech_yeti_land_warfare1_desc:0 "TODO"

tech_yeti_land_warfare2a:0 "Commitment to Horizontal Cohesion"

tech_yeti_land_warfare2b_desc:0 "TODO - beeg creatures, beeg strong tools"

tech_yeti_land_warfare3a:0 "Extreme Tolerance Architecture"
tech_yeti_land_warfare3a_desc:0 "TODO - needs to both account for the size of yetis and their preffered climate (freezing fucking cold)"

tech_yeti_land_warfare3b:0 "Intimidating Equipment Design"
tech_yeti_land_warfare3b_desc:0 "TODO - the storm king did imposing aesthetics right, even if he tried to give his personal guard melee weapons. Combine that with the large average size of a yeti and voila, slightly fewer creatures are shooting at you."

tech_yeti_land_warfare4:0 "Proliferation of Basic Medical Knowledge"
tech_yeti_land_warfare4_desc:0 "TODO - Being big makes you a big target. There isn't much of a way around that, but measures can be taken to lessen our higher-than-worldwide-average casualty rate"

tech_yeti_land_warfare5:0 "Remote Plant Construction"
tech_yeti_land_warfare5_desc:0 "TODO - The yeti constitution and their ability to function well in almost any climate allows for the efficient use of more remote (and more environmentally detrimental) plants that don't care how much flouride waste they produce since you can just dump it in the mountains"

tech_yeti_land_warfare6a:0 "The Certainty of Steel"
tech_yeti_land_warfare6a_desc:0 "TODO - funny mechanicus reference, but moreso leaning into their general doctrine of mobile warfare and horizontal operations\n\n"

tech_yeti_land_warfare6b:0 "Severe Inclination Training"
tech_yeti_land_warfare6b_desc:0 "TODO - applying yeti climate preferences and skill in particular terrain to artillery targeting for increased proficiency\n\n"

tech_yeti_land_warfare7a:0 "Armoured Force Concentration"
tech_yeti_land_warfare7a_desc:0 "TODO - does what it says on the tin, kill that infantry"

tech_yeti_land_warfare7b:0 "Dig Deep, Dig Fast"
tech_yeti_land_warfare7b_desc:0 "TODO - essentially slowing doctrine down somewhat and embracing the effectiveness of concentric trench fortifications with tweaks to make it more feasible for yeti size etc"

tech_yeti_land_warfare8a:0 "Break 'n' Make Doctrine"
tech_yeti_land_warfare8a_desc:0 "TODO - Having mastered the production of these armoured behemoths, we can gradually begin to encourage commanders to use them in riskier maneuvres without risking weeks of production time"

tech_yeti_land_warfare8b:0 "Beehive Battery Organisation"
tech_yeti_land_warfare8b_desc:0 "TODO - using hexagons and shit for efficient loading, firing, organisation and overall effectiveness"

tech_yeti_land_warfare9:0 "The Yeti Spirit of Innovation"
tech_yeti_land_warfare9_desc:0 "TODO - Storm king did a bunch of new shit and used it to great effect, yadda yadda revive that innovative spark in the industrial realm"

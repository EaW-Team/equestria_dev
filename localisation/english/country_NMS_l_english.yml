### Leader Descriptions ###
spiderbat_desc:0 "Having written for numerous newspapers, such as Baltimare Times, Equestria Daily, Manehattan Tribunal and even the Canterlot Inquirer, Light Narrative has made a name for himself in the Equestrian journalist circles by publishing divisive, yet factual articles on thestral rights. Despite his best intentions, the anti-batpony bias meant that he did not remain employed for long.\n\nAfter an another slump following his most recent discharge, Light Narrative traveled to the Equestrian southeast to research and report on the mysterious native tribes that inhabit its jungles. His investigation was interrupted by the civil war, which in no way did it interfere with his publishing, and he has sided with the thestral uprising to write about the successes of the Lunar garrison. Following the pacification of the region, Empress Nightmare Moon has recommended the intrepid journalist for the leadership role, believing that his moderate approach would ensure continued peace in the war torn southeast."

His investigation was interrupted by the civil war, which in no way did it interfere with his publishing, and he has sided with the thestral uprising to write about the successes of the Lunar garrison.\n\nHowever, a most unexpected surge of events has transpired. The native batponies have risen up against the foreign extremists in the service of Nightmare Moon, and declared their own independent nation. After the first Grand Conclave of the Moonspeakers, Light Narrative has been chosen as Tlatoani, the spiritual leader and inspiration for the ponies."
bat_pelley_desc:0 "Writer and occultist, Starry Glory has been infamous for his seditious speeches against the peaceful Equestrian order. The ordinary pony would have been much more sympathetic to the thestral plight if it weren't for his extremist rhetoric. Neither a ban from writing or a short prison sentence has deterred Starry Glory, although his influence waned as he became ostracised.\n\nFortunes have changed due to the civil war, which has given him the platform to propagate his thestral supremacy theory. The brutal war in the southeastern jungles has convinced the higher ups in the Lunar administration that drastic measures are needed to contain the natives, and Starry Glory was chosen to lead the new nation. He intends to transform it into a batpony paradise, which he personally calls "the Free Thestral Empire", although the name has yet find recognition within the wider populace."

NMS_standardise_military_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Currently two administrations exist in our region, the old civilian one that sided with Nightmare Moon in the civil war, and our new military administration.

NMS_formalise_military_frontier_desc:0 "While we have been granted a charter of authority by the Empress Nightmare Moon, we are not yet a true state, some still believe we are an in-between period and that civilian rule shall be restored.

NMS_military_education:0 "Militarise Education"
NMS_military_education_desc:0 "The first lessons every thestral learns should be their ABCs, serving the Empress, and how to shoot a gun. These are the principles that shall keep this region loyal and productive. The remainder are frivolities and decadent excess."
NMS_lunar_cadets:0 "Create The Lunar Cadets"
NMS_lunar_cadets_desc:0 "We should establish a youth organisation to train and teach the children of our nation about the true values of being a thestral.\nSeparate branches will be formed to teach non-thestrals about the values of working hard and how lucky they are to be ruled by such a loving Empress as well."
NMS_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
NMS_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Since our state is one with the military, we should integrate the industry into this trifecta. The industrial output of the nation shall serve to increase the capabilities of our army first of all, and the unending righteous war against the enemies of the night shall have our citizens working as hard as they can to fuel it."
NMS_mandatory_service:0 "Mandatory Military Service"
NMS_mandatory_service_desc:0 "Now that we have all these materials needed for war we simply need the ponypower to wage this war.

NMS_secret_police:0 "Organise The Night Watch"
NMS_secret_police_desc:0 "In the jungles of the south-east one of the key factors to always keep in mind is that of intelligence. What do you know versus what do your enemies know. To solve this the Lunar Empire has the IIC, we should make our own branch of the intelligence services to suit our specific needs in the jungles."
NMS_open_the_camps:0 "The Rubber Camps"
NMS_open_the_camps_desc:0 "One of the primary outputs of the south-east is rubber for cars, planes, and other products. The Imperial army has set high rubber quotas they expect to be delivered by the Military Frontier.

NMS_an_army_with_a_state_desc:0 "Here in the south east we have truly proved the superiority of military rule over all other forms.

NMS_the_riches_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "By using the material wealth of the jungles, we have effectively reversed the economic decline caused by the war over this land, and have begun to make money again. With this we can reinvest into the economy in order to make our region profitable again."
NMS_diamonds:0 "Diamond Mining"

NMS_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "Regardless of our wish to industrialise or make use of our resources, the need to create efficient means of transportation is still there.

NMS_stableside_arms_desc:0 "Stableside has long served as a self sufficient center of military power in southern Equestria, unfortunately the Lunar commander stationed there was overthrown and never got to mobilise the base for our purposes.

NMS_the_third_position_desc:0 "If this bloodshed is our future, then we want no part of it. The batponies might be Luna's favoured, but she is not our creator or our ruler, nor are we her thralls to wage battles for. We must take our future into our own hooves, for the good of all ponies in the south-east."
NMS_gather_the_tribes:0 "Unite The Tenanyotl"
NMS_gather_the_tribes_desc:0 "There are many thestral tribes in the region, each with their own agenda, and with various dialects, customs and culture. To bring together such a diverse group would be an exercise in futility, but we believe we could successfully convince them that working together is in our benefit against the outsiders."
NMS_convince_the_remnants:0 "Convince The Loyalists"
NMS_convince_the_remnants_desc:0 "Some ponies still cling to their false loyalties, believing the Nightmare to be their saviour and protector. And yet, the Nightmare has shown herself to be petty, vindictive and with little care for her subjects. Convince these stragglers that the jungle thestrals are their real family."
NMS_gather_the_moonspeakers:0 "Gather The Moonspeakers"
NMS_gather_the_moonspeakers_desc:0 "Each thestral tribe has its Moonspeaker, a religious leader in charge of the spiritual matters. They represent a tribe's culture and faith, and make many decisions for the benefit of their community. All of them must be gathered so we can decide our unified society's future, and choose an overall leader, as well."

NMS_the_big_bat_that_makes_all_the_rules_desc:0 "With the moonspeakers gathered, the grand conclave will decide who shall act as Tlatoani; king of all thestral tribes and interpreter of the Moon's will. Although the position is more ceremonial than executive, their presence will unite the nation and ensure stability."
NMS_talk_with_caballeron:0 "The Good Doctor"
NMS_talk_with_caballeron_desc:0 "The archeologist, Caballeron, remains alive after the war which tore asunder the southeast. Although not everypony is his fan, he is popular among native tribes, especially the Neighua, for his efforts in protecting their way of life. Certainly, common ground could be found."
NMS_bury_the_hatchet:0 "Bury The Hatchet"
NMS_bury_the_hatchet_desc:0 "With Caballeron on our side, we are in a much better position to negotiate a lasting peace with the native tribes, who fear the batponies. We must show them that not all thestrals are vicious and bloodthirsty, that everypony can live together in harmony regardless of their race."
NMS_religious_dialouge:0 "Hayglian Dialectics"
NMS_religious_dialouge_desc:0 "The points of contention between the thestrals and the natives are many, but the most pressing one is the matter of religion. The Neighua in their myths see the Moon as a negative influence, but the batponies rely on it as their guide through the night. We must mediate together to find a concrete solution."
NMS_embrace_bat_morality:0 "Redefine Tzinacatl Morality"
NMS_embrace_bat_morality_desc:0 "Our old morals in which thestrals are considered to be above other races is quickly becoming outdated in the rapidly expanding world. No longer do we live by ourselves, but we share a large nation with ponies of every kind, and thus our method of thinking must evolve to ensure everypony can coexist together."
NMS_encourage_a_return:0 "The Return Of The Prodigal Bats"
NMS_encourage_a_return_desc:0 "A group of ponies can make an individual pony commit acts that he wouldn't consider committing on his own. Such pressure has resulted in many batponies supporting the Nightmare even if they did not agree, out of fear. Let it be known that anypony who desires peace, can live here in the southeast."
NMS_unite_the_faith:0 "Codify The Faith"
NMS_unite_the_faith_desc:0 "With so many schisms and outright heresies spread amongst the many offshots of the thestral faith, the Tlatoani has decided it would be beneficial to put to the paper of what officially is part of the religion, and what is not. Such an effort would further our efforts in unifying the tribes, especially after casting down Luna."
NMS_moral_law:0 "The Dual Judicial System"
NMS_moral_law_desc:0 "A pony's religion can define their actions, regardless of how conventional morality would rule an action to be proper or not. In the interest of mediation, our courts must take note of the litigants' personal beliefs, and consult an expert's guidance on obtaining a fair judgement."
NMS_meet_with_the_unions:0 "Meet With Chafer"
NMS_meet_with_the_unions_desc:0 "Of the socialists who led the unsuccessful revolt, there are many differing and often contradictory ideologies. The one named Diamond Chafer is most suitable to convince the others to cooperate with us, if he himself can be persuaded. Perhaps his fondness of corn can be used in our favour."
NMS_implement_local_democracy:0 "Preserve Democratic Institutions"
NMS_implement_local_democracy_desc:0 "Although our nation can be loosely considered a kingdom, we do not operate in the traditional sense of the word. Namely, we do not seek to control every aspect of society, nor would we intervene in local politics. As long as everypony follows the law, local communities are free to manage themselves as they see fit."
NMS_encourage_communalism:0 "Encourage Communalism"
NMS_encourage_communalism_desc:0 "Ponies do not always trust each other. Natives, batponies, socialists: they all stick to their self contained groups distrustful of one another. A system of communes must be founded to encourage ponies to mingle, to share their available resources together, maintaining harmony and peace for the near future."
NMS_the_organic_kingdom:0 "The Organic Kingdom"
NMS_the_organic_kingdom_desc:0 "For the first time in centuries, the batponies have their own nation, ruled by their own laws and traditions, and free of foreign interferences.

NMS_united_army:0 "A Brand New Army"
NMS_united_army_desc:0 "For our army we must use everypony we have, natives and all. Restricting our army to just thestrals would hold us back and discard valuable ponypower that could be used."

NMS_guerilla_warfare_f_desc:0 "Hit and run tactics are easy to make use of in the jungle, and we should capitalize on this to train our entire army in some form of guerilla warfare. Our foes will come to see the jungles as Tartarus!"
NMS_decentralised_command:0 "Decentralised Command Structure"
NMS_decentralised_command_desc:0 "By holding various points of command all over the nation we can much more easily direct affairs without requiring central headquarters to issue every order.

NMS_native_officers:0 "Native Officers"
NMS_native_officers_desc:0 "During the war many members of the Coltecs and other tribes fought in our armies, we can reward them now by sending them off to train in our military schools to become full fledged generals in their own right."

NMS_decentralised_army_desc:0 "Through our reforms our army can now operate with peak efficiency in the terrain it is given, an army of those how call this land home, and who will die defending every inch of it from any enemy who would dare to threaten it."
NMS_bat_army:0 "An Army Of Bats"
NMS_bat_army_desc:0 "How could we trust these natives to do the job of a thestral?! They lack both the combat ability and the discipline needed to serve the Empress, and we should make that clear in our recruitment policy."

NMS_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "In the civil war our troops were armed with a mix of Lunar standard rifles, native weapons, hunting guns, and some shovels we found in a hole. We must make sure this never happens again by producing a standard rifle variation for everypony to call their own."

NMS_tank_f:0 "Limited Tank Implementation"
NMS_tank_f_desc:0 "Armored vehicles have been in theorising for a long time now and saw limited use during the Lunar Civil War, we should put our own efforts towards developing these steel behemoths. We certainly don't intend to have them fight in the jungles, but they can and will be deployed elsewhere in Equus."
NMS_motorized_f:0 "The Jackalope"
NMS_motorized_f_desc:0 "Using all of the rubber at our disposal it would be insane to think that we should not try to develop a motorized army branch to serve as a quick moving response force for our infantry. Unlike tanks, they can be customised more easily to adapt to the harsh terrain in the southeast."
NMS_military_rd:0 "The Army R&D Department"

NMS_battleship_f_desc:0 "The strongest and most largest warships may take years to build, but their power is unmatched and having even one to our name could make the difference in future wars.

He would get an extra ration when they got back to camp. For now though, she had to speak with the Coltec emissary. He was at the negotiating table representing not only his own tribe, but all those with a grudge against the Neighua. A tribe of natives who revered the sun in a cult like manner, and had always been hostile to the nocturnal bats, calling them "tlacatecolotl" or "demons" and always fighting against them.\n\nThis anti-Neighua league, called the "Bond of Nine Sisters" would hopefully, after today, include a tenth.

The civilized and the tribal made into one in order to serve the great Empress.\n\nAnd so as the night went on, the talks turned away from official business into chats between friends.

Then somepony saw a guard go down, not with the loud burst of a gunshot, but with the light pop of a blowdart.\n\nNeighua.\n\nBut then also came the roaring of guns and hidden mortars, no, the Neighua couldn't do this alone. This was a full Celestial attack.\n\nThe soldiers scrambled around the camp trying to throw together a defense against the loyalist forces breaking through the outer defence lines, but it was no use. As bats and pegasi clashed in the skies, while native allies on both sides battled in the ad hoc trenches that had been dug the day before regiments tried to form for counter-attacks. Command descended into madness as all of a sudden all orders from high command, or any central officers were cut off.\n\nBut soon the soldiers would know why.\n\nIt started when a mixed bat-coltec platoon would look up from their bloody hole in the ground and see the command staff, lead personally by Stars Whirl herself, with pistols, grenades, and even chair legs in hoof charging down the front of line towards the celestial mortars.\n\nOne of the Coltec let out a great cry, "Tlayacatia yoac!", meaning "They lead in the night". With this the platoon got up and followed the command staff in the charge, who had made a desperate choice after their main command tent had been hit by concentrated artillery fire. They knew they needed to break it or the entirety of Lunar army command in the south would be lost.\n\nAs the reckless charge grew closer to the main loyalist line more weakened platoons began to join them, until they turned into a wave of blood and iron that shocked the loyalists and Neighua until they entered into a retreat.\n\nBut the moment that would be the most remembered was documented by a single soldier, who after being approached by a newspaper journalist named Light Narrative, he would tell them this tale; \nWhen my company was almost entirely dead, I didn't know what much else to do, then I heard charging from the hill tops and saw the generals who lead my army, but that I had never seen, charging head first into the fray. But while I was looking I got hit in the shoulder by shrapnel and was knocked to the ground. Next thing I know I'm being patted awake, and when I opened my eyes, I saw the Marshal herself who said to me,\n\n"Hey wake up, we have an army to burn.""

They would strike at the holiest temple of the Neighua, and desecrate it forever.\n\nAnd so, when the Neighua went at sunrise to preform their rituals, sacrificing a pile of fruits, since Celestia had banned their practice of sacrificing non-believers, they were ambushed by hordes of tribal bats who at once descended on the crowd, not killing them, but dumping onto them a mixture of berries and fruits used in traditional batpony rituals that the Neighua considered the stuff of demons and nightmares. It drove them into a frenzy, fleeing from their temple while being pursued by Lunar military forces. In the chaos Night Guard commandos infiltrated into the Neighua villages and found out who was working with Celestial operatives. They would meet the bullet later.\n\nBut for now, the bats would have be content with humiliation of their greatest enemy.

As all of the voters arrive there seem to be two contenders eeking out ahead of the others.\n\nFirst, we have Starry Glory. A leader of one of the main paramilitary groups in the south-east before the civil war, he has now made an effort to attempt to lead it. He is clear who his administration is for, the thestral and only the thestral. This is favored by many of the more extreme representatives from the Lunar Empire proper but has been railed against by the chief diplomat of the Coltec tribe who sits on the voting council from Aztlan, and even some of the Lunar Empire officials, such as General Bipen who worries about the instability his policies could cause. He also seems to have some sort of relationship with the general, though no one is sure what it is exactly.\n\nOn the other hoof, is the journalist Light Narrative, famous for being an early public supporter of Nightmare Moon's early thestral campaign that was so surpressed by her sister, and then being a supporter of the Lunar revolt to serve as a way to advance the status of all the creatures of Equus. He also reported from the front lines of the war in the south-east bringing grueling tales of war and death, and most famously a tale about the great general Stars Whirl herself. Seeing the blood and conflict he has taken a conciliatory attitude towards the native peoples of the south-east but he has stated he will not fail to build a home for thestrals as well under his leadership.\n\nAnd as the council seems divided, her vote may sway others in their choice.\n\nWho does she choose?"

For now, our leader is not afraid to hold any punches.\n\nAs the natives seemed ready to storm the city from the small thestral garrison that still held the walls, charges went off from in the crowd. Only flashbangs but still enough to startle and shock. This broke the cohesion of the formerly organized crowd and caused it to split. Some ran forwards ready to take the walls, with others dispersing back into the forests. But as soon some of the natives hit the walls. Starry gave the order. "This was reason enough", he would state the next day at a press conference, for him to order the thestral units, conveniently hidden in the shrub of the forest to fly out and unleash on the crowds a hail of fire, with death tolls not yet released. The regiments would only fire once, but the chaos was enough and the natives ran in all directions.

He concluded that due to the prevalance of the sun in Neighua mythos, that their arch-rivals the Coltec developed to see the moon as their guardian.\n\nHe believes that if the Governate lent its support to these groups, and assisted them in speaking out about their Lunar worship, that many tribes could be brought around to being voluntarily loyal to the Governate.

One is the famed Dr. Caballeron, and one is the half mythical, half real story-book author Daring Do.\n\nShe shocked Equestria by coming out to lead the Celestial revolt against the Lunar military in the south-east, but eventually lost and went into hiding with some other followers. But when the governor was elected she decided to come out again and actively resist our rule. Well. It is time to show her that kindness does not mean in-action. A warrant shall be put out for her arrest.\n\nSecond, getting back to the esteemed doctor. He turned himself in after the election of the new governor declaring that he "Didn't want a ponyhunt that could hurt people." For this most agree he shall be granted a pardon, as long as he doesn't do anything else against us. There has even been a consideration of offering him a position in government, to use his credibility with the natives to boost the security of our rule.\n\nAnd then the third issue, other minor chiefs have not been so amenable.

Talking to people and trying to understand where they are coming from.\n\nThough this time it is much harder. The negotiations with the chiefs of the Neighua ended in tense standoff until an agreement was finally settled on. That would allow the Neighua to continue their beliefs, but only within their Temple of the Sun, which will be placed under government surveillance at all times.\n\nWhile this deal really makes no one "happy", it hasn't made anyone angrier, and will hopefully serve as a first step towards something bigger."

The rubber of the jungles and the gemstones of its mines can, and will serve us well if we invest into them and can guarantee income for our state, though this may keep us from having a large industry.\n\nThe second path follows that of industrialization.

A pair of batponies- one whom seemed to be in charge, the other she belatedly recognized as Light Narrative, discussed things, before the Revolutionary Officer nodded his acceptance of something, and wandered off towards the way they'd been led. Probably back towards the City Hall they were using as their capitol building. The members of Whirl's group were blindfolded, asked if they wished for a cigarette, and left to their fate.

So, here he was, aiding the moonspeakers to rally all the loose and widespread tribes of thestrals- the so-called Tenanyotl- their word for Thestral, he presumed. Most of these meetings went the same way. Narrative's troop would escort a moonspeaker or pair of moonspeakers through the jungle, so as to keep them safe from any remnant Neighua tribals fighting with his people. The local tribe would get defensive and wary of the better dressed 'foreigner' troops, as his own ponies were often thought by the Tenanyotl. The moonspeakers would make themselves known, and then the conversation would begin in earnest. Whilst unsure why exactly he was always the one brought along for these meetings, any reply to his queries to the wise old moonspeakers was often rhetorical or twisting in it's words.

However, recent events had made him... reconsider.. his position on things. With the on-going civil war for northern and central Equestria having no end in sight, perhaps it was time to revisit his roots. Especially upon hearing from his superiors that the South-East, which had successfully kicked out the Solar menace and the Baltimare Communists- as well as, by some reports, a massive band of mercenaries or something equally ridiculous. Perhaps Luna did not have, or even never did, have the moon's favor. Surely, if his fellow Tenanyotl to the South-East were successful in their war with the Sun, so should the Night Mare have been. And yet, this was not the case. However, he'd have been content to remain in the north helping his fellow Thestrals, if not for his meeting with the Thestral, Light Narrative. Narrative, who held the favor of the Moonspeakers, supposedly, had brought a pair of such revered elder Tzinacatl with him, and between the three of them, a company's worth of South-Easterners. Their goal, and their reason for crossing from the Jungle into the Lunar Empire's lands at Mareway was simple- They wished to sway their fellow Thestrals away from the Night Mare, and persuade them to join the newly formed country of Tzinacatlia- a country for Thestrals, for Tenanyotl- not for misguided politics or abusive and prideful rulers. Silver Moon, yearning already for home, was not a hard sell. And with his help, and with the help of other such swayed northern Thestrals, neither was his close friend Night Dasher, or the rest of the Mareway contingent- and later, the unit assigned to Sire's Hollow.

The conclave members that had seized the government of the South-East had, over a week ago, sent Night Runners throughout the jungles to the many southern Tzinacatl tribes, requesting their Moonspeakers finally leave their ancestral homes for the reckoning that hadn't been held in generations of Moonspeakers. Tonight, the Clearing was full, as the tribes once more met, and discussed, and meted out words. A new time was approaching the South East. One of war, yet of peace. One of conflict, yet of growth. One of Death, and yet, of life. The Conclave of Moonspeakers would fully take reigns, and begin to lead their peoples into the modern world, in the fashion of the Moonspeakers of the far past.

It is too early to say too much, but he has promised to address his "comrades" in Baltimare and see whether there can be peace between our two groups."

supporters.32.t:0 "The New Course"
supporters.32.d:0 "Humility is among the hardest things to learn. To step down from the great pedestal upon which one has placed oneself and lower oneself to stand among the others around you feels degrading, and yet this is the course that we must chart.\n\nThe Moonspeaker Conclave has spoken, decreeing that no longer shall the non-thestrals of these lands be viewed as less favored. The moon shines upon us all in equal measure, and all who live in these lands are endowed with her blessing. We may have thought we were pure, but we defied the Moon by pushing some of her children into the dirt to feel better about ourselves. No more though, for in these lands all are equal under the Moon."
supporters.32.a:0 "Have some faith!"

supporters.33.t:0 "Grizzly News"
supporters.33.d:0 "A fortuitous omen has passed through our lands recently. Stirred from her sleep by the fighting, a giant Ursa Major has been wandering through the jungle, and our people have been ecstatic in her wake.\n\nLeaving out gifts of food and drink for her, the tribes have worked to placate the sacred moon-spirit and direct her deeper into the jungle, where she may find a peaceful resting spot, and where she can be beseeched for help against our enemies. There are not many left of these Children of the Moon, and the fact that we have been blessed with the sight of one has given hope and joy both to a people who need it."
supporters.33.a:0 "Praise the Moon and the Tlatoani!"

 ### FOCUS ###
 CTH_zarcid_legacy:0 "Lean On The Zarcid Legacy"
 CTH_zarcid_legacy_desc:0 "The Zarca family is more than just a powerful political family. To many Colthaginians, the Zarcids are exemplars of the power and glory of the country's history. By invoking the family name, we will be able to appoint some loyalists to important bureaucratic positions, which should allow us some political momentum to deal with the hampered economy and the unrest in the provinces."

 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics:0 "Bread Or Stick Politics"
 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics_desc:0 "Zamilcar Zarca's bread or stick politics was an informal system of patronage. Less influential chiefs, landowners and other community leaders would get bread or other help for their people in return for backing Zamilcar whenever he needed them while those who refused would be forced out of politics. The Storm King broke a lot of these informal bonds, and it will take time to reforge them."

 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs:0 "Reintroduce Political Chiefs"
 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs_desc:0 "The regional divides of Colthaginian society are not a new phenomenon. Zamilcar Zarca dealt with this problem by assigning political chiefs, a local office used to undermine dissidents, which proved effective. When we lost political control after the Storm King's invasion, the system collapsed, but we can bring the chiefs back from retirement to reassert control over the countryside."
 
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons:0 "Reshuffle The Western Garrisons"
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons_desc:0 "Guarding the border with Hippogriff occupied Zumidia has been regarded as an easy assignment for years. The zebra in the area are usually loyal, unlike the meddlesome Coltvans. However, rumours of Zanno's return have fired up the local youth and the lazy garrison is doing nothing to stop their rallies. Replacing the garrison with veterans from Coltva will teach these foals the strength of Colthage."

 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits:0 "Crackdown On Western Bandits"
 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits_desc:0 "The lazy western garrisons have let bandits fester in the west, making us look weak and aiding Zanno Mzelqatid's movement. With real soldiers now stationed in the area, we can begin to root out the criminals and restore order to the land. Our new political chiefs will investigate bandit strongholds, so we can decisively rid ourselves of this problem."

 CTH_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify The Zumidian Border"
 CTH_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The greedy Hippogriffs are still occupying our brethren in Zumidia and tensions along the border are high. State of the art fortifications in the border provinces will serve as anchor points for our defence and bases for our inevitable assault. Aztarte, the war goddess, will not allow another inch of zebra land be conquered."

 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts:0 "Zam's Redoubts"
 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts_desc:0 "Our ports are the heart of our prosperity and the rivers the veins that spread our wealth to the rest of the people. Zam is the god who oversees this great system of life, and he does so justly. However, Zargon, Lord Under the Sea, known as The Dark One, envies Zam's wealth, striking the surface from his dark domain. Just like wise Zam, we must defend our heart from attacks out of the depths of the sea."

 CTH_fortify_the_capital:0 "Bastion Zanit"
 CTH_fortify_the_capital_desc:0 "Colthage is our home, our mother. Without her, we would be nothing. It is Zanit, the stalwart wife of Za'al, who wept when Colthage was sullied by the Storm King. Upon Zanit, Zalathel Zarca has taken a precious oath, swearing that never again our homes will be in peril. We will build a bastion that will become our sacred guardian, a true successor to our famed city walls. And Zanit will weep no more."

 CTH_appoint_zakbar:0 "Co-Sufrit Baltazar Zakbar"
 CTH_appoint_zakbar_desc:0 "Zalathel is not fond of Baltazar, who is a boring zebra, seemingly without much ambition. The old stallion's greatest joy is balancing budgets and his favourite pastime is chairing board room meetings. However, Zamilcar put great faith in him back in the day, and the commercial faction of the Scientific Clique loves him. And best of all, he can do all the paperwork."

 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_desc:0 "As we attempt to restore order in the countryside, matters are not helped at all by the stench of corruption that every citizen can smell wafting off of the government. Far too many officials neglect their duties, instead using their positions to steal from the public and enrich themselves. It is clear that good, honest administration will be needed in order to get things back on track."

 CTH_scientific_management:0 "Scientific Management"
 CTH_scientific_management_desc:0 "Although decades have passed since the Industrial Revolution was first brought to Colthage, when it comes to production our way of thinking remains stuck in the old craft production mindset. Rather than staying slaves to established traditions, empirical methods should be used to determine new, efficient procedures that maximise labour productivity."

 CTH_mechanized_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_desc:0 "With the advent of industrialisation and the development of complex machines, farming methods have taken a truly massive leap forward. This modern equipment will be costly to acquire, but since mechanisation would allow our farmers to get more work done per day than has ever been possible before, the expense is well worth it."

 CTH_technological_exchange:0 "Propose Technological Exchange To Italy"
 CTH_technological_exchange_desc:0 "Non-governmental technological exchanges between Colthage and Italy have taken place since the late 970s, and the resulting transfer of technical knowledge has been greatly beneficial. An official technological exchange programme would be a fantastic opportunity for our technicians to gain knowledge about the development of science and technology in the world."
 
 CTH_secular_education:0 "Secular Education"
 CTH_secular_education_desc:0 "In our country, education has moved from being the preserve of parents and informal communities to being the concern of trained specialists funded by public taxes. Therefore, public schools should be kept separated from any specific religious institution. Instruction in religion is the domain of parents and their religions, not the business of the state education system."

 CTH_appoint_zaryes:0 "Co-Sufrit Batrun Zaryes"
 CTH_appoint_zaryes_desc:0 "A zebra of true Colthaginian passions, Batrun Zaryes is Zarca's favoured pick for Co-Sufrit. As a general, Zaryes openly disfavours the scientific clique, but has widespread popular support both among civilians and soldiers. Appointing Batrun as Co-Sufrit will not only help prepare the populace for conflict, it should also placate the military for the time being."

 CTH_war_is_a_racket:0 "Everyone Has Their Price"
 CTH_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "Troublingly, reports indicate that there are many in the army who harbour sympathies toward the Constitutionalist cause. Zaryes believes a round of bribes will be the most effective way to guarantee the loyalty of our soldiers and generals: after all, self-interest is a more powerful motivator than any lofty ideal."
 
 CTH_rearmament:0 "Re-Armament"
 CTH_rearmament_desc:0 "A substantial portion of Colthage's military industry was destroyed in the aftermath of the Storm King's invasion. Given the dire threats we face, ensuring the security of the nation will require completely rebuilding this productive capacity."
 
 CTH_learn_from_the_storm:0 "Lessons From The Storm"
 CTH_learn_from_the_storm_desc:0 "Although it is painful to remember, Zaryes knows that there are lessons we must learn from the Storm King's invasion, especially in regards to the importance of military air power. It would be wise for us to study the nature of our defeat, and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future."

 CTH_rural_guard:0 "Restore The Rural Guard"
 CTH_rural_guard_desc:0 "First established as an official constabulary by Zamilcar Zarca in 981, the Rural Guard was a ruthless and efficient organisation primarily responsible for eliminating unrest in the countryside. However, they disintegrated in the chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion. It is clear that this organisation will be needed once again if we are to maintain order in the east."

 CTH_hire_better_mercs:0 "Rebuild A Professional Army"
 CTH_hire_better_mercs_desc:0 "Although we have made use of mercenaries as a stopgap in recent years, their unreliability makes them unsuited to serve as the core of our army, and putting our faith in them to defend the nation would be the height of foolishness. Zaryes has a plan to rebuild a truly professional army, using experienced veterans and the Sacred Band to train these new soldiers."

 CTH_appoint_zorrzel:0 "Co-Sufrit Zaron Zorrel"
 CTH_appoint_zorrzel_desc:0 "Zaron Zorrel is mild-mannered and not very ambitious: the perfect political puppet. There is no doubt that Zorrel will happily do anything the Zarcids want. However, his acute lack of imagination makes him incapable of formulating any policies of his own."

 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution:0 "The Zarcid Constitution"
 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With all the political offices filled, it is time to fully return to political normalcy. Zalathel is accused of being a dictator, of his rule being unconstitutional. The same accusations were heard during his father's reign. But with majority support in the Senate, Zalathel can do what Zamilcar did not: Make his extensive powers enshrined in the constitution."

 CTH_appease_opposition:0 "Appease The Opposition"
 CTH_appease_opposition_desc:0 "Now that Zalathel's hold on power is firmly secure, it would be prudent to make some liberal concessions to the senatorial opposition in order to secure their support. The best way to defuse the tensions that still linger among the elite of Colthage and restore order is by getting them on our side."
 
 CTH_persecute_opposition:0 "Persecute The Opposition"
 CTH_persecute_opposition_desc:0 "Up until now, our excessive leniency has enabled senatorial opposition to plot with radical agitators and stir up unrest across the country. Zalathel will use the power of the One Hundred Twenty Seven—the highest tribunal in the land—to persecute prominent members of the opposition and push them out of office, paving the way for future stability."

 CTH_religious_education:0 "Religious Education"
 CTH_religious_education_desc:0 "Despite what some arrogant zebras may claim, the gods we worship are what bind us together as Colthaginians, being a central part of our shared culture. Having this reflected in their education will provide our foals with vital moral instruction and encourage them to be responsible, spiritually sound adults."

 CTH_national_reconstruction:0 "National Reconstruction Programme"
 CTH_national_reconstruction_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Storm King's invasion left serious hardship throughout the country: hardship which can no longer be ignored. Zalathel plans to initiate a massive economic recovery effort. Best of all, he is generously using his own family funds to help support the project!"

 CTH_rebuild_professional_army:0 "Improve Mercenary Hiring Standards"
 CTH_rebuild_professional_army_desc:0 "In our hour of greatest need, the professional army under Zamilcar Zarca disgraced itself and failed to defend Colthage from the Storm King. With this in mind, Zalathel has decided to continue using mercenaries, albeit with increased hiring standards. He has also ordered a purge of incompetent mercenaries from our ranks."

 CTH_sacrifice_to_zaal:0 "A Divine Sacrifice"
 CTH_sacrifice_to_zaal_desc:0 "Dire times such as these call for a sacrifice to the gods in order to bring us fortune. To gain divine favour for Colthage, Zalathel shall attend a grand ceremony, during which he will choose which deity of the pantheon to venerate."
 
 CTH_demand_war_reparations:0 "Demand War Reparations"
 CTH_demand_war_reparations_desc:0 "Although the Storm King may be dead, that does not undo all the abuses and injustices we suffered due to his onslaught. Zalathel thinks it's only right that the Yeti should pay for all the damage they did to our great homeland, and so he will dispatch a diplomat to the south to demand compensation."
 
 CTH_anti_regionalism:0 "The Old Debate"
 CTH_anti_regionalism_desc:0 "Troublingly, recent years have witnessed a surge in regionalist sentiment and resistance to lawful authority across the country. Centralists have dominated Colthage ever since they defeated the federalists in the civil war in 840. But after all that has happened since then, perhaps it is time to reconsider things..."
 
 CTH_naval_rearmament:0 "Regain Naval Supremacy"
 CTH_naval_rearmament_desc:0 "Long ago, Colthage was a foremost naval power of the ancient world, holding complete dominion over the Middle Sea before suffering catastrophic defeat at the claws of Rome. We must not despair: for if we dedicate ourselves, it is within our power to regain this glory once again."
 
 CTH_invite_foreign_advisors:0 "Invite Foreign Military Advisors"
 CTH_invite_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "To further improve the performance of our army, we should open the door for foreign nations to aid us with military training and organization. Their valuable insights on modern warfare will help increase the effectiveness of the Colthaginian army, as well as allowing us to develop our future military leaders."

 CTH_reinvigorate_trade:0 "Reinvigorate Commerce"
 CTH_reinvigorate_trade_desc:0 "Colthage was once an economic powerhouse built on overseas and overland trade: a mercantile civilisation which transported valuable luxuries across vast distances. This brought us great prosperity that we can regain by establishing a new, robust network of trade."
 
 CTH_distribute_food:0 "Distribute Food To The Poor"
 CTH_distribute_food_desc:0 "The causes of our lackluster agricultural output are uninteresting and unimportant. What's important is that the solution is simple: Zalathel will set up a grain dole to feed the starving and impoverished. This will help to improve their conditions, as well as build up his own popularity with the masses. He will also acquire some of his favourite food, falafel, while he's at it."
 
 CTH_import_weapons:0 "Import Weapons"
 CTH_import_weapons_desc:0 "It is difficult to win wars from a position of technological inferiority. If we buy modern guns from independent contractors in Tobuck and Italy and study their designs, we can build up an arms stockpile while at the same time working towards developing our own models of comparable effectiveness."

 CTH_establish_air_force:0 "Establish The Colthaginian Air Force"
 CTH_establish_air_force_desc:0 "Of all the military lessons we have been forced to learn in recent years, the most pressing one is that the importance of air power cannot be overlooked any longer. It is time that we create our own dedicated branch for air service. The only question is how exactly this new air force should be organized."
 
 CTH_increased_exports:0 "Strengthen Domestic Production"
 CTH_increased_exports_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely trade goods: exporting Colthaginian-made products to foreign markets is an equally important aspect of our revitalisation. Utilising new technology to improve our manufacturing sector will make our exports far more competitive, giving the economy a much-needed boost."
 
 CTH_blatant_nepotism:0 "Blood Is Thicker Than Water"
 CTH_blatant_nepotism_desc:0 "In order for an administration to function effectively, the loyalty of officials in high positions must not be in doubt. To this end, Zalathel shall call on his trusted siblings Zago, Zasdrubal, and Zaphod, and ask them to take up important posts atop the government and military."

 CTH_state_controlled_media:0 "The Rise Of Mass Media"
 CTH_state_controlled_media_desc:0 "As they become accessible to more and more zebras, radios and newspapers are growing increasingly popular and becoming ever more influential on public opinion. Depending on our approach, these new innovations could serve to either bolster or weaken our rule. We must decide on how the government should handle the media, before it spirals out of our control."
 
 CTH_steel_elephants:0 "Elephants Of Steel"
 CTH_steel_elephants_desc:0 "The legendary North Zebrican elephants went extinct in Colthage many centuries ago—those mighty beasts were incredibly effective at charging into enemy lines and breaking their ranks. Fortunately, new technology allows us to create new kinds of war elephants, ones equally capable of striking fear into the hearts of our foes."

 CTH_armoured_convoys:0 "Armoured Convoys"
 CTH_armoured_convoys_desc:0 "As we send increasing numbers of merchant ships out to sea, the corresponding threat posed by piracy grows more acute. We must develop more effective naval convoy tactics to protect this vital shipping and ward off any potential attackers."
 
 CTH_strategic_mining_crap:0 "Strategic Resource Gathering Operations"
 CTH_strategic_mining_crap_desc:0 "A group of prominent Scientifids have proposed we begin what they call Strategic Resource Gathering Operations, or SRGOs for short. These would be a series of geological surveys all across the country, followed by state-funded mining operations to extract whatever worthwhile deposits are discovered."
 
 CTH_naval_academy:0 "The Naval Academy Of Colthage"
 CTH_naval_academy_desc:0 "Truly modernising the Navy requires us to create a new academic institution where civilian professors and military instructors will educate the next generation of Colthaginian officers. At this academy, students will be provided instruction on everything from engineering and mathematics to the value of integrity and honour."
 
 CTH_ultramarines:0 "Retrain The Citizen-Marines"
 CTH_ultramarines_desc:0 "Marines in the Colthaginian Navy have traditionally been recruited from the citizenry rather than being mercenaries. Although they fight with undeniable zeal, their discipline has often been lacking, greatly limiting their effectiveness. Zalathel plans to rectify this by turning them into highly trained professional soldiers."
 
 CTH_army_motorization:0 "Dedicated Military Vehicles"
 CTH_army_motorization_desc:0 "Rather than using forcefully-commandeered civilian vehicles, the army should begin to use dedicated military trucks in its operations. We have settled on a more robust model of truck based on existing Italian designs. This model, built to withstand the stresses of combat, is sure to offer superior performance and serve our soldiers well."
 
 CTH_revitalized_economy:0 "Revitalised Economy"
 CTH_revitalized_economy_desc:0 "Thanks to flourishing trade, the economy is booming and zebras across the land are becoming richer—all a result of Zalathel's tireless efforts. Colthage rejoices, for the years of stagnation and despair are now firmly behind us!"
 
 CTH_fate_of_judiciary:0 "Fate Of The One Hundred And Twenty Seven"
 CTH_fate_of_judiciary_desc:0 "As Zalathel continues to shape the future of Colthage, one of the most pressing questions is what to do about the One Hundred And Twenty Seven. This aristocratic judiciary has long held great power and influence, and leaving them alone could allow them to someday challenge the Sufrit's authority."
 
 CTH_zagos_agricultural_manual:0 "Zago's Agricultural Manual"
 CTH_zagos_agricultural_manual_desc:0 "Wishing to impart his extensive wisdom, Zago Zarca has written a 28-book manual on agriculture filled to the brim with farming knowledge. This manual, which is already proving a hit with landowners, shall be published with state support so that more zebras can make use of the advice within. It also includes an excellent cooking recipe for falafel."
 
 CTH_auxiliary_soldiers:0 "Organise Auxiliary Units"
 CTH_auxiliary_soldiers_desc:0 "The Auxiliary Units of the old Colthaginian Army were specialized combat formations made up of non-citizens and non-Zonicians recruited from the Republic's territory. These units provided vital support to the Army in the past, and restoring them will allow us to make the most of the population we have available."
 
 CTH_disband_the_clique:0 "Disband The Scientific Clique"
 CTH_disband_the_clique_desc:0 "Now that Colthage's economy has fully recovered and the nation is modernised, the Scientific Clique has outlived its usefulness. With the help of the military, Zalathel will move to arrest its most prominent members, permanently breaking Scientifid power."
 
 CTH_fate_of_popular_assembly:0 "Abolish The Popular Assembly"
 CTH_fate_of_popular_assembly_desc:0 "The Popular Assembly—the lower house of the legislature—has been defunct for years with little real political power. It is also a nest of Constitutionalist supporters and other subversives: the Senate would be quite pleased if this unneeded relic were to be abolished."

 CTH_separation_of_military_and_politics:0 "Civilian Control Of The Military"
 CTH_separation_of_military_and_politics_desc:0 "With his relatives in commanding military positions and with the tribunal of One Hundred and Twenty Seven on his side, Zalathel is in a strong enough position to dismiss Zaryes and impose strict government control over the military. After all, a country's strategic decision-making belongs in the hooves of its political leader, not military officers."
 
 CTH_one_sufrit_above_all:0 "One Sufrit Above All"
 CTH_one_sufrit_above_all_desc:0 "As the recent period of chaos and confusion demonstrated so clearly, Colthage is weak when divided into squabbling factions, and strong only when united behind a single leader. And so it is time for Colthage to have only a single Sufrit, who rules supreme over the entire nation."
 
# Economic
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors:0 "The Eler Sea Agreement"
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors_desc:0 "Though it is north of us, the "Jewel of the South" is well-known for its industrial might. Some in our government have proposed the idea of offering a dedicated investment zone in our capital for the Italians. This will bolster our economic throughput, provided that they accept the proposition."

 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops:0 "Cotton Plantations"
 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops_desc:0 "Cotton! One of the more useful materials for clothing, and in ever-growing demand across the sea! We already have suitable land to grow cotton in; if we incentivise the growing of cash crops instead of staple foods, we will increase our export value and please the landowners."

 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone:0 "Colthage-Zur Special Economic Zone"
 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone_desc:0 "Colthage and Zur are the two regions the investors from Italy are most interested in. The griffons see potential in developing the ports and industrial centres in the country's centre. By laxing investment laws and shaking the right claws, we can bring in the capital needed to build up our most promising cities."

 CTH_reform_slavery_laws:0 "Reform The Slavery Laws"
 CTH_reform_slavery_laws_desc:0 "The slavery question has long been up to debate among the Scientifids. Many have argued that it is holding our economy back, but slavery remains a traditional staple of Colthaginian society, especially for the landowners.

 CTH_bandolier_gallops_again_desc:0 "He rode into town one evening the streets began too clear\nThe word was passed in whisper the bandit Bandolier's here\nWith his band of mighty outlaws many stories had been told\nDid he fight for the rights of us or was it lust for gold?"
 
 CTH_acquire_funds:0 ""Fundraising" Campaign"
 CTH_acquire_funds_desc:0 "War is expensive, and the Conventionist Army is in dire need of funds. Thankfully, Bandolier knows how to easily acquire them: Through forced assessments on pro-Zerutrid landowners as well as robbing trains and banks where the Zerutrids hoard their ill-gotten gold. The poor can have their fair share of the acquired land and wealth, too."
 
 CTH_division_of_the_north:0 "The Division of the North"
 CTH_division_of_the_north_desc:0 "There are many disgruntled veterans who have defected from the Zerutrids, but also do not trust the constitutionalists. They have rallied behind Bandolier's cause. The soldiers among their ranks are well-equipped experts and many of them are skilled foreign mercenaries. There is no doubt this is one of the finest military units in Colthage!"
 
 CTH_war_of_mobility:0 "A War Of Mobility"
 CTH_war_of_mobility_desc:0 "Thanks to conducting many train robberies in the past, Bandolier is familiar with trains and knows that they can be very useful in warfare. They allow rapid redeployment of units wherever they are needed. Therefore, Bandolier is determined to acquire trains for the Conventionist army so it can outmanouver the enemy with ease."
 
 CTH_purchase_weapons:0 "Purchase Weapons"
 CTH_purchase_weapons_desc:0 "Thanks to the kind "donations" of the rich zebras, the Conventionst Army can now import quality weaponry from abroad. While Macawia might not fully support us, they are willing to sell military equipment to us."
 
 CTH_hospital_trains:0 "Hospital Trains"
 CTH_hospital_trains_desc:0 "Military hospital facilities need to be just as mobile as military units. For this purpose, specialized railroad cars with medical equipment and capable doctors are required, so they can keep up with the armed forces and heal any wounded soldiers among the casualties."
 
 CTH_volunteer_peasants:0 "Volunteer Peasant Brigades"
 CTH_volunteer_peasants_desc:0 "Redistribution of wealth and land from the rich to the poor has made Bandolier very popular among rural peasantry. They are eager to support his cause and are already forming brigades of lightly armed military units to fight back against the robber barons of Zerutra and the lying landowners of the Constitutionalist Army."
 
 CTH_media_campaign:0 "Launch Media Campaign"
 CTH_media_campaign_desc:0 "To further gather support among the Colthaginian populace, Bandolier has decided to take advantage of his legendary status and spread knowledge of his exploits abroad. Interviews with journalists, Applewood films, a Bandolier-themed restaurant chain, and so on will propel Bandolier to international fame."
 
 CTH_guerilla_warfare:0 "Guerrilla Warfare"
 CTH_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Should the fortunes of war ever turn against us, we need to be ready to continue fighting even in dire circumstances. Thankfully, Bandolier's bandits and the peasant volunteers know local terrain well and will be able to use jungles and hills to great advantage. Even if the cities fall, the countryside will remain under our control."

 CTH_form_interim_government_2_electric_boogaloo_desc:0 "Victory has been won on the battlefield, but the future of Colthaginian democracy is still far from secure. The task before us now is restoring order and preparing for elections again, this time being willing to take decisive action to avoid the mistakes of Mzelqatid."

 CTH_dissolve_red_battalions:0 "Dissolve Red Battalions"
 CTH_dissolve_red_battalions_desc:0 "The workers' militia have served their purpose and we no longer have any need for them, especially as they are now threatening the stability of Colthage. The Red Battalions will be disarmed, by force if necessary, to ensure the working class does not have the power to threaten the constitutional government."
 
 CTH_return_lands:0 "Return Seized Lands"
 CTH_return_lands_desc:0 "The Administration of Confiscated Properties shall be established to manage any property seized during the civil war. What was unlawfully taken from loyal landowners shall be returned, as Zenut Zaranzid himself is a sympathetic landowner. But the lands of traitors and Zerutrids will remain under state ownership for the foreseeable future."
 
 CTH_outlaw_strikes:0 "Outlaw Strikes"
 CTH_outlaw_strikes_desc:0 "The workers have been denying the sacred recognition of the fatherland and they cannot be allowed to destabilize the fragile republic. Rather than negotiating with the RCCW, strikes will be outlawed and the constitutionalist military will be sent to suppress them. Concessions have previously been made to the workers; they better be satisfied with what they have."
 
 CTH_an_independent_judiciary:0 "Judicial Reforms"
 CTH_an_independent_judiciary_desc:0 "Courts should not be subject to improper influence from factional interests; to ensure this, reforms must be made to fully guarantee the independence of the judiciary so it remains an unbiased institution. Zenut firmly believes that our current judges are the good and honourable sort of zebras who can be trusted to put their duty to Colthage before their own self-interest."

 CTH_abolish_title_of_co_sufrit:0 "Abolish The Title Of Co-Sufrit"
 CTH_abolish_title_of_co_sufrit_desc:0 "The ancient Colthaginian institution of dual rule has outlived its usefulness. Bezelshazzar Zerutra rose to power due to a constitutional loophole related to the position of Co-Sufrit, and whoever is appointed to hold the title is either hungry for power or a puppet of the other Sufrit. The new Colthage that is being made needs a strong leader who rules alone."
 
 CTH_assassinate_zesh:0 "Assassinate Zeshmunazash Zeirutid"
 CTH_assassinate_zesh_desc:0 "The "Lion of the West", a glorified bandit, eludes us, but we have tracked down the location of the "Lion of the East". He betrayed the Republic by joining the Conventionist Army and stirs the Coltvans to rebellion. It is therefore vital to remove him from the picture immediately. Let Colthage be reminded that Zenut Zaranzid is the only viable alternative to both anarchy and radicalism!"
 
 CTH_the_constitutional_convention:0 "Call The Constitutional Convention"
 CTH_the_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Years of chaos have proven decisively that the much-praised constitution of Colthage is flawed and outdated. Some reforms are going to be needed, and so Zenut Zaranzid plans to convene a convention where the constitution can be amended, or even partially rewritten."

 CTH_hold_elections_again_and_hope_it_doesnt_go_wrong_this_time_desc:0 "We have done all we can to subdue enemies of the Republic while laying the groundwork for our future freedom and stability. And so the time has come: Zenut Zaranzid's work is finished and he is finally ready to step down and facilitate the smooth transition of power to a Sufrit chosen by the citizens of Colthage."

 CTH_clique_in_control:0 "The Clique In Control"
 CTH_clique_in_control_desc:0 "The previous government was dangerously weak, and proved itself incapable of effectively confronting the revolutionary forces which still threaten to throw Colthage into anarchy. With support in both the Senate and the army, Baltazar must move quickly to seize power and begin solidifying the Scientifids' position: they now represent Colthage's best hope for political order and economic progress."

 CTH_scientific_politics:0 "Scientific Politics"
 CTH_scientific_politics_desc:0 "A core Scientifid principle is the idea that a nation's problems should be approached and its policies formulated scientifically. At present, there is an ongoing debate over what exact form the government should take—Scientifids are split on the question of what political system accords with the laws of nature and is best suited to the current material conditions of Colthage."
 
 CTH_secular_education_2:0 "Secular Education"
 CTH_secular_education_2_desc:0 "In our country, education has moved from being the preserve of parents and informal communities to being the concern of trained specialists funded by public taxes. Therefore, public schools should be kept separated from any specific religious institution. Instruction in religion is the domain of parents and their religions, not the business of the state education system."
 
 CTH_economic_calculation_debate:0 "Economic Calculation Debate"
 CTH_economic_calculation_debate_desc:0 "Although all agree on the paramount importance of promoting economic development, Scientifids are divided as to how Colthage's economy should function and what role the state should play in it. Some favour economic planning as a resource allocation mechanism, while others argue that a free market is the more efficient solution."
 
 CTH_expeditions_and_experiments:0 "Experiments & Expeditions"
 CTH_expeditions_and_experiments_desc:0 "Our new age shall be one guided by science, with policies built upon observation, experiment, and facts, not upon dogmas and abstractions. With full access to state funds and legislation, science no longer has any monetary or legal limitations: the possibilities are endless. It's time to get to work!"
 
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_2:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_2_desc:0 "As we attempt to restore order in the countryside, matters are not helped at all by the stench of corruption that every citizen can smell wafting off of the government. Far too many officials neglect their duties, instead using their positions to steal from the public and enrich themselves. It is clear that good, honest administration will be needed in order to get things back on track."
 
 CTH_rapid_recovery_plan:0 "Rapid Recovery Plan"
 CTH_rapid_recovery_plan_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Storm King's invasion left a huge amount of devastation in its wake. These wounds are still fresh, and there are few in Colthage who emerged unscathed. We must move quickly to repair this damage, as material improvements are vital to promoting societal development."
 
 CTH_medical_science:0 "Wonders Of Medical Science"
 CTH_medical_science_desc:0 "Modern medicine is more capable than ever before of improving the physical health and well-being of creatures. In light of this, adequately funding Colthaginian medical research is of the utmost importance, and so is widely distributing medicine to the populace. After all, healthy citizens make for a healthy society!"
 
 CTH_student_exchange:0 "Student Exchange Programmes"
 CTH_student_exchange_desc:0 "Applying the methods of science to improve our own society requires that we learn all we can from other countries' experiences. Foreigners have plenty of knowledge to share, and so we shall establish student exchange programmes to increase students' understanding of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their horizons."
 
 CTH_on_religion:0 "The Status Of Religion"
 CTH_on_religion_desc:0 "Tensions are rising between those who believe "superstitious practices" have no place in an age of science, and others who claim trying to suppress such traditions will lead to social anarchy. True, it has long been claimed that science and religion are the opposites, but perhaps they can co-exist? A debate must be held to determine the fate of religion in Colthage."
 
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_2:0 "Mechanize Agriculture"
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_2_desc:0 "With the advent of industrialisation and the development of complex machines, farming methods have taken a truly massive leap forward. This modern equipment will be costly to acquire, but since mechanisation would allow our farmers to get more work done per day than has ever been possible before, the expense is well worth it."
 
 CTH_academy_of_applied_alchemy:0 "Open The Academy Of Applied Alchemy"
 CTH_academy_of_applied_alchemy_desc:0 "Charlatans who try to hide potionmaking in a shroud of mysticism impede those who truly seek to understand the nature of magic. Greed and ignorance is all that motivates such zebras. We must train a generation of educated potionmakers: ones who will utilise the superior methods of science to develop new and even stronger recipes."
 
 CTH_eugenics_are_totally_not_pseudoscience_my_dudes:0 "The Eugenics Controversy"
 CTH_eugenics_are_totally_not_pseudoscience_my_dudes_desc:0 "It has been theorised that the process of social evolution goes hoof and hoof with evolution of species that make up society, meaning we should be concerned with the genetic state of the population. But this view is far from universal, and there is a heated debate among Scientifids about exactly how scientific or ethical this field of eugenics is, and if a policy of "guided evolution" should be implemented at all."

 CTH_land_reform_debate:0 "The Issue Of Land Reform"
 CTH_land_reform_debate_desc:0 "Scientifids were the architects of the current rural order where magnates control large swathes of land and dominate peasants. This system produced impressive results, greatly increasing the productivity of the land and contributing to Colthage's economic miracle after 975. However, some Scientifids are beginning to suggest reforms will be necessary to ensure future stability in the countryside."

 CTH_bigass_goddamn_dam:0 "Construct The Grand Bagraza Dam"
 CTH_bigass_goddamn_dam_desc:0 "Forward-looking engineers have long dreamt of constructing a massive dam on the Bagraza river near the capital: one capable of providing electricity for the entire city of Colthage. Now with full national resources at our disposal, we can finally turn their dreams into reality."

 CTH_social_engineering_program:0 "Social Engineering Programme"
 CTH_social_engineering_program_desc:0 "Our citizens need to be enlightened so they learn critical thinking and better appreciate the benefits of Scientifid rule. Fortunately, the rise of mass media now enables social engineering to be undertaken on a grand scale—we can mould the beliefs and behaviours of the common populace in a way never before possible."
 
 CTH_yale_of_zebrica:0 "The Yale Of Zebrica"
 CTH_yale_of_zebrica_desc:0 "We are bold enough to ask questions few others dare to ask and seek the truth, no matter where it might lead us. With this noble spirit, the methods of science are being applied to the practical ends of economic development, social regeneration, and political unity. Without doubt, Colthage has become the intellectual capital of northern Zebrica, if not the entire continent!"

 CTH_gain_army_loyalty:0 "Ensure Military Loyalty"
 CTH_gain_army_loyalty_desc:0 "Batrun Zaryes is popular among soldiers and also commands the respect of his fellow generals. Although his dislike for the Scientifids is well known, his cooperation absolutely must be secured if our regime is to remain in power."

 CTH_coltvan_problem:0 "The Coltvan Problem"
 CTH_coltvan_problem_desc:0 "While our attention has been focused elsewhere, the situation in Coltva continues to further deteriorate. Ambitious bandits are inciting peasants to revolt left and right, causing massive disruptions to the region's economy. The army is demanding that we do something about this backwater province before it slips from our grasp completely."
 
 CTH_foundation_of_order:0 "A Foundation Of Order"
 CTH_foundation_of_order_desc:0 "Our administration is the only thing preventing Colthage from slipping into an age of ignorance and anarchy. To solidify our rule, we will use the army to maintain order in the country by repressing unrest and cracking down on dissent. As the formula goes: 'Order as the basis, progress as the goal.'"
 
 CTH_retake_kar_alpaka_2:0 "Retake Kar-Alpaka"
 CTH_retake_kar_alpaka_2_desc:0 "Llambet seized the Coltvan state of Kar-Alpaka from us after the Storm King's invasion in order to gain sea access for themselves. Since then the territory has been out of our hooves, but the army is adamant that the time has come for these lost lands to be retaken."
 
 CTH_lessons_from_insurgency:0 "Learning From The Insurgency"
 CTH_lessons_from_insurgency_desc:0 "Many months of fighting in Coltva has given us a tremendous amount of experience in fighting irregular forces. This knowledge should be put to use developing our counter-insurgency tactics. We must take a holistic view and catalogue all military, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions that should be taken to defeat an insurgency."

 CTH_reform_the_army:0 "Reform The Army"
 CTH_reform_the_army_desc:0 "As a result of decisions made by the previous administration, high-ranking military leaders have expressed concern over the state of Colthage's army. In particular, Batrun Zaryes doubts that we are properly prepared to face an invasion from any external threat, and wishes to see us greatly reduce our reliance on mercenaries in favour of building a professional army."
 
 CTH_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify The South"
 CTH_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Quaggatai struck in the south and seized Coltdar after the Storm King's invasion, taking advantage of our temporarily weakened state. Now that we have recovered our strength, the military is urging us to destroy the Khanate and retake Coltdar, to permanently neutralise the threat posed by their hordes."
 
 CTH_invest_in_mil_research:0 "Divert Resources To Military Research"
 CTH_invest_in_mil_research_desc:0 "The army is asking us to dedicate more resources towards national defence, and away from our current focus on social and natural sciences. There is wisdom to this request: developing new and more formidable weapons systems will no doubt prove vital in securing Colthage's borders against foreign aggression."

 CTH_found_airforce:0 "Establish An Air Force"
 CTH_found_airforce_desc:0 "The Storm King's devastating invasion clearly demonstrated the value of air power on the modern battlefield. In light of this, the military wishes for us to establish an air force, although they are not in complete agreement on what precise role it should have."
 
 CTH_develop_ship_tech:0 "Develop New Ship Types"
 CTH_develop_ship_tech_desc:0 "Long ago, Colthage was a foremost naval power of the ancient world, holding complete dominion over the Middle Sea before suffering catastrophic defeat at the claws of Rome. Desiring to regain some of this glory once again, the military is asking us to research new hulls and armaments for our naval vessels."
 
 CTH_civilize_savages:0 "Civilize The Savages"
 CTH_civilize_savages_desc:0 "While the zebras of Coltdar are happy to rejoin civilisation, the barbaric zebras of Quaggatai and Buckhara remain backwards and brutish. They are less capable of adjusting to modernity due to centuries of stunted development. It is our duty to civilize them, and aid in their advancement to the point where they can assimilate into Colthaginian society."

 CTH_army_academy:0 "Open A Military Academy"
 CTH_army_academy_desc:0 "A rationally organised military is incompatible with the practice of leaders rising through the ranks based solely on personal connections. And so we shall open an academy where skillful generals are promoted regardless of their familiar or political affiliation. After all, a true meritocracy does not judge zebras by their stripes."

 CTH_army_mechanization:0 "Military Mechanisation"
 CTH_army_mechanization_desc:0 "Having lacked dedicated military vehicles up to now, the army is being forced to make due with forcefully-commandeered civilian vehicles. We must make it our priority to design and produce military trucks for their operations—this will greatly increase their mobility, as they would no longer be forced to rely as heavily on arduous marches or preexisting railroads."
 
 CTH_proclaim_neutrality:0 "Proclaim Neutrality"
 CTH_proclaim_neutrality_desc:0 "The Scientifids know that war is inherently destructive and harmful to progress, and that we must do all we can to avoid it if possible. As a civil government with no desire to get embroiled in regional conflicts, we will proclaim Colthage to be a neutral nation. Militarists will obviously be displeased, but that is all part of the plan..."

 CTH_experimental_weaponry:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
 CTH_experimental_weaponry_desc:0 "The military has requested that we direct our research and development undertakings towards experimenting with and developing new types of weapons. As we press beyond the frontiers of current knowledge, we will no doubt uncover all kinds of exotic technologies that could be used for warfare."

 CTH_purge_the_military:0 "Purge The Military"
 CTH_purge_the_military_desc:0 "Militarist attempts to intimidate the government have gone on for long enough. Their protest of the neutrality proclamation was the last straw, and all the justification needed. With the support of meritocratically promoted generals, the ranks of the military will be purged and all incompetent, warmongering, and corrupt generals will be relieved of duty."

 CTH_order_and_progress:0 "Order And Progress"
 CTH_order_and_progress_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of the Scientifids, Colthage's future now lies in the hooves of managers and administrators: wise experts who are above politics and unaffected by the play of interests. Under their direction, the citizens of Colthage now enjoy the benefits of an era of peace, economic development, and social stability. At last, the age of science has truly arrived!"

 CTH_form_the_junta:0 "Form The Military Junta"
 CTH_form_the_junta_desc:0 "After much planning and preparation, our coup was successful and the old regime has fallen: Colthage is no longer being led down the path of ruin. Despite this, the situation remains precarious. Now a new military government must be formed to oversee the restoration of order and stability in the country."

 CTH_suspend_constitution:0 "Suspend The Constitution"
 CTH_suspend_constitution_desc:0 "In order to purge the weakness and corruption which has taken root within Colthage, the junta must be empowered to take drastic action. Only by suspending the constitution can such measures be taken: dissolving the Senate, imposing a nationwide curfew, taking control of the media, and cracking down on political subversives, for a start."

 CTH_arrest_scientifids:0 "Arrest The Scientifids"
 CTH_arrest_scientifids_desc:0 "Contrary to their benign reputation, the Scientifids are far from harmless technocrats. We have ample evidence that they have been actively plotting to usurp our authority. In light of this, all members and supporters of the Scientific Clique are to be arrested and investigated for conspiracy and treason."

 CTH_ally_with_landowners:0 "Ally With The Landowners"
 CTH_ally_with_landowners_desc:0 "Instead of seeing rural magnates as a threat, they should be seen as powerful potential allies. After all, few zebras have more of an incentive to maintain order than them, and their wealth and resources will no doubt prove helpful in asserting control over the countryside. Therefore, various concessions will be offered to ensure their loyalty and support."

 CTH_disappearance_of_constitutionalists:0 "Forced Disappearances Of Constitutionalists"
 CTH_disappearance_of_constitutionalists_desc:0 "Conveniently for us, Constitutionalist senators and supporters have begun to "disappear" in recent days. Unsubstantiated rumours swirl that they are actually being secretly arrested, imprisoned, tortured, and executed. Naturally, the junta will deny having any involvement with these mysterious abductions."

 CTH_eliminate_harmonites:0 "Eliminate Harmonites"
 CTH_eliminate_harmonites_desc:0 "The greatest threat to order in Colthage is currently posed by Harmonites, most of whom are extremist agents on the payroll of foreign governments, who wish only to throw Colthage into anarchy. Banning their movement and publicly executing some of their more prominent supporters will send a message that disruptive agitation will no longer be tolerated."

 CTH_constitutional_referendum:0 "Hold A Constitutional Referendum"
 CTH_constitutional_referendum_desc:0 "Now that the destabilizing forces which once threatened to overwhelm the nation have been contained, we can begin to look towards the future. A new constitution needs to be approved by the populace to replace the fatally flawed one that was suspended. Therefore a referendum shall be held: one supervised closely by the military, of course."

 CTH_appoint_co_sufrit:0 "Appoint A Co-Sufrit"
 CTH_appoint_co_sufrit_desc:0 "The new constitution still requires the Sufrit to rule with a Co-Sufrit, due to the demands of the officer corps. Therefore one must now be appointed. It is essential that a capable and reliable candidate is selected, or else the consequences could prove disastrous."

 CTH_invite_feathara_girls:0 "Invite The Feathara Girls"
 CTH_invite_feathara_girls_desc:0 "Many Colthaginian zebras have studied abroad in Italy, and among them are a pair of economists known as the Feathara girls. They are proponents of libertarian economic theories and advocate pro-business policies. As they align with [Root.GetLeader]' views, they shall be invited to provide economic advice for the military junta."

 CTH_everyone_has_a_price:0 "Everyone Has Their Price"
 CTH_everyone_has_a_price_desc:0 "Our previous actions alienated many zebras who were sympathetic towards the Constitutionalist cause, causing them to retire from their positions in the military. A round of hefty bribes would surely be an effective way to entice them back into service: after all, self-interest is a more powerful motivator than any lofty ideal."

 CTH_establish_central_bank:0 "Establish A Central Bank"
 CTH_establish_central_bank_desc:0 "Banking in Colthage has long been exclusively under the control of various patrician families. The Feathara girls have proposed a banking reform that would create a central, state-owned bank, allowing more direct control over monetary policy while also closely supervising the patrician banks."
 
 CTH_loans_for_recovery:0 "Loans For Recovery"
 CTH_loans_for_recovery_desc:0 "Countless Colthaginians are still feeling the effects of the Storm King's invasion after the immense devastation he left in his wake. Measures must be taken to get the economy moving again: the government will begin offering low-interest loans for individuals and businesses to help them get back on their hooves."

 CTH_rearmament_2:0 "Re-Armament"
 CTH_rearmament_2_desc:0 "A substantial portion of Colthage's military industry was destroyed in the aftermath of the Storm King's invasion. Given the dire threats we face, ensuring the security of the nation will require completely rebuilding this productive capacity."
 
 CTH_private_education:0 "Permit Private Education"
 CTH_private_education_desc:0 "Parents who are dissatisfied with government-funded schools should have more options when it comes to their foals' education: we will permit the creation of private schools which are not funded or operated by the government. In practice, this will also allow the army to set up its own schools which are completely independent from civilian political interference."
 
 CTH_boom_bust_cycle:0 "The Boom-Bust Cycle"
 CTH_boom_bust_cycle_desc:0 "Our reorientation of the Colthaginian economy and the effects of the economic policies applied by the Feathara girls have already begun to yield stunning results. Liberalizing the economy and ending all state intervention has led to rapid economic growth - perhaps too rapid, but that's a problem for the future!"
 
 CTH_worker_compensation_law:0 "Improve The Lives Of The Workers"
 CTH_worker_compensation_law_desc:0 "Since rebellions can only thrive when there is disaffection among peasants and labourers, addressing their complaints is the best way to prevent future unrest. [Root.GetLeader] will approve several laws, including a workers' compensation law and a law limiting daily work hours, to help win the support of the vast lower class which forms the core of our nation's zebrapower pool."

 CTH_rural_guard_2:0 "Restore The Rural Guard"
 CTH_rural_guard_2_desc:0 "First established as an official constabulary by Zamilcar Zarca in 981, the Rural Guard was a ruthless and efficient organisation primarily responsible for eliminating unrest in the countryside. However, they disintegrated in the chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion. It is clear that this organisation will be needed once again if we are to maintain order in the east."

 CTH_control_media:0 "Control The Media"
 CTH_control_media_desc:0 "When it comes to the information presented to the average citizen, we must be ever-vigilant in combating threats to national unity. The media cannot be allowed to publish seditious anti-junta content at will, and in general must be kept under the tight control of the government. The only facts worthy of public consumption are officially approved facts!"

 CTH_pacify_coltva:0 "Pacify Coltva"
 CTH_pacify_coltva_desc:0 "Coltvans are in dire need of a reminder that they are Colthaginians. The troublemakers and bandits in Coltva will be cleansed with a direct and ruthless application of military force. There will be no negotiations or concessions. The rebel scum will either surrender, or they will die."

 CTH_secret_police:0 "Employ The Servants Of The Dark One"
 CTH_secret_police_desc:0 "Ziempsal Zannid is a respected spymaster despite her ties to an underground cult worshipping Zargon, the Lord of the Deep. Her contacts could be very useful for ensuring the internal security of Colthage. In return for leaving their cult alone, they can use their espionage talents to help the government to track down foreign agents, agitators and dissidents."

 CTH_MKULTRA:0 "Project OTSULTIMA"
 CTH_MKULTRA_desc:0 "It is proposed to continue research on problems critical to a clarification of the fundamental aspects of the stimulus-response relationship in biological systems. Can we get control of an individual to the point where they will do our bidding against their will and even against fundamental laws of nature such as self preservation?"

 CTH_amend_the_constitution:0 "Amend The Constitution"
 CTH_amend_the_constitution_desc:0 "The current constitution states that the position of Sufrit is to be a rotating one, but this has only led to disruptive conflict and infighting up to now. With the loyalty of the warlords secured, [Root.GetLeader] can finally amend the constitution and ensure that their reign lasts for the rest of their life."

 CTH_secure_kar_alpaka:0 "Secure Kar-Alpaka"
 CTH_secure_kar_alpaka_desc:0 "Llambet seized the Coltvan state of Kar-Alpaka from us after the Storm King's invasion in order to gain sea access for themselves. Since then the territory has been out of our hooves, but the time has come to rectify this. There will be no asking nicely: we retake what is rightfully ours by force."

 CTH_fortify_west:0 "Fortify The West"
 CTH_fortify_west_desc:0 "With the Storm King dead and gone, Hippogriffia represents the greatest threat to our future security. Although we have no intention of picking a fight with them, we must be prepared to defend ourselves from potential aggression.

 CTH_crush_quaggatai_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a historic enemy of Colthage—it was the Quaggatai Khans who kept us enslaved for 300 dark years, and their resurgence means that a final confrontation is only a matter of time. They must be destroyed so that their hordes can never again threaten us."

 CTH_war_plan_east:0 "War Plan East"
 CTH_war_plan_east_desc:0 "Colthage is in dire need of additional resources and labourers to rival other regional powers such as Hippogriffia and Chiropterra.

It is imperative that we control this land, as it will serve as an important staging area for our eventual campaigns deeper into Hindia."

 CTH_viking_coast:0 "The Viking Coast"
 CTH_viking_coast_desc:0 "Our next targets are the wealthy realms of Chital and Sambar, dominated by the Olenian cousins of native deer. The locals will welcome us as liberators as we topple the regimes of these "Yarils" and such. Complete control of the northern coast is necessary if we wish to assert our military dominance in the region."
 
 CTH_pearl_of_the_east:0 "The Final Frontier"
 CTH_pearl_of_the_east_desc:0 "Barasingha is the untamed borderland of Hindia, most savage and uncivilized part of the region. To fully complete our conquest, this realm must be conquered as well. Only then can we call ourselves masters of Hindia."

 CTH_colthaginian_raj:0 "The Colthaginian Raj"
 CTH_colthaginian_raj_desc:0 "Glorious triumph! [Root.GetLeader] has led us to total victory, leaving us the sole masters of Hindia. However, conquest and administration are two different things altogether. It is time to decide how to organise our new lands. Ruling over such a large population of deer will be difficult, but necessary in order to take advantage of the valuable resources in the territory."

 CTH_war_plan_north:0 "War Plan North"
 CTH_war_plan_north_desc:0 "In the distant past, Colthage dominated the Middle Sea, controlling all naval commerce passing east and west. Without this control, Colthage is doomed to forever remain a minor power. According to the navy, seizing the populous islands to the north would not only give us back this control, but vastly expand our industrial base."

 CTH_operation_parroting:0 "Operation Parroting"
 CTH_operation_parroting_desc:0 "Macawia has long been a neighbour of Colthage with a tenuous relationship to say the least: they cannot be trusted and pose a threat to the junta, especially with so many of their citizens having pro-democratic sympathies. For Colthage's security, Macawia must be destroyed."

 CTH_operation_bullfighter:0 "Operation Bullfighter"
 CTH_operation_bullfighter_desc:0 "Asterion is another rival naval power in the Middle Sea, and also potentially hostile to us after our recent takeover of Macawia. They cannot be ignored any longer. In addition, taking control of the islands they currently hold will provide us with a strategically vital staging area for our future operations in the region."

 CTH_operation_trident:0 "Operation Trident"
 CTH_operation_trident_desc:0 "Sicameon was clearly behind the murder of Professor Balazar Zatid. How else could their sham "investigation" have failed to produce any suspects? The country is led by a pack of griffon supremacists who are squatting on soil which was once part of New Colthage. We have not forgotten this grievous insult to our national honour, and it will not go unavenged!"

 CTH_new_colthage_focus:0 "Refounding Of New Colthage"
 CTH_new_colthage_focus_desc:0 "1500 years ago, the colony of New Colthage was founded on Scarlet Island. Shortly afterwards, a massive war erupted with Rome, which Colthage eventually lost, along with our overseas colonies. In light of our newfound dominance over the Middle Sea, some zebras are suggesting that the time has come to resurrect the idea of New Colthage."

 CTH_two_branches:0 "The Two Branches Of The Military"
 CTH_two_branches_desc:0 "Colthage has always relied on two primary pillars to support it: The army and the navy. In recent years both have been weakened severely, threatening the very foundation of the nation. They must be restored to their former glories so Colthage has dominance of both land and sea once more!"

 CTH_professionalize_army:0 "Rebuild The Professional Army"
 CTH_professionalize_army_desc:0 "Although we have made use of mercenaries as a stopgap in recent years, their unreliability makes them unsuited to serve as the core of our army, and putting our faith in them to defend the nation would be the height of foolishness. [Root.GetLeader] has a plan to rebuild a truly professional army, using experienced veterans and the Sacred Band to train these new soldiers."

 CTH_blessing_of_aztarte:0 "Blessing Of Aztarte"
 CTH_blessing_of_aztarte_desc:0 "O Aztarte, Goddess of Fertility and War, heed the prayers of your most humble and faithful followers! Your most divine blessing is necessary if we wish to smite the enemies of Zonician civilization. Be generous and grant us a mere fraction of your sacred power!"

 CTH_lessons_from_the_storm:0 "Lessons From The Storm"
 CTH_lessons_from_the_storm_desc:0 "Although it is painful to remember, [Root.GetLeader] knows that there are lessons we must learn from the Storm King's invasion, especially in regards to the importance of military air power. It would be wise for us to study the nature of our defeat, and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future."

 CTH_contract_with_ochzors:0 "Sign A Contract With Ochzor"
 CTH_contract_with_ochzors_desc:0 "Zauro Ochzor is a famed weapons designer and businesszebra who owns several manufacturing companies. We should strike a deal with one of them to supply the army, which would allow us to equip our forces with quality arms while at the same time gaining the loyalty of the Ochzors."
 
 CTH_airforce_debate:0 "The Air Force Debate"
 CTH_airforce_debate_desc:0 "The Storm King's lightning invasion plainly demonstrated the value of air power on the modern battlefield for all to see. In light of this, we clearly need to establish an air force, although the army and navy are not in complete agreement on what precise role it should have."

 CTH_recruitment_campaign:0 "Begin Recruitment Campaigns"
 CTH_recruitment_campaign_desc:0 "North Zebrica has become an increasingly chaotic place in recent years, making national defence more important than ever. Ensuring our future security will require a substantial buildup: the army is hungry for more willing soldiers, and so nationwide propaganda campaigns need to be launched to incentivise zebras to sign up."

 CTH_army_modernization:0 "Army Modernisation"
 CTH_army_modernization_desc:0 "Advances in technology have made possible the creation of new combat vehicles that can protect soldiers as well as greatly increase their offensive capabilities. We can not afford to neglect developing and incorporating these machines into our army, or else we will get left behind and pay dearly for it in the next war."

 CTH_military_rd:0 "Military Research And Development"
 CTH_military_rd_desc:0 "Our research efforts suffered a bit of a setback after purging the Scientifids, but we have finally amassed the resources and personnel needed to establish a new department specialising in military research and development. This department will be responsible for the development of emerging technologies to support the needs of national security."

 CTH_dockyard_expansion:0 "Expand The Hippone Dockyard"
 CTH_dockyard_expansion_desc:0 "Hippone has a natural harbour of great strategic and economic importance, but the infrastructure currently in place there is inadequate. It is not being utilised for ship production as effectively as it could be: we need to construct additional dry docks and repair facilities if we are to rectify this."

 CTH_new_admirals:0 "Promote New Admirals"
 CTH_new_admirals_desc:0 "Recent events have left us with new openings in the leadership of the navy. We must make it a priority to fill these gaps with talented, qualified zebras.

 CTH_blessing_of_zam:0 "Blessing Of Zam"
 CTH_blessing_of_zam_desc:0 "O Zam, God of the Great Sea and all rivers that flow into it, heed the prayers of your most humble and faithful followers! Guide our sailors to safety and sink our foes in vicious storms. Keep the seas calm when our gunners take aim in battle. Keep your sacred rivers from drying up or flooding. Be generous and grant us a mere fraction of your sacred power!" 

 CTH_torpedo_stuff:0 "Copy Italian Torpedo Designs"
 CTH_torpedo_stuff_desc:0 "Italy has been at the forefront of torpedo development for many years now. Thanks to our shared history of military cooperation, it would not be so difficult to copy some of their torpedo designs. Of course, they might not be exactly pleased with this, but with a few modifications, nogriffon will ever know."

 CTH_marines_2:0 "Establish Naval Infantry Corps"
 CTH_marines_2_desc:0 "Occupying and asserting control over our overseas territories will require specialized naval infantry: armed sailors are simply not up to the task of conducting expeditionary and amphibious operations. And so a new service branch shall be established to serve this critical military role as an amphibious warfare force."

 CTH_navy_modernization:0 "Navy Modernization"
 CTH_navy_modernization_desc:0 "The balance of power at sea is changing, and naval warfare itself is changing along with it. If we wish to become a first-rate power in our region, we must adapt to these changes and modernize our navy. To this end, we will begin the process of upgrading our warship designs without delay."

 CTH_experimental_weaponry_2:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
 CTH_experimental_weaponry_2_desc:0 "Past technological breakthroughs have led to advancements that forever changed the face of the battlefield. As we press beyond the frontiers of current knowledge, we will no doubt uncover all kinds of amazing discoveries that can be applied towards warfare—we should direct all our research and development undertakings towards experimenting with and developing new types of weapons."

 CTH_arise_people_of_colthage_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, nozebra believed the new harmonite faction could ever be considered a serious political contender within Colthage. Now, they have been elected to power, free to make their dreams of a better tomorrow into reality. There is no doubt the path will be long and arduous, as Colthage has many flaws that need to be addressed. The populace must be aware of what the future holds for us."

 CTH_the_missing_half:0 "The Missing Half"
 CTH_the_missing_half_desc:0 "As is tradition, the new Sufrit must appoint a Co-Sufrit to govern alongside them. This is a decision of immense importance: it is essential that a worthy and principled candidate is selected, one who can be trusted to help guide the future Colthage while ensuring the prosperity of every zebra."

 CTH_speak_softly_and_carry_a_big_stick:0 "Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick"
 CTH_speak_softly_and_carry_a_big_stick_desc:0 "Jezabzella has always been fond of this proverb of the Great Lakes zebras. It means always trying to resolve disputes through negotiation, while wielding significant military force in case rational talks fail. Harmony does not equal weakness, yet strength must be used only when necessary and preferably in support of words and reason rather than as their replacement."

 CTH_together_we_can_rebuild:0 "Together, We Can Rebuild!"
 CTH_together_we_can_rebuild_desc:0 "The Storm King's marauding army left tremendous destruction in its wake. Much of the nation still lies in ruins, neglected thanks to the previous government's incompetence. Although helping these zebras back on their hooves will be an arduous task, it is something we must do: for as long as we believe in the power of the Colthaginian spirit, we can achieve anything!"

 CTH_state_subventions:0 "Fulfillment Of Basic Needs"
 CTH_state_subventions_desc:0 "Everyone has the right to food, water and shelter, so when some are too poor to even afford these, it is the duty of the state to intervene with subventions and aid programs to guarantee access to them. With these basic needs fulfilled, standard of living will increase and the impoverished can worry less about simple survival."
 
 CTH_devolution_of_power:0 "Devolution Of Power"
 CTH_devolution_of_power_desc:0 "While many harmonites and constitutionalists are federalists, Jezabzella herself prefers a middle ground between full federalization and centralization, that being devolution. Local governments will be delegated additional legislative power and given limited autonomy while still remaining under the watchful guidance of the central government in Colthage."
 
 CTH_role_of_patricians:0 "Role Of The Patricians"
 CTH_role_of_patricians_desc:0 "Although patricians lost much of their political influence under Zamilcar's regime, they remain very wealthy and powerful figures. Their wealth has the potential to improve society greatly if put to productive use. Unfortunately, recent political instability has left them reluctant to invest in the economy. Now that things have settled down, perhaps they can be convinced to loosen their purse strings."
 
 CTH_hippogriff_model:0 "Adopt The Hippogriff Model"
 CTH_hippogriff_model_desc:0 "The Hippogriff model of harmony is fairly authoritarian, with the queen traditionally having quite extensive powers. In Equestria, too, the alicorn rulers technically have absolute power. Since these two are strong and stable countries that embody what we strive to establish, why shouldn't we try to emulate what has worked for them?"

 CTH_empower_popular_assembly:0 "Empower The Popular Assembly"
 CTH_empower_popular_assembly_desc:0 "For too long has the Senate dominated our legislature, completely sidelining the lower house. It's time we give power to the common folk of the Popular Assembly and allow these representatives to steer the direction of the country. This course of action is far wiser than entrusting everything to a single strong ruler who, if the wrong zebra is chosen, has the potential to become a tyrant."

 CTH_outlaw_indentured_servitude:0 "Outlaw Indentured Servitude"
 CTH_outlaw_indentured_servitude_desc:0 "Although the practice of slavery has been ended and replaced with indentured servitude, we recognize that in truth there is little difference between the two. Even if a zebra signs an indenture of their own "free will" they are still treated as property instead of a living being. We must outlaw this barbaric practice, and fully emancipate all lower class zebras."

 CTH_open_for_business:0 "Open For Business"
 CTH_open_for_business_desc:0 "Establishing trade ties with other countries is a great way to encourage the exchange of both goods and ideas, while at the same time promoting economic growth in Colthage. With the support of the patricians who are sure to benefit from lowered trade barriers, it can be easily done."

 CTH_universal_suffrage:0 "Introduce Universal Suffrage"
 CTH_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "Thus far, voting rights in Colthage have been limited only to full citizens—which has meant that only a fraction of the populace had any real say in how the country is governed. It is time to change this by introducing voting rights for all adult citizens, while also granting citizenship to a much wider portion of Colthaginians."

 CTH_expand_our_horizons:0 "Expand Our Horizons"
 CTH_expand_our_horizons_desc:0 "Increased international trade has already begun to raise living standards for Colthaginians, and the competition is also resulting in more competitive prices for consumers. We must search far and wide to find new trade partners. This will grant us access to markets which otherwise would not have been available to us, allowing our economy to grow even more efficiently."

 CTH_establish_nature_reserves:0 "The Bounties Of Nature"
 CTH_establish_nature_reserves_desc:0 "Colthage has vast tracts of wilderness that are presently being ignored as worthless land, but in truth there is incalculable value in these wonders of nature. Of course, we must be responsible and careful when taking advantage of them, making sure to protect them so that future generations can appreciate their beauty."

 CTH_urban_development:0 "Accelerated Urbanisation"
 CTH_urban_development_desc:0 "There is a growing trend of zebras moving from the countryside into the cities. This is beneficial, since workers are more productive in urban areas, and urbanisation results in better education, housing, and safety conditions for the average citizen. By improving urban living conditions and incentivising expansion of housing and infrastructure, this growth can be sped up even further."

 CTH_harmonization_of_society:0 "Societal Harmonization"
 CTH_harmonization_of_society_desc:0 "Colthaginian society is plagued by divisions and factionalism. In a truly harmonious society, all classes should work together for the greater good. To achieve this, it is likely concessions will need to be made. Alternatively, a more radical approach could be taken, empowering the common zebra at the expense of political factions. It is up to the Sufrit to choose which path to tread."

 CTH_rehabilitating_scientifids:0 "Rehabilitating Scientifids"
 CTH_rehabilitating_scientifids_desc:0 "Members of the Scientific Clique played an important role in the modernization of Colthage, and are thus a vital part of society today. There is no doubt their expertise would be a great asset to our administration. However, something must be done to keep their political ambitions in check and ensure they don't become too dominant."

 CTH_fate_of_the_old_guard:0 "Fate Of The Old Guard"
 CTH_fate_of_the_old_guard_desc:0 "Not all generals who fought to defend the Zarcids had undying loyalty for them. Rather, they were simply fulfilling what they saw as their duty to Colthage. Now that we are the sole legitimate authority in the country, perhaps they could be convinced to fight for us."

 CTH_merits_of_meritocracy:0 "Merits Of Meritocracy"
 CTH_merits_of_meritocracy_desc:0 "The Scientifids were always strong proponents of meritocratic values and anti-corruption, and the military could benefit from these values as well. However, such ideas may conflict with democratic spirit we wish to cultivate. We must decide what to do, and if we should embrace meritocracy or not."

 CTH_implement_land_reform:0 "Implement Land Reform"
 CTH_implement_land_reform_desc:0 "Peasant unrest has been building steadily as they eagerly await the land reform that we have promised them. Now that we hold the reins of power, the time has finally come to implement it. However, it remains to be seen exactly how extensive it will be."

 CTH_amend_constitution:0 "Amending The Constitution"
 CTH_amend_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of Colthage is a great and venerable document, embodying a tradition of republicanism that dates back over a thousand years. However, it has undeniably begun to show its age. Jezabzella wishes to see it amended: times change, and our government must be able to adapt and change along with them."

 CTH_the_plantation_system:0 "The Plantation System"
 CTH_the_plantation_system_desc:0 "For the majority of our history, the largest percentage of the Colthaginian population was engaged in subsistence agriculture. Zamilcar's reforms ushered in large-scale commercial agriculture, creating a system of plantations focused on growing cash crops and rubber. While highly profitable, this might not be the best for our people."

 CTH_crystallize_harmonisation:0 "Crystallized Harmonization"
 CTH_crystallize_harmonisation_desc:0 "For many years, our citizens have wished to tear down Zarcid oppression and rebuild a free society that would allow them to finally flourish. After much hard work and struggle, this reality is beginning to take shape: our efforts have borne fruit and Colthage is becoming a truly harmonious society, with new values of freedom and cooperation taking hold across the nation."

 CTH_cultural_pluralism:0 "Cultural Pluralism"
 CTH_cultural_pluralism_desc:0 "Colthage is not a republic of Colthaginians alone, but also Coltvans, Coltdarians and even alpacas. This diversity is what makes us strong, and must not be suppressed. Minority groups within our society will be allowed to maintain their distinctive cultural identities, values, and practices: the state shall not discriminate towards any creature."

 CTH_seek_allies:0 "Seek Allies"
 CTH_seek_allies_desc:0 "It's a dangerous world out there, and we simply won't be able to confront it alone. In the face of the threat posed by the rising tide of tyranny, we need to establish alliances with other free nations nearby, so that we may stand together in defence of liberty."

 CTH_the_popular_army:0 "The Popular Army"
 CTH_the_popular_army_desc:0 "Colthage does not need an army of professional soldiers or foreign mercenaries. It needs an army of the people, by the people, for the people. It is the duty of the citizens to defend their homes and wield military power within their very own hooves. Only then can the common folk truly be empowered and democracy safeguarded from those who hunger for control."

 CTH_negotiate_about_kar_alpaka:0 "Negotiate For Kar-Alpaka"
 CTH_negotiate_about_kar_alpaka_desc:0 "Llambet unlawfully took control of the Kar-Alpaka region in the aftermath of the Storm King's invasion because they wanted access to the sea. If we agree to provide them what they want, perhaps they will give our lands back. And if not... Well, we do have a big stick."

 CTH_liberate_coltdar:0 "Liberate Coltdar"
 CTH_liberate_coltdar_desc:0 "Taking advantage while Colthage was engulfed in chaos, Coltdar was invaded by the brutish Quaggatai horde. The population of the region is still suffering terribly under their rule. We need to take this land back, and liberate them from such ghastly oppression."

 CTH_overthrow_the_khan:0 "Overthrow The Khan"
 CTH_overthrow_the_khan_desc:0 "To our south, the Quaggatai Khan rules over the plains with an iron hoof, oppressing countless innocent creatures. This despicable regime will pose an existential threat to us as long as we allow them to remain in power: they must be overthrown to secure peace and democracy in the region."

 CTH_zumidian_question:0 "The Zumidian Question"
 CTH_zumidian_question_desc:0 "After the Storm King's defeat, the victorious Hippogriffs took the devastated lands of Zumidia under their protection. However, rather than making it a temporary affair, their occupation continues with no end in sight. The Zumidians should be able to decide their own fate: it is likely that they wish to be free once again. If so, their will must be respected."

 CTH_the_great_white_fleet:0 "The Great White Fleet"
 CTH_the_great_white_fleet_desc:0 "Our outdated fleet is incapable of defending the country's economic and commercial interests elsewhere in the world. The time has come to construct new, modern battleships to make Colthage a real sea power once again. They will all be painted white—the national colour of Colthage and a symbol of purity and peace."

 CTH_make_air_force:0 "The Colthaginian Air Force"
 CTH_make_air_force_desc:0 "Of all the military lessons which have been clearly demonstrated in recent years, most pressing is that the importance of air power cannot be overlooked any longer. We must not delay in creating our own dedicated branch for air service. The only question is how exactly this new air force should be organized."

 CTH_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
 CTH_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "The best way to avoid unnecessary casualties is to bombard the enemy from afar with precise shelling and clear the way for our own forces to advance. By dedicating ourselves to artillery production and technological innovation, we can make use of superior firepower to achieve rapid dominance on the battlefield."

 CTH_republican_special_forces:0 "Republican Special Forces"
 CTH_republican_special_forces_desc:0 "We must accept the reality that when it comes to conducting high-risk actions such as reconnaissance, hostage rescue, and sabotage, the Sacred Band is simply not up to the task. A new force of modern, elite soldiers will need to be created and trained: one able to operate in all environments, and use unconventional combat skills and equipment."

 CTH_volunteer_bonus:0 "Form Volunteer Brigades"
 CTH_volunteer_bonus_desc:0 "We have learned the hard way that Harmony must be fought for, but fighting for it alone can be challenging. At this very moment, there are other free nations of the world that need our help in their own struggles against tyranny. It is our sacred duty to support the cause of liberty and lend our aid to all the oppressed creatures of the world."

 CTH_injustice_anywhere:0 "Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere"
 CTH_injustice_anywhere_desc:0 "We can not afford to simply rest on our laurels while nearby nations oppress their citizens and rob their wealth. If we allow the seeds of evil to fester and grow within our neighbours, it will not be long before the danger threatens Colthage as well. We must be willing to act quickly and decisively to pre-empt such threats—to preserve peace, no matter the cost."

 CTH_the_shining_beacon:0 "The Shining Beacon"
 CTH_the_shining_beacon_desc:0 "Under our administration, Colthage has seen a wondrous renewal. Once mired in strife and injustice, it has been transformed into a true democracy: a prosperous haven of freedom. All citizens finally have a say in government, and have the liberty to live their lives however they wish. Now the eyes of creatures all across the world are upon us, looking to us for inspiration.

 CTH_fate_of_the_clique:0 "Fate Of The Clique"
 CTH_fate_of_the_clique_desc:0 "The members of the Scientific Clique have a long and controversial history. During the past few decades they greatly helped with the modernization of the nation, while at the same time providing backing for an authoritarian regime.

 CTH_monument_to_the_revolution_desc:0 "The struggle to overthrow the Zarcid regime and crush any other enemies of the people in Colthage was bloody and many lost their lives.

 CTH_hunt_down_bandits:0 "Hunt Down Bandits"
 CTH_hunt_down_bandits_desc:0 "The collapse of law and order during the Storm King's invasion resulted in a bandit infestation that continues to persist. Many bandits aligned with the Revolution, while some did not. Regardless, the truth remains that they are all criminals who must be dealt with. The time of innocent zebras living in fear of lawless violence must come to an end!"

 CTH_factionalism_into_institutionalism:0 "From Factionalism Into Institutionalism"
 CTH_factionalism_into_institutionalism_desc:0 "Colthaginian politics have long been dominated by informal factions which try to sway senators to their side while doing their best to undermine the ruling government. For the sake of peace and order, a Griffonian-style system of political parties must be introduced. These formal organizations will abandon cloak and daggers in favour of democratic legitimacy."

 CTH_the_federal_amendment:0 "The Federal Amendment"
 CTH_the_federal_amendment_desc:0 "The constitution of Colthage did not originally specify if the nation should have a federal or a unitary structure. This resulted in a bloody civil war between centralists and federalists, which the former won. But it is clear now that the centralised model has failed. A constitutional amendment must be introduced to empower the states, turning Colthage into a federation."

 CTH_national_banking_reform:0 "National Banking Reform"
 CTH_national_banking_reform_desc:0 "Instability caused by the Revolution devastated Colthage's patrician banks, causing many to go bankrupt. We are left with little choice but to create a new institution responsible for managing the currency and monetary policy of the nation—our fractured banking system will be replaced with a new nationwide network of banks under the control of the new Central Bank of Colthage."

 CTH_heal_wounds_of_nation:0 "Heal The Wounds Of The Nation"
 CTH_heal_wounds_of_nation_desc:0 "The nation still bears deep scars from the Storm King's invasion, as well as from decades of Zarcid corruption and mismanagement. The economy remains devastated, but we are finally able to implement a programme of recovery to help our citizens prosper, free from oppressive tyranny."

 CTH_limited_land_reform:0 "Moderate Land Reform"
 CTH_limited_land_reform_desc:0 "The constitution allows the government to redistribute ownership of land as it sees fit, and many smallholders barely own enough to sustain themselves. Land reform is necessary, but it should not be taken too far, as radical changes might destroy the economy of the nation and lead to a return to subsistence agriculture."
 
 CTH_muralism:0 "Support The Mural Movement"
 CTH_muralism_desc:0 "The government will sponsor gifted artists to paint murals on public buildings across the country, depicting not the past of Zonician civilization or following Italian styles, but depicting modern Colthaginian culture with the spirit of the revolution. The aim is to unite the nation under a new shared identity and simultaneously educating those who are ignorant."
 
 CTH_increased_wages:0 "Increase Worker Wages"
 CTH_increased_wages_desc:0 "Many promises were made to industrial workers in order to gain their support in the past political struggle. Since the urban proletariat played an important role in the Constitutionalist victory, we owe it to them to start delivering on these promises. Every labourer deserves fair compensation for their work, and laws will be enacted to guarantee this."
 
 CTH_confederation_of_labourers:0 "Form The Colthaginian Federation of Labour"
 CTH_confederation_of_labourers_desc:0 "The RCCW has long been a thorn in the side of Colthage: their reckless mission to destroy capitalism continues to undermine the economy. It is up to us to strike a new balance between capital and labour; one that benefits workers without throwing the country into chaos. A new government organization, the CFL, will be founded and all other labour union federations will be broken up and barred from striking."

 CTH_fate_of_the_popular_assembly:0 "Role Of The Popular Assembly"
 CTH_fate_of_the_popular_assembly_desc:0 "The constitution outlines two legislative bodies for the Republic: The Senate and the Popular Assembly. However, some senators have questioned the need for a bicameral system, while others claim the Popular Assembly remains too weak. The Sufrit needs to intervene to resolve this dispute."

 CTH_restore_civilian_governance_in_coltva:0 "Restore Civilian Governance In Coltva"
 CTH_restore_civilian_governance_in_coltva_desc:0 "For many years now, Coltva has been governed side-by-side by a civilian governor and the Commander of the East. With the region now peaceful and liberated from foreign rule, it is time to end military intervention into civilian affairs and allow Coltvan states to elect their own senators for the Colthaginian Senate."

 CTH_separation_of_temples_and_state:0 "Separation Of Temples And State"
 CTH_separation_of_temples_and_state_desc:0 "Thus far the relationship between religious temples and the government has been somewhat ambiguous, but the constitution makes it clear that the state of Colthage is irreligious. The time has come to enforce these articles and fully separate temples from politics—both religious involvement in government affairs and government involvement in religious affairs shall be strictly forbidden."

 CTH_healthcare_reforms:0 "Implement Healthcare Reforms"
 CTH_healthcare_reforms_desc:0 "Up to this point, Colthage has never really had excellent healthcare, but it's time for that to change. The government will take an expanded role in providing healthcare services to citizens, and vaccinations will be made mandatory. After all, the well-being of our citizens must always be our primary concern."

 CTH_national_road_commission:0 "Establish The National Road Commission"
 CTH_national_road_commission_desc:0 "While railroads do a fine enough job of connecting cities, paved roads are required to connect the countryside. This will not only increase rural economic activity, but also allow the government to exert more control over remote areas. To accomplish this, a new government agency will oversee the construction and maintenance of the federal road network."

 CTH_foreign_property_treaty:0 "The Buckarel Treaty"
 CTH_foreign_property_treaty_desc:0 "The recent political upheaval, and accompanying property seizures, have caused many foreign companies to take a hostile stance towards our government.

 CTH_power_to_the_party_desc:0 "The Revolution is threatened from within by warring factions that—if left unchecked—will undo all of our hard work as they furiously clash for power. The only way to guarantee stability, prosperity, peace, and liberty is to entrench the position of the Colthaginian Revolutionary Party. To accomplish this, we might have to employ some... special methods in the next elections."

 CTH_modern_professional_army:0 "A Modern Professional Army"
 CTH_modern_professional_army_desc:0 "Sufrit Orzagid is a staunch believer in modern principles of warfare and wishes for Colthage's army to adopt them as well. Now that the political situation has stabilised, we can finally phase out mercenaries, who are motivated purely by greed and have no loyalty to the Republic's principles, and transition to a strictly professional force fully focused on national defence."

 CTH_officer_standards:0 "Improved Officer Standards"
 CTH_officer_standards_desc:0 "Colthage's army has long suffered under the command of officers ranging from corrupt to outright incompetent. To remedy this, formal military training will now be required, to be provided at the newly established Heroic Military College.

 CTH_modern_equipment:0 "Fund Development Of Armaments"
 CTH_modern_equipment_desc:0 "As a consequence of technological developments, the nature of warfare itself is changing rapidly.

 CTH_modern_ships:0 "Rejuvenate Shipbuilding"
 CTH_modern_ships_desc:0 "It is not enough to modernize the designs of our ships; we need to modernize our shipbuilding industry as well.

However, the industrialization of firepower has increased the amount of munitions required by soldiers, and logistical failures have the potential to cripple entire operations. The fact is that good logistics are crucial to maintaining the efficiency and reliability of our army."

 CTH_finest_army_on_the_equator:0 "The Finest Army On The Equator"
 CTH_finest_army_on_the_equator_desc:0 "Constant reforms and merciless training, combined with the experience amassed during our recent campaigns, has helped mould our army into the finest fighting force in Northern Zebrica. These brave zebras, steadfast in their loyalty and bravery, shall serve as the iron bastion defending Colthage from foreign domination."

 CTH_remove_term_limit:0 "Remove The Term Limit"
 CTH_remove_term_limit_desc:0 "According to the constitution, the Sufrit of Colthage cannot be re-elected infinitely. However, it is clear to all that without Orzagid's visionary leadership, the Republic is doomed to descend once more into chaos and civil war. An emergency amendment must be made to remedy this problem and save Colthage!"

This army was unable to survive the Storm King's invasion and was scattered to the winds. All that remains is the elite Sacred Band of Colthage which faithfully followed Zalathel to victory. After the Storm King's death, the Colthaginian army was quickly rebuilt by relying once again on mercenaries, recruited both from home and abroad.

Yet successful economic reforms managed to calm the populace and the situation finally seemed stable.\n\nThen the Storm King arrived.\n\nNow Zamilcar is dead and [Root.GetLeader]'s hold over the country is tenuous at best.

The rich and powerful Colthaginian landowners justified their rule by claiming to be their defenders, yet they had failed in this duty. So what right did they have to keep the common zebra in chains?\n\nOne rebel leader, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, managed to rally the Coltvans to his cause and is continuing his war of resistance against the Colthaginian government. §RIf we do not deal with the unrest in the region, this could spill over to be a full-blown rebellion.§!"

Now, instead of being appointed by the Sufrit, the senators of the Colthaginian Senate are elected by the states, with every Federal State having its own representatives. In practice, this means that without the popular support of the citizens of each state, it is impossible to pass legislation on a federal level. In addition, the states are relatively autonomous, meaning the support of their governors is needed to implement changes on the local level. Senators from each state generally belong to one of four main political parties in Colthage:\n\n§gThe Colthaginian Revolutionary Party§! is the current ruling party of the republic. The sufrit, Zarvad Orzagid, is its founding member and original leader. The party was formed by former constitutionalists and they continue to advocate for similar policies, which are a mix of conservative and liberal ones. Generally, they support the post-revolution status quo and oppose radical changes to society.\n\nThe §PParty of the Harmonic Movement§! has for the first time drawn a clear line between former harmonites and constitutionalists, making it clear that the two are distinct groups with their own goals. Like before, the supporters of harmony continue to see Equestria as the ideal model of a perfect society which should be emulated in Colthage. In practice, they advocate for grassroots democracy, class cooperation, social welfare and a proactive foreign policy.\n\nThe §LNational Action Front§! is an attempt by former Zarcid supporters and members of the military to retain their influence in Colthaginian politics. For purely pragmatic reasons, they are willing to work in a democratic framework, at least for now. Their party program contains a dazzling mixture of nationalistic, xenophobic, militant and authoritarian policies.\n\nThe §RLabour Party§! is the smallest of the four major parties, having its roots in the syndicalist RCCW organisation. Its members largely have an urban, either proletarian or academic, background, and they continue to push for better working conditions, labour reforms and radical social equality.\n\nCurrently, senators of [?CTH_total_senator_support] states support the government's policy proposals."

 colthage_coltvan.1.t:0 "The New Commander of The East"
 colthage_coltvan.1.d_annizalid:0 ""Father, how did you deal with generals as problematic as these?" Zalathel Zarca, Sufrit of Colthage and heir to the Zarca Family's power, sighed as he looked up to the portrait of his father. The only answer he received was Zamilcar's proud gaze staring down from his office's wall. Taking power had been easy, but one particular problem of the Zarca inheritance was frustrating Zalathel: Coltva.\n\nJust like himself, the Coltvans had fought a war of attrition against the Storm King, but now they resisted Colthaginian control as well. Under the guise of land reform, rebel leader Zeshmunazash Zeirutid rallied the forces of Coltva. The situation was dire. Although the Colthaginian forces outgunned the rebels for now, they lacked a clear strategy. To crush the rebels, Zalathel needed to appoint one of his generals to lead the way, as he himself was indispensable in Colthage.\n\nThree candidates had come forward, although sadly both of his brothers had passed up the job. First to apply was Bezelshazzar Zerutra, ever looking to increase his own influence. It was no secret that the zebra was an addict, but he could lead a fight. If given enough incentive, Bezelshazzar would pacify Coltva, but Zalathel worried about increasing the sly general's power.\n\nThe second applicant was Jebzel Zoblos, whose distaste for the Coltvan people was well known. This zebra would do whatever was within her power to crush the rebels. But she had a one-track mind, and Zalathel feared that the general might pass up opportunities to undermine the rebellion in different ways than brute force. The final candidate was Ziliad Annizalid, a general who sympathised with the constitutionalist faction. By all accounts Ziliad was a decent zebra, and his mild manners might help legitimise Colthaginian rule and make Zeirutid seem as the ruthless party. However, Zalathel feared the general might try to advance his own faction in Coltva, replacing one problem for another. After weighing the candidates for a while longer, the Sufrit decided to name as Commander of the East... "
 colthage_coltvan.1.d_no_annizalid:0 ""Father, how did you deal with generals as problematic as these?" Zalathel Zarca, Sufrit of Colthage and heir to the Zarca Family's power, sighed as he looked up to the portrait of his father. The only answer he received was Zamilcar's proud gaze staring down from his office's wall. Taking power had been easy, but one particular problem of the Zarca inheritance was frustrating Zalathel: Coltva.\n\nJust like himself, the Coltvans had fought a war of attrition against the Storm King, but now they resisted Colthaginian control as well. Under the guise of land reform, rebel leader Zeshmunazash Zeirutid rallied the forces of Coltva. The situation was dire. Although the Colthaginian forces outgunned the rebels for now, they lacked a clear strategy. To crush the rebels, Zalathel needed to appoint one of his generals to lead the way, as he himself was indispensable in Colthage.\n\nTwo candidates had come forward, although sadly both of his brothers had passed up the job. First to apply was Bezelshazzar Zerutra, ever looking to increase his own influence. It was no secret that the zebra was an addict, but he could lead a fight. If given enough incentive, Bezelshazzar would pacify Coltva, but Zalathel worried about increasing the sly general's power.\n\nThe other applicant was Jebzel Zoblos, whose distaste for the Coltvan people was well known. This zebra would do whatever was within her power to crush the rebels. But she had a one-track mind, and Zalathel feared that the general might pass up opportunities to undermine the rebellion in different ways than brute force. There was also another zebra Zalathel had in mind who could've been a good candidate: Ziliad Annizalid. Unfortunately, he had proven himself to be a traitor and had defected to the constitutionalists, so he was now sitting behind bars. After weighing the two available candidates for a while longer, the Sufrit decided to name as Commander of the East... "

 colthage_coltvan.2.d:0 "Couriers and criers spread the news through the towns of Coltva: General Bezelshazzar Zerutra had arrived with a fresh contingent of troops and a mandate from the Sufrit to restore order. His first order of business was to impose martial law. Several of the protections of the Colthaginian Constitution would be suspended in Coltva and more powers granted to the military over local police and military. Aiding the rebels in any way, such as providing directions, lodgings or supplies, would be criminal and was subject to trial by military tribunal.\n\nThe news had a chilling effect on the Coltvans, with many of the zebra on the fence about the Zeirutids deciding to withdraw support. Another proclamation the general had spread was even more surprising to the Coltvans. Bezelshazzar intended to make his new headquarters in the Metzudah quarter of Kizil-Zeb, the historical centre of the town. This was a bold move and many zebras considered this a direct challenge to Zeshmunazash. Abandon his influence in the city and suffer a propaganda defeat, or fight, with Colthage still having the upper hoof in soldiers and materiel and risk losing it all.\n\nFor now, Kizil-Zeb's usual garrison was still in place, a light enough detachment to allow the Zeirutids free roam of the city, as Bezelshazzar secured other strategic locations first, intend on giving the rebels time to respond to his challenge. The Colthaginians played their first move, and Coltva held its breath to see if Zeirutid would let himself be caught off-guard."

 colthage_coltvan.3.d:0 "Commander of the East Bezelshazzar Zerutra looked out over the city of Kizil-Zeb from his headquarters, positioned on a hill outside the city. His troops had split up into multiple columns, preparing to move into the city from different angles. The start of the operation would not be much trouble, with the modern outskirts of the city consisting of broad straight lanes with clear avenues of attack. The real problem would be the Metzudah quarter, the hilltop which once housed a fort from which the ancient Colthaginian trading post of Kizil-Zeb grew. The streets were windy and narrow, with the buildings crammed against each other in a tight maze.\n\nBut general Zerutra knew that it was not the layout of the city which made this operation so peculiar. As he peered through his binoculars, he spied for any sign of enemy movement in the city below, but he could not pierce through the tight inner-city alleys. The real difficulty of this operation was his lack of knowledge of the enemy's intention. If they had left the city open, then the challenge would be to ascertain that without having to ransack every building in the city. If not, Bezelshazzar would only find out when his troops would be stuck in close quarters fighting, denying him the use of his artillery. Of course, Bezelshazzar had full confidence in his professional soldiers in a pitched battle.\n\nThe general smirked, as he had the rebels right where he wanted them. Either they trapped themselves in a siege, or they fled, showing they were nothing more than frightened peasants. Satisfied with himself, he retreated into his tent, closing the flap and taking out his favourite spirit-expanding substance. He grimaced as his eyes lit up in anticipation."

As the vehicle drove into Kizil-Zeb, his aide tried to explain the events of the day to his superior. The rebels had fled, and except for a few close calls with nervous soldiers and scared civilians, the city had been taken without incident. Although Bezelshazzar's eyes barely showed a hint of acknowledgement, his mouth curled into a sheepish smirk. What followed was a hastily arranged parade through the Metzudah quarter, with the citizens of the city watching their 'conqueror' transition from an almost catatonic state to pretending to be a god in his motorcade, slowly back to normal at the end of the day. Bezelshazzar's troops, already well aware of their general's inclinations, tried to ignore the embarrassment as best they could.\n\nHowever, little changed. Bezelshazzar's troops now had the unenviable task of keeping a tight watch over his new headquarters, with the city still being an refuge for rebels, while Zeirutid had his hooves free, able to strike wherever he wished from his hideouts in the mountains. Furthermore, any propaganda effect the Colthaginians had hoped to gain from the capture of the city was nullified by Bezelshazzar's absurd behaviour during the parade. Word of the debacle had even reached back to Colthage itself, with the Sufrit writing an angry letter to his general, demanding some sort of success, although The Commander of the East did not seem fazed by Zarca's threats.\n\nThe general would leave the occupation to his aides, while he locked himself in his office, devising new plans to break the Cotlvan resistance. And behind closed doors, he often chose to forget about it all..."

 colthage_coltvan.5.d:0 "The Commander of the East, general Bezelshazzar Zerutra, sat on a chair on the balcony of his headquarters in Kizil-Zeb, looking at the bunch of papers he had received a day ago, and then out over the city, and then back over the papers again. He sighed and took a sip of water. No alcohol, no drugs, not even a pipe. Not on the day that everything hung in the balance. In front of him lay terms given to Bezelshazzar by Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. The rebel leader had them smuggled into the compound with a booze delivery, his signed letter politely hoping that peace could give more pleasure than even the stiff drinks. On a personal note, Zeirutid thanked the Colthaginian for taking over Kizil-Zeb without bloodshed, and mentioned how Colthaginian soldiers often acted more justly than the police officers they were assisting.\n\nThe terms themselves, Bezelshazzar had to admit, were reasonable. Though worded with the skills of a seasoned negotiator, the terms were plain and without the ambiguous language which treaties were usually known for. However cunning his adversary was, he was not underhoofed. Colthage would retain sovereignty over Coltva, but the locals would be allowed a great deal of autonomy. The general had never been much of a farmer, but the papers spoke in passionate words about a land reform plan Zeirutid wished to implement, which would allow all Coltvans to take care of themselves.\n\nSo now the unenviable decision was up to Bezelshazzar. Would he accept these terms, and defend his compromise with the rebels he was sent to root out to the Senate and the Sufrit? Or would he keep fighting these tenacious farmers? If he chose the latter, Zeirutid's letter plainly recommended him to save the alcohol for the Colthaginian wounded."

 colthage_coltvan.6.d:0 "The august halls of the Colthaginian Senate were busier than usual, as the scandal of the Commander of the East reached its conclusion. On the speaker's stand stood general Zerutra, surrounded by stone benches full of ill-humoured senators. Bezelshazzar recognised several senior officers amongst them, and when they noticed him looking, he was met by angry gazes. The murmuring died down as the eldest senator, president of the Senate by ancient precedent, tapped his staff on the ground and motioned for Bezelshazzar to speak.\n\n"Honoured senators, Colthaginians, I come bearing the gift of peace, yet my name is used in these halls as if I were her killer." Accusations of treason and addiction already started flying towards the general from the officers and their militarist supporters. In the following hour, Bezelshazzar spoke to a tumultuous senate about land reform and regionalism, becoming an unwilling advocate for the Coltvan cause. Afterwards, the first motion passed moved for the Sufrit to appoint a new Commander of the East, a sensitive political blow questioning Zalathel Zarca's authority directly.\n\nThe stern-faced Sufrit declined his turn to speak, and after the Senate session was adjourned, met up with Bezelshazzar, flanked by two Sacred Band soldiers. "Good afternoon, general Zerutra. First of all, I regret the Senate's decision today."\n\nThe general frowned, surprised by the Sufrit's seeming mildness. "It is understandable, if anything they would have wanted the final say on the agreement, although I doubt they would have accepted."\n\n"You have to make difficult decisions in the field, Zerutra, and every soldier lost in Coltva would have been missed elsewhere." Now the general was truly baffled, did Zarca become soft? The Sufrit noticed his general's surprise and let out a rare smile. "Do not think I agree with Zeirutid's plans. He is still a traitor and will get justice in time. But Colthage cannot be divided, not now. Have a good day, general." Bezelshazzar nodded dutifully, although privately he strongly doubted if Zalathel would ever be able to get Zeirutid in front of a judge. The general shook his head when he left the Senate himself, taking a sip of some of the drink Zeirutid had sent him weeks earlier."

Under his hoof, the leader of the Coltvan rebellion was holding rolls of pamphlets. His compatriots, descending the steep path after him, did the same. "Careful now, I will take it personally if any of you falls and gets there before me." Zeirutid joked, his eyes focused downwards, careful with every step. There had been a lot of grumbling when the rebel leader had asked for volunteers for delivering pamphlets, as his fellow rebels all styled themselves dashing heroes instead of delivery colts. The grumbling turned into embarrassment when the rebel leader announced he'd just do it himself, after which volunteers rapidly applied.\n\nThe zebra did not stay on the streets of the village for long and hurried to a larger building where they were quickly led in by an elderly zebra mare who smiled brightly. "Zeshmunazash, in the flesh!" She would say warmly, before inspecting the stacks of papers the Coltvan rebels gratefully put down. "We will have these spread over Coltva and beyond soon enough. I wish they didn't contain such awful news..." The mare would sigh and shake her head.\n\n"Coltvans need to know what is happening. The Commander of the East has crossed the line. Any zebra who was hoping for a peaceful solution cannot look away anymore."\n\nAgain the mare would sigh. "It is simple when you bring it like that, I suppose."

Perhaps another zebra would have been a better fit."\n\nZalathel Zarca wheezed at the zebra's accusation, impatient with the governor who was twenty years his senior. This stallion, who had been in charge of Coltva until the Commander of the East arrived, was a leftover from his father's inner circle. "Governor, you ask for patience, while I have waited to act for months. You are the one who did not manage to bring back order after the yetis were driven out. I do not care at all for your military advice. Tell me about this situation properly or go back to your duties."\n\nSensing that he had little to gain from questioning the Sufrit's decisions, the governor elaborated on the Coltvans instead. "Zeirutid grows bolder by the day, encouraged by his swelling numbers. Due to, ahem..." The zebra stallion coughed politely, "Recent events, many Coltvans that were ambivalent towards us have drifted to the rebel camp. Your commander has broken what little trust the common Coltvan had left for us. Only the towns with a direct armed presence are still controlled by us and even just supplying our troops is getting expensive, as the soldiers no longer trust local suppliers."\n\nThe governor eyed at the Sufrit expectantly. He had known the reign of Zamilcar Zarca, and expected Zalathel, like his father, to come up with some sort of creative solution. The sufrit, meanwhile, nodded solemnly. "So be it, I shall dispatch new orders to the garrison and mobilise reserve forces." He then turned his attention directly to the governor. "I believe we are resigned to trot the path of war, it is the only way left to save our Republic. Prepare your staff to evacuate from Kizil-Zeb immediately if the worst should occur."\n\nThe governor frowned, "You see no other way, my sufrit?" Zalathel shook his head."

Truly the gods themselves could not even enjoy such comforts, if it wasn't for that blasted buzzing.

Bezelshazzar's adjutant rushed towards him and saluted, the rest of the general's staff waiting at the entrance. "Sir, the rebels, they are fighting back. They say Zeirutid is in the city, but we can't get to him. What do we do sir?"\n\nGeneral Zerutra took a deep breath, and he seemed to be coming back to his senses. In his head an incredible migraine started stirring, instead of on a cloud he found himself at the edge of a roaring volcano. "We must stop it, before it is too late." The commander stated with a fearful gaze, barely present.\n\nHis adjutant looked befuddled, stammering back.

Half an hour later, the roar of dozens of howitzers silenced the volcano and brought the general back into reality. "Holy mother Aztarte..." He muttered, running towards the sound. "Cease fire, cease fire by the gods!" The general screamed his lungs out and managed to stop the barrage mid-fire. However, the damage was done.

Once in the province, the mare had her forces disperse, with sizable groups heading for Kizil-Zeb, Coltartan, and even across the interior to Marelaka. All urban settlements would receive a sizeable influx of soldiers. At first, it seemed like the new Commander of the East merely intended to strengthen the garrison, but nothing could be further from the truth. Arriving in Kizil-Zeb at the head of her forces, Jebzel Zoblos would be quick to dash any hope of a gentle regime. She commanded her forces to set up camp, and ordered all non Coltvans to leave the city. Within hours, Colthaginian soldiers had set up checkpoints at every access road, and patrols had been set out to make sure no zebra could leave the city. Telecom-cables were cut, making communication to the outside difficult. Even sea-access was denied by a destroyer blocking the port. Meanwhile, the same scene would repeat itself around cities and towns all over Coltva.\n\nAfter the initial shock had worn off, several zebras from both in and outside Kizil-Zeb would attempt to come close to the Colthaginian perimeter, but were sent away, with warning shots if they were insistent. General Zoblos was watching with glee as she saw more and more of the city's inhabitants eye her perimeter with concern or desperation, as the realisation of what had happened sank in. Eventually, she ordered her soldiers to bring one of the braver Coltvans who had been hanging around one of the roadblocks for a while to her. The young Coltvan, barely a stallion, would look at the Colthaginian general with a contemptuous glare, held down by two of Jebzel's soldiers. "Let me go, you brutes!" The zebra demanded, struggling against the soldiers in vain while Jebzel smiled amusedly.\n\n"You Coltvans can do nothing but squirm after all..." She leaned closer, grinning widely. "Until you filthy peasants stop resisting the rule of your superiors, you and all the others in those mud huts over there will not be receiving any company, understood?"\nThe Coltvan's eyes widened and his squirming only grew more intense. "You will not get away with this, you filthy daughter of Zargon! May the Deeplord swallow you and drag Colthage down with it!"\nThe stallion's curse would just make Commander of the East chuckle. "Take it up with Zeirutid. And tell your leader it is up to him to decide if you will ever see fresh food again." Jebzel gestured towards her soldiers and they carried the young stallion away."

As always, Zamilcar did not provide any advice, just a stern gaze. Zeshmunazash Zeirutid was the last zebra the Sufrit expected a letter from, not least a letter so polite, with attached photographs and reports from Colthaginian civil servants in Coltva:\n\n"Dear Zalathel,\n\nI write to you in the understanding that we both share the common decency of zebra, by which I mean a basic respect for sentient life, especially when it comes to civilians and foals. That common decency seems to not be universal, however, as your new Commander of the East has demonstrated. By besieging the cities of Coltva (which are Colthaginian cities!) she has forced the civilian population into the conflict, causing much unnecessary suffering and a lack of food. Although I oppose you politically, I believe you understand your duty as Sufrit is to defend Colthaginian citizens. Therefore, I request that you replace Jebzel Zoblos with a zebra who is not willing to endanger civilian lives. In case information about the gravity of the situation has not reached you yet, I have attached photographs and reports by your civil servants about the extent of Zoblos' crimes.\nI implore you to make the right decision.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nZeshmunazash Zeirutid"\n\nZalathel had no idea how the Coltvan even managed to send him a letter, and he could only guess the zebra's intentions. Zarca had to admit Zoblos' methods were excessive, to put it mildly. If Zeirutid was desperate enough to beg for a replacement, however, could that mean the blockades were actually working? If that was the case, perhaps this strategy might save more lives than it would cost, in the long term."

"We escape the blockade and head for the mountains, where we have freedom of movement. For that we need to break this blockade. Everything depends on speed and coordination. Wait for my signal flare, then strike as one to overwhelm the enemy. We can do this; I will see you on the other side." With those words, Zeirutid cut off the transmission and loaded his flare gun and swung his rifle over his shoulder. Without a word the zebra headed outside, towards the rally point for his unit.\n\nHalf an hour later, the silence was deafening. Zeirutid's left his unit on the edge of the city, sneaking forward himself. There he was, prone in the tall grass, as close to the entrenched Colthaginians as he dared. This had to be enough time for all units to assemble. The Coltvan reached for his flare gun and aimed towards the sky. The flare set of a cascade of action. Coltvan battle cries came from behind him and confused shouts from the front. With unflinching focus, the rebel leader grabbed his rifle and took aim at the trenches. The ringing of his shot cut through the air; the scream of his target muffled by the cranking of the bolt. A second shot sowed confusion and fear as zebra dug for cover. More flares lit up the sky and searchlights aimed towards his comrades. Zeirutid's third shot was already drowned out by fire from all sides. His eyes lost focus as he heard the hoofsteps of his comrades' race towards the trenches. Leaping to his hooves himself, Zeirutid joined them into the fray. His hooves hit the sand of the trenches. To the left a flash illuminated a frightened young Colthaginian face. With a rushed gallop and the butt of his rifle, she falls down. Safe for now. Breathing heavily, the Coltvan looks around to see only his comrades left standing in the trench, but lights and shouting in the distant indicated Jebzel' forces would soon come to plug the hole. Zeirutid again grabs his flare gun, the second flare signalling to the Coltvans it was time to scatter."

The captured zebra inside looked like a mess. Her mane was ruffled and unkept, her eyes, which had big bags under them, stared at the general groggily. Jebzel sat down in front of Zeirutid. "Good afternoon, prisoner."\n\nBefore Jebzel could say more, Zarishat interrupted, her voiced drenched in irony. "Jebzel Zoblos. You have got the wrong sibling, you just missed him. Zesh is out of town."\nThe taunt managed to wipe the smile of Jebzel's face. "No, I think you are exactly who I need, Zarishat. Your brother has been quite the thorn in my side, you see."\n\n"You and me both, general." No change in tone. Now even the ever-confident Jebzel gave the Zeirutid a confused look. Was this an act? The sister seemed nothing like the brother, yet her sources told her Zarishat was with Zeshmunazash for most of the rebellion. Maybe this was just the entrance she needed. Her grin returned.\n\n"If that is so, why don't you help me get rid of this thorn? I will get you and any zebra you want out of here in no time. And you can get your home back too, if you want." Focus appeared in Zarishat's disinterested eyes, but nevertheless, the offer seemed to not phase her.\n"I'd help if I could. If Zesh had one hideout he'd have been caught already. Listen, he is way smarter than you are. If you care about your career just give up, that's my advice to you."\nJebzel started to wheeze and punched her hoof onto the table. "Who do you think you are talking to, you filthy Coltvan? I don't think you understand. If you, or any of the other prisoners related to the rebels, don't give me something, I will have you all killed!"\n\n"Thus proving my point. For every zebra you kill, you will create a small village of rebels. Murder has a way of getting zebras riled up."

At the same time, the burden of proof needed lowered and the sentence for any rebellious act was heightened. Death would be the only acceptable sentence. But Captain Pazeb was convinced the general did not sign these sentences herself. Surely then she would understand the stress she had put her officers under with these orders!\n\nAfter another big sip of rum, the zebra took a paper in his hoof. "Sixteen... Not even an adult. Did not show up to his landlord for work three days ago. Known slacker. Three citizens testify suspicious behaviour. Yea, yea, I'm sure some bastard was looking for a way to fire you, young stallion. Poor sod." With a flick of the pen Pazeb signed the death sentence.\n\n"Right, what have we here?" The next paper contained the details of an elderly mare. "Some sort of innkeeper? Already well above the age to retire. I don't think she can hold a rifle anymore. Let's hope no zebra will miss you. Nothing can be done."\n\nA third. A fourth. A group of six. Then Captain Pazeb lost count. Nothing can be done. Ten more? Another zebra might be worse. How big was today's stack? At least he cared. He'd say to himself. He would intervene. If it was something really bad. That's why the captain had to play along. There would be a time to make his stand. Pazeb fantasised about his heroic intervention.

Ramshackle guard towers were manned day and night, overseeing the prisoners inside. Every day, columns of prisoners were marched into the camp. Some were wearing suits, some poor workers' clothes. Young, old, stallion, mare. The only thing the prisoners shared was their Coltvan heritage and having been designated a 'dangerous element' by Jebzel Zoblos. The barracks the Coltvans had to sleep in were shoddily made and the beds were whatever the Colthaginian soldier could find for them. Despite his orders, newly promoted Camp Commander Pazeb worked with local farmers to get the prisoners as much food as he could. None of his subordinates protested. No soldier lifted a hoof when he arranged pickups for arrested foals. Most of the soldiers guarding the camp were silent, only speaking when communication was necessary. Then there were the few who were louder than ever. Who could not care for the judgemental looks of the others as they consumed their lust for power over the innocent.\n\nDespite following his orders in the most gentle way he could think of, Pazeb had noticed the latest afront by Jebzel had broken something among the Coltvans. For every 'danger' they'd arrest, there would be a retaliation. By now, the camp was the only safe place for Colthaginians in the entire city. He did not know how to respond. He did not have it in him to enact reprisals. The Commander did not want anything anymore. Perhaps it would be better if he went home? No. If Pazeb went home, home would be ruined as well. At least he, and the others, still had innocent memories of home. The Coltvans did not even have that. And they would have their revenge."

Smoke, sir?"\n\nAnnizalid smiled as he looked over the sun laden street in front of his window, but he shook his head at the mare's offer. "Colthage has no need for police officers for whom the law is a means to an end, commissioner. I want Kizil-Zeb, and all the other towns and villages in Coltva to thrive, and for that the zebras here need to be able to trust the law is on their side."\n\n"Alright." The mare put one cigar back, before lighting her own. "The governor is probably going to whine to Zarca. Along with the big landowners. But I will not mess up this shot at peace, general." The police commissioner grinned. "Makes me wonder, was the corruption just as bad over in the capital?" A trail of smoke started rising from the cigar out of the open window.\n\nAnnizalid's smile faded at the question. "The Storm King left our institutions in tatters and opportunists took advantage." He sighed and looked down at the medal on his uniform. "The rot goes deep. But for now, let us focus on what is within our reach, commissioner Quarzaim."\n\nIzavel took another puff from her cigar. "Za'al defends the just, general. Your actions will not be in vain. You've given me more hope in a week than I have had since I joined the force. Don't forget to keep some for yourself.""

One of the soldiers in Captain Pazeb's office, in the Coltartan army barracks was making excuses for their behaviour.\nWith a smile, the captain took the bottle the soldier gifted him. "I can't fault you for your taste private, but our foraging trips are over now, general's orders. So you better treat every Coltvan as if they are the Sufrit's mother from now on."\n"Old Zarca's wife is still kicking?" One of the other soldiers asked defiantly.\n"Yes, corporal, and we are going to pay her a visit. When you are there, you can explain why we took all her rum. Now move out soldiers."\n\nThe trio of looters saluted and then followed the captain out, with the alcohol they had acquired. Captain Pazeb marched unflinchingly to Coltartan, the soldiers behind him getting ever more embarrassed at the stares the locals were giving them. Pazeb made sure to parade the trio the long way around to the liquor store. Looking inside, the captain saw the clerk jump behind the counter when she saw uniforms. He knocked softly, raising his voice. "Good evening miss, we have come to return some goods. Could we come in?" Without waiting for an answer, the Colthaginian opened the door and the four entered the store. One shelf was laying on the floor, pieces of glass bottles scattered about the store. "This is what breaking nothing is, huh?" Pazeb muttered before trotting to the counter and putting his bottle on the counter, along with the coins to pay for it. "I apologise for the mess, ma'am, on behalf of the military."\n\nThe zebra behind the counter cautiously raised her head. "Huh? Are you, are you serious?" The officer's warm smile and the shy looks of the soldiers behind him convinced the clerk before Pazeb ever could. "Yes, the ones who vandalised the store! That must have been a month's worth of damage."\n\n"I see how it is." The army captain pondered for a moment before smirking, grabbing the rum he bought and turning to face his zebras. "You are staying here tonight to clean up the damage. And then you are helping this clerk every evening until she reckons you made it up to her." He glared at the soldiers. "And if I catch any of you with alcohol for the next month, you're peeling potatoes until your hooves fall off. Are we understood?""

Zalathel Zarca looked surprised at the young officer who just came storming up to him in the Senate hallway. However, he was not the zebra to say no to some attention.\n\n"Very well, lieutenant, report."\nThe zebra mare took a second to catch her breath, before giving the sufrit a sealed envelope. "A dispatch from our agents in Coltva, sir. There is a change in political activity."\n\nZarca smiled, shaking his head as he broke the seal. "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you did not need to gallop all this way to tell me the rebellion is losing strength." He unfolded the paper. "Although it never hurts to be the bringer of good news."\n\nThe mare started shuffling on the spot a bit, her eyes looking at the dispatch nervously and her beating heart wishing she had been more clear to the highest ranking commander in the country. Meanwhile the sufrit's smile soured as he scanned the paper. Commander of the East Annizalid had managed to lower support for the main Coltvan rebel group; the Liberation Army of the East, this has come at a cost. Many former rebel sympathisers have started openly supporting the Constitutionalist faction of Zarca's one-time challenger Zanno Mzelqatid. This may be due to the general's own influence. When he finished reading, the sufrit's gaze, now annoyed, fell back upon the mare. "I see." Was Zalathel's only curt comment.\n\nThe zebra in front of him was furiously hoping Za'al would grant her the power to sink into the floor and disappear, but the lack of divine intervention made her ask; "What are you going to do now, sir?""

The Gilded Arabian was an upper-class Ladies & Gentlecolts' Club, a den for the old money to strengthen their networks and do business. Zalathel Zarca stood up from his chair and trotted towards the backroom, where one stallion was waiting. Zaalshillek Bodazthart embodied old money. A grey mane and a gentlecolt's moustache adorned him, and the stifling smoke from his Cyanolisian cigar made the air moody. "Mister Zarca, thank you for coming on such short notice."\n"It is my pleasure mister Bodazthart." Zalathel lied through his teeth, sitting himself down in front of the landowners' unofficial leader. Few zebras could make the sufrit cancel his business to meet them, but Zaalshillek was one of them.\n\nMuch to Zarca's annoyance, the next 30 minutes were spent on pleasantries, smoking, a few drinks and a plate of falafel. Zarca spent the time imagining himself arresting the old-fashioned zebra, but he knew full well he could not antagonise his most supportive faction. Finally, Bodazthart cleared his throat, and pragmatism seeped into his overly familial tone. "Now then, Zalathel, I did not call you here merely to talk about my kids and the farm." He put out his third griffonian cigar on the ashtray. "My friends in Coltva have been telling me your new appointment has been interfering with their business. They are telling me this may have an influence on their ability to donate to your cause, unless the interference would be removed, of course."\n\nIt took Zalathel Zarca all of his willpower to keep calm during Bodazthart's command disguised as concern. "Mister Bodazthart, general Annizalid tells me he is merely making sure labour laws are being followed. If your friends hadn't treated Coltvans as glorified slaves-"\nBodazthart interrupted, his tone still as sweet as before; "My friends are helping Coltvans see the virtue of hard work. I am merely relaying my friends' concerns about mister Annizalid as a courtesy to you, and to your father. As always, the decision is yours, and I will respect it either way." He smiled and briefly looked at the door, signifying the conversation was over. Zarca briefly nodded and then left the club, heading straight for his office, wondering yet again if he should replace his commander."

"That gate was fixed since we came by here last week. Let's check it out." The captain and his driver got out of their vehicle, trotting into the property, with the corporal holding on to his rifle. Pazeb pointed towards a small barn. "Remember? That was nailed shut, now the door is open." The two zebras got close and then entered the wooden building, looking around. Both froze when they heard the distinctive sound of an Ochzor revolver being cocked.\n\n"Who's there?" A young stallion's voice said from behind a haybale.\n"I am Captain Pazeb of the Colthaginian Army, on patrol. Now come out friend, we were just having a look around." Pazeb said calmly, as the corporal aimed his rifle at the hay. After a sigh, the Coltvan emerged from behind the hay, revolver still drawn at the two others. "Army huh, I was afraid you were with the Liberation Army." He nodded at the corporal and both put their guns down. "What brings you here, captain?"\n"Just patrolling, and I couldn't help but notice this farm looks lived in again. Was the rebel life not for you, my friend?" Pazeb smiled, "Don't worry, we're not here to catch the other side's deserters."\n\nThe Coltvan farmer gave a brief chuckle. "Guess you could say that. After I heard about the new police, and your commander standing up to the landowners, the old farm started calling to me." The stallion smirked. "Picked up my folks from Coltartan as well, they told me the captain there is a good zebra."\n\nPazeb shook his head. "All that work and I still get aimed at. Either way, good luck with restoring your farm.""

Even this place, so far removed from the patrols of the Colthaginian troops, was becoming unsafe for him. General Ziliad Annizalid, constitutionalist and Zarca's surprising pick for Commander of the East, had managed to dwindle support for the Liberation Army. And he had done it without compromising on the structure of the Coltvan economy. Much to Zeirutid's disappointment, a change in tone was enough to convince many peasants to lay down their arms. Although the rebel leader had applauded the changes Annizalid did propose, including actually enforcing the rights of Coltvans towards the landed class, the Colthaginian was not willing to, or perhaps, not able to, break the power of the landowners.\n\nRain started falling, but the zebra was too proud to go inside for now, standing defiant against the weather. Zeirutid was not the only one, of course, who was still defiant. But he had to be reasonable. Despite some support from the remaining hardliners, it would be amoral and unfruitful to continue the fight without support from the populace. "One good zebra is all it takes to protect the worst ones," he lamented. Zeshmunazash grabbed his rifle and held it firmly in his hooves. His mane started to hang low due to the water. But perhaps it was the weather which returned Zeirutid's resolve to him. "Perhaps his consciousness will call him to us at some point. Or to move against Zarca. And then the wound will be exposed again." The Coltvan turned around and grinned to himself. "I could not ignite the uprising today, but that does not mean there is no fuel for the fire." Finally the rebel leader headed inside, shaking his mane clean."

Only before the Storm King's rampage had the streets been so lively on a normal day. Foals were playing, and elderly zebra were sitting on benches in front of their homes instead of glaring at the street from behind curtains. With the police and the military now friendly, and the Liberation Army disintegrating, the people regained control of the street. Coltva Square too had become the bustling hub it was meant to be. Some zebras even took the time to fix up the fountain, which now made for a nice place for the young zebras to hang out. The cafés and restaurants around the square were inviting her in, but the commissioner had one specific place to go.\n\n"Ah, commissioner, I hope you will forgive me for changing the place where we meet for today. The weather simply demanded it."\nGeneral Annizalid said when Quarzaim approached and sat down. "Not at all, Commander, I think you deserve to enjoy the fruits of your labour." She smiled genuinely; Kizil-Zeb had been peaceful for weeks now. Instead of rebel plots Quarzaim now investigated thefts and bar brawls.\n"Come now commissioner, the Coltvans did this themselves. I just reached out my hoof. They had no reason to trust me, but they took the chance." Quarzaim's retort was stopped by the waiter asking for their order, and soon both zebras were enjoying a coffee.\n\n"But I wanted to ask, Ziliad." The two had moved to a first name basis for a while now, despite Quarzaim's initial reservations. "What about Zeirutid?"\n"Nowhere to be found. He did leave a note on my desk, however."\nThe commissioner raised her eyebrow. "What did it say?"\n"He said he had to stop fighting for now, but that I was not addressing structural flaws in our system." Annizalid smiled. "I think he sees a lot more flaws than I do."\nQuarzaim shook her head and chuckled, "Speaking of flaws, is Zarca jealous of you yet?"\n"Oh yes, he recalled me a few times already,""

He believes so strongly in his cause, he thinks eventually every zebra would see things his way." The Sufrit kept the responses which came to mind to himself, instead nodding. "Perhaps, I suppose it would not hurt to try. What about Bezelshazzar, is he on board as well?"\n"Oh, trust me, he would do anything to further his standing. Don't worry about that."\n\nNow Zalathel really started worrying about his company. When his father was in charge, all these zebras seemed a lot less self-serving. It must have been because it was his father who was the target of their schemes. "Very well, you have my permission, but return his body to Coltva after you are done."\nNow Jebzel looked surprised. "Why in Za'al's name would we do that, they'd all worship his corpse."\n"Dead zebras can't lead. None of them can claim his legacy if he looms between them.

One of Zeirutid's bodyguards remarked, eyeing the surrounding jungle suspiciously.\n"Did you not meet me on the outskirts of Maneake, in the dead of night?" As usual, Zeirutid's witty response cleared the tension from the air. "I am convinced of his intentions. Having recognized our strength, he wants to work together with us to overthrow the Zarcas. In return, we will get what we desire." Zeirutid approached the cabin and knocked on the heavy metal door, which gave a peculiar sound. "We have arrived, general." He said, after which he stood back and patiently waited.\n\nZeshmunazash's patience ran thin when he heard the sound of a radio switching on, and then some murmuring. A few more seconds passed and there was some rustling in the woods behind the group. "Hello?" Zeirutid asked with another knock, before his voice got overpowered by the sound of a machine gun letting loose upon the Coltvans. With the reflexes of an Abyssinian, Zeirutid leaped behind the corner of the cabin to safety and then quickly grabbed his rifle.\n"Ambush!" The rebel leader shouted over the screams of his comrades, as his guards did their best to find cover and return fire. Rifle-fire now mixed with the constant hail of machine-fed bullets, as it became clear the cabin was surrounded by enemies. Zeirutid filtered out the screams of his comrades and aimed towards the shadows and flashes, before taking a shot. The silenced machine gun was one success. Another shot, one less enemy soldier. A third one, but then a pain in his hind leg forced the Coltvan on his knees. Still the rebel fired a shot. Then another flash of agony in his back. Zeirutid's vision blurred, and focused again on his comrades dying on the ground in front of him. "Not. Yet." The zebra growled, and managed to grab a grenade, throwing it towards the woods. Surprised screams ahead gave him hope. An opening. Zeirutid willed on his body, struggling forwards.\n\nZeirutid almost made it to the wood line, his eyes fixated on the trees. But then his chest exploded with impossible pain, and the world tumbled. His rifle fell to the ground, and the zebra's thoughts turned to home. Finally, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid closed his eyes."

As was tradition, the cemetery in Kizil-Zeb was located on the opposite end of a small stream from the city, and the funerary stelae stood like grim ghosts in the starry night. The road to the burial ground was lit by rows of torches and surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. As the procession carrying Zeirutid's body passed, many Coltvans weeped openly. The Liberation Army's top general, Zenarvo Ozid, one of the ones carrying the coffin, wore his saddened heart on his sleeve. Also in attendance were Ahirom Zadadid, Zammo Jazelid and rebel hardliner Zanuzel Zala.\n\nAfter the invited guests went inside the small temple of Za'al, the rest of the crowd started enjoying a meal beneath the starry sky, sitting around the freshly dug grave and its large stele. Inside, the guests were greeted by an embarrassed priest and a drunk, boisterous Zarishat Zeirutid, the sister of the former Coltvan leader. As tradition required, the next step was the mrz, the ritual meal. As the rebels consumed the temple wine and the local fruits, the priest sang a eulogy for the deceased. Many in attendance lost their appetite as they were reminded of the person they had lost, not just a leader, but a loving, gentle zebra. This respectful sadness was only broken by the scrunching and burping of Zarishat.\n\nZala, sitting next to Ozid, whispered to him, while patting his back supportively. "They need a new leader, Zenarvo. It should be you, not her."\nThe general shook his head, clearly beside himself. "He is irreplaceable. I cannot replace his place in our hearts. Only she could, if..."\n"Look at her, if only the people knew." Zala replied, but before they could continue the guests stood up for the final part of the ritual. All the zebras took their plates with them, throwing them into the pit outside. Then, surrounded by utter silence, Zeshmunazash was lowered into his final resting place and buried next to the largest stele of them all. No zebra, not even Zarishat, made a sound as the grave was filled. Alongside Zeirutid, lay the dreams of the Liberation Army."

"Did you grab your lunch Zari?"\n"Stop calling me that! But yes!" Zesh smiled, he picked up his tea as he heard Zarishat crunching on a taco upstairs. Grabbing his tea and turron, he sat down at the table and opened the paper.\n\nThe headline caught him off guard, 'Sufrit Zarca promises further educational reforms, suggests removing barriers of entry for nation's largest universities.'\nZesh continued reading, the article listing other changes the Sufrit had made in recent years.

From Zumidia nervous hippogriff police officers watched as a bearded figure made his way across the bridge amidst loud cheering. The stallion in question was Zanno Mzelqatid, leader of the Constitutionalist Army, whose banner was flying over Zapsa now. He was smiling widely as he waved towards the crowd of citizens and soldiers. Once over the bridge, the politician was quickly approached by two generals, Zarvad Orzagid and Azruzaal Azarago, who shared his upbeat mood. "Good morning, friends, how pleasant to finally meet you on free Colthaginian soil!" Zanno exclaimed to the crowd, before turning his attention to the generals. "It is a pleasure to see both of you could make it to our planned meeting. Tell me; how are we doing?"\n\nAzarago, impassioned, raised his voice now. "The Zapsa Plan has exceeded even our expectations! The people have taken control of Zalihli, Sivmareas, Tefemanei, and even Hippone!" The mention of each state just caused further jubilation amongst the crowd.\nGeneral Orzagid, trying to calm down his eager colleague, nodded. "Our supporters have also taken control of cities along the western coast, as well as most of Colthage. Many garrisons have joined us without a fight, as well as regular army units and their commanders." He took a deep breath. "Mister Mzelqatid, no doubt Zarca will try to retake Colthage and cut off our supporters into pockets, let us make haste."\n\nZanno, however, seemed distracted by the large crowd, shaking hooves and speaking with them, which caused Orzagid to grin. "He seems a bit aloof."\nAzarago just smirked and gave the other general a pat on the shoulder, "Let him do his thing, and we shall do ours. For freedom!"\n"For the Republic, general." Orzagid could not hide his smile looking at the huge crowd. Perhaps this was possible after all."

The stallion in question was Zanno Mzelqatid, leader of the Constitutionalist Army, whose banner was flying over Zapsa, ridden with bullets. At the designated meeting point, the politician stood aimlessly for a moment, gunshots sounding in the distance, until a revolver wielding zebra appeared from the shadows. "Good day mister Zanno. Zannido Zidon, at your service. The constitutionalists evacuated the city already, so I'm the only one here to meet you. Ready for a gallop? This will be a rough ride!"\n\nZarvad Orzagid and Azruzaal Azarago grinned at a map of Colthage spread over a table in their field base in Zam'al. Azarago sighed at the tiny circle representing the area under constitutionalist control. "I did not expect the plan to go this wrong. I don't know how he managed to do it, but most of our key supporters are locked up. I was hoping for more than just Sivmareas."\nGeneral Orzagid nodded, lighting a cigar. "Just us, these bandits and a whole lot of not much, Azruzaal." He took a whiff.

 colthage_civil_war.3.desc:0 ""Look sergeant, the bastards are all there. I think that's general Azarago." The police officer whispered to sergeant Xanza. The police forces were hidden in buildings surrounding the bridge between Zumidian Annaza and Colthaginian Zapsa. "You see the rebels? Let's bag them now, before they move away."\nXanza shook her head and laid her hoof on the officer's shoulder. "Quiet. The head of the snake isn't here yet. Look over the bridge." Both zebras gazed over, the sun's rays illuminating a solitary figure standing at the opposite end. He seemed to wave to his supporters on the other side, and casually trotted towards them. "Wait for it, we make sure he is far enough in. I won't let the bastard slip away." Xanza commanded as quiet as she could muster. Her eyes squeezed in focus as she tried to suppress her pounding heart. The chief would be proud this day. The nation would sigh in relief.\n\nZanno Mzelqatid smiled at general Azarago. "So good to see you here, in Colthage itself. Tell me; how are we doing?" The constitutionalist looked around the surprisingly small entourage waiting for him, before he froze from a shout erupting from one of the buildings. "Zanno Mzelqatid, you are under arrest for treason against the Republic! You are surrounded, do not resist!"\nAs if to enforce the point, dozens of rifles emerged from windows and doors, pointing at the conspirators on the street. "Za'al's beard, it's an ambush!" general Azarago shouted, his revolver in his hoof with one swift motion. "Let's get Zanno over that bridge! Now!" The conspirators were preparing to start a gunfight, but Zanno simply raised his hooves. "No need for violence. We lost. We surrender."\n"You can't be serious!" The general tried, but one look at the leader of the constitutionalists was all he needed to know. The stallion dropped his gun as the police emerged from cover. The revolution had ended before it had even begun."

 colthage_civil_war.4.desc:0 ""An impressive job as always, miss Zannid." Zalathel smirked at the figure in the corner of his office, who kept to the shadows. His father had used the illusive zebra's talents before to surgically remove dissenters, and Ziempsal had not disappointed this time either.\n"Thank you for your patronage, mister Zarca. Although there is more you must know." The shadowy figure waited for the Sufrit to give her his full attention, relishing the moment of superiority where she knew and the most powerful zebra in Colthage did not. "The student protests were coordinated centrally. We expect that the ringleaders planned to protest the moment they would have an excuse to do so, all across Colthage. It is possible one of your enemies may have sought to weaken your rule. In time for a triumphant return, perhaps?"\nThe suggestion lingered in the air for a moment before Zalathel responded. "Zanno. Of course. No doubt funded by those arrogant half breeds in Aris!"\n\n"Perhaps, perhaps not. Although further investigation would be needed. The sort which the police would not be allowed to handle." Zalathel grimaced at the thought. It was better that he did not know what Zannid did. For a moment he wondered if his father ever asked.\n"Alright, do it." The Sufrit's determined answer did not stir the cloaked figure.\n"I must mention, that we will have to make considerable expenses. There are a hundred and twenty-seven pairs of eyes to avoid, after all." Zannid referenced the ancient judicial institution of the Republic, ever-watchful for foul play. This made Zalathel hesitate. If he had to borrow from the treasury, his other priorities might have to be postponed, and there was no telling if Zannid would uncover anything useful from her 'investigation.'"

 colthage_civil_war.5.desc:0 "Zalathel Zarca flipped through the information miss Zannid had brought to him. Secret correspondence, which must have been well hidden and only given to the most trusted leaders of the opposition. Their operation was called the plan of Zapsa, orchestrated by Zanno Mzelqatid himself. Lists of contacts, codes, detailed maps, hidden weapon caches. The plan even came with a date; The first of August 1007. The Sufrit could not help but be impressed by the intricacies of the plan and the many countermeasures to discovery. Zanno's plan was like a ship, which could seal off bulkheads if it was breached. Zalathel looked up at the shadowy figure, who he imagined must be grinning under her hood.\n\n"How did you get all this, Zannid? This is incredible."\nIf the illusive zebra was gloating, she managed to hide it well. "Zargon, the Dark One, demands I do not share my secrets."\nWas Zannid just being esoteric for the sake of it, or did she really worship the dreaded Lord of the Deep? Either way, her answer was enough to stop Zalathel from prying. "With this we should be able to root out the constitutionalist conspiracy." The eldest Zarca smirked, imagining the despair of his old opponent as his elaborate scheme unravelled before his eyes. The cloaked Zebra only nodded her head just enough for it to be visible, before leaving the Sufrit's office."

 colthage_civil_war.6.desc:0 ""Mister Zerdin, you are under arrest on suspicion of treason against the Republic. Come out now or we will come in." The voice of Hippone's Chief of Police thundered, barely muffled by the closed doors and windows.\n"I'd like to see you try!" Abdzamon Zerdin looked around the lobby of the Port Authority building. His compatriots were staring at the haphazardly barricaded door from behind desks and other cover. The zebra loaded his gun as a loud knock made the door shake in its hinges. "Remember what you are fighting for, Colthaginians!" The bureaucrat spoke loudly. "Today we defend the constitution! Today we fight for our Republic! Death to Zarca!" Wood splinters filled the room as the door broke down and police stormed through. The first zebra in barely set hoof inside before being ridden with bullets, but the police quickly responded with smoke grenades and gunfire of their own.\n\nPolice sergeant Xanza grinned. The Constitutionalist rebels were better armed than they had suspected. The zebra reloaded her Garcano-Ochzor, but then a scream next to her made the sergeant look to the side, where the chief of police collapsed. With a jump and a duck, Xanza sat next to him. "Let's get you out of here sir." Xanza pressed the chief's hoof against the wound.\n"Negative Xanza, don't let these bandits escape for my sake." Her superior coughed up blood, his voice wavering.\n"Screw that-" Xanza's retort was cut short by fire erupting in the building, making her stand back up. What in the Deep were they doing? Then the officer saw a dozen galloping shadows advance at her. Were they charging? The rest of the squad seemed as stunned as her. "Gun them down, now! Don't let them close into melee!" Xanza fired her rifle at the constitutionalists to enforce her order. It was enough to snap her colleagues out of it, and the rebels dropped one by one. She ordered a zebra to get the fire department, while the rest investigated the bodies.\n\nWith her heart still racing from the fight, Xanza looked back down at her chief, but it was too late. His eyes were closed and his body was still. She cursed and cursed until another officer snapped her out of it. "Zerdin is here, sergeant. Looks like they were out of ammo. Seems like even the pencil pushers fight to the death now.""

A delegation of Senators and Judges followed him through the prison, taking notes and asking questions to the guards and inmates. No matter how much the senators from the constitutionalist faction prodded the prisoners, they would not get any answers confirming rumours of maltreatment. Whenever the politicians seemed to be close to getting a political prisoner to talk, they would tense up and refuse to elaborate. Up in the rafters above the block, a zebra in a dark cloak shadowed the delegation, flashing a light to any prisoner thinking about talking to make them look up. The mere sight of Ziempsal Zannid was then enough to quell rebellious thoughts.\n\nEventually the delegation ended the tour and one of the senators came up to Zasdrubal. "Congratulations general Zarca, the prison seems to be working adequately, although we have some concerns about its capacity, we hope most of these new prisoners will only be temporary residents."\nZarca responded with a polite smile. "Naturally, senator. Once the situation has calmed down. As I said at the start of the inspection, rumours of abuse, or even worse, are just that, rumours."\n"You will have to forgive the One Hundred and Twenty Seven, general." A judge chimed in. "The speed at which you found out these rebels is impressive, but we have found nothing to indicate unlawful interrogation on your part. Look forward to our report."\n\n"Your praise is a compliment to the guards and the warden, your honour. Now please, let us end this inspection in a more pleasant setting." Zasdrubal Zarca let the delegation outside with a smirk, prompting Zannid to come down from her vantage point, as frightened prisoners looked defeatedly at the leaving politicians' backs.\n"You played along so well, foals. First by telling me about your friends and now by keeping my secrets. None of you will have to go to the Deep with me tonight.""

The sufrit shouted as he looked up from his desk.\n"Family business, brother!" The jovial voice of Zago responded from the other side, to which Zasdrubal opened the door to a smiling Zago supporting a wincing Zaphod, her admiral's dress uniform stained red on one of her legs. The two entered and the general closed the door behind them. Zalathel got up, sighing in relief at the sight of his sister.\n"Holy Za'al, Zaphod, are you alright? We have been worried sick!"\n\nThe mare sits down on a chair, resting her leg as she looks around the room. "Figures you'd worry more about me than the rest. I hear you captured Zanno and the rest of us."\nZasdrubal stared daggers at his sister. "'Us?' Does family mean nothing to you, Zaph? The legacy of our father?"\n"Do not lecture me, Zas! I know full well what I did. I fought for democracy. A republic where creatures are free to choose their politics. A country without slavery!"\nZalathel stood in between the two and looked towards Zaphod. "And how many paid the ultimate price for your idealism, Zaph? How many students with bright futures? How many brave soldiers? While all around us our enemies gather strength, Colthage is reeling. This is exactly what father sought to prevent."\nZago chipped in, his tone soft and his words considerate. "It does not matter now; we are together again. There is a lot still to do."\nZasdrubal sighed, hanged his shoulders and stepped towards his sister. "Let's go home, Zaph. And save our bullets for real enemies.

As such, he and many other Zarcids entered into surrender negotiations, peacefully handing themselves over to us in a symbolic end to their leadership. However, the Senate remains intact and under our intense scrutiny, with an informal "coordination council" forming to handle the delicate transition to a democratic society while upholding Colthaginian institutions.

It was early in the morning and Zanno Mzelqatid had summoned his advisors over a letter he had received last night. "With all due respect, sir, shadowy figures dropping of letters into your bedroom do not seem like the most trustworthy messengers." General Zarvad Orzagid sighed, examining the seals attached to it. "But it seems genuine enough."\nZanno smiled, eager to relay the offer. "Discretion was required, I understand. Either way, it comes down to this: Baltazar Zakbar and Batrun Zaryes, and their scientifid and militarist factions, realise they cannot win and wish to stop the conflict. If we accept their proposal, they will coup the Zarcids and make peace, in return for keeping their place in society."\n"And if we reject?" Zenut Zaranzid, one of the few senators who travelled to the constitutionalist capital in person to support the revolution, interjected; "They say it themselves, they have lost. Let us get rid of the whole rotten structure in one kick!"\n"If we reject, senator Zaranzid," Zanno replied, his heart burdened by the thought, "many more innocents will perish."\n\nZanno's words hung heavy in the air, and the silence was only broken by Mzelqatid himself; "furthermore, their demands seem reasonable. Both the military and the scientifid clique have a place in our Colthage, do they not? We fight to bring Colthage back to normal."\n"Many risked their lives for real change. Though they may have been there before the Zarcids, those two groups exemplify what the people despise of our elite. They run counter to our Republican ideals!" Zaranzid retorted, earning murmurs of approval from some others in the crowd.\n"More importantly than ideals, however. I worry about deceit. Zakbar and Zaryes are cunning, and they only act out of their own interests. Their coup is a shaky foundation for our Republic." Orzagid added. "Another opportunity to stop the fighting, I would have taken, but not this." Zanno stared down at the letter, considering the words of those around him. Should he really deny a chance for peace?"

With the Zarca brothers quickly arrested, the conspirators announced a special session of the senate.

On the other hoof, those of a more pragmatic and skeptical mindset see the new government as merely a fresh coat of paint for the old regime, that will at best still actively oppress the Coltvan people despite the democratic reforms, and at worst, be a repeat of the Zarcid regime cloaking themselves in a banner of liberty and democracy. Still, no attempt at reconciliation or peace negotiations have been made on behalf of the Constitutionalists, and former Zarcid soldiers on our front have now found themselves under new command.

Of course, the devastation caused by two consecutive civil wars will take much time to heal, and the implementation of democracy as was demonstrated will be much harder then at first glance, but regardless of such the most painful part for the people is over, and hopefully, they will become all the stronger for it."

Though we have much to credit the former Coltvan resistance movement, equally as much is due to Zannido Zidon and his crew for whipping the movement into a proper fighting force to take back what is rightfully theirs. Many may see us as being nothing more than petty thugs who rule based on fear and terror, but in truth, we are built upon the principles of justice that so many peasants crave. From land reform to equal treatment before the law, we seek to bring back those unalienable rights others would rather see taken away for their benefit.

The constitutionalists may call us autocrats, but truthfully, we are merely a unique form of democracy, one that is more capable of stability in the face of adversity and seldom falls to the infighting over petty issues that draw away from the crucial matters of state. When the people cry out for a leader to save them from despair, and when the Sufrit comes and delivers that safety, the people still ask for more as if they are entitled foals, unaware that their very demands are what wrought such insecurity in the first place.

Although the leader of Colthage knew this place was more treacherous than Zargon's domain. Many of the senators were old, and had seen his father deliver speeches from the stand. A few of them had been colleagues of Zalathel's grandfather even. The sufrit quickly glanced at his brothers, who sat on the first row of benches and then at the old president of the Senate. The zebra nodded and gave permission for the sufrit to speak as an honoured guest of the ancient institution.\n\n"Colthaginians, esteemed members of the senate, we stand at a crossroad. To our west, is the road against which my father has often cautioned, a warning I will repeat today." The sufrit's eyes shone proudly, as his voice bellowed powerfully through the chamber. "Pushed on by foreign agitators and jealousy, there are those who call our noble republic a sham, and who would call the Zarca family despots. I will not stand for accusations of tyranny, when we all remember life under yeti occupation!" Murmurs of approval went through the senate. "The tyrant did not vanish. We drove him out. And it has cost us dearly. The Zarcids bled for the republic and we shall not let that sacrifice be undone by so called 'constitutionalist' agitators and saboteurs!"\n\nThe sufrit let the cheers from the non-constitutionalist senators die down before continuing, trying to disregard the cold stare from his sister Zaphod. "Then to the east, we find the opportunists. While we were weak, they armed themselves. Coltvan separatists terrorise our economy and honest citizens while some in this chamber call for dialogue and peace branches. Honourable Colthaginians, there is but one answer to treason!" Zarca's supporters roared, and Zalathel grinned, basking in the glory. "I see a path before us, venerable senators, shown by my father's sacrifice. It leads to prosperity and glory. Walk with me, and I shall lead Colthage to a new golden age!" It took minutes for the president to bring the senate to order, but Zalathel had acquired the momentum he needed."

Lately, Baltazar's loyalty had become questionable, so an urgent meeting was arranged where disagreements could be peacefully resolved. After all, the Scientifids preferred more refined methods rather than brute force.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] and Baltazar Zakbar met in a safe and secure conference room in the depths of the Byrza Citadel. As [Root.GetLeader] sat down on a table opposite Zakbar, the old zebra offered a cup of steaming hot Hindian tea. It would be impolite to refuse, so the offer was accepted, but not before a taster was summoned to drink first. As Zakbar drank calmly from his own cup, the taster concluded that the tea was safe to drink and tasted normal, giving the cup to [Root.GetLeader]. And so the Sufrit drank, and the negotiations began.\n\nOn the following day, both [Root.GetLeader] and the drink taster were bedridden and extremely sick. With the Sufrit unable to fulfill their duties, Baltazar Zakbar announced that he would take control of the government, claiming it was temporary. But when some officials or senators protested this, they were swiftly arrested by pro-Scientifid soldiers for conspiring treason. Meanwhile Zakbar met with the ill Sufrit who was in terrible pain. He brought with him a teapot and two cups. Into one, he poured normal tea, then flicked a switch, and poured an entirely different mixture into another. The Sufrit's eyes widened as it became clear how the poisoning had been done.\n"In this cup is the antidote to your poison. I offer it to you, but with a price. You must sign this document where you officially resign due to health issues." Baltazar offered a document and a pencil.\n[Root.GetLeader] hesitated, suffered a pang of pain, then hastily signed it while shaking. Baltazar Zakbar smiled gently, then gave the cure. "Thank you.

A large procession made its way to the building, circling up from the lower city crowds, through the massive gates of the citadel walls. In front was Zalathel Zarca, in ceremonial uniform, flanked on either side by a zebra dressed in the all-white uniform of the Sacred Band, Colthage's ancient honour guard. Behind him a bronze statue, decorated with silver and gemstones depicting a sailing ship was carried by dozens of sacred band soldiers. The procession was ended by a band.\n\nAlthough the Zonician pantheon had six main gods, Zalathel was not seeking the favour of Dark Zargon who rules beneath the waves, lawbringer Zam or warring Aztarte. The ones he courted were, naturally, Za'al, 'Lord', creator of zebra, who has a form as a King, Za'al Zarakin, and an unpredictable form as God of storms, Za'al Zephon. Along with Zanit, the mother goddess, his wife, and the patron of Colthage. His last choice was Zothar, the skillful god who patronised smiths, engineers and inventors.\n\nThe sufrit had consulted with the priesthood, who had picked today as an auspicious day for a sacrifice, and the clear skies seemed to prove them right. The High Priest led the statue's escort inside, leaving the sufrit outside. Zarca's heart pounded in his chest.

 colthage_other.29.d:0 "Although this palace was the most refined building in the [Root.GetAdjective] capital, it was crude for Hiram Zerranid's tastes. His society in Hippone was a much more subtle place, managing a finer sort of comfort with much less wealth than the Yeti's blunt style. The sufrit had sent him, a diplomat, to wrangle reparations from the yeti government. As the zebra, clad in a heavy cloak, made his way through the halls of the government building, Hiram began to lose faith in his mission. These yeti were no better than those who occupied Colthage during the reign of the Storm King. Still, Hiram had a plan to snatch victory from the jaws of diplomatic humiliation. After waiting for an insultingly long while, the diplomat was finally let into the throne room.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] was sitting on a throne of sorts, frowning. "So, what brings you here, Colthaginian? We do not often get official visits from up north. Tell me what [Root.GetNameDef] can do for you."\nHiram smiled politely and gave a bow. "Your splendour and grace have brought me before you today, [Root.GetLeader]. We Colthaginians still recall the might of the yeti, and it is this might which is the subject of my visit."\n[Root.GetLeader] smirked, "Tribute is always welcome, northerner."\nHiram gave a polite nod, but quickly tried to turn the conversation around. "Well, we happen to be in a dire situation when it comes to our finances, so the sufrit considered it wise to ask the mightiest people we know for assistance. If you help, Colthage will consider the destruction left by the yeti settled. Such a gesture would of course, also show the yeti are a force to be reckoned with." Hiram again bowed extravagantly, awaiting the yeti leader's response.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] smiled brightly, and then slowly began to laugh. Then the others in the room joined, while Hiram bit his lip. The fit of laughter lasted for more than a minute, before the yeti spoke again. "Go home! Tell your leader he can come collect his gold if he can take it!""

 colthage_other.30.d:0 "Zalathel Zarca was sitting behind his desk in the sufrit's office. Next to him stood his brother Zasdrubal, in military uniform as always. Sitting on the other side was the Hipponian diplomat Hiram Zerranid. The latter had just returned from a diplomatic mission to the Stormlands, to demand war reparations from the yeti. The diplomat was finishing off the summary of his trip. "Valuable ties have been made with yeti diplomats and officials, but unfortunately, the yeti did not seem to want to acquiesce to our demands." Hiram's first assertion was half-true at best, but a diplomat should never report a total failure.\nZalathel had been frowning for most of the report, anger building at the blatant disrespect of those barbarians. "Those yetis do not take us seriously! I will show them what happens to those who insult Colthage's might. General, prepare your soldiers for embarkation immediately. Have Zaphod prepare a strike squadron."\n\nNow it was Zasdrubal's turn to frown. He would only give a slight smile to his brother's anger, while Hiram watched on with great interest. "Zalathel, I agree that the yetis' insolence demands a response, but we do not have a feasible response in our arsenal right now. Supplying a campaign in a hostile land across the continent will demand too much of our logistics. With our capabilities stretched, our enemies would seize the opportunity to steal even more of Zonicia from us."\nMuch to the Hipponean's surprise, Zasdrubal's reasonable argument had calmed Zalathel down. When it came to dealing with the sufrit, none were more adept than his siblings. The elder Zarca spoke; "You are right, of course. We cannot forsake our duty to the Republic.

Zalathel and Zaphod were standing over the table, looking over paperwork, while Zasdrubal was observing the slaves working in the field with a keen eye and the master of the house was reclining on the sofa. "So, what do you think Zal? The senators are quite excited, except for the oldest fossils, of course." Zago asked, before taking a sip from his wine.\n"It does not sit right me, honestly." Zalathel responded. "Father cemented the power of the centralists, that's how he secured our power."\nOut in the field, the overseer threatened the whip on a slave slacking off, which caused him to scurry back to his position. Zasdrubal nodded sagely at the affair, while Zaphod cringed at the sound of the cracking whip. The admiral spoke deliberately. "Your slaves work efficiently Zago, you must be proud."\n"They are grateful and hardworking, I am proud of the household indeed."\n"Then I do not understand your desire to federalise the Republic. Without a strong Zarcid grip, this estate would flounder, is it not the same for Colthage?"\n\nIt took a while before Zago responded. "We are talking about civilised people. A leader knows who he must control, and who he can trust to govern themselves."\nZaphod sighed. "I can't believe you see your slaves like that. Do you even talk to them?"\n"Naturally, they are always grateful." Zago smiled widely.\n"Of course they are. Either way, we might lose some control with this, Zal, but it is not the sort of control we need. Father's reforms led to the unrest in Coltva and in the west. Pass these concessions, and you show that you are a sufrit of all Zonicians, not just those in Colthage and Zur."\n"But if I reject them, we can finish father's work and start reaping the benefits." Zalathel sat down, still considering the proposal.\n"Let us have dinner first, and wine! All homegrown. We can't be all business, all day!"

Most generals agree that the natural application of combat aircraft, and therefore the aviation arm of our military, is to act in support of ground forces. They believe flying units should be placed under the operational control of Army commanders so that they can cooperate and effectively support our troops.\n\nOn the other hoof, many admirals argue that given the importance of sea power with respect to regaining Colthage's naval supremacy, it is logical to place the Air Force under the authority of the Navy. Close integration would lead to maximum efficiency for our naval aviation forces. Most of all, they emphasise the potential of air power in coastal defense, insisting that it would take only a small number of planes to sink massive enemy battleships.\n\nOpposed to both of these views, a group of visionary generals and admirals argue that if placed under the hoof of a separate branch, we risk stifling the development of the Air Force. They believe that air power has to be autonomous and controlled by zebras who understand the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who will not waste precious air assets trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. In their view, our aerial warfare branch must be given autonomy to expand and grow efficiently, free from outside meddling.\n\nThe question lies before us: what kind of Air Force does Colthage need?"

Although devastated by the Storm King's invasion in recent years, at this point they seem to have fully recovered.\n\nSigning the treaty would fully open up Colthaginian markets to us, giving us access to valuable goods such as coffee, pearls, porcelain, ivory, and sugar, to name just a few.

Zalathel responded, looking longingly to the hilltop.\nZaphod, who was panting a bit from the climb interjected. "We could have been having a nice cruise today, I vote we never let Zas decide what to do again!" This prompted a triumphant smirk from Zasdrubal and nods of agreement from the other two. "I have to agree with you this time, Zalathel," the admiral continued. "I do not think we know the power of the mass media just yet, and we should definitely ban foreign companies. But this is also a way for us to get information from the people, without a sycophantic filter."\n\nZasdrubal had sprinted off while Zaphod spoke and was standing triumphantly at the top.

"Maybe I'll allow you to keep meetup planning privileges, Zas."\nZasdrubal pointed to the continuation of the trail. "Just ahead is a grove of Zanit.

Eventually, these tensions reached a dangerous boiling point. Rumours began to spread of a conspiracy to overthrow [Root.GetLeader] and impose military rule upon Colthage. The Sufrit urged citizens to remain calm, while secretly trying to brace for the inevitable.\n\nIt all began before the sun rose. In the capital, all roads leading out of the city were blocked by army barricades and all communication lines were cut. Meanwhile, the navy sent ships out into the gulf to stop any maritime traffic from entering or leaving the city. Soldiers marched out of the barracks and swiftly occupied post offices, newspaper printing presses, train stations and the Byrza citadel. By dawn, most of the city was already in military control and a curfew had been imposed. The Senate attempted to gather in an emergency session, but it was too late. Batrun Zaryes, prominent leader of the army, confidently led a column of soldiers towards the Senate building. Rather than oppose them, the zebras guarding the Senate surrendered without a fight, allowing Batrun to enter and arrest any dissident senators.\n\nWithin a few hours, an official proclamation was made that emergency military rule would be instated and martial law was in full effect. The deposed Sufrit, [Root.GetLeader], tried to escape the capital but was captured and placed under house arrest. Some loyalists to the old regime tried to resist, but were swiftly crushed, and the capital soon became eerily quiet. The news spread across the country and the military secured its control of all major settlements and strategic locations.\n\nWithin one day, the military had taken complete control of the [Root.GetName].

"Although I did not imagine your interests included matters of the judiciary, mister Bodazthart."\nThe rural magnate smiled warmly. "Quite the contrary, my friends and I consider the One Hundred and Twenty Seven a critical institution for Colthage's continued stability and prosperity." Zaalshillek lit up a cigar, which Zalathel saw as a sign of nervousness.\n"They are critical indeed, and their independence is hurting this country. Now that the people follow me, it is time we reign in the court. I will not let any zebra stand in my way, especially not those meddlesome lawyers."\n\nZaalshillek's smile faded. "I see you are a zebra set in his ways, Zalathel, quite unlike your father. But I can offer you an alternative. My friends and I have connections." Zalathel leaned forward, interested. "There is no need to make an enemy of a potential friend. Would it not be fortunate if some constitutationalist senators were prosecuted? If they appeared as corrupt as they claim you are?" A bit of his smile returned. "You are considering it, aren't you?"\nZalathel smirked. This offer showed how much the landowners were willing to bend to remain in his good graces. Bodazthart was right where he wanted him. "I do admit, there are more important targets than the Tribunal still at large.

Did we not ask to not be disturbed?"\nThe soldier, standing in the middle of the room now, glanced around nervously, until his eyes rested on Zanno, who gave the stallion a calm smile. "Kind sir, you sound as if Za'al has come down from the heavens and declared himself Emperor of Griffonia. Please tell us what is going on."\nThe corporal nodded and grabbed a letter from his saddle bag and gave it to Mzelqatid. "It is Zeirutid's response, sir."\n\nThe room went silent. The shadow of the Liberation Army of the East had loomed large over the constitutionalists, as an unpredictable, albeit sympathetic force. Zanno casually opened the envelope and read its contents to himself, his smile not fading for a second. The politician enjoyed keeping his advisers on the edge of their seats as he let the silence linger a few moments longer. Then he spoke. "The Liberation Army of the East recognises our authority. Coltva and Colthage shall work together!" With that announcement, the decorum of the formal meeting broke down. Some generals shook their hooves in victory, with several senators banging the table in approval. General Azarago ordered the corporal to bring a bottle of wine to the room, and to grab a bottle of rum for him and his zebras. Despite broad support from the population, it was not until this moment that true unification of Colthage, and a bright future appeared within reach. The rest of the day the constitutionalists spent congratulating themselves on their newfound alliance with the Coltvans."

For now, we stand alone, although Zeirutid is keeping the door open to discuss this at a later date." Generals and senators eyed at each other in disappointment, with no zebra quite sure of what to say, as the corporal awkwardly shuffled out of the room. None of them could quite oversee the implications of this letter. There had been hope that the Coltvans could be open to a deal, preventing the need for more fighting and making it easier to fight Zarca from two fronts. Suddenly, the future appeared a lot less certain."

Although I have made arrangements with mister Zarra."\nZenut furrowed his brow, for his somewhat aloof nature, Zanno always surprised him with his slyness.\n\nAnother thing troubled him, however. The senator briefly glanced over his shoulder, bringing his friend's attention to Zaphod Zarca, in her dress uniform, and Jezabzella Zeshmid, the impeccably dressed patrician, chatting impassionedly. They were surrounded by a group of young zebras, former members of the Popular Aseembly, who replaced Zalathel's supporters in the senate. "I would urge you to keep an eye on the Harmonites. With the Zarca sister in tow they have a powerful ally."\nZanno nodded. "I think the people will see the merit in our platform and reject these experiments."\n"The people. It is in their hooves now." Zenut could not help but smile. After all this time, there would finally be a real choice for them."

 colthage_other.50.d:0 "With the Constitutionalist victory in Colthage, it was inevitable the new central government would shift its attention to the Liberation Army of the East. A separate armed group was a significant infringement to their authority. Zeshmunazash Zeirutid knew all this, but as he looked around at the faces of his closest compatriots and friends, there were mixed reactions. Zeirutid had just read out the demands of the new government: complete disarmament; the effective dissolution of the LAE. The group had fallen along two lines, the first in favour of negotiation. Many of the proponents of negotiation were tired of actual fighting, of nights beneath the stars and looking over their shoulders. They were hopeful that there was a real difference and a possibility for real change. The second group was more combative, not trusting any Colthaginian government and willing to keep fighting for Coltvan's full independence. It had never been Zeirutid's intention to fully break off, but separatist sentiment had grown with every step forward the LAE took.\n\nOver the next few hours, Zeshmunazash and the more diplomatic faction worked on putting down their demands, mostly based on the Plan of Kizil-Zeb. However, they also demanded the resignation of Benoam Gerza, a general who was known in Coltva for his extreme tactics in suppressing Coltvans as an anti-Storm King insurgent. Zeirutid spent the next of the evening drawing up plans for continued resistance with the combative faction, so that at the end of the night, the Coltvan had two plans of action in front of him. Two ways to respond to the demand from Colthage. Negotiation or war."

The new Sufrit was a bit more subtle in his choice of decoration at the least.\nZarra gave a nod. "The leader of the so-called Liberation Army of the East has given us his list of demands, mister Mzelqatid. And before reacting in any official capacity, I wanted to hear your opinion."\nBoth zebras knew well that the Sufrit was beholden to the leader of the Constitutionalists, but neither wanted to state the power dynamics explicitly out of respect for the office. So, Zanno just nodded sagely in response, summing up the conditions Zeirutid had set out; "It seems most of the conditions follow the initial declaration of the rebels, the plan of Kizil-Zeb, which calls for a measure of local autonomy for Coltva, along with land reforms. Certain rights would be especially protected in the region, although with our rule, I doubt that would be necessary."\n\nZarra smiled slightly. "So far the demands seems reasonable, although I had a visit from mister Bodazthart, who claimed this was a dangerous precedent for the landowning class."\n"That is something to consider, but in the end we are not rocking the boat too much, I feel. Although one demand remains."\nZarra rolled his eyes, realising what the politician was getting at. "The infamous general Gerza, the zebra who never won a battle." With a sigh he shook his head. "It is telling the general staff hasn't complained about the demand that we sack him."\n"Colthage can stand to lose him, even if the demand is a little, unorthodox.

Zanno sighed. "Regrettable, but that does not mean we should do anything rash."\n\nZarra smiled slightly. "I figured you would advise against it, but are you not afraid we will look weak?"\n"We would look weak if we would accept no for an answer and rush into conflict with our own citizens. We should invite the stallion to Colthage, and show we are prepared to do our utmost for peace." Mzelqatid rubbed his hoof on his beard. "Zeirutid's aura is positive, although I sense calamity close by, and I would like to meet him in person."\n\nZarani Zarra smiled and nodded, hiding his slight discomfort at Zanno's final remark. The zebra was a skilled politician, but his spiritualism made him seem aloof.

The Rebel leader had just received an invitation from the Sufrit of Colthage, to negotiate peace between Coltva and Colthage. \n"I am serious here Zesh. You will be going into the Snake Pit, the Lion's Den!"\n"Tartarus itself, you could say!" The Coltvan leader brushed off his friend's concerns. "The new Sufrit is a diplomat, and Zanno believes in diplomacy as well, he tried to make overtures to us before, he does not seem the sort of stallion to play dirty like that." The two proceeded into Zeirutid's tent, where he started to pack his saddlebag, while Ozid stood in the entrance, sighing.\n\n"It is not the constitutionalists, you know that, it is the other factions still skulking about. The landowners, the militarists, they have reason to hate you, since you helped push them out of power!"\nZeirutid put the saddlebag on his desk, nodding. "I suppose it is a leap of faith. But if there is a chance we can resolve this peacefully, are we not obligated to try?"\n"Not at the expense of everything!" Ozid raised his voice, his eyes were pleading with Zeirutid to take his personal wellbeing more seriously, and this made his friend stop in his tracks.

"Excuse my friend, she has never been to the city before. Come on, we have a lot of formalities to go through." Like a teacher on a school trip, the leader of the rebels herded his entourage past all the formalities waiting for them. First up was a firing salute organised by general Orzagid, a religious ceremony at the temple of Za'al, and finally entry into the Sufrit's City Palace, which housed his office. "This courtyard cost more than every plantation we've raided put together." One Coltvan whispered to Zeirutid, as the Sufrit's aides ushered the Coltvan delegation through the mosaicked patio, where a fountain symbolising Zam as God of the Rivers provided a serene calm in the middle of the city.\n\nThe long rectangular room the delegates arrived in was no less impressive than the rest of the building, with one long side full of windows letting in light, and the other bearing a painting of a sea battle between the Old Republic and the Roman Empire. Many of the Coltvans stood impressed in the doorway, before the Sufrit, already seated next to Zanno Mzelqatid, urged them to take a seat on their side of the table, already marked by little Coltvan flags.\nSoon the negotiations were in full swing, although few Coltvan delegates could match the decorum of their Colthaginian counterparts, who did their best to overlook their lack of formal diplomatic training to focus on results. The zebras present could see another side of Zeirutid on display entirely, however, as he matched wits with Zanno and Zarra, veterans of countless negotiations. Negotiations lasted for two weeks, but eventually wine and rum flowed freely as a treaty was signed. Coltva would retain its autonomy, land reforms would be enacted and the problematic general Gerza would be sacked. Zeirutid would return to celebrations in Kizil-Zeb; another civil war had been avoided!"

From there the story diverged. Official Colthaginian investigation points to a freak accident, with no culprit. However, the Coltvans who were present swear to have seen Benoam Gerza, well known for his cruelty against his fellow Coltvans during the Storm King's reign, present at the firing salute.

[Root.GetLeader] was aware of this build-up, but failed to take decisive action against it before it was all too late.\n\nAnti-government protests began in the cities, and initially the local law enforcement was sent to quell the unrest. But this served only to escalate tensions and drive more citizens into the streets, especially in the capital. Worse still, many military units now refused to comply with orders, having likely been infiltrated by constitutionalist supporters. As the protesters demanded the restoration of the old constitution and pro-middle class reforms, even the garrison of the capital was disobeying the central government, and pressure grew.\n\nRather than risk further escalation, the Sufrit instead decided to resign from office. Constitutionalist soldiers, surrounded by jubilant citizens, then marched through the capital and into the Senate building, where they met with sympathetic senators and agreed to form a new government.

Despite this, two challengers emerged who met all bureaucratic challenges the government could throw their way. The remaining constitutionalist senators rallied behind general Zarvad Orzagid. Respected by many soldiers, and considered a safe alternative to steer the country to a more democratic course, the general campaigned vigorously, carving out a supporter base in the west. Jezabzella Zeshmid, a mare of the wealthy Zeshmid patrician dynasty, ran on a radical platform, and was considered the outsider in the election, managing to qualify despite numerous legal challenges. Her radical harmonist platform did well in university cities and among members of the RCCW Trade Union.\n\nDespite interference from the government, the election was closely watched, as for the second time now, Zalathel Zarca faced serious opposition. Thousands of volunteers stayed up all night to count the ballots, with election officials eagerly sharing results with journalists and then radioing them to the central electoral commission in Colthage itself.

Preliminary efforts to guarantee the independence of state radio was also underway. If Zanno Mzelqatid expected gratitude from the unmuzzled press, he was in for a rude awakening. Journalists scrutinised the interim-government's every move. Questionable decisions during the civil war, the pace of reforms, and the independence of the Sufrit were the topic of frequent reports. For the first time since the consolidation of Zarcid power, criticism of the government cut through to the masses, with a large effect on public opinion.

"Ah, mister Bodazthart, to what do I owe the pleasure of company in my free time?" The Constitutionalist gave as a greeting.\n\n"It is an outrage of the highest order, Zanno! And I urge you to deal with it forthwith." The landowner's hoof pointed out the window, his body shaking slightly with cropped up anger. In response, Zanno put down his book and trotted over to the balcony, followed by Bodazthart. There, on one of Colthage's Citadel's many squares, a large group of workers gathered, some waving red banners, and others carrying signs. One of the signs depicted Bodazthart as a fat dragon, another had him surrounded by parasprites. Chants reached up to the office balcony; "Justice for the workers! Free the slaves!

I could not help but overhear your gathering today, and I was wondering what seems to be the matter." At mentioning his name, more of the protesters came closer, curious about the senator. The farmer seemed a little taken aback by such an important figure talking to him, and he gripped his pitchfork tight. "Oh, oh. Well we thought now that we have the right to protest, we would use it, you know?"\n\nZaranzid nodded patiently, giving a gentle smile. "Indeed, and I appreciate you all coming out. But could you tell me what you are protesting for?"\nThe farmer took a deep breath. "Land reform." He takes another breath, as if to gather courage. "You see mister Senator, construction workers have been hard at work building schools in my village, and in others too. And I really appreciate that you are thinking of my children, but."\nA mare cut in, "I am from Coltva, and with our meagre land, we cannot afford to send our foals to school. We need the land reform you promised!" Her words could count on support from the other farmers, which made the senator nod gravely.\n\n"I see. That is unfortunate. I am afraid that is a matter for the new government, however, after elections." The senator wished he could tell the protesters anything else. He did not know if any new government would be able to wrangle the Landowners into parting with their land. The farmers seemed disappointed.

The zebra was sentenced for abuse of office, misappropriation of government funds and blasphemy. Batrun Zaryes, leader of a clique of generals known as the militarists, was sentenced for treason against the Republic for his major role in supporting the Zarcids and fighting the Constitutionalist uprising.\n\nNext the crowd watched as a wide eyed Bezelshazzar Zerutra and a restrained Jebzel Zoblos were tried for crimes committed during the Zarcas' reign. Zerutra interrupted the justice when she gave the list of charges, choosing to admit to all accounts rather than hear them spoken out loud. Zoblos was more combative, trying first with words, and then with hoof to intimidate the quorum of judges. It took four bailiffs to carry her out of the courtroom. Both generals were stripped of their rank and sentenced to prison for crimes against Zebrakind.\n\nLastly, three Zarca brothers entered the courtroom, a silent crowd gazing as the three zebras held their heads up in unison, listening to the council member who brought forth the charges. It took her a while to finish, the gaze of the ex-Sufrit making her stammer on occasion. Finally, she rounded off. "Therefore, I advise the council to sentence the suspects with capital punishment." There were gasps from the audience in the courtroom, as the presiding justice waited for a response. Three Zarcids stood unmoved before the council, but the fourth jolted up from the audience, carrying a stack of papers.

Zalathel grinned, Zago smiled, and Zasdrubal kept his feelings hidden as the zebra made her way to the court floor and began her defence. Zaphod recited ancient law and precedent, reminding the justices of the difficult position the Zarca family had been in, how they liberated Colthage from the Storm King, and how the lessons they learned from that war had been the wrong ones.\n\nAll justices met until the dark of night, but none of the audience left the courtroom.

The latter tried to give an encouraging smile from behind his desk. "Come now Zanno, do not let them get to you. We will find another way to bring these zebras to justice." Zaranzid could not contain his anger any longer, however. "Stop it with your eternal nuance." He stared at Zanno with fiery eyes, but his leader only gave back a dim look.

"The people will not just forget who brought them their freedom. Let us put our faith in our citizens." Zarra's voice carried calmly through the room, his smile trying to melt Zaranzid's anger.\n"The election, yes, the election. You realise we have achieved nothing so far? We may as well print the Plan of Zapza as our manifesto again, because we achieved none of our promises!"\n"Please, my friend. Do not desert me now. Do not give up on our dream." Mzelqatid pleaded, as Zaranzid recalled the preparations for the civil war, the triumphs and the low points. Zanno's idealism and his genuine character. Would it be enough to see him through? To see them all through?\n"I am sorry, I was beside myself. Let us prepare your campaign, my friend." Zaranzid sighed, patting Zanno on the shoulder. "

Citizenship was not universal, and not every Colthaginian qualified, despite promises from the constitutionalists to extend the franchise. As the restored constitution stipulated, one Sufrit was elected by the citizenry, while the Co-Sufrit was appointed by the Sufrit. Three major candidates emerged. The first was Batrun Zaryes, a popular general in the Colthaginian army. Secondly, there was Jezabzella Zeshmid, a harmonite patrician, whose campaign was hampered by harassment from unknown thugs and by multiple major donors inexplicably withdrawing support. Lastly, Zanno Mzelqatid, the leader of the Constitutionalists, rallied much of the moderate vote behind him, along with tactical voters afraid of Zaryes. The inability of the interim government to deal with the old order had disillusioned much of Zanno's base, however.\n\nAs election day came to a close, the electoral commission announced a turnout of 59%. Several polling stations took a long time to report any results, meaning that it took until the morning after the election for the commission to announce a preliminary result; Zanno Mzelqatid got a slight majority of the vote. Jezabzella took the opportunity to speak over the airwaves, congratulating her rival on his victory.\n\nHowever, as Zanno gave his victory speech, Batrun Zaryes also came on the radio. The general announced his team was investigating several reports of voter fraud, pointing out that some of the polling booths which took the longest to report their results were in the western heartlands of Zanno. He denounced the constitutionalist as a fraud on the radio, threatening repercussions. Militarist and scientific senators, as well as several governors, soon rallied to demand a formal inquiry into the election, despite the commission's assurance the results were valid. Colthage was uneasy the next days, with citizens protesting on Zanno's behalf, but the Senate, still filled with supporters of the old order, refusing to ratify the election's result and demanding an inquiry."

Although multiple leftist candidates ran for the position as well, their inability to ally meant there were only two contenders on election day. The first was Zanno Mzelqatid, the leader of the Constitutionalists, who enjoyed much support from the middle class, more conservative voters, and the west of the country generally. He had been taking a hit in the polls recently due to the inaction of the interim government. His opponent was Jezabzella Zeshmid, the harmonite candidate, who campaigned aggressively, managing to form a broad coalition, with a solid base in the capital and cities along the north-eastern coast.\n\nAs election day came to a close, the electoral commission announced that the turnout was 82%, the highest percentage in 30 years. Thousands of volunteers stayed up all night to count the ballots, with election officials eagerly sharing results with journalists and then radioing them to the commission in Colthage. Supporters of the two candidates stayed up late at night, glued to their radio as a preliminary result was declared;\nJezabzella had won a slight majority of the votes. Many zebras rejoiced, but some waited anxiously for Zanno's calming voice to come over the radio waves. The constitutionalist conceded and congratulated Jezabzella, reminding his voters that leading opposition was as honourable a task as being Sufrit.\n\nZanno had expelled any fear of post-election violence with his concession, and in the days after, the Senate convened to recognise the vote as legitimate, preparing for a new Sufrit to be instated."

They took over the prison, I think they freed many prisoners. They are on their way to the Citadel."\n"Whose soldiers? How did they get here?"\n"Our soldiers, major. Batrun Zaryes marches at their head."\n"Sweet mother Zanit..." Major Pazeb muttered, before jolting up on his hooves. "Get the senators and the delegates inside the building. Gather every zebra who can shoot a rifle. And get sandbags up here." The corporal saluted nervously and stormed out. "Commander of the Citadel! Ceremonial position, my flank. Of course, I had to be the one promoted away to the capital." Pazeb grumbled to himself, before grabbing a helm, a hipflask of rum and a rifle.\n\nA few minutes later the entire quarter was in chaos, with many zebras fleeing into the Senate building and its surroundings, and soldiers and police officers erecting barricades and sandbag walls. On the Senate's roof, a zebra shouted: "They're coming!" The work immediately ceased, shovels and hammers dropping to the ground as guns were drawn and cover taken. Pazeb huddled behind a sandbag, rifle in hoof, as a full column of soldiers marched up the street, halting a good fifty metres from him. In front of them stood General Zaryes, in full dress uniform, his medals gleaming in the sun.\n"Good afternoon, citizens. I have urgent business in the Senate building, so stand aside." The general's voice carried through the silent street.\nThe major bit his lip, but then spoke up. "You are in violation of the Constitution of the Republic. Stand down, general."\n"I am merely coming to help the Senate ratify the right result." Zaryes smirked, staring at the Senate building, his final goal.\n\nMajor Pazeb sighed deeply. The zebras around him stared anxiously as he aimed his Ochzor rifle, and pulled the trigger. A moment later, General Zaryes' body slumped down on the street, and his soldiers dispersed into cover to fight back. The firefight lasted the rest of the day, but without their leader, many of the coup's supporters surrendered and were arrested. Batrun Zaryes would close his eyes for the final time in sight of the Senate, his coup attempt suppressed before he could even declare himself Sufrit. "

Much of the lower city, and the area around the Senate, were in control of Major Pazeb and constitutionalist supporting army units, but while Zaryes had been defeated, Zalathel Zarca escaped prison. He and what remained of his supporters had taken over much of the Byrza Citadel, raiding armouries which had been stocked with artillery and other heavy weapons for a potential attack against the capital. Citizens cowered in basements as the Zarcids aimed their howitzers at the Senate, bombarding the ancient building and demanding the 'illegitimate government' surrender. Relief came in the person of Bezelshazzar Zerutra, who led his forces to Colthage from the countryside. The general took over the defence effort, with Major Pazeb gladly giving him the title of Commander of the Citadel. He brought his own artillery, with which he took aim at the Temple of Za'al, and other citadel strongpoints of the Zarcids. Fires raged uncontrollably through the city as the two sides clashed, crushing civilians between their lines.\n\nIn the Senate, the remnants of the constitutional government hid from the fighting, and Sufrit Zarra met with Zanno Mzelqatid. The Sufrit spoke, "Please, my friend. Let us go out there, and broker a peace between the two sides. We need to protect our people."\nZanno shook his head. "There is no negotiating with these brutes, Sufrit. They speak only for themselves. We must endure."\nZarra sighed. A loud boom echoed through the halls, as small pieces of the ceiling came down and the floor shook. Another impact. "We will be torn asunder. Zanno, Colthage does not have much endurance left. We must give way before she collapses."\n"Never! My brother told me to not give up. He said the Republic is worth fighting for. We cannot give up now!" Zanno's voice echoed through the hall, lifting the heads of the senators and others hiding inside. On their faces, weariness and fear were setting in. There was no end in sight."

Zanno Mzelqatid got up from his makeshift bed, his eyes full of hope. "Maybe they won... Maybe we can go back to normal..." He muttered, making his way to the exit, talking to soldiers and finding his way to General Zerutra's headquarters. The city was in shambles, and even the small trip meant Zanno had to climb rubble multiple times. Soldiers saluted the leader of the constitutionalists as he reached Zerutra's office, and the general stood up to shake hooves with Zanno. "General, it is good to see you. I see the fighting has stopped. Do you have good news?"\n\nBezelshazzar Zerutra gave a small smile. "Yes, I have been able to broker a ceasefire with Zarca." His smile dropped. "However, I will need you to drop your claim to the Sufrit's office. Zarca was adamant that you would not replace him."\nZanno shook his head. "General, I cannot agree to that. You know how many have given their all for me to succeed? I cannot meet such demands, even if I wanted to."\nThe general put his hoof on Zanno's shoulder. "Mister Mzelqatid, there is no reason to make this difficult. Resign."\n"No, no, no!" Zanno reiterated.\n"Then you leave me no choice." Zerutra raised his voice and shouted. "Guards, take Mzelqatid away, he is a threat to the peace!" The leader of the constitutionalists struggled with his depleted strength, but eventually he gave up.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic stipulated that in an emergency, a sufrit without a co-sufrit would be succeeded by the Commander of the Citadel, who was presumed to be in charge of the defence of the city. Carefully relaying the order of events to the rest of the country, Zerutra claimed the title of Sufrit, shaking hooves with Zalathel Zarca, who fully expected to be reinstated after the dust was settled. In his eyes, Zerutra had always been loyal, crushing any threats to the family. Within ten days of the coup, Bezelshazzar Zerutra was the most powerful zebra in Colthage."

The older sergeant sighed as they trotted into an alleyway. Zanno frowned, his eyes darting nervously between the two soldiers. "I don't think this is the way." He tried, while the two soldiers kept leading the would-be Sufrit to the end of the alley, until Zanno reached a brick wall. "Sergeant, private, I think we ought to head back now." Zanno tried again.\n"I'm sorry, please stand still. Close your eyes. It will be over soon." The private said, as the two soldiers trotted back a little, their rifles aiming at Zanno.\nThe leader of the Constitutionalists froze to the ground, staring at the two barrels. "Brother, is this why you wanted me to try? You wanted me to come to you?"\n\nTwo gunshots ended the life of Zanno Mzelqatid. He would never make it to prison.\n\nAfter Zanno's body was found in the alleyway, acting Sufrit Zerutra ordered a full investigation into his death, but no news came. In the west of the country, Zanno's supporters whispered that the sufrit ordered the killing to eliminate opposition. This rumour was soon fed by Zenut Zaranzid, who assumed the mantle of leader of the constitutionalists. The senior senator had fled Colthage when the fighting broke out, re-emerging in Zapsa. As the capital settled down from the fighting, the rest of the country started to stir. Protests were planned, pamphlets shared and schemes hatched. With his death, Zanno Mzelqatid turned from a disgrace to a martyr for the cause, his name carried on banners in every town in the west."

Critics have been quick to point out that this personnel reshuffling goes against the constitution. In response, the new Sufrit has pushed back aggressively, claiming such complaints rest on "arbitrary, irrational dogma," and promising his administration will do away with "metaphysical politics" altogether.\n\nDespite Baltazar's grand ambitions, his position is far from secure. The problems facing Colthage have not gone anywhere, and his administration will have to fix them while facing threats from both within and without.\n\nAt the moment, opposition to Baltazar within the government is concentrated mainly in the army, where only a small fraction currently support him. It goes without saying that this level of distrust between military zebras and civilian officials is harmful to both Colthage's stability and its security. If Baltazar wants to remain in power for long, the loyalty of soldiers and generals will need to be earned, and earned fast.\n\nAnother challenge facing the new Sufrit is growing divisions within the Scientific Clique itself. The most relevant one is the split between older and more conservative Scientifids and the young and progressive Scientifids. Although they all agree on the power of science and its ability to advance society for the betterment of all creatures, the two sides have differing ideas on what the new social order should look like, and what policies should be implemented to bring it about."

 colthage_other.73.d:0 "One of the primary reform platforms of the Scientifids has been the overhauling of how state officials and bureaucrats receive their positions, given the widespread prevalence of nepotism, corruption, and general unsuitability of these officials under the Zarcid regime. This has drastically reduced the overall strength and efficiency of the state, lessening its ability to handle problems and crises, reducing the citizenry's confidence in the government, in turn leading them to ideologies that will only further destabilize the nation, as demonstrated in the situations with the Constitutionalists and Coltvans. To break the cycle and restore our state's capacity, the Scientifids have nearly unanimously agreed to implement a robust meritocratic appointment process to ensure that all state officials are qualified and capable to serve in the offices they occupy; however, disagreements between the Old and Young Scientifids in the implementation of this process have once again been brought to the forefront of Senatorial politics.\n\nThe Old Scientifids support a purely internal system of appointment conducted through a series of rigorous qualifications that a zebra must meet to be considered for that position (those qualifications, in turn, being drafted by an independent council of experts specific to a given field). At the same time, the Young Scientifids argue that the government should let the public decide who gets to run what through elections for various executive offices, though they still support the rigorous qualifications to qualify as candidates. Though this seems like a return to the mob rule the Constitutionalists promote, the Young Scientifids bring up valid points regarding the fact that the Old Scientifids system is based on the assumption that the fields in which the officials are working lack any room for interpretation or debate. This could allow for the possibility of bias to appear in appointments should one interpretation of a field be preferred over another, something that would be doubly concerning given the insular nature of these appointments. By allowing elections for these offices, we would be opening the door to allow a more comprehensive portion of the population to decide how their government should be run, and though it would not eliminate bias, it would certainly minimize it.\n\nCountering, the Old Scientifids bring up the fact that the public is not well informed enough to make proper judgments on the candidates they would be voting on, thus allowing candidates to manipulate public opinion based on emotions rather than evidence, giving further likelihood to a less than ideal candidate winning an election. The Young Scientifids then refute this by bringing up the various high-quality education proposals pushed by the Old Scientifids, causing another counterargument from the Old Scientifids in a seemingly never-ending cycle for weeks on end. In truth, the goal of these debates is never to sway the other side but rather to bring the Clique onto yours, as they do have the final say in all aspects of policy."

After taking a seat, Batrun's eyes lingered on the conspicuously empty space where Zamilcar Zarca's portrait had once hung.\n\n"Ah, greetings," Baltazar said, bowing his head slightly. "It's been far too long since we had a chat, but things have been very busy around here. I'm sure you understand." Baltazar chuckled. Batrun responded with stony silence. "Well... let's skip the pleasantries, then!" Baltazar tapped his desk while awkwardly clearing his throat.

Three: Heed any demands the military may have and fulfil them with all possible haste." Batrun tried to read Baltazar's expression, but the Sufrit wore a poker face. "Do this, and there will be no cause for strife between us," he continued, leaning back in his chair. "You see, I have no problem leaving domestic affairs to the relevant experts—but warfare is a science as well, and we generals are experts of war. Our expertise must be respected; surely you agree?" Batrun asked, cocking an eyebrow.\n\n"Yes, that is all quite reasonable." Baltazar nodded after a few seconds of mock-hesitation. In his head, he knew he had no choice but to accept. "I assure you, every one of those things will be done!" Baltazar extended a hoof towards Batrun. The general smiled wide and shook his hoof, meeting Baltazar's gaze with friendly eyes. But behind those eyes, Baltazar could sense a ruthless predator, one whose ambition had not yet been sated. There was no doubt about it: his new Co-Sufrit was a dangerous stallion."

Unfortunately, production has declined in recent years due to domestic upheavals. We need to get things back on track: achieving prosperity is critical to both maintaining our popularity among the citizenry and ensuring the future security of Colthage.\n\nTo this end, some of the Old Scientifids want the state to take a more direct role in the economy, using economic calculation and the scientific method to manage it. We would be able, via government controls and regulations, to take all necessary measures to keep conditions stable and promote economic growth. Instead of relying on countless individuals, none of whom can see the bigger picture, a strategic plan would allow our experts to make decisions about how best to allocate resources on a nationwide scale.\n\nThe Young Scientifids, however, are sceptical of this plan, arguing that the government should instead leave the economy alone and make it as free as possible. They assert that, fundamentally, it is impossible for any centralised agency to efficiently process all the information generated by a modern economy. A free market system, by contrast, requires no overall coordinating centre.

They promise that, if given the go-ahead, they could pacify the entire region in under two weeks.\n\nSome Scientifids are sceptical of the feasibility of a military solution and are proposing another way forward. They claim that Coltva is nothing more than a backwater province full of uneducated peasants, therefore it is not worth the cost in blood and treasure of continuing to enforce direct rule. They claim that instead of throwing ever-more resources into the Coltvan quagmire, it would be best to just give them what they want and permit them a degree of self-government.

The conflict arose once the Clique sponsored legislation implementing higher standards for mercenaries regarding their employment and contracts with the government, setting off alarm bells within the Militarist faction, who quickly made their strong opinions known to the Clique.\n\nThe Militarists, led by General Zaryes, has been pushing for the establishment of a permanent standing army, citing increased loyalty to the country they're fighting for and improved cohesion between units in carrying out military operations, all helping to build a more stable and reliable army to protect the Colthaginian nation's interests. Of course, one would be remiss in thinking that these were the only motivations for Zaryes' lobbying, for the interests he often cites as being for Colthage can tend to benefit him one way or another. The permanent standing army that Zaryes has frequently advocated for contains no measures to curb the military's influence over civilian politics, and in its current state would only serve to give Zaryes an expanded base of support for his hardline militarist rhetoric, allowing him to extort the state for the military's, and his, own benefit. It is for this reason that the Scientifids support a meritocratic mercenary force, as mercenaries are kept loyal and quiet through a stable cash flow, with the additional standards giving them a degree of professionalism to mimic a standing army. It would also provide the government a pillar to fall back on should Zaryes and his cronies ever decide to do away with civilian rule.\n\nStill, dealing with the standing army as it exists now is a risky endeavor, as Zaryes would easily be able to move against the government before the full effects of the reforms could be put in place, and Zaryes' vigorous opposition to the bill coupled with the strained relationship between General Zaryes and Sufrit Zakbar may prove to be too much for us to handle. Though it would be safer if we appeased Zaryes with a professional army in the hopes of gaining his support, one cannot deny the benefits a primarily mercenary force would give us."

 colthage_other.79.d:0 "Abstract:\nThe striped black-and-white colourization of a zebra's coat makes it difficult to discern what the 'primary' colour is. At first glance, it might appear that the 'base' colour is white and that the black stripes are 'secondary', or vice versa. The fact that a fully shaved zebra with no fur is black does not answer this question, as it is related to the coat, not the skin. The goal of this experiment is to discover the 'primary' or 'default' colour of fur by inhibiting melanin production.\nProcedure:\nThe test subject, a healthy 32-year-old female zebra was administered mercury salts over a long enough time period to cause a visible reduction in melanin production.\nAnalysis:\nWith reduced melanin, the test subject's fur turned whiter as the black stripes faded. White stripes therefore represent the absence of melanin. This proves that zebras have white fur with black stripes.\nConclusions:\nFurther study could focus on learning the evolutionary purpose of stripes, to explain why they exist in the first place. In addition, the mechanism that causes melanocytes to cease melanin production in a stripe pattern is worth investigating as well."

It was not a caravan of merchants, but a 'scientific expedition', whatever that means. There were old zebras with amusingly large moustaches escorted by stern soldiers. They set up camp near the settlement of Azir and appeared to investigate the nearby ruins, as if they were looking for something. They continued this for many days, before suddenly packing up their tent village and leaving. They gave no explanation for their journey and spoke very little with the locals, preferring to avoid them whenever possible. It is a shame, for we could've told them much about the ruins."
 colthage_other.80.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nColthaginian patricians have long spoken of a rumour spread by merchants who cross the Zebhara desert. According to the rumour, monolithic ruins of dark stone can be found near the settlement of Azir. This expedition aims to investigate the source of these rumours, and potentially conduct an archaeological survey of the site if it exists.\nExpedition Review:\nIn total, around 2000 personnel attended the expedition. Vast majority of these were military or logistics personnel escorting the scientists. There were enough supplies for a two-month expedition. The expedition was launched from Colthage, heading directly south along a well known caravan route. As the expedition entered the Zebhara desert, conditions quickly worsened. While there was more than enough water, preparations for preventing afflictions such as heatstroke and sunburn proved to be insufficient. Therefore, many lives were lost during the expedition. After several weeks, Azir was reached and a base camp was established near the settlement. Ruins were soon spotted in the vicinity and further studies commenced. The ruins are clearly extremely old, as the march of time has reduced them to little more than a pile of rubble. Several excavations were made, but nothing noteworthy was found. Many photographs and other records were made for further study. The native savages caused no trouble and provided supplies for the return journey.\nConclusions:\nThe poor condition of the ruins and their difficult location means that further study is not worthwhile. Valuable experience was gained from the expedition, however. In the future, better preparations will be made for travel through harsh arid environments."

 colthage_other.81.d:0 "Abstract:\nThe stripe colour experiment proved that the spiral symbol on a zebra's flank is a magical one, as the cessation of melanin production failed to remove it. The true purpose of the symbol, shared by all zebras, has never been learned. Some theorize it to be similar to a pony's cutie mark, but this has not been scientifically proven. The goal of this experiment is to discover potential similarities between the two types of flank symbols.\nProcedure:\nA potion containing the Heart's Desire flower was prepared. When ingested by a pony, it causes the Cutie Pox disease, a magical affliction which causes numerous cutie marks to appear, giving the afflicted pony an excessive amount of special talents which can result in death or injury at worst. A cure was prepared in advance with the Seeds of Truth. The potion was then administered to a healthy 27-year-old male zebra.\nAnalysis:\nThe potion had no noticeable physical effects. The zebra was a woodworker, so he was requested to cut down trees. He proved to be far more efficient at the task than before. The Heart's Desire potion is known to cause a similar talent-enhancing effect on other creatures as well, so it is unrelated to the flank symbol.\nConclusions:\nThe experiment proves that the flank symbols of zebras are not cutie marks. However, it does not provide an explanation for their purpose. Further experimentation is required to provide additional data."

They were zebras using local canoes, but their clothing and appearance were... unusual. Not only that, but they appeared to be equipped with advanced technology. An attempt to stop the group ended up with our soldiers being fired upon and retreating. There were several hundred canoes in total, so a larger force was gathered to stop them for questioning. The foreigners however had machine guns on their boats and mowed down anyone who approached. Long-range guns were fired upon them but they proved to have little effect.\n\nOur soldiers resorted to following them at a distance and scouting their movements. They entered deep into the country, nearly unopposed, and nobody knew if this was or wasn't a raid. They travelled all the way south to the Thunder Cliffs, where they appeared to study... rivers.\n\nAfter a while, the strange group turned around and travelled downstream. We let them pass as they had caused no trouble after initial confrontations. It remains unclear what their purpose was, or from where they had even come from."
 colthage_other.82.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nThe Neighle river covers an extremely long distance, and is often used for traffic across the Zebhara desert. However, the source of the river remains a mystery, primarily because the headwaters lie in the homeland of the Yeti. This expedition aims to discover the source of the river despite the danger.\nExpedition Review:\nA strong military escort was prepared to defend the expedition from potential Yeti aggression. A large quantity of supplies were gathered in preparation for the long journey. First, several naval vessels embarked from Hippone, arriving in Somnambula several days later. Then the expedition embarked on Maregyptian river ferries to travel upstream as far as possible. Several cataracts were crossed. When the Great Lakes were reached, hundreds of local canoes were loaned to continue the journey. Unrest in the region led to several skirmishes which caused many deaths. Finally, the homeland of the Yeti was reached. It did not take long for the Yeti to launch probing attacks at our expedition, but they were successfully repelled. With supplies running low, the headwaters in the region were explored extensively, with every tributary examined. Finally, the primary source of the Neighle was found in the southern Thunder Cliffs. The water comes from mountain glaciers that melt in the summer, causing flooding downstream. The expedition then turned back, resupplying in the cities of Hayzebland along the way.\nConclusions:\nThe Neighle is fed by many rivers flowing from the southern mountains, so there is no single clear source. However, there was one brook that is the proposed source stream due to being the furthest away from the estuary of the Neighle."

Most interaction between zebras and cattle occurs in the countryside, and little study has been done on the subject. But with more and more citizens comparing the status of livestock to slavery (or vice versa) it is necessary to learn more about the mentality of cows and bulls.\nProcedure:\nA healthy fifteen-year-old cow named Arizona was interviewed at her home farm near Trotkat. The owner gave permission for it to be conducted. The cow spoke in a thick rural accent, so the owner acted as translator when needed.\nAnalysis:\nThe cow was asked numerous questions and the following information was learned: Cattle are intelligent, they are fully content with their situation, and they have acted as livestock for countless generations. They are used to being taken care of. In a way, they live in a symbiotic relationship, providing milk and fertilizing manure for their caretakers, and, when they die of old age, hides for leather. The cow showed no issue with lack of freedoms or rights and seemed ignorant of the concept of politics. She also appeared to be pleased with her life despite never leaving the farm. The status of livestock was willingly accepted by her.\nConclusions:\nBased on this interview, the keeping of livestock is morally justified especially if all of them share the worldview of the interviewed cow. However, further study and additional interviews are required to confirm the hypothesis."

 colthage_other.84.d:0 "Abstract:\nThe extraction of magical energy of a creature is known to be possible. When Lord Tirek attacked Equestria, he famously drained the magic of thousands of ponies. Yet this was thought to be an innate ability. The Storm King, wielding the Staff of Sacanas, proved that it is possible to extract magical energy with an external tool. Using this method of energy extraction, it might be possible to remove a zebra's magical energy and thus discover what abilities are lost without the spiral symbol.\nProcedure:\nAfter gathering information about magical crystals and the Staff of Sacanas (primarily from Equestrian sources), over a month was spent making a machine that fulfills a similar purpose. This machine was then experimentally used on a healthy 43-year-old male zebra.\nAnalysis:\nAfter several attempts the machine functioned as intended. The magical crystal within it successfully absorbed the test subject's energy, draining it entirely. The removal of magic had a severe effect on the test subject. They became weak, the pupils of their eyes faded and the spiral symbol on their flank disappeared. They were unable to stand and had to be carried to a hospital. Completion of tests to measure abilities impacted by the absence of magic was impossible for them. Their magical energy reserves are expected to recover naturally over the course of several months.\nConclusions:\nThe extraction of magic had such a strong effect on the zebra that it was impossible to say what had been lost with the disappearance of the flank symbol. In that regard, the experiment was a failure. However, it was the first successful attempt of using a machine to extract magical energy from a sapient creature."

 colthage_other.85.t:0 "Experiment Report: Magical Injection"
 colthage_other.85.d:0 "Abstract:\nWith extraction of magical energy being successful, it should be possible to simply reverse the flow and thus inject energy into a creature. The effects of such an experiment are potentially dangerous, so extensive preparations are necessary. Injecting magical energy into a zebra should, theoretically, increase the effects of the magical spiral symbol, thus making it clear to observe what those effects are.\nProcedure:\nThe same machine that was used for extraction will be used for injection, with the flow reversed. The magical crystal that was filled with energy in the previous experiment will be used again. The test subject was a healthy 37-year-old female zebra. The experiment was made in a secure environment with the presence of armed guards.\nAnalysis:\nThe test subject grew rapidly in size and began to glow with raw energy. Their muscle strength increased noticeably. No changes were seen on their flank symbol. The test subject's mental state remained stable, and they were asked to prepare a potion, despite having no prior experience of making one. The task was fulfilled successfully. The test subject also succeeded in several tests of endurance and resilience which the control group was unable to do. Within several hours the test subject's condition began to rapidly deteriorate, their skin and flesh melting unnaturally. The test subject expired before magic could be removed from their body.\nConclusions:\nThe end result was similar to the previous experiment. The effect of magic was too great and it was not clear what impact the flank symbol had, if any at all. The test did prove that zebras are unable to handle excessive amounts of magical energy. It is possible that other races, such as unicorns, centaurs or changelings, have a larger innate "power capacity". A significant amount of data related to the effects of magic was gathered, which should prove useful in the future."

 colthage_other.86.d:0 "Abstract:\nScholars from abroad have proven with empirical evidence that magical crystals grow naturally. The cause of this growth is as of yet unknown, and the effect has not been replicated in a laboratory environment. As crystals are inherently magical, the primary driving force is unlikely to be related to factors such as temperature or air pressure. This experiment will attempt to use magical energy to stimulate crystal growth.\nProcedure:\nA device similar to a magical rifle developed abroad was constructed for the purposes of the experiment. It discharges magical energy into a focused point at a slow rate. The machine will be used on a small magical crystal.\nAnalysis:\nContinued discharge of energy over a period of a week caused the crystal to grow at a relatively rapid rate, about one centimeter every three hours. Higher rates of discharge accelerated the growth, but at a critical point, the target crystal shattered.\nConclusions:\nThe experiment was successful and proved that the growth of magical crystals can be artificially stimulated with the use of fully grown crystals that are charged with magical energy. It is evidence for the theory that crystals naturally grow in places with a high density of magical energy flows. These locations are most often found underground, where crystals usually appear as well."

 colthage_other.87.d:0 "Abstract:\nMotor functions of hooves have been studied extensively and are well understood. Even without scientific study, it is possible to understand how hooves can be used to grasp objects. Prehensile appendages of other species are another matter: Hands and claws have long confounded both ponies and zebras. In this study, the functioning of these forelimbs will be examined closely.\nProcedure:\nThere were two test subjects: A healthy 25-year-old female harpy and a healthy 39-year-old male minotaur. The former utilizes claws for grasping, while the latter has hands. They were given a series of tasks to complete under close monitoring. In addition, X-ray scans of both appendages will be made.\nAnalysis:\nThe two test subjects were able to complete all tasks successfully, and in some of them they proved to be more efficient than zebras. They could grasp, hold, flip and throw various objects as well as fulfill tasks requiring high degrees of precision. There was little difference between the performance of claws and hands. The X-ray scans showed their inner structures to be somewhat similar. A significant feature shared by both were opposable "thumbs", or dewclaws in the case of claws.\nConclusions:\nThe experiment provided a significant amount of data on the functioning of the prehensile appendages. It appears that the primary advantage of them are talons or fingers which can wrap around objects. Most important of these "digits" are "thumbs" which allows different types of grasping, most notably "precision grip" and "power grip". The versatility of the appendages is so significant that their form should be copied and utilized in one way or another. For example, it might be possible to construct machinery that functions in a similar manner, enabling easier completion of motor tasks requiring precision."

Instead of seeing conflict, they see compatibility between religion and science, regarding the two as non-overlapping since they address fundamentally separate forms of knowledge and aspects of life.

Their "guided evolution" programme includes incentives for highly educated citizens to reproduce, promotes genetic screening of newborns, encourages making birth control more accessible, and recommends implementing marriage restrictions. These measures are meant to weed out weak and lazy elements of society and refine the genetics of Colthaginian zebras, ultimately leading to a better, more fit society.\n\nHowever, the proposed programme has run into fierce opposition from Young Scientifids, who see eugenics as highly unethical and scientifically invalid. They believe it is a short jump from these seemingly-benign measures to dangerous barbarism: state-sponsored genetic discrimination against individuals perceived as "inferior." They argue that given the complexity of zebra genetics, there can be no objective means of determining which traits are desirable or undesirable.

At last, the commoners would become masters of their own fates.\n\nUnrest spread in the countryside as the zebras protested against their poor living conditions. This anger was channeled by the harmonite movement, who organized the dissatisfied people into a single, united movement, while also providing armaments. [Root.GetLeader] was aware of this, but failed to take decisive action against the harmonites before it was too late.\n\nSoon, peasants and citizens from across the country began flooding the capital, marching in protest of the ruling government. They filled streets to the brim with their numbers. It was an alarming situation for [Root.GetLeader], so an order was sent to the garrison to restore order in the city. However, many soldiers were disillusioned by the popular discontent and refused to act against their fellow Colthaginians. Some loyalists to the Sufrit obeyed and tried to crack down on the protesters, but this only resulted in a massive riot. Soon enough, the Citadel of Byrza was stormed by armed commoners who freed many political prisoners.\n\nThe senate gathered in an emergency meeting and voted to push [Root.GetLeader] out of office, blaming them for both causing the unrest and failing to stop it.

The Sufrit's office had never felt this empty before, even though it usually was occupied by one zebra, who himself was still seated at his desk, finishing his reading of a report on bullying in schools. It had been a minor legal oversight that let the report slip to his desk as he worked on his final act, an oversight that had been quickly accounted for and corrected, but as such an act now lay finished beside him, Baltazar Zakbar couldn't help but read it out of a sense of nostalgia. It seemed like so long ago when he had first been granted the office of Sufrit by the Senate, from the chaos of the Storm King's reign, and even from when he had joined the Scientific Clique to serve Zamilcar Zarca, yet despite those feelings here he was.\n\nColthage had grown so much under his reign, from a relatively prosperous backwater to a modern paragon of science, technology, and progress. He took a humble pride towards these accomplishments as he looked out of the window upon the various new skyscrapers piercing the heavens, symbols of the nation's might, orderly, pristine, and precise, just as things should be. Still, he knew that he couldn't last forever and that when he did go, he would have no way of guiding the nation forwards, no way of knowing whether the nation could weather crises or even hold itself together after his departure. All that he could do was hope that the systems he had put in place over his tenure would be enough to sustain the country long past his demise, and it was this matter that was the concern of his final act, a constitutional amendment regarding the executive. Regardless of the formalities and the advisors, the position of Sufrit was one similar to that of a dictator, where the rules for the ruler were whatever they decided them to be, a fundamentally flawed form of government, as it allowed one zebra control over all matters of state, and zebras on their own always think that they are correct all of the time. Even he was not immune to it; it was a simple fact of their existence.\n\nStill, though, there was a solution to the problem, to not vest executive power in any one zebra, but to instead vest it in a technocratic council of experts, who could talk and debate freely amongst one another until they came to a consensus on the problem at hoof. Although research had already shown that zebras made better decisions when they had to come to a consensus, he would still allow himself some time to observe the implementation of the system from his retirement so that if it were to go awry, he could always come back in one way or another to set it straight. Still, he expected his observance to be more of a hobby than anything else.\n\n"Hey, Grandpa. Are you ready to come home yet? I promised to take some friends out for dinner, and I thought it'd be cool if you joined us," his teenage granddaughter entered the office. Filing the report away and bringing the act in front of him, he smiled as he signed his name as Sufrit for the final time before giving it a wax seal, as was tradition for amendments. "I am now.""

He mounted an archaeological expedition there and was proven to be correct. However, his work ended with his unexpected murder, and the expedition returned home. This expedition aims to conclude the excavations which were started years ago.\nExpedition Review:\nA small fleet escorted by military vessels departed the port of Hippone and sailed north to Scarlet Island. While the Sicameonese were sceptical of the military personnel accompanying the expedition, they allowed them to land and escort the scientists. The expedition then headed to the dig site, which had been preserved by the local scientific community, and proceeded with the excavation. Sicameonese griffons volunteered to help with the manual labour. After several months many ruined buildings were unearthed, along with several thousand artifacts, ranging from arrowheads to golden jewelry and coins. A full list of items is included in the appendix.\nConclusions:\nThe expedition concluded Professor Balazar Zatid's work and allows historians to form a far more complete image of Colthaginian history. The Sicameonese proved to be far more cooperative than before, and were given some of the discovered artifacts as compensation for their aid (donated items are marked in the list). The rest were brought back to Colthage, and some of them will be put on display in a public museum exhibit."

 colthage_other.98.d_no_colthage:0 "Foreigners, strange creatures who are not zebras or kirin, are an increasingly common sight in south eastern Zebrica. They are for the most part greedy griffons who yearn for treasure to fill the gaping holes in their hollow hearts.\n\nBut this time, the intruders were different.\n\nScouts reported of a large group of zebras making their way through the jungle. Yet these zebras wore griffon clothing and spoke a strange, unfamiliar language. Some of them carried weapons, while others seemed to study their surroundings closely. The scouts remained hidden, following the strangers.\n\nThey wandered in the jungle for many days, and while it was clear they did not know the way, they were slowly but surely approaching the sacred Golden Temple. When the scouts reported this, a war party was swiftly assembled to stop the trespassers. They were soon surrounded from all sides and an ambush was launched. Panic soon spread among them, and they frantically fired their guns at the foliage. After the initial shock, they reorganized to better defend themselves, so our warriors retreated.\n\nAnother ambush was going to be launched on the following day, but thankfully the intruders understood the warning and turned back. The strange zebras were then never seen again."
 colthage_other.98.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nIt has long been claimed that a temple made entirely out of gold can be found somewhere within the jungles of southeastern Zebrica. While it is extremely unlikely for an entire temple to be made out of pure gold, the amount of witness accounts and stories makes it possible that some kind of unusual structure does indeed exist. If this structure is magical in nature, it could explain the unusual weather patterns in the region that create a tropical climate despite it being near the Tropic of Capricorn. An expedition is necessary to verify the validity of the claims.\nExpedition Review:\nTwo routes were proposed for the expedition: An overland route and an overseas route. The latter was chosen despite its greater length, as it was safer and easier. A small fleet with military escort vessels set sail from Colthage and headed eastwards. Following the coast, the ships turned southwards as they sailed past Hindia and Kiria. After several weeks, the fleet landed at the destination and disembarked. Local griffon explorers and zebras were hired to guide the expedition through the jungle. The journey proved to be extremely perilous: Disease ravaged the expedition, and dangerous animals caused additional casualties. Nevertheless, slow and steady progress was made. But when the supposed location of the temple was near, a large warband of natives emerged from the jungle and ambushed the expedition. In the confusion, many fell. By the time order was restored, the natives were already gone. Due to the high number of casualties, the risk of another native attack and lack of potable water, it was decided that the expedition should be aborted. Everyone capable of walking turned back and headed to the ships.\nConclusions:\nThe expedition proved to be unprepared for the challenges of a tropical environment. Fatalities due to disease were especially high, and the terrain was more difficult to navigate than expected. Lack of water was another serious issue. Recommendations for future expeditions into such enviroments will be prepared. As for the temple, it was aggressively defended by local natives, so it would require an entire well-supplied army to get past them. Unfortunately, it is not logistically possible to mount such a large expedition at the present."

Only those who are too curious for their own good sometimes land on the frozen shores and soon regret their life choices. Everyone else keeps their distance, and if they have no choice but to sail close to the coast, they come heavily armed with the largest cannons possible.\n\nBut now, something unusual happened.\n\nAn entire fleet of ships landed on the coast, and hundreds of striped equines disembarked. Some of them wielded weapons, while others carried strange instruments. Without much hesitation, the group started heading further inland into the frozen wastes. All this time, the dragons were watching them from afar, confused yet intrigued.\n\nThe group followed a glacial river, going upstream and headed directly south. Eventually, they entered a valley surrounded by tall cliffs. This was the perfect place for an ambush, so the dragons struck. The prey fired their weapons to no avail, only felling smaller whelps. Against elder dragons, they had no chance. Soon the entire group was dispersed and scattered, forced to flee back to their ships. All this time the dragons preyed on them and hunted down those who were not fast enough.\n\nIn the end, only one ship managed to depart. The rest were left on the shore, their crewmembers and passengers slain. The dragons celebrated their victory and scavenged whatever they could. The might of the dragons had been proven once again. Perhaps the other races would from now on avoid the island forever."
 colthage_other.99.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nWhile the north pole has already been reached by a scientific expedition, the same cannot be said of the south pole. Due to a large scale dragon infestation, such a feat has not yet been accomplished. Modern technology however presents an opportunity to attempt it. New weapons can pierce the scales of dragons, while improved insulation helps with survival in extremely cold temperatures. With proper preparations, it should be possible to reach the south pole despite the odds.\nExpedition Review:\nA fleet with a strong military escort was prepared. Due to the danger of the mission, most personnel in the expedition were soldiers, with only a few scientists. The fleet departed from Hippone, sailing westwards. Once it passed Abyssinia it turned southwest, following the Arabian coast, before finally turning directly south. While approaching the island of the ice dragons, several nearby ships tried to warn the expedition, telling them to turn back. These warnings were ignored. Once the island was reached, landings proceeded without problems. There were no reports of any dragon activity, so the expedition headed south as soon as it was ready to do so. A glacial river was followed as it provided the shortest and easiest route to the polar glaciers. Eventually the group reached a valley surrounded by cliffs. The soldiers were on high alert as dragons were sighted, but there was no time to prepare before the beasts launched an all out attack from all sides. Hundreds of dragons, large and small, assailed the expedition. The assumption that the guns could pierce dragon scales proved to be false, and only a few small dragons fell in the battle. The expedition was ordered to retreat back to the ships where heavy naval guns could be used, but constant attacks by dragons made this a difficult task. In the end, only 42 zebras reached a ship and managed to depart.\nConclusions:\nCasualties in the expedition ended up being extremely high due to weaponry proving to be ineffective against elder dragons. Another expedition to the south pole should not be attempted until a powerful enough weapon can be mass-produced."

Behind them sat Zerutra's troops, rifles and booze in hoof, enjoying the show. The speaker stood up, leaning on his staff, the elderly zebra shaking slightly as he tapped his staff on the floor. "Honoured Senators, Colthaginians and esteemed listeners over the radio. Given the national emergency," The speaker sighed deeply, his voice breaking up slightly. "A motion lays before us to appoint acting Sufrit Bezelshazzar Zerutra, present here, to the office of Sufrit, until the emergency abates and the government can hold elections. All those in favour, say aye!" Zerutra's soldiers jumped on the benches, shouting their approval, making it seem to the listeners that the Senate was way more enthusiastic about this appointment than it was in reality. Zalathel Zarca, on the front row, also gave his approval, after which the remaining zarcid senators followed.\n\nAfter the shouting died down, the speaker gave the floor to now Sufrit Zerutra, who slightly adjusted his glasses to read his speech. "Honoured members of the Senate, Colthaginians, all my life I have faithfully served Colthage. Under Zamilcar Zarca I guarded the frontier and fought against the Storm King. Under his son, with us today, I sought to rebuild the country. The interim government was unstable, and once again I was called upon to restore order, so like a faithful soldier of Colthage, I did." Zerutra smiled, half a dozen generals came to mind holding speeches like this in ages past, history was being made. "I pledge to you today, to continue serving Colthage in the position granted to me. I will guard our borders, I will restore order to our countryside and return Colthage to her rightful place as the envy of Zebrica!" This time more of the Senators showed their approval. Even though the Senate, and Colthage, were still badly damaged, for a moment it seemed as if Zerutra might make his pledges come true."

Instead, a painting of Sufrit Zanzazall's crossing of the Creeper Mountains in the Second Zonic War graced the wall. The current Sufrit smiled and took a sip of his wine. "Good day to you, general Zarca. What brings you here?"\nZalathel turned around from the painting and approached the desk behind which he had sat for so long. "I came to check in on the progress for holding elections. It seems as if there have not been any preparations at all."\n\nZerutra smiled. "All in due time, Zalathel. For now I have an important mission for you." Zalathel frowned more as Zerutra got a dossier from his drawer and gave it over to Zarca. "Look in here."\nZalathel quickly scanned the pages of the special mission he had been assigned, signed off on by the Sufrit. The general was to be the military attaché to [PNG.GetNameDef]. And learn about their military advancements. Zalathel's eyes narrowed as he slammed the papers down on the desk. "You must think this is incredibly funny, Bezelshazzar." He raised his voice. "But I am the Sufrit of Colthage. You served my father and me. Stand down immediately and give me my office back!"\n\n"I'm afraid not, Zalathel. For too long have I sacrificed!"\n"Sacrificed? I sacrificed a town's worth of tax on your addictions!" Zarca growled and jumped on the desk. "Zaryes, Zakbar? They were always corrupt. Zanno and Zaranzid, yes yes! But Zerutra? Out of every zebra, YOU?"\nZerutra smiled and whistled, after which some of his soldiers came in. Without saying a word more, he watched the ex-Sufrit wrestle with half a dozen soldiers and be dragged off to his one way trip. "You will bother me no longer."

The penguin harbourmaster slightly tilts his head, looking at the strange visitor, who seemed to be wearing a high-ranking uniform of a foreign military. "Who are you and what brings you to [PNG.GetNameDef], zebra?"\n\nThe zebra's stare was full of malcontent, his eyes fiery, which made the penguin take a step back. "I am Zalathel Zarca, Marshal of the Colthaginian Republic." He bit his lip, reaching into his saddlebag to give the harbourmaster a bundle of documents. "I am here on behalf of the Sufrit, on a military mission to learn about your advancements in the art of war, in return I offer my services."\nAs the harbourmaster flipped through the papers one of the other penguins spoke up, his flipper hiding laughter from his beak. "Wait, are you really the old Sufrit?"\nThe question made the zebra explode, grabbing his marshal's baton and hitting the penguin over the head with it. "I am the rightful Sufrit of Colthage! I do not deserve being sent to the far end of this world to suffer under sunless skies!" It took the full port police to detain general Zarca and stop his fuming rage. Luckily for the former Sufrit, the military recognised his talent and released him, allowing the former Sufrit to go on with his mission."

 colthage_other.103.d:0 "Sufrit Zerutra was laying on a soft paper mattress resting upon a bed of tropical wood, staring at the starry heavens and the crystal sun. Somewhere under his flank was a report which had troubled him an hour ago, or was it two? Many citizens had been conscripted into the military earlier, to defend the Republic against corrupt elements, but a significant portion of them had deserted the cause, some even joining the rebel forces. It did not matter, what use did Bezelshazzar have for traitors in any case? He smiled, relaxing. The Sufrit turned his gaze downwards, and the painting on the wall began to move with memories. Spears turned to rifles and mountain tops to red flames. The stares of soldiers turned to wicked grins as screams filled his ears. The scene of the Second Zonic War changed to his own crimes. Ransacking bandit camps in the west during Zamilcar's centralisation, and burning villages unwilling to help the Zarcids during the Storm King's reign.\n\nZerutra started sweating, his body tensing up. "Not again!", he cried out, rolling off the desk, taking cover behind it and drawing his revolver in one motion. The images and the screams did not stop, however. Zalathel and Zamilcar Zarca stood above the flames, staring at the new Sufrit with empty eyes. The Sufrit shouted back, "No, you did this! I was following your orders! I am cleaning up your mess!" With a shaky hoof, he aimed his weapon at the painting, pulling the trigger.\n\nThe ring of the gunshot cleansed Zerutra's ears of the screams, and the world returned to normal, a bullet lodged in ancient general Zanzazall's head. The Sufrit slumped down on the floor, leaning on the desk, panting rapidly. "This is for me and for Colthage. They did this. The Zarca's made me do it. This is just necessary, can't they see?"

The illegitimate Sufrit is trying to greatly increase the size of his army, but raising the needed number of soldiers proved impossible with volunteers, since zebras are naturally reluctant to fight for such a ruthless dictator. As a result, his army has been forced to resort to forced conscription.\n\nIn contrast, our own revolutionary forces have had no problem finding willing volunteers. The vast majority of Colthaginians are avoiding conscription by the Zerutra regime at all costs, and the ones forced into service are clearly reluctant to fight. His conscripts are deserting by the thousands, with many deciding to join our ranks. Clearly, fighting for freedom is a much more appealing prospect than defending tyranny."

To radicals, this narrow political plan falls far short of what they are fighting for. Zidonids and the Conventionist Army have not officially acknowledged it yet, and even some Constitutionalists say that the plan is too short.\n\nZaranzid has responded to these criticisms by claiming that a purely political plan, limited in scope, will provoke less resistance, meaning the brutal civil war will end sooner.

The general took a deep breath as he summarised the information in his head: Determined to win the civil war, Zaranzid had decided on hard measures to crack his troops' morale, giving the order to give no quarter to the enemy. News of this policy quickly spread through the Zerutrid ranks, especially causing havoc on the morale of the conscripts. Getting troops to commit on the frontline was getting more difficult and officers were resulting to the threat of harsh punishment to actually get conscript soldiers to engage the enemy. But at the least, his troops would think twice about surrendering.\n\nAll of it made Zerutra sigh. This was far from the honourable wars of old. A civil war, a modern war, was nothing like an honourable conflict of chivalrous generals and their citizen-soldiers. These were meat grinders. But he had to believe. Colthage was relying on his resolve to bring back the country from the abyss. To never again make the mistakes of the past. All of them were monsters. But not Zerutra. He would set things right, in the end.\n\nThe stallion cringed as the memory of the civilians he had killed shot through him like a jolt of electricity. Instinctively, the general reached for the bottle. Maybe this time he'd forget."

Some were concerned of the risk and urged him not to go, but Zaranzid ignored them, saying he was not afraid of becoming a martyr like Mzelqatid.\n\nOnce he arrived, escorted by numerous bodyguards, he was met by General Zarvad Orzagid, one of the more accomplished constitutionalist military leaders. Together, they toured the frontlines, inspecting trenches and meeting with common soldiers. Orzagid explained their current situation and said the war was going relatively well, but Zaranzid urged them to take more decisive action against the enemies of the revolution. The troops' morale was greatly improved by the brave visit of the First Chief.\n\nAfter the tour, the General met with Zaranzid in private, in an abandoned farmstead that had been repurposed for military use.\n"Mister Zaranzid, with all due respect, I must express concern of your recent decisions."\n"What do you mean?" the First Chief asked in response, appearing bemused.\n"I understand the need to safeguard the revolution, but are executions of prisoners of war truly necessary? It is hurting the morale of the soldiers. I also do not know why a civilian should interfere in military affairs as much as you do. And what happened to the promises of reform in the Plan of Zapsa?"\nZaranzid's brow furrowed deeply. "General, you must understand. When a revolution makes concessions, it commits suicide. You saw what happened to Mzelqatid. We must learn from our mistakes, or Colthage is doomed."\nOrzagid sighed deeply. "Very well, Mister. But promise me this: After the struggle is over and the revolution is secured, we return to our original revolutionary and democratic program."\nZaranzid smiled, though it was hard to tell how genuine it was. "Of course, General. I will always do what is best for our sacred homeland.""

Their executives, along with other affected businessgriffs, are furious at this expropriation and are demanding swift action from our government to address their grievances.\n\nIt would be possible to support the enemies of the Constitutionalists—who might be convinced to return the lost assets—in the ongoing civil war.

It was dominated by a local landlord who owned almost all of the farmland and an entire cohort of slaves. The rest of the inhabitants of the village worked her lands and paid rent. Over the years, the costs of rent had steadily grown while the free zebras of the village continued to languish in poverty. Meanwhile, the landlord and her family prospered in a luxurious mansion, never lifting a hoof thanks to their slaves and servants doing all the work.\n\nThe constitutionalist revolution had brought hope to the downtrodden villagers. Word spread of imminent land reform, of a utopia where the zebras would own the soil they worked on. This scared the landlord family so badly that they left the village when constitutionalist forces passed through the area. A celebration was held, and the future looked bright.\n\nThen the Ten Tragic Days occurred.\n\nNow the landlord had returned with a vengeance, accompanied by Zerutra's armed lackeys. She demanded all unpaid rent to be paid within a week, with interest. The free zebras were suddenly on the verge of debt bondage. Some considered suicide while a few escaped into the hills, never to be seen again.\n\nOnly a day before the deadline for rent payment, a group of strange zebras appeared on the outskirts of the village. They appeared like bandits, and many villagers thought this was the final blow to end their miserable lives. But as the bandits galloped into the village, they left the peasants alone, and headed straight for the mansion. The landlord's guards opened fire, so the bandits spread out and surrounded the building. They shot back and stormed the mansion. After a brief but fierce firefight, the entire landlord family was brought before the villagers in chains, and all the slaves were set free. The bandits also brought out all the valuables and foodstuffs in the manor, taking a small share and giving away the rest.\n\nThe joyous but confused villagers asked the leader of the bandits who he was. He grinned, and said: "I am Bandolier, the Lion of the West.""

However, in this bleak predicament, an unlikely figure has risen, offering salvation for the oppressed zebras of Colthage: Zannido Zidon, better known as Bandolier, a hero of the common folk who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.\n\nOnce a simple bandit, Bandolier was inspired by Mzelqatid and joined his armed rebellion to oust the dictator Zalathel Zarca, becoming a leader in the Constitutionalist army. Bandolier remained loyal to the end—after Mzelqatid was killed, he took the field once again, starting a movement to overthrow the usurper Bezelshazzar Zerutra. His army, the Division of the North, is without a doubt the finest military force in Colthage.\n\nThanks to wise use of the media, word of Bandolier's thrilling exploits has spread both in Colthage and abroad. He recently gave an interview to a prominent Macawian journalist, and even starred as himself in a movie produced by the Equestrian Applewood studios. The resulting publicity has drummed up a great deal of support for the Conventionist cause.\n\nThanks to his blossoming reputation as revolutionary hero and friend of the poor, a flood of international support has begun to pour into his territory: arms from Macawia, as well as mercenaries and doctors from around the world, all wishing to see the Colthaginian Revolution emerge victorious."

The two made for an odd pair, with Bandolier's sloppy clothes contrasting sharply with the First Chief's finely tailored suit.\n\n"Greetings, Mr. Zidon!" Zenut exclaimed, extending a hoof. Bandolier gave a crooked grin in response, shaking his hoof before playfully slapping his shoulder, smearing a spot of mud on his previously immaculate suit. Zenut's face twitched, but he was otherwise unphased. "Ah... thank you for attending these negotiations. In times such as these, it is vital that we find a way to work together in order to defeat our shared foe," Zenut said politely. "Za'al willing, we can come to an agreement for the good of the Revolution." The two zebras took their seats across from one another.\n\n"Yes, I have eagerly awaited meeting the Constitutionalists' greatest leader," Bandolier said. "I have heard he is a fearless leader, beloved by the people. A brilliant strategist, who has proven himself in the fight against tyranny. A zebra who, while I do not agree with him in all things, I nonetheless respect immensely." he stomped a hoof for emphasis while Zenut simply nodded, soaking in the extravagant praise. "But tell me, where is he?" Bandolier asked. Zenut was confused by the question and raised an eyebrow.\n\n"Where is General Orzagid?"\n\nZenut looked taken aback the instant Bandolier's words reached his ears. But when the statement registered, his face turned red. "It seems you did not come here to have a genuine discussion. Instead, you came to hurl petty insults!" Zenut shot up to his hooves.

Zaryes would then take a seat in Zarca's old chair, as his underlings stood at attention.\n\n"Anarchy needs to end, and fast. However, we can't be seen as usurpers and defilers of the republic. I'll have the clerks start writing up several acts, and later on an improved constitution to enforce our rule. In short, keep up the pretences of legitimacy, and once our work is complete, we can retire in peace to some distant beach in Macawia." He pointed his hoof at Zerutra. "Bezelshazzar, you'll be in charge of Trotkat. It requires your special touch when it comes to pacification. Jebzel, same for you, in Zapsa. Zauro, you and your cousin can handle Hippone. Ensure that the privateering is kept to a respectable amount. And Zurelo? Make yourself useful. Now then, are there any questions?"\n\n"And what about you, Batrun?"

He couldn't complain about getting paid for doing nothing, if it weren't for everything else that came alongside that "perk".\n\nThere was fear in the eyes of the good citizens, and barely concealed contempt in the eyes of patrolling soldiers. Curfew was going to begin in an hour, which meant nozebra wanted to be caught breaking it. The consequences were less than pleasant. Zenut was content knowing that he was safe from any prosecution due to his old friendship with Zaryes, but how good was that safety when he couldn't say the same for his friends and colleagues? Last week, a fellow constitutional senator disappeared. When he tried asking about their whereabouts, he only received vague non-answers about "taking a vacation in Macawia". The euphemism wasn't lost on him.\n\nSpeaking of his colleagues, some have left the nation on more favourable terms.

In the end the proposed constitution was approved by over two-thirds of voters; political opponents have objected to these results to no effect, and it is already in the process of being promulgated.\n\nThe new constitution affirms Batrun Zaryes as the Sufrit of Colthage, while assigning many seats in the Senate and the Popular Assembly to military officers. It also requires that all elected senators be approved by the junta before being allowed to take office. Although its stated goal is to transition the country from its current military government to a civil one, it is apparent that nothing in the administration will happen without the military's approval. Responding to zebras concerned about these anti-democratic elements, Zaryes claims that a level of armed institutional oversight is necessary in order to preserve peace and prevent domestic upheaval."

The position of co-sufrit remained noticeably empty, even though it was functionally useless at this stage, like a bent nail, but there was a certain prestige to the holder. Which meant, throwing a bone to Balzanquet was out of the question, but other zebras would appreciate the gesture.\n\nBezelshazzar Zerutra was known to be a stallion of ambition, and perhaps a little unreliable when the push comes to shove. It was clear that he was never content enough with what he had, and the position of co-sufrit would certainly placate his ego for the time being. Not to mention, it could be seen as a proper reward for all the hard work he's done over the years, ensuring the continued rule of Colthage's government.\n\nJebzel Zoblos... was not the most stable individual. How could a mare be so cruel and vindictive? However, showing her favour would send a clear message to any who would still dare to resist. Just as long as she remained far from Zaryes' vicinity, then everything would be fine.\n\nFinally, Zauro Ochzor seemed to be the best pick when it came to not raising a fuss. Old, respected, quite brilliant and a designer of many weapons the Colthaginian army uses, his appointment would surely be seen as the junta aiming for a moderate, tender approach. However, Ochzor has little interest in chasing after medals and titles, and is more than content enough in his current position. Making him co-sufrit would be a move without any real benefit."

At long last, Zerutra climbed to the top and achieved what he dreamed of for so long: sufrit of Colthage. Sufrit Zerutra sounded quite pleasing to his ears, if he may thump his chest for a moment! Alas, with all the instability that shook Colthage these years, he had to work twice as much to keep things steady, when he would rather nurse his favourite brand of Skyfall whiskey. To that measure, a co-sufrit needed to be appointed to handle some of his workload, and there were two suitable choices for the task.\n\nJebzel Zoblos was perhaps one of the most vicious mares he had ever met, but she shared his penchant for putting down uprising and rebellions. Surely, it was a perfect ruling match, as long as she released her violent tendencies somewhere far away from Zerutra? That was certainly worthy of consideration.\n\nOtherwise, Zauro Ochzor was Zerutra's more preferred choice. Old, respected, quite brilliant, their previous professional relationship had nothing to complain about. Indeed, giving him this position could result in Ochzor having more time to tinker up another effective weapon for the Colthaginian army?

This precarious situation finally came to a head as one of the warlords took the bold step of marching into the capital with their loyal troops and, encountering little resistance from the city's garrison, forcing Zaryes to resign at gunpoint.\n\nShortly afterwards they declared themselves the sole ruling Sufrit, completely abolishing the position of Co-Sufrit. While most ordinary zebras have reacted with ambivalence to this development, the other warlords are not pleased at all. Suspicious and fearing that their own power and interests might be threatened in the future, there are rumblings that further conflict is lurking on the horizon.

I know you'll do right by them."\n\nZeirutid could see the sincerity in his friend's eyes, and appreciated the amount of trust it must have taken to make such a decision. "I am humbled," he said, bowing his head. "Very well, I will agree to take charge of Colthage."\n\n"Good luck." Bandolier smiled and winked. "This is a Revolution for everyzebra, but it hasn't reached everywhere yet. I'm off to hunt down the Zerutra-worshipping landowners still hiding across the country." And so, with one final farewell, he turned and galloped off into the sunset."

Although the building bore scars from previous rounds of fighting, the war was finally over. Bandolier had achieved the impossible, going from an obscure rebel outlaw to supreme revolutionary leader. He was victorious: the last zebra standing in the long and brutal fight for national dominance. But to Jezabzella, in that moment he seemed defeated.\n\n"It's time I retired from politics," Bandolier said with a wistful look. "I'm a simple stallion who would rather roam the hills than be cooped up in an office for the rest of my days. To be honest, I prefer a military camp to all this luxury and comfort." The tired zebra gave a weak laugh, but Jezabzella was too surprised by what she had heard to laugh along.\n\n"My, are you sure about that, Mr. Zidon?" Jezabzella was incredulous. "Things aren't exactly... stable at the moment," she said, putting it politely. "I mean, accomplishing such incredible things only to walk away after your moment of triumph? It's an odd decision."\n\n"I'm at the end of my rope," Bandolier sighed. "I'm just not cut out for administration. Za'al, I can barely read!" His exhausted eyes turned downward. "I can't lead this country into the future. I don't have a plan, but I know the Harmonites do—that's why you'll do a better job running Colthage than I ever could." he practically begged Jezabzella. "You're not like the others: you're a zebra with integrity. The people deserve you. I'm sure you'll do right by them."\n\nJezabzella could see the desperation in Bandolier's eyes, and appreciated the amount of faith in her it must have taken to make such a request. "I am honoured," she said, bowing her head. "Very well, I shall agree to take charge of Colthage. You can rest easy, Mr. Zidon!"\n\n"Thank you." Bandolier smiled, but there was a glimmer of sadness in his eyes. "If you want to know where to find me, I'll be off hunting down the Zerutra-worshipping landowners still hiding across the country."

The uncharismatic yet shrewd politician is not eligible to run for Sufrit in the upcoming elections, so most citizens are pleased and the level of popular support enjoyed by the government is high.\n\nThe power of the Militarists and Scientifids has been greatly reduced, as most supporters of the old order are either dead or in exile. Zenut has promised swift reforms to lay the groundwork for a peaceful and stable Constitutionalist regime. However, more radically inclined elements continue to agitate for much broader social reform.\n\nAdditionally, tensions appear to be building within the Constitutionalist coalition itself. Several prominent zebras, including General Zarvad Orzagid, have publicly expressed concerns about how Zenut has chosen to call the government "Pre-constitutional," meaning extralegal, fearing that it opens the door to abuses of power by the government. Only time will tell if such concerns are founded."

Believing that the threat of force is the only leverage they have to secure their demands, some worker militias are outright refusing to disarm.\n\nNow that their counter-revolutionary enemies have been defeated on the battlefield, all of their ire is focused squarely against the Colthaginian government. Labour unrest is flaring up in cities across the nation. Countless protests, strikes and riots are breaking out, all featuring urban workers demanding the pro-labour reforms Zenut had promised."

His network had helped Zidon escape into hiding, but they had caught Zesh the day before his flight. "Well, Zarishat, I think you should be going. You get a head start on them. I'll hold them off as long as I can."\n\nZarishat perked up, "Alright! I agree! Cya Zesh!" and began to gallop off, away from the ranch. Only looking back for a second, she'd at least remember him. The trucks were nearby now, they'd form a perimeter soon, and Zesh would be surrounded. Zesh quickly fiddled around with a thin string as he traced it to a hole in his wall. He wouldn't let the dictator take him easily. Zesh checked his watch, then striking a match, the twine began to burn.\n\n"Zeshmunazash Zeirutid! Come out with your hooves up!" Ah, so they were trying the old 'trick him into coming out without a fight' act. Zeshmunazash scoffed. He wouldn't fall for that. "You really don't have to use my full name! I don't like formality!" Zesh yelled. He flew around his living room, rummaging through piles, grabbing odds and ends, hoping his stalling would confuse the assassins enough. "You are wanted for crimes against the Colthaginian republic. Surrender now!" "Could you list them off for me? I think that's one of my rights." Zesh could tell he was losing time.

Zenut has declared that the current Constitution of Colthage will be respected, though purged of some of its shortcomings. He and his supporters are pushing for slight tweaks only, wishing to make the Sufrit more powerful, as well as solidify his recent changes such as abolishing the title of Co-Sufrit and reforming the judiciary.\n\nHowever, there is turning out to be a surprisingly large number of reformist, radical and Harmonite delegates present at the convention. These delegates insist that land reform be embodied in the new constitution, and are also pushing for more radical changes including pro-labour and secularist articles. Zenut and other Constitutionalists accuse these delegates of going too far, believing that they are trying to tarnish the Constitution and "trying to fix something that isn't broken."\n\nAs the convention gets underway, it is unclear which faction has the numbers and the unity to more effectively impose their vision on the final document."

 colthage_other.135.d:0 "With all lingering constitutional matters settled by the Constitutional Convention of Colturubis, the most pressing question still facing the people of Colthage is who will be chosen as the next Sufrit. In the upcoming elections, there are three major candidates vying for the position.\n\nThe first candidate is Jezabzella Zeshmid, leader of the Harmonites. Hailing from a wealthy patrician family, she is an admirer of the harmonic society of Equestria, as well as a fierce advocate for the rights and dignity of the common zebra. Her reputation as a defender of the downtrodden and her promises of land reform has made her far and away the most popular choice of the lower classes.\n\nThe second candidate is Zarvad Orzagid, a veteran Constitutionalist general from Amanesya. Coming from humble origins, he rose through the ranks due to hard work and determination, eventually becoming renowned for his military skills. Already well-known as a genius of war with impeccable revolutionary credentials, most zebras see him as the natural successor to Zenut Zaranzid.\n\nThis fact makes it all the more strange that the candidate Zenut has actually chosen to endorse is not the veteran general but an obscure diplomat named Hiram Zerranid. Few zebras have even heard of Hiram: he is a diplomat from Hippone with no popular support, and is only a serious candidate because Zenut is supporting him. Despite this, he is viewed with suspicion by most dedicated Constitutionalists, who see the unknown civilian as an unacceptable choice for Sufrit."

He scowled. It was a constant reminder that the mistakes of the past must not be repeated. Those mistakes loomed large as his mind turned to who the people of Colthage might choose to be their next Sufrit.\n\nWould it be General Orzagid, the dashing hero galloping in to save the day? He shook his head. Another military zebra could not be allowed to take the reins of Colthage. Zenut knew full well where that path would lead: dictatorship. The recent example of Bezelshazzar Zerutra's tyranny was impossible to ignore.\n\nWould it be Jezabzella, the idealistic fool? He scoffed. The Harmonites were far too radical. They would let unwashed peasants and uneducated labourers run roughshod, upending society and tearing the country apart! Choosing either one of them would mean the death of the Revolution.\n\nColthage needed a leader who would listen to reason: Hiram Zerranid. Unfortunately it was obvious the citizens would never choose him on their own. Zenut clenched his teeth. The path had to be cleared, and so his hoof was forced. At that very moment, his agents were cracking down on supporters of Orzagid and Jezabzella, silencing, arresting, and even murdering them.\n\n"This is the only option," he muttered to no one. Was it to reassure himself? No, he was simply stating a fact."

 colthage_other.137.d:0 "Zenut Zaranzid's decision to order supporters of rivals to his preferred candidate for Sufrit, Hiram Zerranid, suppressed and killed ultimately provoked fierce backlash. Most zebras already considered Hiram an easily-manipulated puppet, and saw the crackdown as an attempt by Zenut to concentrate power in his own hooves and rule Colthage from the shadows.\n\nSuch an aggressive move also served as a breaking point for General Orzagid—whose relationship with Zenut had been deteriorating for months. With support from almost all other Constitutionalist generals he publicly denounced the government, condemning the "evils of the Zaranzid regime," and began marching on the capital with the stated goal of ensuring order and peace during the elections.\n\nFearing for his life, Zenut fled the city along with thousands of his supporters and with gold from the Colthaginian treasury, aiming to set up his government in Zapsa. If successful, this likely would have signalled the start of a third civil war. However, his forces were ambushed on the road there and Zenut himself was shot dead.

It has been a long road to get to this point, but the cries of the masses demanding justice and equality could not be ignored, and when it came time for their voices to be heard, they ensured that those who would see through to the harmonic ideals every zebra holds within their heart would be the ones empowered. As your highest representative in the land, I promise you to do everything in my power to ensure that you will receive the treatment that you deserve. Whether it be land reform, fair wages, welfare, or healthcare, I will ensure to bring you these things so long as the means to do them exist within our democratic institutions.

Whatever their opinions on politics may have been, it is undeniable that they took their call to arms to heart and did so under the assumption that they would be fighting for a Colthage that would be better for not only themselves but their friends and family. We must all learn to empathize with these individuals to overcome this collective trauma, emerging from it more united and compassionate than we were before, knowing and wishing for a tragedy like that never to occur again."\n\n"I will not lie to you; the road before us remains difficult. The world around us continues to spiral into chaos, and through the chaos, the people will desire stability, and in that desire, they may sacrifice their freedom for security. And though they may gain such security, over time, their lack of freedom will worsen their conditions, and in those conditions, revolution is inevitable, though it might not always result in an improvement. We were lucky to end up where we are now. Despite the turmoil that continues to grip this nation and others around it, we will not succumb to tyranny and remain a beacon of light, harmony, and liberty; for all in Zebrica!"\n\n"Thank you all for giving us this opportunity; now, let's get to work.""

Not even the sufrit stood alone, and one of the most important pieces of this particular little puzzle was the co-sufrit. Thankfully she had her hoof on the pedal for this matter. The question was just who to choose for the role. She could choose Zaron Zorrel, which'd be the safest possible bet, the equivalent of a safe, tasteful dress that'd earn compliments but turn not a single head. Usually she would prefer to cause a bit of a controversy, but this wasn't a society gathering she wanted to spice up. Zorrel would not offend anyone, but rather he was the safe and stable bet that may well be the best way to make sure this particular grand dinner went smoothly.\n\nThen again, she didn't need 'safe' as much as she needed 'driven and capable', and she could think of few more driven zebras than her dear friend Zaphod. It was true that she was inexperienced compared to Zorrel, and while Jezabzella didn't judge Zaphod by her family, the fact that she was Zalathel's sister would be something many would hold against her. Despite all these things though, Jezabzella knew that Zaphod could do great things if given the chance.\n\nIt was a tough choice, and she wondered if the best choice was to not choose, and simply let the matter be put to a vote. She knew that her party would approve of it, but there was just the teeny tiny matter that it went against the constitution. She could probably work around that, if she wanted to, but did she?"

No wonder that he had evaded capture for so long Jezabzella thought as he elaborated on his odd remark. "That the sufrit herself treks all the way here is not much less extraordinary, so one wonders."\n\n"I'll make sure to have them look."

"In the meantime, I can only hear you out, without reservation or judgement. The ball is in your court, sir."\n\n"Whatever happens, the land reforms won't leave the table," Zeshmunazash told her. "All we've wanted is for our neighbours to be able to feed themselves, and what followed rose out of that."\n\n"Would you accept reintegration, as long as they stay?" Jezabzella asked gently. It was so pathetic in a way. All this fighting, just to keep these peasants from being able to earn their living. Zeshmunazash shrugged in response.\n\n"Can't say I'm crazy about it, but autonomy is secondary to the land reforms. It's going to take a heck of a lot to rebuild my countryzebras' faith in the sufrit though, and in my experience we're just far enough away that you don't like spending too much on us."\n\n"Well, as previously established, the sufrit has shown herself quite able to surprise you, and I think that'd work better than flying pigs.""

"Your predecessor's death was a pointless tragedy, and I only hope that we can find a better path forward. It should have happened a long time ago, but though we didn't have yesterday, today is still better than tomorrow."\n\n"This whole conflict did not start over autonomy or independence, we never sought political power. We wanted land reform, that was all. But now... what trust that we have for the sufrit's office is long gone, and blood makes it hard to turn back the clock."\n\n"I have no intent of standing in the way of those reforms in any way shape or form, that much I can promise here and now."

It seems like such a shame to let your talents go to waste though. How could I put these talents to good use for Colthage?"\n\n"Other than yielding the sufrit's position to me? I'm quite willing to take up an advisory position in your cabinet, and make sure that the scientifids are put to good use."\n\n"A good use controlling the nation's scientific institutions?" Jezabzella asked mildly. Of course that was what he angled for. The scientifids were synonymous with science for a reason, but could she pay that price? Some of her fellow harmonites had suggested to ally with the younger scientifids and make science the right of all colthaginians, not just the scientifid old guard.

He had ended up in jail for a reason, and she was growing suspicious of him. Ochzor gave a dismissive wave of his hoof.\n\n"He was the legal authority, that didn't mean we liked him. Politics make for strange bedfellows, and between the two of you, I know who I'd prefer. But yes," he continued after the remark only earned him a frigid look.

She had campaigned so hard for land reform, and yet now here he sat trying to lecture her about it.

We'll open the door for future land reforms, enshrine workers' rights, separate the temple and the state and make sure that another Zarca never can arise again."\n\n"And that is wonderful, truly," Zarvad stressed, "but what you are doing is extremely dangerous. The constitution is the foundation of Colthage, and meddling with it lightly is opening the door for so many further dangers. Half of what you are trying to do would be a shining achievement for any sufrit, I'm just asking you to consider toning it down. You can achieve great things without taking a crowbar to the political foundations of Colthage." He spoke carefully, almost apologetically, yet Jezabzella could only sigh.\n\nThis was why she had left the constitutionalists. Their devotion to true change was so tepid, and at times it seemed like they were content just polishing the surface and ignoring the rot below. Still, they were the closest kin the harmonites had in the halls of power, and that still counted for something she supposed."

The treaty would see [Root.GetName] cede Kar-Alpaka back to Colthage. In return, we will be provided passage through Colthaginian territory and reduced tariffs on Colthaginian trade goods. In addition, they promise guaranteed rights for the region's sizable Alpaca minority.\n\nThis proposal essentially gives everything we would want, but is it really worth giving the land back, and can we trust the Colthaginians to keep their word? Although they desire peace, they also appear to be prepared for war. It is likely that refusing their offer will lead to some form of armed conflict with Colthage.

 colthage_other.151.d:0 ""I heard that lady Zirich got engaged recently." Her mother threw a pointed look across the table towards her father, who quickly caught it and nodded. Jezabzella, meanwhile, already wanted to groan.\n\n"Indeed, her coltfriend finally asked for her hoof, and they are set to marry in three months' time. I understand it was quite the romantic proposal too, is that not right, dear?" Her mother nodded fervently. "And I just recall how you once said you were never going to lose to her..." Zaal help her, Jezabzella wanted to tell them that she was working on having some dashing bandit from Coltva spirit her away for a life of dishonor and wild romance, but knew what would happen. They'd start yelling at each other again, and the fact that the dinner had been awkward thus far instead of outright acrimonious had made it one of their better times in the last few years.\n\n"Mother, father, you both know that I am committed to the sufrit's office. It is the highest honor the Zeshmids have reached in their history, and my work is not just for the family, but for the entirety of the nation, and I ask for your patience with me, your patience and your aid. The patrician class is hoarding their money, and more and more of Colthage's wealth ends up just sitting in bank accounts. If the economy is to improve, that needs to change. They talk about how the patricians are the heart of Colthage, but a heart that does not work will kill its host in the end. I beg you, try to convince other patricians to use that wealth. Investments, partying, charity, it does not matter as long as the money is spent. And if it's spent, the economy will improve, and if it improves, I can do what I have set out to do much faster. And if my work is finished, then I'll have the time to consider marriage." She said the last words reluctantly, but she had to work from their points of view.\n\nHer parents looked at each other, and she could tell what a lemon this was for both of them. Her being the sufrit of Colthage was secondary to her marrying somezebra and giving them grandfoals in their eyes, always had been, and at times she wanted to just scream. Yet, to her surprise, her mother slowly nodded in the end."
 colthage_other.151.a:0 ""We will see what we can do, dear.""
 
 colthage_other.152.t:0 "Meritocracy And Democracy"
 colthage_other.152.d:0 ""It just seems like such an obvious thing to do," Zaphod commented on the proposal that had hit the sufrit's desk; to introduce a new system of checks and balances by demanding that those who wished to hold any political or military office pass a series of examinations. "We want to ensure that the most suited are in charge of Colthage, and demanding that those who wish to take part in the leadership of the nation prove their competence seems objectively the right path."\n\n"The most suited, or the most capable of taking exams?" Jezabzella pursed her lips as she pondered the idea. It had merits, she didn't deny that. At least it'd be a safeguard against those who sailed into office on their parents' money. Then again... "It's also objectively so that all other things equal, those born to a well-off family have a massive advantage in the education system over those who aren't, and demanding that any political candidate or military officer pass these kinds of tests would in effect lock out a large part of the population from the political system. When one side has the money and resources to hire tutors and attend extra classes, and the other doesn't, that just makes the democracy we've worked towards becomes just out of reach for those not blessed with already well-studied families."\n\n"I don't see how that would be the case. Sure it would raise the bar, but the exams are still there for all to attend, and they will be equally judged on their merits, won't they? We could just reinforce civics education and give everycreature a foundation to work off."\n\n"Democracy's built on public participation, and whatever our intent, raising the bar isn't something to be done lightly." Still, Jezabzella couldn't deny the point Zaphod was making. Maybe there was a point to these examinations after all?"

 colthage_other.153.d:0 ""I have to say, it's a real honor to be here. Most sufrits wouldn't give somezebra like me the time of day." Jezabzella couldn't deny that she saw why. If there was any zebra whom the world 'rustic' would apply to, it'd most certainly be the stallion who had been shown into her office and who currently was seated across the table from her. Introduced as Ahirom Zadadid, he carried with him a large stack of papers, which he presented to her. "On behalf of a hundred thousand farmers across eastern Colthage, I wish to humbly request that the plantations are reformed. For all the wealth they provide the nation, we country zebras are all too often left struggling to even eat."\n\n"Are you not paid properly?" Jezabzella took the stack of paper and looked at the signatures. Row upon row of names covered each page, many of them barely even legible. Ahirom grimaced a little at the question before elaborating.\n\n"It's hard to be paid properly when the grain prices go up and down like a yo-yo, ma'am. Colthage's soil could easily feed our people twice over, but everyzebra's determined to grow coffee, sugar, tobacco, spices, cotton, you name it. It's gone to the point where we're not self-sufficient when it comes to subsistence crops, and for the common zebra, this means that a tariff or a change in exchange rates can make food too expensive for a lot of them. Yet, if some of the plantations were converted to farmland, it would cover the needs of the nation and ensure that no matter what happens, we can feed the people."\n\n"It's a bold proposal, mister Zadadid, yet I see the merits in it. Thank you for bringing this to my attention." Jezabzella quietly acknowledged the egg on her face as well. That was indeed an astute assessment, far beyond the simple concerns she had imagined he'd have based on his looks. How very patrician of her... Part of her wanted to ram this proposal through right away, yet at the same time she could just imagine the landowners crying blood over it. Did she have the option?"

No longer mired in chaos, Colthage has evidently recovered enough to begin concerning themselves with regional affairs once again.\n\nThe referendum structure they propose would give Zumidians the choice to remain with [Root.GetNameDef], become an independent country, or join Colthage. They claim that if this referendum is not held, then it will be made clear to them that [Root.GetNameDef] is holding Zumidia hostage against the will of its citizens.

Despite being met with initial skepticism upon their arrival in port, the delegation was able to dock once they made their intentions clear to the Kásan authorities, escorted to the Foreign Office under armed guard. Meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the diplomats were light in their remarks, merely handing the minister a note from the Sufrit and reassuring him that it would explain everything.\n\n"To the people of the Kása Free State, descendants of the slaves of Colthage:\n\nOn behalf of all of the zebras within Colthage, I, Jezabzella Zeshmid, am offering a formal apology to the free people of Kása, who justly and rightfully fought for their freedom against Colthaginian slave drivers. The nation's acceptance, participation, and continued reliance on the exploitation of slaves was a morally indefensible position held by our society for far too long. Though I acknowledge that far from all Colthaginians took part in the practice and that the vast majority of the population never had much of an opinion on the practice until the questioning of it was made a political issue, it still does not exonerate those who actively enslaved millions of zebras over hundreds of years of Colthaginian history. As of this letter's signing, I have already passed a constitutional amendment to criminalize slavery in all of its forms and provide a complete and total pardon of all slaves who committed crimes related to escaping from their masters or were pressed under faulty evidence. This is to be enforced by a new government body known as the Truth and Reconciliation Bureau, which will also assist in helping former slaves get on their hoofs and contribute to society freely like any other free zebra. I hope that this is enough to begin the healing process between our two nations, and I would like to formally request the beginnings of diplomatic relations to further this process. I understand completely if you do not accept this apology, but know that our nation shall be willing to accept your conditions with open arms if you ever reconsider.\n\n-Sincerely, Sufrit Jezabzella Zeshmid"\n\nAlongside the note came a personal gift from the Sufrit to the First Commander, a basket of fruit collected from her private garden in Colthage, along with a new set of traditional Colthaginian clothes for the First Commander. Unfortunately, the gifts became a more mixed bag, with the fruit basket rotting due to faults in the delegation's refrigerator, and the garments - though beautiful - weren't really the kind used in Kása. Still, though, the spirit behind the gifts remained intact, with the clothes and the letter both being sent to the Seguro historical museum, and the request regarding the beginning of diplomatic relations was graciously accepted by the Foreign Minister. We can only hope for a peaceful relationship between our two countries for many years to come."

It stung Jezabzella to realize that her parents' appearance at her estate filled her with suspicion. She couldn't remember the last time that she had had an uncontroversial interaction with them. Her family had been loyal to the Zarcas for generations, and it was a wonder if they had a civil conversation, so the fact that they had appeared in her home unprompted set her on edge. Still, she was never going to give them the satisfaction of being able to complain about how rude she was and instead made sure to serve them coffee.\n\n"Actually we..." her father began, faltering before being nudged in the side by her mother. "We've let you down." Jezabzella blinked, unable to respond to him. Surely she must have misheard him there. Had her proud father just said...? "We focused so much on what we imagined you'd be that we couldn't accept when you became something else. I convinced myself you were insolent and disloyal, when you in truth saw further than any of us. Our family rose to patricianhood by doing what you have done, by challenging the norms and finding new ways to do better, and all we've done is complain that you weren't married... what kind of zebra complains that his daughter is unmarried because she is too busy being the sufrit?" He smiled awkwardly at her, leaving Jezabzella even more flummoxed.\n\n"We also wanted to let you know that we're planning a grand banquet for the entire extended family," her mother continued. "We would like to see you as the guest of honour, and put this entire conflict to bed. You are the crown jewel of our family, and it's time that we stand behind you and make sure that the rest of the family sees it too."\n\nThis wasn't fair! They couldn't just do this! They couldn't just say she was right after all this time! It couldn't be that easy! Jezabzella looked down at her coffee cup and struggled as a million conflicting emotions flew through her. Anger, resentment, suspicion and countless other emotions flew through her, but in the end she grasped the reins of herself as she had done countless times before and smiled widely and a little impishly at them."

If there is to be anyone who is to be celebrated today, it is not me, but those hundreds of thousands who may long be forgotten to history, yet still played a decisive role in shaping it! Despite the odds, they remained loyal, patriotic, and persevering to the very end, whether it be in victory or death. When Zarca began to undermine the republic and its institutions, with our protests only being met with lead batons, they did not give up! When there was hope for a republic after the Storm King's defeat, hope only to be met with the restoration of the Zarcid regime, they did not give up! And even when victory appeared so close to our grasp, they did not become complacent in their efforts; they kept pushing until their goals were made manifest!"\n\n"Without them, none of what you witness today would ever have been possible, and we should all be wary of that. Yet despite the tremendous victory we celebrate, we still are not content with what we have achieved, for threats still undermine our democracy. It comes from a natural fear of uncertainty, the unknown, and the drive-by such fears for comfort and warmth against the cruel and unrelenting world. We all often find ourselves yearning for control over one's life, and it is a yearning that leads many to support autocracy over democracy. After all, wouldn't it be all that more helpful for someone else to hold the entirety of the duties of the state rather than having you carry a fraction, a fraction which in itself would induce significant stress, anxiety, and division within one's own life? Though it sounds like an irresistible offer, it must be known that it is a mistaken idea and that democracies always have and will continue to provide more fair, just, and equal societies for all who dwell within their borders. Letting autocracy back into our government is akin to desecrating the corpses of those who fought valiantly for the freedoms you now enjoy. Once a generation has grown without feeling liberty's warmth, and those who did feel it begin to pass on, it may take many decades for the embers to merely be kindled anew."\n\n"If we are to succeed in allowing this republic to flourish, we must ensure that its ideals and institutions are entrenched into the very nation it's set to govern so that our prosperity will never forget the value of their freedoms. And when it is their turn to rule, they will pass such knowledge on to their children, and so on for as long as there is a sun in the sky! May it be so that the light of liberty shall never be dampened or extinguished through war or peace, stability or turmoil, or victory or defeat! May it be that the light of liberty shall burn far brighter and far longer than we would ever expect! And may it so that the citizens of this land will have a republic, so long as there is a Colthage to call their own!""

At this, Zakbar's ears perked up. "But first, there are some lingering concerns about the past that must be addressed," Orzagid said, narrowing his eyes. "Specifically, the many essays you have authored justifying Zarcid dictatorship."\n\n"If you are suggesting that I am responsible for keeping those tyrants in power, I can only say that that is completely untrue." Zakbar pleaded. There was passion in his voice that Orzagid was surprised to hear. "It was not ideas, but bayonets that formed the foundation of the Zarcid state. The fact is we did not control him, he controlled all of us. I was forced to sing his praises, or else end up in a prison cell!" His words dripped with resentment towards the Zarcids.\n\nDespite Zakbar's apparent sincerity, Orzagid naturally distrusted Scientifids, and was not convinced yet. "I see... That being said, I remain concerned about the scope of your ambitions. There have been many whispers these past few years of coup plots and assassinations emerging from the Scientific Clique." Orzagid raised an eyebrow. "I would very much like these fears assuaged. So please, enlighten me about your ultimate goals."\n\n"You think we desire an iron hoof to rule Colthage?

That is why I have no qualms about pledging myself to you." He bowed humbly.

Surrounded by thick jungle, he took a second to collect his thoughts, and his belongings: A simple army rifle, a pistol, a few grenades, a machete, and 67 rounds of ammunition in a bandolier.\n\nZannido Zidon didn't know how long he had been hiding. No, not hiding. Fighting. He hadn't given up the fight. Time and time again, he'd led daring attacks to allow chunks of his followers to escape back to their day-to-day lives while he kept on fighting. Three days ago, or well, he thought it was about three days, he had convinced his most trusted followers to abandon him while he let them escape. Since then, it was just him left.\n\nNow here he was, back where it all began. Out in the rural west, being pursued by government troops. Zannido chuckled to himself. If there was anything he knew about this, it was proof that these constitutionalists weren't so different from the Zarcids.\n\nRustling in the undergrowth made the hair on his neck stand up. He hadn't heard hoofbeats approach. Slowly collecting his weapons, he tracked the hoofsteps, thirty feet, twenty, ten, five.\n"Alright, let's dance," he muttered.\nWhirling around, Zannido lashed out with his machete, and the flow of red confirmed his hit. As the soldier howled out in pain, Zidon brought up his pistol and confirmed the kill. Jumping forwards, following the falling corpse, he heard shots fire off nearby. Racing towards what he thought was the closest, he found the soldier crouching behind a tree, two shots in the back of the head silenced his weapon just the same.\n\nZidon had to be fast. Standing still for any moment may mean death. He heard the next closest rifle and began to dash, another slash with his machete, one more soldier fell, the next, a grenade into a bush, the next-\n\nZannido burst through the treeline into a large clearing. Looking up, he saw a firing line of Constitutionalist troops and knew he had been beaten. The officer held a pistol in the air, the perfect lure.\n\n"Horseapples.""

At this crucial juncture, the structure of our institutions is still being defined. In fact, there is an ongoing dispute in the Senate itself about what the role of the Popular Assembly should be.\n\nOver the last few years the Popular Assembly has been largely sidelined, and as a result it currently wields little political power. Believing that it would improve the efficiency of the government, some senators, mostly belonging to the NAF party, have proposed that it be abolished entirely, or relegated to an advisory role at the very least.\n\nHowever, they are opposed by others, especially senators of PHM, who claim the Popular Assembly should instead be empowered. They argue that the lower house is crucial for representing important sectors of society, whose interests might not be adequately considered by the zebras of the Senate alone.\n\nAt the moment the two sides are deadlocked, with neither able to command a clear majority.

Not long after signing the amendment, he was shot dead while visiting a cafe by a zebra who professed to be a member of the Cult of the Dark One.\n\nThe government's investigation into the killing found a trail leading to the leader of the shadowy organisation, Ziempsal Zannid, but she has thus far evaded capture. It is suspected the assassin shot Orzagid because of his anti-religious reforms, but some have speculated that he may have been hired by an unknown third party.\n\nWhatever the case, the CRP chose to nominate Azruzaal Azarago—a widely respected general—as Orzagid's successor. Promising to restore true democracy to Colthage, Azarago wasted no time nullifying the term limit extension.

Once inside, Zago hurried down the aisle, where he found his brother Zasdrubal standing in front of the door. Even without his uniform, the general looked more formidable than any bouncer. He glared at his brother. "You are late."\n"No dress uniform for the occasion, Zas?"

Despite their slumber, the baby still managed to instil joy in the two Zarca's and Zago quickly put down his basket on the small table next to the bed. "Some fruits for the new parents, and homemade falafel for all!" He declared, before looking at Imilze. "How did it go, my dear?"\nBefore the tired mare could answer, Zalathel, eyes scorching with pride, responded.

Staring down at his watch, he tried to guess how much time was left. Eying his father's old pistol across the room, he scrambled over to it as bullets flew above his head. Taking the pistol, Zesh leaned against the stone wall, counting the shots fired, and trying his best to guess when the soldiers needed to reload. Peaking into a window, he fired three shots, seeing the soldiers closing in, one wail of pain as a shot connected. Glancing at his watch again, he prayed that the fuse was just running long, and not that it had been snubbed. Peeking out the window, he could see soldiers rushing towards his front door.\n\nBoom.\n\nZesh heard the first explosion, and lept out of the window. Seconds later, the entire farmhouse detonated behind him, spraying him with flaming wood splinters.\n\nFace to face with the rest of the assassins, he could hear those in the house yelling as the building was consumed with fire. Taking three more shots with his pistol, all three were aimed well. Grabbing a clip from his bandolier, he ducked behind a barrel in his yard and reloaded. He didn't know how long he could keep this up.\n\nBut before he needed to ask himself that question, he felt a dull pain strike the back of his head. A rifle butt. Dropping his pistol, and falling to the ground, the Lion of Coltva was dragged by his shirt into his front yard. He couldn't understand what the soldiers were saying. He nearly blacked out.

The rest of the Zarcids, including Zago and their aging mother Zaydara, sat on the Grand Stand facing Zalathel. The triumph continued as soldiers from newly incorporated parts of the Republic marched by as well, carrying their own standards, until the square was filled with a truly massive number of zebras, with civilians watching from the stands and even from atop the Citadel Wall.\n\nFinally Zalathel, his voice carried over all Zonicia, spoke. "Citizens, Zonicians, I am proud to speak to you today as your Sufrit. For years we have suffered foreign oppression, division and uncertainty. Our people were adrift at sea, castaways of the storm!" Zalathel paused for a moment. "But as long as water flows in the harbour of Colthage, a Zonician is never truly lost.

 ### CHARACTER SHIT ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "As the son of Zamilcar Zarca, former head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Sufrit of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high society during a period of peace and prosperity. Since his birth, he was seen as the successor of his father, and thus received far more attention than his siblings. He was educated in history, military science and politics, becoming fascinated with ancient Colthage in the process. His love for his homeland grew as rapidly as the size of his ego did. By the time he became an adult, he saw himself as the embodiment of Zonician civilization, and was ready to succeed his aging father who was preparing to retire. However, everything changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces overwhelmed the defenders. Zamilcar perished in the chaos and Zalathel was forced to abandon the city of Colthage with his sister and two brothers. The zebras fled high into the Alaudid Range to lead a guerrilla force to harass the Storm King's army as it continued to rampage in Northern Zebrica. When news of the Storm King's death reached Zalathel, he led his forces to the capital and executed those who had surrendered to the enemy. With the city secure, he was seen as a liberator by many, but did not hesitate to crackdown on any opposition to the Zarcid rule. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nElections were soon held, which were claimed to be rigged, and the Senate approved Zalathel as the successor of his father. Now the new Sufrit, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Scientifids and militarists have taken advantage of the chaos, rebuilding their power. In the west, the anti-Zarcid Constitutionalist movement is plotting against his rightful rule, while in the east, the Coltvans are rising up against their landlords. Only time will tell if he is able to continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for, or if the house of cards collapses around him."
 POLITICS_ZANNO_MZELQATID_DESC:0 "Zanno Mzelqatid is a son of a landowning well-off family in Western Colthage. He attended university in Italy thanks to a government exchange program and there he became part of the ever growing urban middle class that read republican Griffonian literature and spoke out against the Zarcid regimen as an affront to Colthage's own republican traditions.\n\nIn 1006, when the chaos of the Storm King's invasion was dying down, Zanno travelled around the nation gathering support from the citizenry to campaign for an end of Zarcid tyranny and promised them true political and economic reform. All that had to be done was for them to make their voices heard to the Senate. Unfortunately this led to Zanno being arrested a week before the senate voted Zalathel Zarca in as Sufrit. Zanno was eventually released from prison on bail, but managed to make his way across the border into the Hippogriff-run Zumidian Mandate where he declared the election as illegitimate and began gathering supporters.\n\nPersonally, he is often seen as aloof and often not in touch with reality. In Italy he ended up becoming an advocate of Spiritism and believes he is a medium who can talk to the dead and magical spirits. He claims the spirit of his dead brother visited him and asked him to dedicate his life to helping others, and to never drink alcohol or smoke. He is also a strong believer in homeopathy, a system of alternative medicine denounced by practitioners of both healing magic and medical science. Regardless, he is well liked by people he meets and is held in high regard by the employees of his plantations. He introduced sweeping education, medical, and social reforms for the plantation and the nearby towns, building schools and hospitals (staffed by actual doctors thankfully). He is against slavery and the semi-official class system in the nation and wishes to see a true liberal democratic Colthage."
 CTH_baltazar_zakbar_desc:0 "While the Scientific Clique has no formal leadership, Baltazar Zakbar is widely acknowledged as the political figurehead of the faction. He supported the Zarcids from the very beginning, primarily because of Zamilcar's efforts to modernize the country which aligned with the goals of the Scientifids.\n\nHaving studied law and economics extensively and even worked as a teacher at the University of Colthage, Baltazar is an economic mastermind who was credited with laying the foundations for Colthage's economic miracle in the 900s. It was he who balanced the budget, established a gold standard for the zhekel and signed lucrative commercial treaties with Italy and Sicameon. Without his genius, Colthage would've remained as backwards as many other zebra countries. However, his reforms came at the expense of the common folk, who lost much of their land and wealth to mighty magnates.\n\nBaltazar's influence was so great that Zamilcar grew worried. Shortly before the Storm King's invasion, he sent the economist far away to Griffonia to negotiate a loan, wanting to get him out of the picture. This move likely saved Baltazar's life, as he was on another continent when flames of chaos engulfed Colthage.\n\nAfter returning to his home, Baltazar was quick to assert dominance once again. His relations with the Zarcids had soured, especially because he saw Zalathel as nothing more than a selfish, hot-headed youth. The only thing that kept him from trying to take over the country was General Batrun Zaryes, who deeply distrusted Colthaginian intellectuals. It was clear to him that more preparations needed to be made before the Scientifids could assert dominance and guarantee order and progress in Colthage."
 CTH_batrun_zaryes_desc:0 "If there was one zebra who could've challenged Zamilcar Zarca head-on, it was Batrun Zaryes. He was a military stallion who rose through the ranks during Zamilcar's reign, thanks to the Sufrit's patronage. Eventually Zamilcar gave him a position in the government, and Batrun quickly proved to be a capable administrator as well.\n\nHe used the opportunity to build up his power base, forging alliances with other generals, earning the popularity of the commoners and building his personal army. His power grew quickly, much to the dismay of the Scientifids. They were concerned and advised Zamilcar to turn on Batrun. The old Sufrit saw the general's growing influence as a threat to his regime and agreed to do so: He disbanded Batrun's private army and arrested many of his supporters.\n\nSome years later, Zamilcar perished during the Storm King's invasion. Batrun re-established his army to fight off the invaders and reluctantly worked together with Zamilcar's eldest son, Zalathel Zarca. Thus he was able to take advantage of the chaos and rebuild his diminished power base. After the restoration of peace and order, Batrun stood as the second most powerful zebra in Colthage.\n\nBatrun is a counterweight to the Scientifids, and is very popular both among soldiers and citizens. Over the years, he earned the personal loyalty of many generals and admirals and in practice is the true head of the military. He opposed the state-directed economic policies of Zamilcar and is a proponent of free economy and business interests. It is clear that he has aspirations to "save" Colthage, so anyone who opposes him must tread carefully. They must remember that in the end, true political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 CTH_zebra_rarity_desc:0 "Jezabzella's patrician parents had a very clear future planned for her when she was a filly. As a scion of the immensely wealthy Zeshmid dynasty, her destiny was to continue the family's legacy by embracing the life of a merchant and marrying some zebra from another equally wealthy (preferably even wealthier) patrician family.\n\nHowever, she has bucked traditions since the beginning, and defied her parents' will. She studied foreign literature and took up political writing, had a knack for causing embarrassment for those who courted her which earned her the nickname "Lady Oleander", and most annoying of all, she joined the constitutionalists (which was a horrid disgrace to her father, who was loyal to the Zarcas).\n\nHaving studied political science from across the world, she's keenly up to date with global political discourse. She also has a fascination with the harmonic society of Equestria and is an admirer of Princess Twilight and her friends. This eventually led her to establish the harmonite faction within the constitutionalists, which quickly grew in popularity by appealing to the downtrodden masses.\n\nNo matter the occasion, she usually dresses up as if she's going to the ball. In part this is because she adores high fashion and dressing up, but she also loves it when others underestimate her. Many zebras are surprised to learn that she is experienced in fencing or that she is often ruthless to her political opponents. If they are against the common zebra getting rights and dignity, it is clear that they are not good individuals, so she doesn't feel bad about crushing them like ants."
 CTH_zenut_zaranzid_desc:0 "Zenut Zaranzid has much in common with the late Zanno Mzelqatid. He, too, comes from a landowner dynasty from western Colthage, and was influenced by liberal ideas during his studies. He also grew disillusioned with Zamilcar's authoritarianism, although he did not openly oppose the Zarcids. But this is where the similarities end.\n\nDuring Zamilcar's reign, there was a small uprising in the west. Zamilcar dispatched Batrun Zaryes to put it down. It was during this expedition that Zenut met him. Zenut negotiated on behalf of the rebels and managed to convince Batrun that their revolt was justified. Together, the two convinced Zamilcar to accept the demands of the rebels. Thus began an unusual friendship between a soldier and a politician.\n\nZenut used his ties with Batrun to his advantage, becoming a Senator in the Colthaginian Senate. He, too, opposed the Scientifids despite supporting some of their policies. However, when Zamilcar turned against Batrun, Zenut had no choice but to find another ally. This ally was Zanno Mzelqatid, the head of the Constitutionalist movement.\n\nAfter Zamilcar's death, Zenut joined the anti-Zarcid movement, which was the right choice as the rebellion succeeded and Zalathel was overthrown. But Zanno did not listen to his advice about cracking down on Zarcid supporters. This proved to be a fatal mistake when the Ten Tragic Days occurred.\n\nZenut was not surprised by the coup, and initially even supported Zaryes. But his old friend died in the chaos, and when Bezelshazzar Zerutra rose to power, he knew something had to be done to oppose him. He declared himself in rebellion of the coup and filled the void left by Zanno. However, he would prove to be a very different leader than him, in both good and bad ways..."
 CTH_bezelshazzar_zerutra_desc:0 "Born in an impoverished rural village in Trotkat, Bezelshazzar Zerutra saw a military career as the only way to escape the poverty of his home. He did his best to learn how to read, immersing himself in books about great historical figures, which allowed him to become the personal secretary of a general. With his hoof in the door, Bezelshazzar could begin to climb the ladder of military hierarchy. He entered a cadet school, earned a commission and was soon promoted to captain. Under Zamilcar Zarca's rule, he led numerous "pacification campaigns" into rebellious regions such as Coltva and distinguished himself as a capable leader. He earned a reputation of always paying his soldiers, sometimes employing ruthless methods to acquire the funds needed.\n\nNumerous brutal operations to crush rebellions took a toll on the zebra, and he soon developed a dependency on alcohol. At the same time however, he was promoted to the rank of general, joining the upper echelons of Colthage's military. But this was not enough for him. The stories he had read as a colt, about larger-than-life heroes, instilled in him a desire to make his mark on history. He now dreamed of becoming Sufrit, hoping to succeed Zamilcar once he died.\n\nSoon the Zarca did die, but nothing went as expected. Colthage erupted into chaos, and the weakened central government was barely restored by Zamilcar's offspring. There was little Bezelshazzar could do besides help with crushing rebellions as always. After the dust settled, it was clear he wasn't the only one vying for power. But the competition and chaos only made him more determined. One day, he would become Sufrit, and he would make things right."
 CTH_zannido_zidon_desc:0 "To some, he is Zannido Zidon, a ruthless bandit who takes what he wants. To many others however, he is Bandolier, hero of the common folk who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.\n\nLittle is known about Zannido's early life. He grew up on a large farm estate near Zur as the son of a sharecropper and learned to read at a local temple. He was nothing more than an average peasant, until the fateful day when the rich owner of his home estate harassed his sister. Zidon killed the zebra, saving his sister but becoming an outlaw in the process. Left with no choice but to flee, he escaped to the hills where he joined a notorious group of bandits to survive. Eventually he was arrested by Zamilcar's Rural Guard, avoiding a death sentence thanks to previously selling stolen goods to a general and instead being conscripted into the army. Not long after, he killed his commanding officer and deserted, returning to banditry. It was around this time when he earned the infamous nickname "Bandolier".\n\nNow it appeared that the average peasant had become an average bandit, stealing from others to survive. But his life changed again when he met a supporter of Mzelqatid, who convinced him that he could utilize banditry to fight back against the cruel landowners and help the common zebras of Colthage. He pledged his loyalty to the revolution, proving to be an excellent and cunning strategist, rising quickly through the ranks of the Constitutionalist army and rallying followers to his cause. The revolutionaries who have a patrician background see Zidon as little more than a criminal who cannot be trusted, but he has become legendary among the commoners, who see him as their hero."
 CTH_BATNOAM_ZARZA_DESC:0 "Born to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Benoam Gerza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Benoam would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Benoam made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and Coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nAfter tenuous peace settled in Colthage and Zalathel became Sufrit, he was promoted to a general thanks to Zoblos' recommendation, despite his complete lack of competence. However, his loyalty to the Zarcids is questionable at best. He is a zebra of opportunity with a desire to always be on the winning side. Should the tide turn against the Zarcas, he will be among the first to take advantage of it. Unless, of course, he is offered a deal he cannot resist."
 CTH_zarvad_orzagid_desc:0 "The Orzagid family is well known in Amanesya, with some of its members being landowners, officials and notables. But Zarvad Orzagid never shared the fortune of his relatives. Being the eighteenth orphaned foal of his late father, all odds in life were stacked against him from the start. Yet Zarvad was always filled with determination and ambition, and his family contacts helped him rise from nothing. In his youth, he worked on the family farm, studied in his brother's school, bought a small farm for himself, married and raised a family of his own. Life struck back, and his wife and two of his foals died in the same year, but Zarvad did not give up. He founded a company, got involved in local politics and used lobbying to get the Zarcid government to build a railway to Amanesya.\n\nMisfortune struck again as the Storm King rampaged through Colthage with his marauding army. Zarvad's properties were pillaged and he was left impoverished again. But he did not give up. He joined the newly reformed army after the storm subsided and quickly proved to be an exceptional and naturally talented military leader, rising through the ranks. Soon he hit a brick wall of corruption, as older generals looked down upon him and saw him as an upstart peasant who disobeyed orders from his superiors. Frustrated with this, it was no surprise that he became a supporter of the Constitutionalists.\n\nZarvad Orzagid is above all a zebra who favours the middle ground. When there are disputes between conservatives and radicals, he tries to act as the mediator, solving disputes through words rather than violence. He distrusts those rich zebras who did not earn their wealth through hard work, but does not want to overthrow social hierarchy. His mind is sharp and he has quickly adapted to modernity, advocating the use of latest technologies. He knows he has the skills to be a great general, and maybe one day, Sufrit."
 CTH_jebzel_zoblos_desc:0 "The mere mention of the name Jebzel Zoblos is enough to make almost any Colthaginian uncomfortable, furious or terrified. She is without a doubt the most infamous and controversial officer in the military of the republic. Word of her infamous deeds has spread far and wide, cementing her reputation as a ruthless commander.\n\nJebzel was born to a family of urban workers in the city of Zapsa. While attending school in her youth, she earned a reputation of a bully, an arsonist and a filly who enjoyed torturing animals. Eventually she was expelled for her behaviour, leaving her without an education to qualify for good jobs. So when she grew up, she made the decision to join the army, where her actions would not only be accepted, but respected. It did not take long for others to recognize the usefulness of her harshness and brutality, and she was soon made into a trainer of recruits, enforcing strict discipline on them and creating a culture of hazing which weeded out the weak.\n\nDuring Zamilcar Zarca's reign, several revolts broke out, and Jebzel was one of the zebras put in charge of suppressing them. This is where she became a terrifying legend, a tale told to foals to scare them. Her soldiers left behind a trail of destruction as she ordered any villages or towns that were potentially sympathetic to the rebels to be burned to the ground. This brutality made the rebels flee elsewhere, so Jebzel claimed she had defeated and killed them all. Zamilcar believed her claim and granted her the rank of general as a reward for her valiant efforts.\n\nWhen the Storm King invaded Colthage, Jebzel ensured soldiers loyal to her avoided direct confrontation with the enemy, thus sparing them from destruction. They joined Zalathel Zarca as he marched into the capital after the Storm King's death to restore order. Those who had tried to take advantage of the chaos faced the worst possible fates imaginable, all thanks to Jebzel Zoblos and her bloodhounds."
 CTH_zauro_ochzor_desc:0 "Zauro Ochzor is one of the senior generals of the Colthaginian army, and is greatly respected by soldiers and civilians alike. Born in Colturubis, he entered the military academy of Colthage and graduated as an artillery officer. His father had been an engineer and Zauro had developed a fascination with firearms from a young age, so it was inevitable that he ended up becoming a designer of military materiel.\n\nAs Zamilcar Zarca was modernizing the Colthaginian army, he needed zebras like Zauro to create a modern arsenal. Zauro answered the call and proved to be an ingenius and diligent designer, taking Griffonian designs and modifying them to perfection. His most famous work is the Garcano-Ochzor Model 989, the standard weapon of Colthaginian infantry. He also wrote several manuals on weapons and was promoted to Director of the Department of Artillery.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Storm King, he started work on the world's first gas-operated semi-automatic rifle, which he calls the C-1007 and which others simply call the Ochzor Rifle. It is a revolutionary design, but he is distracted by his duties as a general of the army during a period of instability. While he is loyal to the Zarcid regime, he also believes that other factions in Colthage would be foolish to not adopt his superior design once it is finished."
 CTH_zasdrubal_zalvarado_desc:0 "Ambition comes in many forms, most of them selfish. But selfless ambition exists, and it is a rare blessing to have.\n\nAzruzaal Azarago was born in the Colthaginian city of Zur to an upper-middle-class family of intellectuals, seemingly destined for a life of going to university, sitting back and discussing philosophy, and doing nearly nothing else. But then, one day, he announced to his parents he wanted to join the military, and they wished him farewell without much fuss. Enrolling in an officer school, Azruzaal quickly noticed flaws with the Colthaginian military. Its reliance on mercenaries, corrupt command structure, and far more all caused fatal problems in the system. But Azruzaal kept his mouth shut. He would have opportunities to fix it all someday.\n\nAzruzaal's first assignment was the management of roads and dikes in the Karamane region. He remained there for years until the arrival of the Storm King. Leading his unit underground, Azruzaal calmly guided the soldiers under his command towards survival and freedom upon the eventual liberation of Colthage, but without much of the publicity of Zalathel Zarca's own resistance effort. Returning to his post as a military engineer, Azruzaal soon was contacted by officers and politicians affiliated with Zanno Mzelqatid and signed on to their program resisting Zarca's rule.\n\nWhat can be learned from Azruzaal's story is that sometimes the simplest people are the most reliable. Azruzaal has performed no great acts of heroism or political bravado in his life. He has simply done his service to the Colthaginian people at every opportunity. And one day, that responsibility will be to wage war, and by Za'al above, he shall do it."

Born to a middle-class family, studying Zonician literature in university and a lover of sailing in his free time, his personal life does not stand out either. His mild manners and willingness to swim with the tides has caused Zorrel to make his way upwards, always a trusted lieutenant to evermore important political figures.

This means they value order and progress above all else.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Research Speed\n2% Production Efficiency Cap"
 CTH_MILITARY_FACTION_TOOLTIP:0 "While much of the Colthaginian army was scattered to the wind by the Storm King, the old generals from Zamilcar's time remain in charge. In the chaos following the invasion, these generals were responsible for re-establishing order in Colthage. They became warlords who rule over their forces like decadent kings. Yet they are also fiercely patriotic, ready to fight against anything that threatens Colthage. Anything.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Organization\n2% Surrender Limit"
 CTH_LANDOWNERS_TOOLTIP:0 "The rich landowning aristocrats of Colthage are a fairly new faction, whose wealth is tied to the powers they were given during Zamilcar's reign. Traditionally landowners have not been influential in Colthage, with the mercantile patricians dominating the nation, but things have changed. Zamilcar rewarded those loyal to him with sizeable grants of land, while Scientifids consolidated rural property into large estates. This created a new, proud class of landlords who dominate their leaseholders and slaves.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n0.1 Political Power Gain\n4% Consumer Goods Factor"
 CTH_CONSTITUTIONALIST_TOOLTIP:0 "Constitutionalists have their roots in the establishment of the Colthaginian Republic almost two hundred years ago, when the ancient democratic constitution was restored and amended. But like other factions, they were formed during the reign of Zamilcar Zarca as an opposition to his dictatorial and oligarchic rule. Its members, many of whom are middle-class urbanites and patricians, seek to restore liberty and democracy to Colthage, but not necessarily bring about social and economic reforms.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n10% Economy and Mobilization Law Cost"
 CTH_HARMONITES_TOOLTIP:0 "Harmonites are the youngest of all factions within Colthage and many still consider them to be a part of the constitutionalists. They are seen by some as radicals, influenced by foreign ideas from countries such as Hippogriffia and Equestria. They advocate for a welfare state where all zebras are equal. While the harmonites share the background of other constitutionalists, they have gained more popularity among the poor and downtrodden.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2.5% Stability Factor\n10% Trade Opinion Factor"
 CTH_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Loyalty§! represents a faction's relationship with the ruling government. Generally, if Loyalty drops below §Y50%§!, the Faction will become §RDisloyal§!. A loyal faction grants bonuses, while a disloyal faction gives maluses. Worst of all, a disloyal faction with high enough §YPower§! can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government. The §GLandowners§! faction is an exception to this rule."
 CTH_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Powerbase§! represents a faction's level of influence in the nation and amount of support in the government. There are five levels of power, with higher levels providing stronger modifiers. While powerful factions can be beneficial, they can also be dangerous: A faction with §RVery High§! power will slowly lose loyalty, and a §RDisloyal§! faction can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government. The §GLandowners§! faction is an exception to this rule."

 cat_folder_desc:0 "Magical technologies and improvements specific to the Abyssinian race."
 cat_race:0 "Abyssinian Race"
 cat_race_desc:0 "Bipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Abyssinian cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and they are seen as lazy two-faced schemers. Like other cats, they are obligate carnivores and tend to avoid sweet food and milk."

 tech_cat_biology1:0 "Natural Night Vision"
 tech_cat_biology1_desc:0 "Felines are more than capable of seeing in the dark thanks to their large pupils and a layer of tissue known as tapetum lucidum. This natural ability should be taken into account in the military with an increased focus on operations conducted during the night."
 tech_cat_biology2:0 "The Righting Reflex"
 tech_cat_biology2_desc:0 "When falling from a high place, cats reflexively twist and turn their body to ensure they land on their paws. While this does not mean cats are capable of surviving falls from any height, it does reduce chance of injury greatly, and makes traversal of terrain easier. Military planners should note this ability in their plans."
 tech_cat_biology3:0 "Expert Climbers"
 tech_cat_biology3_desc:0 "Like all cats, Abyssinians are adept at climbing and fond of heights. Not only that, but they have adapted to the rough terrain of the Abyssinian peninsula and can traverse rocky lands with relative ease. This means military commanders should not see difficult terrain as an obstacle, but rather, as an opportunity."
 tech_cat_biology4:0 "Fierce Fighters"
 tech_cat_biology4_desc:0 "With their sharp claws, fangs and quick reflexes, cats excel at close quarters combat. Infantry commanders should not hesitate to exploit any opportunity to reach the enemy in melee range."
 tech_cat_biology5:0 "Hunting The Prey"
 tech_cat_biology5_desc:0 "While many civilized cats have abandoned hunting in favour of agriculture and keeping livestock, they still retain the primordial instincts of ambush predators. While hunting enemy soldiers is much harder than hunting animals, similar ambush tactics can still prove to be useful against them."
 tech_cat_biology6:0 "Refined Senses"
 tech_cat_biology6_desc:0 "Military leaders should not forget to take advantage of all the sharpened senses of their Abyssinian soldiers besides the obvious ones like night vision. They have well developed senses of smell and hearing and can even detect changes in atmospheric pressure that accompany changing weather. Some scientists have even proposed utilizing ultrasound communications in battle, which enemies would be unable to hear."
 
 tech_cat_highlanders1:0 "Highlanders"
 tech_cat_highlanders1_desc:0 "Much of the Abyssinian population resides in the highlands. Rough terrain combined with periodic conflict between regional nobles means that many cats have experience in mountain combat. These highlanders are excellent recruits for any potential mountaineer brigades."
 tech_cat_highlanders2:0 "There Can Be Only One!"
 tech_cat_highlanders2_desc:0 "The Abyssinian highlands are known for their culture of honor and duelling. Annual tournaments are held where the most experienced warriors participate. The tournament continues until one cat remains standing, hence the highlander motto "There can be only one!". This culture helps to refine their fighting skills further, and encourages individual warriors to do their best."
 tech_cat_highlanders3:0 "Mountain Guns"
 tech_cat_highlanders3_desc:0 "Moving cannons in rough terrain is no easy task, but the highlanders are innovative folk. They have developed specialized artillery pieces that can be taken apart, packed and carried by pack animals, slaves or even cats themselves."
 tech_cat_highlanders4:0 "Anti-Armor Tactics"
 tech_cat_highlanders4_desc:0 "Modern armoured vehicles already have a hard time in rough terrain. Highlanders seek to exploit this weakness and have proposed new tactics to counter mechanized opponents. These tactics rely on ambushes and rear-area attacks to strike vulnerable vehicle columns in the mountains."
 
 tech_cat_culture1:0 "Vertical Architecture"
 tech_cat_culture1_desc:0 "As cats instinctively like high places, Abyssinians tend to construct tall and slender buildings. While more challenging to build than the houses used by other races, it does mean buildings take up less space, allowing for highly concentrated cities and lower prices for land."
 tech_cat_culture2:0 "Desert Adaptability"
 tech_cat_culture2_desc:0 "More than half of Abyssinia is covered in arid, sandy deserts. Yet Abyssinians have learned to not only survive in such a harsh environment, but thrive. They can find water in most unlikely places, maintain their equipment in the harsh heat and can traverse the wastelands with relative ease."
 tech_cat_culture3:0 "Industrial Meat Production"
 tech_cat_culture3_desc:0 "Intensive and mechanized animal farming combined with an organized meat packing industry will allow for greatly increased food production. However, it will also require more extensive irrigation and water use in general, which might put a strain on limited natural resources. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure all cats are well fed."
 tech_cat_culture4:0 "Charming Appearance"
 tech_cat_culture4_desc:0 "Many other races find Abyssinian cats to be "cute adorable fluffballs". It is not clear what this means, but it does result in other races being more willing to deal with Abyssinians diplomatically. Advantage of this should be taken."
 tech_cat_culture5:0 "Grooming And Purring"
 tech_cat_culture5_desc:0 "Even wild cats keep themselves clean by grooming their fur with their tongues. Abyssinian culture unsurprisingly places emphasis on cleanliness and personal hygiene. This improves the health of the population and prevents wound infections. When injured, cats can also purr to reduce pain and promote healing in their bodies."
 tech_cat_culture6:0 "Widespread Coffee Consumption"
 tech_cat_culture6_desc:0 "Coffee is well known for its rejuvenating properties, and is often consumed by drowsy cats. Coffee has become such an integral part of Abyssinian culture that many factory workers drink coffee to avoid becoming tired. This results in increased productivity."

 tech_cat_navy1:0 "Coastal Defence"
 tech_cat_navy1_desc:0 "A lengthy coastline is difficult to defend, as an overseas enemy can land almost anywhere. If the navy fails to defend the coast, then defenders on land must be prepared to fend off naval invasions at any cost."
 tech_cat_navy2:0 "Water Desensitization Training"
 tech_cat_navy2_desc:0 "Many cats tend to instinctively avoid being submerged in water, which means they avoid any large surface bodies of liquid. This innate phobia can be overcome through rigorous desensitization training, which makes them more eager to serve in the navy."
 tech_cat_navy3:0 "Mercantile Traditions"
 tech_cat_navy3_desc:0 "Abyssinia has long relied on overseas trade due to its central location. Abyssinian shipwrights and sailors are therefore accustomed to take care of mercantile shipping."
 tech_cat_navy4:0 "Shipbuilding Heritage"
 tech_cat_navy4_desc:0 "A nation with a long coastline has many harbours and many citizens who have experience with building ships. This knowledge accumulated over centuries will continue to be useful."
 
 #tech_cat_potential1:0 "Size Shifting"
 #tech_cat_potential1_desc:0 "With the power of the witchweed potion, Abyssinians can magically change their size at will, becoming giants within seconds. For enlarged cats, bullets feel like tiny needles."
 #tech_cat_potential2:0 "Weather Control"
 #tech_cat_potential2_desc:0 "The witchweed potion allows Abyssinians to directly influence surrounding weather conditions, forming or dissipating clouds at will and summoning winds or even storms. This power surpasses the weather control abilities of pegasi."
 #tech_cat_potential3:0 "Super Speed"
 #tech_cat_potential3_desc:0 "Thanks to the witchweed potions, Abyssinians can move at a greatly increased velocity for prolonged periods of time without feeling exhausted afterwards. This means infantry can quickly move between locations when needed."
 #tech_cat_potential4:0 "Eyes Of Lightning"
 #tech_cat_potential4_desc:0 "The sheer power unlocked by the witchweed potion can be channeled through the feline eyes of Abyssinians and unleashed upon enemies at a distance. Any foe they gaze upon will be incinerated."

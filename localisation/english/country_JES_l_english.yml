 ### Foci
 JES_to_arms_citizens:0 "To Arms, Citizens!"
 JES_to_arms_citizens_desc:0 "Long have we prepared for this day, secretly gathering weapons smuggled from Aquileia. Now it is finally time to open up our caches and distribute weaponry to all who need them. Sacred love of the Fatherland, lead, support our avenging arms!"
 JES_form_your_battalions:0 "Form Your Battalions!"
 JES_form_your_battalions_desc:0 "Arise, children of the Fatherland, the day of glory has arrived! The foreign oppressors are coming, trying to prevent us from regaining our liberty. Every citizen must join the fight for Tarrin, and rather perish in battle than return to a life of slavery."
 JES_march_on:0 "Let's March, Let's March!"
 JES_march_on_desc:0 "Enough of hiding in the hills! We can now fight like true soldiers, marching in formation to battle, accompanied by the music of marching bands! We shall battle like a cohesive force, united in purpose and well-disciplined.\nA father, in tears, says to his Babette: "Listen, our griffs are said to be beating the drums!""
 JES_impure_blood:0 "Let An Impure Blood"
 JES_impure_blood_desc:0 "Francistrian colonists brought in by the despotic Martlewing government have been nothing but parasites and oppressors in Tarrin. They have stolen our lands, imposed their barbaric language upon us and treat us like cattle. Tarrinians, for us, ah! What outrage, what furious action it must arouse!"
 JES_water_furrows:0 "Water Our Furrows!"
 JES_water_furrows_desc:0 "Our rivers are the lifeblood of our nation, and they may aid us in our struggle. We can open dams, breach levees and flood irrigation systems to turn our fertile fields into a marsh, difficult to traverse by the enemy. Everyone is a soldier to combat you, our foe, even our rivers!"
 
 JES_second_elections:0 "The Second Elections"
 JES_second_elections_desc:0 "Decades ago, in 980, the first elections were held in the Tarrinian Republic. Unfortunately, a new government was never formed before the Francistrians invaded our land. Now that we are free once more, new elections shall be held. The old parties have already been re-founded and campaigning for votes has begun. Hopefully, the democratic process won't be interrupted once again."
 
 JES_gaddafi_victory:0 "Freedom, Socialism, And Unity"
 JES_gaddafi_victory_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire and the AST party have triumphed in the elections, promising to bring direct democracy and extensive social reform to Tarrin. They have radical ideas, but their promises of a brighter future for the nation have appealed to many, especially in the lower classes of society."
 JES_mixed_economy:0 "The Path To Socialism"
 JES_mixed_economy_desc:0 "As Caramel Marks wrote, the path to socialism goes through capitalism. This is why the Sisterly Leader has decreed the adoption of reforms which make the Tarrinian economy a mixed one. Entrepreneurs will be supported while at the same time vital assets, especially those owned by foreigners, will be nationalized. This combination should foster rapid economic growth in the country."
 JES_green_revolution:0 "The Green Revolution"
 JES_green_revolution_desc:0 "Securing self-suffiency in food production is an important priority for any nation. The Sisterly Leader has ordered that all land expropriated from Francistrian settlers shall be redistributed freely to native Tarrinians. New irrigation projects are also being funded to boost productivity and any farmers in need can receive generous subsidies from the government."
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil:0 "Nationalize Transista Oil Fields"
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil_desc:0 "Transista is a small province, but nonetheless important thanks to its oil deposits. However, these are currently owned by Wingbardian oil companies and investors, who drain much of the profit abroad. To strenghten the nation, the Sisterly Leader has decreed the nationalization of oil fields. She believes this is an essential step towards socialism."
 JES_invest_into_military:0 "Military Build-Up"
 JES_invest_into_military_desc:0 "Profits from oil exports should be invested not only into improving the wellbeing of the citizenry, but also into the strengthening of the arms industry. A nation's sovereignty can only be truly secured with military force, and an army is only as strong as its supply chain is. Expanding arms production will also provide jobs for thousands."
 JES_more_wages_less_rent:0 "More Wages, Less Rents"
 JES_more_wages_less_rent_desc:0 "Workers of Tarrin have been exploited long enough, not only by foreigners but by greedy capitalists and landowners also. The minimum wage will from now on be doubled, price controls will be put in place for essential products and rents will be reduced across the board. This will greatly improve the livelihood of the Tarrinian citizenry."
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives:0 "Companies Into Cooperatives"
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives_desc:0 "The Sisterly Leader wishes to tear down bureaucracy and eliminate the private sector of the economy. For this purpose, control of businesses and companies will be ceded to the workers who work in them. Cooperatives with democratically chosen representatives will replace the dictatorial leadership of capitalists and business owners."
 JES_house_for_every_family:0 "A House For Every Family"
 JES_house_for_every_family_desc:0 "The Francistrians cared little for the living conditions of Tarrinians. Many towns, especially Tarrin itself, have squalorous slums or homeless griffons wandering the streets. The Sisterly Leader cannot tolerate such poverty in our glorious Tarrin, and has decreed extensive housing construction programs to provide a dwelling for every family."
 JES_haven_of_socialism:0 "Haven Of Socialism"
 JES_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Through patient reform, we are building a truly socialist economy, one owned by the state and managed by the workers. Living standards in our small country have quickly risen and even skeptics of socialism have to admit that our Sisterly Leader's policies have worked effectively. Now we can reap the red fruits of our labour!"
 JES_state_control_trade:0 "State-Controlled Trade"
 JES_state_control_trade_desc:0 "Greedy, self-serving individuals have exploited Tarrinian economy long enough. From this day onwards, Tarrin will take control of its own trade, with the state managing imports and exports directly. Government-owned supermarkets will provide the citizenry everything they need, keeping the prices low and ensuring the profits go to the workers."
 
 JES_disband_parliament:0 "Disband The Parliament"
 JES_disband_parliament_desc:0 "The newly formed parliament is not a fitting governmental body for a democratic nation. It empowers a small minority of elected representatives, leaving the citizens with only one privilege: The right to vote. The President has decreed the dissolution of the parliament, so it can be replaced with a more righteous institution."
 JES_popular_committees:0 "Establish Popular Committees"
 JES_popular_committees_desc:0 "The next step in the political restructuring of Tarrin is establishing Popular Committees, allowing for more direct political participation than the old parliamentary system. These local councils will mobilize the populace to be more involved in political decision-making. Schools and universities will have their own Committees to enlighten the young."
 JES_dissolve_parties:0 "Dissolve Political Parties"
 JES_dissolve_parties_desc:0 "Political parties are elitist, corrupt clubs for the rich. The Republic of Tarrin has no need for such organizations. Our populace cannot be divided by factionalism, which these parties exacerbate. Instead, regional Basic Congresses will fulfill the political needs of the citizenry, allowing them to vote directly on local matters."
 JES_moralism:0 "Moralism"
 JES_moralism_desc:0 "Tarrinian society must have moral superiority over other cultures, especially that of decadent Francistrians. The Sisterly Leader has decreed the banning of alcohol, encouragement of traditional dress codes and the closing of immoral establishments. Eliminating these vices will improve the moral character of our citizenry and make their lives better."
 JES_purge_monarchists:0 "Purge The Monarchists"
 JES_purge_monarchists_desc:0 "The pathetic remnants of pro-monarchists in the nation have reared their ugly heads. The Sisterly Leader has ordered them to be dealt with quickly. FLNT veterans will outsmart the resistance and Popular Courts will be established to hold trials for any monarchists captured. Lastly, the despicable claimant Count will be sentenced to death, in absentia."
 JES_erase_foreign_influence:0 "Erase Foreign Influences"
 JES_erase_foreign_influence_desc:0 "Thirty years of Francistrian occupation and separation from Aquileia have tainted the country. It must be healed before it is too late, and like a surgeon we must conduct a swift operation. Any Francistrians remaining in the country will be expelled, their property confiscated and their cultural influences removed."
 JES_adult_literacy_program:0 "Adult Literacy Program"
 JES_adult_literacy_program_desc:0 "It is easy to teach young griffs to read, as they are open-minded and able to learn easily. But illteracy among adults must be erased as well, and that is a much more difficult task. The Sisterly Leader has requested new social programs to offer free and mandatory reading courses for all citizens who still cannot read."
 JES_free_university_education:0 "Free University Education"
 JES_free_university_education_desc:0 "Charging money for the privilege of learning is truly rapacious and capitalistic. Thankfully, all education in our country will be free of charge, even at university level. Now brilliant minds can be cultivated even if they belong to poor griffons. Hopefully, many new bright minds will join the ranks of our intelligentsia."
 JES_pan_aquileianism:0 "Pan-Aquileianism"
 JES_pan_aquileianism_desc:0 "Aquileians are one of the major cultural groups of griffonkind, alongside Herzlanders and Wingbardians. Aquileians have shared history, heritage and traditions, as well as similar languages. It has been many years since Aquileians were united under a single nation. However, the Sisterly Leader has a dream, and it shall not be deferred."
 
 JES_reestablish_the_army:0 "Re-Establish The Army"
 JES_reestablish_the_army_desc:0 "The army of the Republic of Tarrin was a direct successor to the army of the County, but it was effectively destroyed during the Francistrian invasion, its soldiers imprisoned, forced into exile or joining the FLNT. Now that we have regained our independence, we can rebuild the army that was lost."
 JES_standardize_equipment:0 "Standardize Military Equipment"
 JES_standardize_equipment_desc:0 "Many soldiers in our recreated army are former resistance fighters, who fought with whatever weapons they could get their claws on. However, maintaining these weapons was often difficult due to numerous designs in use, and much of the equipment was outdated. A proper army needs proper weapons, or else it is little more than a band of rabble."
 JES_promote_officers:0 "Promote Officers"
 JES_promote_officers_desc:0 "The new army is in need of an officer corps large enough to lead the soldiers in battle. Therefore [Root.GetLeader] has authorized the promotion of new officers from the ranks of common soldiers. Those who proved themselves most capable during the years of resistance will be prioritized first. This will revitalize our forces and bring fresh minds into our leadership."
 JES_military_academy:0 "Reopen The Griffoble Military Academy"
 JES_military_academy_desc:0 "Before the Francistrian occupation, Griffoble used to have one of the most famous military academies in Aquileia. It was an old and prestigious organization, responsible for training many capable military leaders and cultivating new strategies for warfare. It was closed by the Francistrians, but now we can finally reopen the venerable academy."
 JES_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorization"
 JES_army_motorization_desc:0 "The future of warfare is on wheels and treads. However, reaching that future will take time, requiring production and supply of trucks, cars and other vehicles. While Tarrin lacks a strong industry to mass produce them, efforts can be made to acquire them from abroad instead. This will aid with efforts to further modernize the armed forces."
 JES_big_money_big_women_big_guns:0 "Supplying The Artillery"
 JES_big_money_big_women_big_guns_desc:0 "Artillery is the key of industrial war. It allows the weakening of defensive positions, the dispersal of attack formations and destruction of fortifications. Yet it requires the manufacture of a large amount of shells and guns to be effective. For now, we must rely on a foreign supplier."
 JES_tank_experiments:0 "Tank Experiments"
 JES_tank_experiments_desc:0 "The so-called tank is revolutionizing warfare, and the younger officers, always open to new ideas, are advocating for them to be adopted by the Tarrinian army. These technological marvels are difficult to manufacture, but very powerful on the battlefield as long as they are used effectively. Therefore, experiments with making and using tanks shall take place."
 JES_hire_aquileian_advisors:0 "Hire Aquileian Advisors"
 JES_hire_aquileian_advisors_desc:0 "The Aquileians have much to teach for the Tarrinian military. There are many experts, theorists and veterans with useful knowledge. Private deals can be struck with such individuals who might be interested in aiding us in exchange for regular pay. It will be a worthwhile investment, to make sure the latest innovations can be exploited by us."
 JES_establish_an_air_force:0 "Establish An Air Force"
 JES_establish_an_air_force_desc:0 "Winged infantry is no longer enough to secure the air, with the advent of metallic planes armed with heavy weaponry. If the Tarrinian air space is to be secured, then a proper air force will be needed to defend it. Personel will be trained and planes acquired from contractors. The Transista airfield will be the main base of the new air force."
 
 JES_republican_victory:0 "The Republican Cause"
 JES_republican_victory_desc:0 "Just like in 980, Meinard Nocère and the pro-Aquileian RTA party have won the elections. The spirit of the Aquileian Revolution lives on, and Meinard promises to continue the fight that began so long ago. Tarrin and Aquileia shall be united in purpose, bearing the shining torch of democracy in despotic Griffonia!"
 JES_third_revolution:0 "The Third Revolution"
 JES_third_revolution_desc:0 "The Second Aquileian Revolution ended in bitter failure. But President Meinard already learned to never abandon hope, and to keep fighting until the end. Next time, the Aquileian Revolution shall succeed, and the tyranny of the disgusting Discret dynasty shall end. Third time is the charm, as they say."
 JES_contact_the_exiles:0 "Contact The Exiles"
 JES_contact_the_exiles_desc:0 "The Aquileian underground resistance movement has been forced to flee the country after the monarchist triumph and now live in hiding, scattered across the world. But now they are needed once more. They can come to the safe haven of Tarrin as long as they agree to continue fighting for the Republican cause."
 JES_anti_monarchist_propaganda:0 "Anti-Monarchist Propaganda"
 JES_anti_monarchist_propaganda_desc:0 "The griffons of Tarrin must be galvanized into revolutionary action against supporters of monarchy. They need to be reminded that our true enemies are not the Francistrians, but monarchists. They have always wanted a crowned head to oppress the common folk in the name of Boreas. There can be no negotiation or reasoning with such deluded minds."
 JES_foreign_legion:0 "Tarrinian Foreign Legion"
 JES_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The word of our cause has spread far and wide already, and many are flocking to our blue-red-white banner of revolution. They are bringing with them arms and equipment, so they simply need to be organized into proper fighting units. Thus, the Tarrinian Foreign Legion shall be established, and those wishing to join will go through rigorous training."
 JES_allies_in_periphery:0 "Allies In The Periphery"
 JES_allies_in_periphery_desc:0 "While the local leaders in the Periphery used the chaos of the First Aquileian Revolution to their advantage by declaring independence, this does not mean they are necessarily opposed to our cause. We share a common enemy, the Kingdom of Aquileia, and thus we can put our differences aside for now. We need to stand united against the Discrets!"
 JES_infiltrate_aquileia:0 "Infiltrate Aquileia"
 JES_infiltrate_aquileia_desc:0 "It is said knowing is half the battle. The Second Revolution failed because the strength of the monarchists was underestimated. The same mistake will not be repeated this time; Meinard has already ordered extensive preparations to be made by comprehensive intelligence gathering."
 JES_prepare_partisans:0 "Prepare The Partisans"
 JES_prepare_partisans_desc:0 "The freedom fighters of FLNT are veterans of guerilla warfare. They will train new partisan detachments which will be secretly sent into Aquileia with support from republican sympathisers. They will prepare local revolts to seize control of territory once we are ready to launch the Third Revolution."
 JES_incite_resistance:0 "Incite Popular Resistance"
 JES_incite_resistance_desc:0 "The willpower of the common griffons took a heavy blow from the defeat of the Second Revolution, but we must inform them that the Republicans never give up, so it is too early to abandon hope. Our agents will spread the word, urging Aquileians to join the anti-monarchist resistance and providing them with weapons they need."
 JES_for_the_republic:0 "For The Republic!"
 JES_for_the_republic_desc:0 "The time has come. The preparations are complete. We are now ready to launch the Third Aquileian Revolution, our final Hail Eyr. We will liberate Aquileia from Discret despotism or die trying. In either case, eternal glory shall await us! Marshal Nocère, lead us to Aquila, and we shall follow!"
 
 JES_capitalism_within_reason:0 "Capitalism Within Reason"
 JES_capitalism_within_reason_desc:0 "Political liberation must co-exist alongside economic liberation; a free market and the right to own property are the foundations of a truly democratic society. However, capitalism without any limitations leads to exploitation and inequality. With limited oversight, the economy can grow with every citizen getting their fair share."
 JES_lower_taxes:0 "Lower The Taxes"
 JES_lower_taxes_desc:0 "The Francistrian occupiers imposed high taxes upon the populace, wishing to drain the wealth of Tarrin into their own coffers. This suffocated the economy and resulted in a long period of stagnation. The new Republic shall repeal many excessive taxes, making citizens and businesses wealthier. This money that was taxed before can now be invested into growth."
 JES_auction_seized_property:0 "Auction Seized Property"
 JES_auction_seized_property_desc:0 "During the chaos of the Tarrinian declaration of independence, many Francistrian colonists and businessgriffs abandoned their properties in Tarrin, leaving them vacant and unowned. They were then claimed by the state once the Republic was firmly established. Now, the lands and buildings will be sold to Tarrinian citizens."
 JES_state_owned_arms_industry:0 "Contracts With Arms Manufacturers"
 JES_state_owned_arms_industry_desc:0 "Our army is in desperate need of a reliable supply of weapons, as we can no longer simply rely on scavenged, smuggled or salvaged armaments. The government will award contracts to those companies that can fulfill the demands of the military. This should galvanize private industries into arming the nation."
 JES_railroad_shit:0 "Tarrinian Railway Company"
 JES_railroad_shit_desc:0 "Francistrians had little interest in improving the infrastructure of the lands they occupied. Now, a new private company has been founded to construct new railway lines across the nation. The government shall give its approval to their planned projects and offer low-interest loans to fund them."
 JES_expand_mines:0 "General Mining Act"
 JES_expand_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Tarrin contain many rich mineral deposits, but Francistrians made sure to keep them out of the claws of the locals. To facilitate expansion of mining operations, the government has now passed a new law allowing all citizens to prospect for ores on public lands, and gives them the right to acquire mining claims at a low price."
 JES_central_bank:0 "Establish The Central Bank"
 JES_central_bank_desc:0 "To better oversee the financial system of Tarrin, a central monetary authority needs to be organized. It shall be fully independent from political interference and will ensure economic stability by controlling inflation. Its first act will be to set low interest rates for loans to boost the national economy."
 JES_industrial_council:0 "Industrial Research Council"
 JES_industrial_council_desc:0 "By an act of parliament, the IRC will be created. It is a central organization focused on developing Tarrin's nascent industrial sector and its outdated technology. Its membership will consist of both educated engineers as well as businessgriffs, who will cooperate on creating strategies for improving industrial production."
 JES_free_market_focus:0 "Protect The Freedom Of Trade"
 JES_free_market_focus_desc:0 "It is the right of every citizen to exchange their own property freely, and this right should be respected by the government. Taxes, tariffs and barries should be minimized and any government-imposed monopolies dismantled. Only then can the common griffon of Tarrin prosper freely, without any chains of undue restrictions."
 
 JES_ultranat_victory:0 "Tarrin Awakens"
 JES_ultranat_victory_desc:0 "Aquileians were no better than Francistrians. After fighting so hard to gain their freedom, Tarrinians would now rather die than give it away. They will accept no foreigner to rule over them, only a true, pure-blooded Tarrinian, whose young heart burns with passionate flame. Enemies of Tarrin beware! The eagle has broken free from its shackles."
 JES_organic_unity:0 "Organic Unity"
 JES_organic_unity_desc:0 "A nation is a living, breathing being, made up of its citizens. Each Tarrinian is an integral part of the whole, and the whole is an integral part of each Tarrinian. The will of the nation is channelled through democracy and action is taken by its elected leaders. At the center of everything is President Pandionne, the beating heart of the living state."
 JES_rebirth_culture:0 "Cultural Rebirth"
 JES_rebirth_culture_desc:0 "Tarrin has always been under the shadow of Aquileia, the cultural hegemon of western Griffonia. Under Discret rule, native traditions were slowly forgotten, fewer and fewer griffons could speak Tarrinian, and the national identity began to erode. Francistrians were no better, attempting to forcefully assimilate Tarrin. But now, the Phoenix rises from the ashes."
 JES_expel_the_foreigners:0 "Expel The Foreigners"
 JES_expel_the_foreigners_desc:0 "Already, Tarrin has tolerated foreign presence on her sacred soil for too long. Any remaining Aquileians, Francistrians or other aliens without citizenship shall be expelled immediately from the territory of the Republic, and all of their property will be confiscated and redistributed to the citizenry. Tarrin must be purified of taint."
 JES_expand_tarrin_university:0 "Expand The University Of Tarrin"
 JES_expand_tarrin_university_desc:0 "When Francistrians occupied Tarrin, they took control of education and fired any university professors who were deemed to be too "unreliable". Funding was cut, the curriculum was changed and foreign teachers were brought in. With independence restored, Tarrin's temple of knowledge can be fully restored to its former glory."
 JES_liberate_north_tarrin:0 "Liberate Northern Tarrin"
 JES_liberate_north_tarrin_desc:0 "Lointaineau, now known as western Verenia, was once part of Aquileia. Yet even today its griffons speak a dialect that is unmistakably similar to Tarrinian. In the eyes of President Pandionne, these lands are rightfully part of the Tarrinian nation, and its griffons yearn to be liberated from oppressive rule. The army must be prepared for action at once."
 JES_finish_the_job:0 "Finish The Job"
 JES_finish_the_job_desc:0 "The work of the revolutionaries was left unfinished when Count Francis VIII invaded Tarrin. Many Discret loyalists were left alive and managed to go into hiding, and have now once again reared their ugly heads. It is time to cleanse the filth of monarchism from the pure land of Tarrin. No mercy will be given to those suspected of cooperating with the terrorists."
 JES_secure_the_border:0 "Secure The Border"
 JES_secure_the_border_desc:0 "Tarrin cannot be allowed to fall to outside invasion ever again. Proper defences must be prepared so history is not repeated. President Pandionne has decreed massive public works projects to construct extensive fortifications across the entire border of the nation. Border controls will be made more strict as well, so no spies or illegal migrants get through."
 JES_scientific_nationalism:0 "Scientific Nationalism"
 JES_scientific_nationalism_desc:0 "The light of science cannot be darkened by excessive foreign corruption. Tarrinian science must strive to be above the rest, because through intellectual achievement the nation may attain prominence on the world stage. Groundbreaking innovations will also strenghten the economy and the military. Scholars deserve all the support they can get for their work."
 JES_tarrin_forever:0 "Tarrin Forever"
 JES_tarrin_forever_desc:0 "Under the strong yet wise guidance of President Pandionne, Tarrin shall last for a thousand years, prevailing against all opposition. The lands may be occupied, its citizens may be enslaved, its wealth may be stolen, but as long as Tarrinians live, Tarrin shall never perish.\nTarrin liura totjorn!"
 
 JES_veterans_of_long_war:0 "Veterans Of The Long War"
 JES_veterans_of_long_war_desc:0 "For 30 years they fought, waging a secret war in the shadows against the tenacious invader. Yet they never abandoned hope, never gave in to despair. Thus Arcturius saw their courage and rewarded them with victory. The experience has honed fine warriors who have proven themselves able to defend Tarrin. Only in death does their duty end."
 JES_lessons_from_the_past:0 "Lessons From The Past"
 JES_lessons_from_the_past_desc:0 "The soldiers of FLNT learned many things about waging asymmetric modern warfare during the insurgency. These lessons can now be applied to more conventional style of warfare, allowing Tarrin to catch up to other countries that have more advanced military doctrine. Those veterans unable to fight shall teach the next generation all they know."
 JES_scavengers:0 "Battlefield Scavengers"
 JES_scavengers_desc:0 "To supply themselves with weapons, FLNT soldiers resorted to stealing them from the enemy garrison and raiding weapon stockpiles in the dark of the night. Even though they can now access a domestic supply of weapons, it's always good to acquire more equipment, especially if it comes from the enemy."
 JES_knights_of_the_republic:0 "Knights Of The Republic"
 JES_knights_of_the_republic_desc:0 "During the insurgency, FLNT fighters faced fearsome knights of Francistria who wore enchanted magical armour capable of stopping bullets. This has inspired President Pandionne to establish a new knightly order to defend the Republic against its enemies. Only those most capable and most loyal will be allowed to enter its hallowed ranks."
 JES_peoples_militia:0 "Citizen Militia"
 JES_peoples_militia_desc:0 "It is the duty of every citizen to defend their homeland from the enemy. The populace must be reminded of this, and new militia units organized to aid with national defence and internal security. These militia units will receive training from FLNT veterans, who will hopefully enlighten their hearts with patriotic flames."
 JES_sappers_engineers:0 "Transista School Of Military Engineering"
 JES_sappers_engineers_desc:0 "Thanks to the oil fields, Transista has already been a home to many engineers. However, their engineering talents could be used for the benefit of the military. Therefore President Pandionne has decreed the opening of a new military engineering school where sappers and pioneers can be trained."
 JES_anti_air_focus:0 "National Air Defence"
 JES_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "While a dispersed infantry army is a harder target for enemy air forces, the same cannot be said for urban centers. The air defence capabilities of Tarrinian settlements must be improved to shield them from bombardment. Also, without a strong defensive air force, the army might still need anti-air weaponry to protect themselves from below."
 JES_infiltration_operations:0 "Infiltrate The Enemy"
 JES_infiltration_operations_desc:0 "Partisan warfare requires secrecy and the ability to avoid being discovered. However, this method of secret warfare can be used offensively as well. Specialized partisan detachments can be prepared to infiltrate enemy territory and launch a deadly strike at the heart of the nation while their troops are distracted on the border."
 JES_anti_tank_focus:0 "Anti-Tank Tactics"
 JES_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "Nations with a larger industrial capacity can afford to create formations of armoured attack vehicles that can break through defensive lines with ease. To counter them, specialized weaponry and training is needed. While new anti-tank guns are prepared, the infantry will learn to use incendiary bombs, mines and grenades to destroy enemy tanks."

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nIf FLNT achieves its goal of independence, she feels obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."
 JES_meinard_desc:0 "When the Aquileian revolution broke out in 980, it was Meinard Nocère who led the uprising in Tarrin against the despotic Discret Countess. It was him who ordered the execution of the tyrant by guillotine. It was him who was the first President of the Republic of Tarrin, preparing his homeland for joining the Aquileian Republic. It was him who led the desperate struggle against Count Francis VIII and his forces. It was him who fled into the hills and founded the FLNT, even as the revolution crumbled around him.\n\nMeinard's status among Tarrinians is close to mythical. For the longest time, most did not even know if he was alive anymore, or merely a story older Tarrinians told, about a hero who would one day miraculously liberate Tarrin from foreign oppression. For a long time, even the Governor-General Vittorio Felice was unsure about the fate of Meinard.\n\nNow that FLNT has declared Tarrin's independence, Meinard has come out of hiding and revealed himself, leaving Tarrinians in awe and Francistrians in shock. Its as if he had risen from the dead to stand aside the griffons of Tarrin as they broke their chains once more.\n\nMeinard has close ties to the main republican movement in Aquileia, and especially to Théodore Vérany. He was born in Aquileia, but in his eyes Aquileians and Tarrinians are kinfolk with shared heritage. He has spent so many years fighting for Tarrin's freedom that no one cares where he comes from and most Tarrinians consider him a true national hero of Tarrin."
 JES_corina_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire, commonly known as Colonel Corina, is an eccentric figure. Coming from a humble background, she joined the Griffoble Military Academy, but betrayed her royalist superiors and joined the revolutionaries in 980. During the first Tarrinian elections, she founded AST, a socialist nationalist party, despite still being fairly young and inexperienced at the time.\n\nShe is strongly religious and nationalistic, yet is without a doubt a devout socialist. She advocates republican rule, yet is known for her authoritarian tendencies within the party. Due to leading a group of dissident officers who rebelled against the County, the republicans had a difficult time trusting her. Yet over the years, she slowly gained the trust she deserved by bravely fighting against the Francistrian invaders and organizing both passive and active resistance to occupation. At the same time, her popularity has grown among the citizens of Tarrin.\n\nReclusive, irrational and impulsive, yet also naive, intelligent and pious. To this day, Corina remains a controversial figure, but none doubt that she genuinely cares about the liberation of Tarrin and its inhabitants."

Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."

However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] army has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy?

 tarrin.5.t:0 "Reunion"
 tarrin.5.d:0 "It was wise for the three leading figures of FLNT to never gather together in one place, so the leadership of the movement could never be eliminated in a single ambush. Therefore they almost never met each other, communicating exclusively with encrypted letters and telegrams, staying hidden and separate for as long as was needed.\n\nNow, they no longer had to hide like rats, or fear Francistrian agents spying their moves. They could meet freely, though just in case they still met in their secret underground headquarters. Meinard Nocère was already waiting there as Leontina Pandionne and Corina Trasviraire arrived, peacefully smoking a pipe and observing drafted military plans on the table. Leontina came first. The young freedom fighter bowed in respect.\n"Ah, little Leontina, good to see you!" Meinard said with a smile. "You've become a true adult since we last met."\n"It's been a while, hasn't it?" She replied. "My entire life I've spent fighting against the barbarians. To think it could soon be over..."\n"Let us not be so optimistic just yet. We still have to secure our independence."\nNext Corina entered the room, saluting Meinard like a soldier, her face stone-cold and serious.\n"You can drop the act, Corina, it's just the three of us here."\nCorina's expression became warmer and she let out a hearty chuckle, then sat down. "I wish I could drop the act when I am around my soldiers. There is no reason to be serious when we should rejoice instead!"\n"Not yet. It would be premature."\nCorina smirked. "And here I thought you were the optimist. What's the matter?"\n"Francistria may yet send their army to 'pacify' Tarrin. Aquileia may not recognize our independence. And to the north, stormclouds gather. We must make contingency plans for every scenario. We have gained our freedom, but we must continue to fight for it. Let us not rest on our laurels just yet."\nCorina and Leontina nodded, and the three began to plan together."

Many of them lack food or water, or are either sickly or injured. Long wagon caravans clog up the roads, making it difficult to supply our military forces.\n\nRefugees are reporting about atrocities committed by nationalistic Tarrinians as well as forced expulsions and seizure of property. Those Tarrinians who were sympathetic to either Francistrian or Aquileian rule were treated even worse than the foreign settlers, being regarded as heinous traitors.\n\nNow the government has to do what it can to take care of all these homeless, desperate refugees, straining its resources and distracting from any military efforts."

 tarrin.7.d:0 "Meinard Nocère, the hero of Tarrin, was relaxing on the balcony of his office and smoking a pipe. The weather was clear and sunny, which reflected the mood in the country at the time. Meinard sighed wistfully, somehow knowing deep inside it wouldn't last.\n\nThere was a creaking sound as Leontina Pandionne opened the door to the balcony. "Ah, there you are, Marshal. I was looking for you."\nMeinard blew out smoke from his beak. "Oh yes, you wanted to meet. What's the matter, little Leontina?"\nShe sat down on a chair next to him, took in a deep breath as if preparing to fly off a cliff, and spoke. "Marshal, do you still... intend to cooperate with the Aquileians?"\n"With the republicans? Why yes, of course. They are our close friends. Their cause is our cause."\n"But their cause is doomed to fail, I fear. And even if it didn't, why should we still consider them friends? Where was Aquileia when the barbarians invaded?"\nMeinard frowned, and inhaled smoke from his pipe. "They were busy securing their own revolution. Besides, Francistria was allied with Wingbardy. They couldn't risk a war with them."\nLeontina pouted. "Or maybe they don't care for Tarrin and its independence. Do you still intend for Tarrin to become part of Aquileia? Just throw away the hard-fought freedom we've earned?"\nThe older griffon seemed increasingly uncomfortable. "Well, we'd still be free being part of an Aquileian Republic, just not sovereign. For me, it's democracy that truly matters."\nLeontina stood up and grimaced. "So it's as I feared. Your mind is set, I can tell, but I cannot agree with that." She placed a claw on her chest. "By Boreas, I am a Tarrinian, not an Aquileian!"\nMeinard set aside his pipe. "Little Leontina, please, calm down-"\n"I've now made my decision. I will run for President, and if I win, I will make sure Tarrin remains truly free. I'd rather die than live again in slavery!" She then took off, flying away from the balcony.\n\nMeinard was certain he saw tears in her eyes as she did so."

 tarrin.8.d:0 "With elections approaching, one of the leading figures of FLNT's socialist wing and the head of the socialist AST party, Corina Trasviraire, was strangely absent from public stage. However, it turned out she was just preparing the publication of a book she had written during her time as a resistance fighter. Now, it was released across the nation and copies were given out freely to commoners in towns and villages. Of course, many citizens remained illiterate, but those that weren't could read the book out loud to others.\n\nThe book was simply called "The Blue Book". It was relatively short, written personally by Corina and meant to be read by everyone in Tarrin. It outlined Corina's own political views and her plans for the future, if she will be elected President.\n\nThe book condemned capitalism, but also communism, and curiously also denounced political parties, parliaments and constitutions. Instead, it advocated socialism, direct democracy and nationalism. Instead of a parliament, Tarrin should have a system of popular committees and conferences so power is not delegated to a ruling minority. It called for the abolishment of wage labour, elimination of exploitation and devolution of the state. She emphasised the importance of family, equality and freedom of speech.\n\nIn an interview with a reporter for a newly-founded Tarrin newspaper, Meinard Nocère called the book "a bunch of nonsense" and expressed his disappointment with Corina running for Presidency, saying it makes the nation more divided than it should be."

 tarrin.9.t:0 "Two Sides Of The Same Coin"
 tarrin.9.d:0 "Soon after Leontina heard the news that Corina was running for presidency, she wanted to have a public political debate with Corina. Because of Corina's nationalist platform, she saw her as a challenger who could easily win the favour of her own voting base. Leontina knew she'd have to beat her face-to-face in a debate to prove herself as a superior candidate.\n\nCorina accepted the invitation to a debate and soon enough the two met on stage in Griffoble, their speech being broadcast by radio so Tarrinians across the country could listen to it.\nAfter short and formal introductions, Leontina opened the debate proper. "First of all, I want to say that I've read your book, just so we're clear. And while I have tremendous respect for you as a resistance fighter, I found many things to disagree with in this tome. And to be frank, some of it is just strange. You condemn representative democracy, yet are trying to get elected President?"\nCorina shrugged with her characteristic, laid back smirk. "Well, can't reform representative democracy into something else without becoming President first, you know? I might be a revolutionary, but I only overthrow monarchical regimes, not democratic ones."\n"Hmpf, fair enough. But you also advocate for socialism. Don't you know socialism as an economic system cannot work?"\nCorina almost burst out laughing. "Hah, everygriff knows true socialism hasn't been tried yet."\n"And these conferences and committees, they sound borderline anarchical. How can Tarrin be strong and united if it is made so internally divided?"\n"You know, you're doing pretty well in a debate for someone so young," Corina said with a warm smile. "I'm impressed, you have a fiery spirit and I respect that. But in debates it is usually polite to let the other side speak freely instead of just bombarding them with critique."\nLeontina was taken aback and stuttered with her speech. "O-oh, right. My apologies."\n\nThe debate continued long into the afternoon, with both sides making good points."
 tarrin.9.a:0 "Tarrinians are impressed with Leontina's arguments."

 tarrin.10.d:0 "All of Tarrin was abuzz with activity on the day of the elections. Many of the older Tarrinians felt nostalgic for the last election day in 980, while the younger ones were eager to finally have their voices be heard. As the country was in need of both a head of state and a parliament, it was a dual election of sorts, with both votes being held simultaneously. The three main contenders for political positions were RTA, a Tarrinian-Aquileian republican party led by Meinard Nocère, PNT, a relatively young nationalist party whose figurehead was Leontina Pandionne, and AST, the old socialist party whose leader had always been Corina Trasviraire. It was quite likely that the party that would win a majority would also get their candidate voted President, so most Tarrinians treated both elections as one.\n\nVoter turnout was even higher than it had been in 980, and counting began as soon as the ballots were closed. All of Tarrin held its breath and eagerly awaited to hear the results being revealed on the radio, as it would decide the fate of the nation itself. Despite stark differences between the policies of the three parties, the country was peaceful as its griffons respected the democratic process. Whatever the results may be, they will be accepted by all three parties and their leaders."

Tarrin was once a County subject to the Discret monarchy, but the Count was overthrown in 980. Already back then, Meinard Nocère won the elections and wished to join the fellow revolutionaries in Aquila, but before that could be done, the Francistrians invaded.\n\nNow at last, after so many years of separation, Tarrin can rejoin the fatherland!"

With the foreign occupiers expelled, the building once more became the personal quarters of the President of Tarrin.\n\nCorina Trasviraire, however, was still not content with the building's status. As she explored its luxurious halls, she thought of what could be sold off or melted into ingots. In her mind, the entire building would have to be repurposed, either into a meeting place of popular committees, or a museum dedicated to the revolution. She had little interest in living in such a spacious and extravagant place. But for now, it would have to suffice.\n\nShe opened a door and entered a conference room, where Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne were already waiting. As she sat down, Meinard smirked. "How typical of you to be late for your own meeting."\nCorina shrugged and rested her paws on the table. "Had a look around the place, I'm still not familiar with it. In any case, I did want to talk with you two. You lost the presidential race, and I know that you disagree with my plans for Tarrin. Which makes me question if you still wish to remain loyal to the Republic."\nLeontina rolled her eyes, while Meinard chuckled. "Of course. No matter what happens, we three are bound by blood and oaths of loyalty to one another."\n"At least you're not willing to simply let go of our sovereignty," Leontina said to Corina, glancing at Meinard.\n"Good, good. Our personal disagreements are secondary to national unity. Besides, it'd be a shame to lose such talented military leaders."\n"Flattery won't win our undying loyalty," Leontina said. "But if you prove that you know what you're doing and make Tarrin prosper, I don't see a reason to oppose you in any way."\n"Agreed," Meinard said. "Losing an election is nothing compared to losing my country. Promise you won't let that happen."\nCorina smiled and saluted the Marshal. "I promise.""

With the foreign occupiers expelled, the building once more became the personal quarters of the President of Tarrin.\n\nWhen Meinard Nocère entered it for the first time in about 30 years, he let out a peaceful sigh. It felt like coming back home after all this time. This had been his home and headquarters during his last Presidency, which had been short-lived. Much had changed since then, and he could see how the Francistrians had stripped it of many valuable artworks, bringing them all to their own country. Yet much had remained untouched, and it still had an aura of luxury and prosperity, which had once been exclusive to the Discrets alone.\n\nHe opened a door and entered a conference room, where he had arranged a meeting with two of his most trusted comrades, Corina Trasviraire and Leontina Pandionne. He sat down, took out his pipe and lit it with a match. It had been too long since he had last smoked in this room. He could remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nSoon, Leontina entered, on time as usual. She was a good soldier, obedient yet confident, knowing in her heart what had to be done. Meinard simply nodded in greeting, and she nodded back as she sat down. Some time later, Corina came, late as always. Yet Meinard did not mind. It was simply Corina's habit, and nothing could change it.\n"It is unreal that we are now gathered here in this room, but sometimes dreams can become reality," Meinard said. "Yet our work is far from over. The evil work of the occupier must be undone, the nation healed. And most importantly, Aquileia must be saved from the claws of the Discrets."\n"We must strike against the monarchist scum immediately!" Corina almost shouted, slamming her clawed fist on the table.\n"Patience, Corina. We are too weak to do so. Preparations need to be made, or our independence will be as short-lived as last time."\n"You are putting Tarrin at risk if you plan to topple the Kingdom," Leontina muttered. "And if we miraculously win? What happens to Tarrin?"\n"Do not worry, little Leontina," Meinard said. "Tarrin will prevail. It always has, and always will, no matter what.""

It was a monument to greed, oppression and foreign corruption. She had always wanted to demolish the entire structure, and likely would do so as soon as she could. For now, it would unfortunately function as the Presidential Palace. Leontina already envisioned a new, grand building in its place, without any signs of Aquileian architecture. It would be purely Tarrinian, designed by a Tarrinian architect and built by Tarrinian workers. Only that would be sufficient for the President of Tarrin.\n\nShe walked inside and headed for the conference room, where Meinard Nocère was already waiting, calmly smoking his pipe.

We cannot possibly survive alone.\n"Perhaps," Leontina replied, "but this does not mean I will sacrifice our sovereignty. No, I will defend it at any cost. Tarrin has been trampled by foreigners long enough, and I want to make it strong."\n"I like the sound of that," Corina said, "but try not to anger the Aquileians or Francistrians too much.

It is possible they receive foreign support from monarchist supporters in Aquileia and possibly from Francistria as well, though these claims have not been fully confirmed. Whatever the case, they are conducting terrorist attacks across the country, bombing government buildings and assassinating officials, as well as spreading pro-monarchist and anti-republican propaganda. They call themselves the "Burgundy Order", named after the colour of the Discret coat of arms, and are proving to be dangerous despite their small size."

 tarrin.16.d:0 "The separatists in Tarrin, who recently gained their independence from [FRN.GetNameDef], have sent us a diplomatic envoy, asking for their newborn nation to be recognized by our government as a sovereign country.\n\nAccepting this request would mean that we not only acknowledge their independence as legal, but also enables us to form friendly ties with the young country. However, doing so would also likely anger some Francistrians, who may still think that Tarrin is a rightful part of their nation. Not only that, but justifying the military occupation of an area is much easier if you do not recognize it as a legal entity. And in the end, does Griffonia truly need yet another tiny statelet that can hardly sustain itself?"
 tarrin.16.a:0 "We recognize Tarrin's independence."

 tarrin.18.d:0 "Bad news from [From.GetNameDef]. Their government has officially refused to recognize our nation as a sovereign, independent country, and continues to consider that our country legally belongs to either Aquileia, Francistria or a Pan-Griffonian government. They have also rejected our proposal to establish a [From.GetAdjective] in our capital. This will make it difficult to form proper diplomatic relations with them, and endangers our liberty. We should be wary of them in the future."

[JES.GetLeader] has publicly stated that she wished to secure control of the vital resource and ensure most of the profits would remain inside the nation instead of being funneled abroad.\n\nWe have decided to issue a formal protest to the Tarrinian government, albeit there is no support for further action. We have, however, promised to compensate the oil companies for their losses so they can continue to function normally."

 tarrin.20.d:0 "With a majority secured in the parliament, Corina Trasviraire could easily push through the needed legislation to completely disband the flawed institution and replace it with a new one, the General National Congress. Of course, RTA and PNT would oppose the act, but with a minority they could do little more than protest. Some accused Corina of trying to seize power for herself, but she assured them new, more democratic governmental bodies would replace the parliament.\n\nAnd so the parliament gathered for the first time since 980, only for it to be the final time as well. Speeches were spoken and a vote was held, and in the end a majority of the parliament agreed for it to be disbanded permanently, and replaced with the General National Congress, a vastly expanded legislature with 3000 representatives of regional Basic Congresses. There were loud protests from the other parties, but Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne remained silent, seemingly trusting Corina.\n\nCorina herself then officially resigned as well, announcing that the position of President would cease to exist as well. Instead, she'd take more of a guiding role in leading the nation. A name for her new position was needed, so AST agreed to call her Sisterly Leader."

 tarrin.21.d:0 "During the years of occupation, Francistrians were the ones in power and did everything they could to integrate Tarrin. They offered confiscated land to colonists, enforced the Francistrian language, suppressed the freedom of speech and expression, seized control of local business and so on. While much has been done to undo all this damage, the insidious Francistrian influence was never properly expunged. Until now.\n\nThe Sisterly Leader decreed the immediate expulsion of all Francistrians and their families, banned the use of Francistrian language in public and forbade any cultural practices that were deemed too "Francistrian". Instead, she wished for the promotion of Aquileian language and culture. Schools would now become bilingual, teaching both Aquileian and Tarrinian. Francistrian had already been removed from the curriculum entirely.\n\nThe Popular Congresses complied, starting a cultural revolution of sorts where anything seen as "foreign" was removed from society. No compensation was offered to those who were expulsed and stripped of property. Corina saw this as justified, saying that it would cover "the cost of the occupation". Tarrinian populace celebrated the event on the streets, burning effigies of Governor-General Vittorio and Count Francis VIII. The flags of the Griffonian Empire, Aquileian monarchy, Francistria and Wingbardy were spread out on the pavement, then walked over by a griffon carrying the flag of Tarrin, and finally burned into ashes.\n\nThe Congresses later made the celebration annual, calling it "Vengeance Day". Corina was pleased and expressed her support for the decision, saying it would encourage patriotism among the citizenry."

 tarrin.22.d:0 "The so-called Sisterly Leader of Tarrin, Corina Trasviraire, has personally visited our country today and met with our head of state [ROOT.GetLeader]. During the meeting, she told of her dreams of a socialist Pan-Aquileian federal union, where the rights of all member states were fully guaranteed. This, she said, would permanently end the division of Aquileia which occurred after the revolution of 980. She suggested that our country join this federation with Tarrin, so the two nations be stronger together.\n\nOur leader was hesistant to accept this proposal immediately. She did not clarify the exact structure of this federation or who would lead it, leading to a fear that it'd be a federation dominated by Tarrin. Some advisors say that Corina is claiming her government to be the only legitimate Aquileian one, which contests the claims of others. However, she was right in saying that a united Aquileia is stronger than a divided one. In these uncertain times, security is what we need the most.\n\nAfter some pondering, [Root.GetLeader] finally decided how to respond to Corina Trasviraire."

 tarrin.25.d:0 "When the Sisterly Leader Corina Trasviraire arrived in the traditional capital of Aquileia, Aquila, she was accompanied by a grand entourage of soldiers and supporters. A parade was held to celebrate her arrival, with commoners cheering on the streets as Corina's armoured car made its way through the city, slowly driving towards the city center.\n\nAgainst all odds, her ambitions of creating a socialist Pan-Aquileian Federation led by her had come one step closer to being reality, as Aquileia had officially become part of the Federation. Alongside her however were Marshal Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne. Despite everything, she had never forgotten her friends, who had supported her in all her endeavours. Without them, she might have never succeeded at all. Of course, they did not agree with everything she did, but Meinard advocated her Pan-Aquileian dreams, while Leontina approved of her more militaristic tendencies.\n\nWhen she reached her destination, the city hall of Aquila, she came out of her car and walked up to a podium that had been prepared for her in advance. Thousands of griffons flocked to listen to her speech, filling up the plaza and the roofs and balconies of buildings as they flied up to them.\n"Brothers and sisters of Aquileia! Today is a momentous day that shall be forever remembered in the annals of history. For on this day, the re-unification of Aquileia and Tarrin under the red banner of socialism became a reality. However, even if I did everything I could to make this come true, I still needed the help of my two good friends, Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne."\nAs Corina mentioned their names and gestured towards them, both of them smiled in return.\n"Without their heroism, without their support, without their loyalty and dedication, I would not be standing here today. Therefore, let us three hurrahs: One for Aquileia, one for Tarrin, and one for these two heroes!"\n\nThe crowd obeyed Corina and soon loud hurrahs echoed in the plaza.

While it is true Tarrin had always been closely tied with Aquileia, whether it was a kingdom or a republic, three decades of fighting for independence all alone has created a strong sentiment of nationalism among the Tarrinians. If they were able to earn their freedom by themselves, what do they need Aquileia for?\n\nOf course, realistically speaking, being part of Aquileia would bring great security to Tarrin against external enemies. But would it guarantee Tarrin's liberty? Some of [Root.GetLeader] advisors proposed that autonomy should be demanded from Aquileia, or that the request for reunification must be denied outright. Such responses would be likely to spark hostility from Aquileia. Should Tarrin risk open war with a powerful country?\n\nIn the end, it was up to [Root.GetLeader] to make the final decision, and respond to the delegation's request."

On the paper was a signed agreement for Tarrin's reannexation into Aquileia proper, with all the necessary groundwork laid to smoothly reintegrate local administration. It is a great diplomatic victory, proving that the pen is mightier than the sword.\n\nHowever, there were some outbreaks of unrest in Tarrin when news of this spread, as local nationalists protested the act. It seems three decades of foreign occupation fostered a strong spirit of nationalism in Tarrin. However, with benevolent rule, it should die down over time, turning into healthy Aquileian patriotism."

However, it wasn't an agreement for reunification, but a petition from [From.GetLeader] for a guarantee of Tarrinian autonomy. If this request for self-governance would be granted for their young republic, then they would accept Aquileian sovereignty.\n\nWhile under Discret rule, Tarrin did have various degrees of autonomy over the centuries, what the Tarrinians are asking for now is not far from independence. Should such autonomy be granted to a strategically important border region? Some in the government even saw it as an insult, with Tarrinians denying the legitimacy of [Root.GetNameDef] and possibly inspiring separatism in other border regions with their boldness. Warhawks were already calling for Tarrin to be forcibly reannexed, to dissuade any separatist movements.\n\nThe Tarrinian request was understandable however, as three decades of foreign occupation had inspired strong nationalism in the area. If this compromise is not accepted, then Tarrinians may never fully accept Aquileian rule."

The delegation explained that the Tarrinians had refused to even negotiate about any kind of reunification and asserted their status as a sovereign, independent nation, completely free from both Aquileia and Francistria.\n\nThe response was met with outrage in the government. Tarrin had traditionally been part of Aquileia, so the Tarrinians desiring independence seemed absurd. This bold separatism could spark unrest in other border regions if it was not dealt with swiftly. Calls were made for a military intervention to dismantle the "rebels" of Tarrin. Some noted the irony of this, how Aquileia was becoming the new Francistria, but they could do little to silence the calls for war.\n\nThe Tarrinian response was understandable however, as three decades of foreign occupation had inspired strong nationalism in the area. If an invasion of Tarrin is launched, then Tarrinians may never fully accept Aquileian rule."

But the same cannot be said for our brothers and sisters in Aquileia. Their revolution failed, and the Discrets remain in power. We cannot simply stand and do nothing, as the Discrets are no friends of ours, and will undoubtedly threaten the nation. But some of you may ask, why should we help the Aquileians? They did not come to our aid when the Francistrians invaded. Well, it is simple: We must do better than them, otherwise we will regret our inaction, just like the Aquileians did. A great, final struggle is at claw against the forces of reaction, and I ask you, fellow citizens of the sovereign Republic of Tarrin, to stand by my side in my final crusade against evil. Because without you, I am nothing."\nThe audience immediately ruptured into cheering, with griffons raising their fists high in the air and shouting oaths of eternal loyalty to the Republic.

Thousands of griffons flocked to listen to his speech, filling up the plaza and the rooves and balconies of buildings as they flied up to them.\n"My fellow citizens! I stand here as the liberator of Aquileia from the tyranny of monarchism, but I do not stand alone. All who fought for the greater cause are liberators, all of them are heroes. Let us not forget this! The contribution of every single griffon was vital for our miraculous victory. Above all, I want to thank my good friends, Corina Trasviraire and Leontina Pandionne. We were able to accomplish this feat thanks to their most generous aid, and most admirable determination. Indeed, determination can overcome anything. Three times did the Discrets try to crush the revolution, but they never succeeded. That is because ideas can never die."\n"However, I am afraid the same is not true for us mere mortals. I am old now, having fought for the republican cause for over thirty years. As such, I consider my work to be finally done. I shall thereby retire to humble civilian life, allowing younger spirits to lead Aquileia and Tarrin to a new, brighter future. Thank you, my friends, and good bye."\nThere was deafening silence on the plaza. Griffons bowed in respect, taking off their hats, as Meinard exited the podium.

A group of armed militants have stormed government buildings in the capital and have taken hundreds of hostages. In addition, several border crossings in the west have been seized. While they could eventually be dealt with, this was followed by Aquileian soldiers crossing the border at the captured locations, pouring into the country en masse and catching defenders off guard. Within hours, the Republic's independence has once again been compromised by a surprise invasion. It seems [Root.GetLeader] did not learn their lesson in 980 and thus the revolution is crushed once more.\n\nYet hope will live on, as hope can never die."

This was granted to them, which allowed them to expand their operations and prepare for a coup against the illegitimate Republican government in Tarrin. Thankfully, the revolutionaries did not crack down on the underground movement, allowing them to operate mostly unmolested.\n\nNow the monarchists have launched a daring coup, seizing control of the capital of Tarrin as well as several border crossings. Aquileian detachments were already prepared in advance to cross the border and support the loyalist cause. Now, most of Tarrin has swiftly been secured, with thousands of republican rebels arrested. Unfortunately, some of them have fled into hiding or abroad. Nevertheless, Tarrin belongs once more to the Discrets."

 tarrin.36.d:0 ""Aquileians we are no longer, Francistrians we do not want to become, let us therefore be Tarrinian." Thus spoke Rambaut Boscaiga, a famed poet, during the Francistrian occupation. Leontina Pandionne heard the phrase when she was young and it has remained in her mind ever since. When she became President, it was no surprise she would do everything she could to foster the rebirth of Tarrinian culture. She contacted Boscaiga as well, now an old griffon, and expressed her admiration for the venerable poet.\n\nThe program of cultural revival was extensive. The school curriculum was renewed entirely, erasing traces of Aquileian and Francistrian rule and emphasising Tarrinian language, culture and history much more. Indeed, Tarrinian became the sole official language of the country, and soon officials across the land began dismanting road signs which were written in foreign language. Funding for culture expanded exponentially, with generous support for artists, musicians, actors and writers being provided as long as their works espoused patriotism. Old traditions and celebrations were reinstated, most notably the Festival of Cheese and Wine (it is pure coincidence that Francistrians have an identical celebration) which should motivate the revitalization of the Tarrinian cheesemaking tradition.\n\nLeontina's friends, Meinard Nocère and Corina Trasviraire, were concerned by the erasure of Aquileian culture. In their eyes, she was not removing something foreign, but rather eliminating a vital part of Tarrinian culture. But there was little they could do about the situation."

By decree, she ordered the army to forcefully evict any such griffons from their homes and take them to the border, where they could leave the country at once. All valuable property was rightfully seized so it could be given to proper citizens later.\n\nWord of the events spread quickly, and many civilians took part in the acts of expulsion. They believed Aquileians to be crypto-monarchists, especially after the vicious terror attacks of the Burgundy Order, while Francistrians and Wingbardians were universally hated as foreign imperialist oppressors. But without any oversight, there were many acts of violence and theft as Tarrinians lynched foreigners or took away all their belongings. The country was overtaken by a nationalist fervor, a burning desire to avenge all the mistreatment Tarrin had suffered.\n\nLeontina Pandionne eventually sent soldiers to stop the uncontrolled violence, but it was already too late. She was blamed for intentional inaction and accused of approving the violence. She retorted by admitting the accusers were right and saying that if they sympathised with the foreigners they could feel free to leave the country with them. Meinard Nocère, the national hero of Tarrin who was however born in Aquileia, urged her to calm down, expressed his disappointment and apologized to the evicted Aquileians on her behalf.

In 980, it had been burned to the ground by Francistrian invaders, but now it had been rebuilt with state funds, and attracted many visitors who were curious to see the President's home village. When Pandionne arrived with her two friends and a small escort, she was surprised to see that a statue depicting her had been erected in the center of the settlement. She could barely hold back tears as the villagers flocked around her, showering her in praise.\n\nThat wasn't the only time she almost cried. Afterwards she visited the local graveyard and showed the memorial dedicated to her parents. Both of them had perished defending the village when she was just a small chick. Meinard offered his condolences and Corina saluted the memorial, honouring the fallen heroes. Leontina did her best to not cry, but when Meinard embraced her, she broke out into tears.\n\nOn the way back home to the capital, both Meinard and Corina said they now understood why she loved her country so much, and why she did everything she could to make the spirits of her parents proud.

 pony_race_trait:0 "Pony"
 pony_race_trait_desc:0 "§LPonies are small, colourful and sapient equines. The term "pony" traditionally encompasses three subgroups which are the earth ponies, the pegasi and the unicorns. Earth ponies are characterized by their sturdier physique and affinity to agriculture. The pegasi are lighter than their cousins and have a pair of wings that allows them to fly, as well as a magical ability to manipulate weather. The unicorns have a distinctive horn on their forehead which allows them to practice all kinds of magic and use various spells. An extremely rare subgroup called the alicorns have features of all three: strong physique, wings and a magical horn. Finally, every pony has a cutie mark, a magical symbol upon their flanks that appears during the latter phase of their development. The cutie mark is a not well-understood phenomenon and illustrates a special talent or personality trait of the pony who bears it. It has therefore a significant cultural importance to many pony societies throughout the world. Ponies are almost exclusively herbivores.§!"
 unspecified_race_trait:0 "Mysterious Being"
 unspecified_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThere are no records of whatever this being represents.§!"
 thestral_race_trait:0 "Thestral"
 thestral_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThestrals or bat ponies are a subgroup of ponies identifiable by their leathery bat-like wings and sharp fangs. Due to centuries of separation, they are often considered a separate race, despite sharing much in common with other pony subgroups. Like ponies, their flanks have magical cutie marks. They have the ability to see in the dark but have no magical abilities beyond those of earth ponies and pegasi. While it is not an absolute rule, many thestrals behave as nocturnal creatures. They are sometimes called bats, even among themselves, though it is sometimes seen as derogatory compared to the more neutral term of thestral, and has historically been associated to the figure of Nightmare Moon, though the truth is much more complex. Bat ponies are primarily herbivorous but do occasionally eat meat.§!"
 zebra_race_trait:0 "Zebra"
 zebra_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThe Zebras are equids similar to earth ponies but recognizable by their striped black and white coat. Their flanks have a spiral symbol that resembles a pony's cutie mark but is identical on every zebra. Its meaning or purpose is unknown. Zebras do have limited magical abilities, which are mostly used for the brewing and use of potions as well as communion with supernatural spirits. Unlike their pony cousins, zebras tend to live in more arid or tropical climates, but like ponies, they are herbivorous.§!"
 penguin_race_trait:0 "Penguin"
 penguin_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThe penguins are a sapient species of small, bipedal, flightless and aquatic avians. They have a wide array of physical appearances as several types of penguins exist. Extremely proficient at swimming and incredibly resilient to the cold, they are very-well adapted to polar environments. Most penguins have no known innate magical abilities, but it is possible these abilities are merely dormant. They primarily consume marine animals and do not practice agriculture.§!"
 bear_race_trait:0 "Bear"
 bear_race_trait_desc:0 "§LBears are large mammalian creatures known for their large size, powerful claws and lush fur. They have no magical abilities to speak of. While they appear friendly and to some cuddly, they can have quite the temper and are among the most ferocious opponents one can find. Curiously, not all bears exhibit sapience and most are simply wild animals. However polar bears, a type of bear with white fur, are for the most part sapient creatures. Polar bears are mostly carnivorous, but other types of bears have more varied diets. And remember: only you can prevent forest fires.§!"
 changeling_race_trait:0 "Changeling"
 changeling_race_trait_desc:0 "§LChangelings are a sapient species of black pony-like insectoids. They have transparent insect wings on their back and thus are capable of flight. Their most recognizable feature is their magical ability to temporarily shift their form, voice and even size to a minor degree in near-instantaneous speed. They are also capable of magically draining the emotion of love felt by other species and to feed upon it. While they are able to survive without it, feeding on love allows them to feel and perform better and shapeshift for longer periods than they would otherwise. These abilities have gave them a rather sinister reputation among other species, particularly as many are willing to use aggressive means to obtain love. Contrary to popular belief, changelings do not just consume love but food as well, which is usually meat and sometimes plants.§!"
 griffon_race_trait:0 "Griffon"
 griffon_race_trait_desc:0 "§LGriffons are sapient creatures who are half avian and half feline. They are quadrupeds, with sharp talons on their front legs and paws on their rear legs. All griffons also have wings on their backs, which makes traversing across rough terrain easy for them. They are also known to be relatively strong creatures, but lack significant magical capabilities as they are only capable of enchantments and incantations. They are said to be a greedy and gold-obsessed species but this is just a lie invented by insolvent debtors. While biologically carnivorous, griffons do consume baked goods as part of their diet. They do not eat raw plants, however.§!"
 yak_race_trait:0 "Yak"
 yak_race_trait_desc:0 "§LYaks are large and sapient quadrupedal mammals, recognizable by their thick coat and large horns. They have extraordinary resilience to the cold and high altitudes, which combined with their surprising agility make them particularly adapted to mountainous environment. They have no magical abilities. Yaks tend to have short tempers and are easily insulted. A violent act known as "smashing" is a prominent feature of most yak cultures. They are herbivorous.§!"
 deer_race_trait:0 "Deer"
 deer_race_trait_desc:0 "§LDeer are relatively small and sapient quadrupedal mammals. They are recognizable by their large antlers and thick patches of fur around their necks. They have magical abilities which are linked to mystical connections to spirits, allowing them to perform limited divination of the future. Despite having no particular abilities in aquatic environments, the deer are renowned seafarers. They are herbivores who sometimes eat meat, especially fish.§!"
 diamond_dog_race_trait:0 "Diamond Dog"
 diamond_dog_race_trait_desc:0 "§LDiamond dogs are sapient canine creatures capable of bipedal movement, though they usually engage in knuckle-walking. They can see well in the dark and prefer to live underground. Thanks to their powerful digging paws, they are able to extract resources and dig tunnels with ease. They have no magical abilities whatsoever, but most diamond dog societies have a great expertise with the magical aspects of crystals. Diamond dogs have a mixed diet, and they are halfway between carnivores and omnivores.§!"
 minotaur_race_trait:0 "Minotaur"
 minotaur_race_trait_desc:0 "§LMinotaurs are sapient creatures who have the head and lower half of a bovine and the torso and arms of a primate. They are known to be strong but lack magical abilities, which they make up for with their dexterous multi-fingered appendages known as "hands". Unlike most other races, they are exclusively bipedal, which also makes them much taller. They like to build labyrinthine constructions. Despite having the head of a herbivorous animal, minotaurs are omnivores.§!"
 undead_race_trait:0 "Undead"
 undead_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThe undead are usually animated magical creatures, made from the remains of creatures infused with forbidden magic, and can therefore take a wide array of forms. However, other forms of unlife exist thanks to the twisted imagination of our world's necromancers, such as vampires, ghouls, liches and so on. They are practically immortal and are sustained entirely by magical energy.§!"
 buffalo_race_trait:0 "Buffalo"
 buffalo_race_trait_desc:0 "§LBuffalo are sapient quadrupedal mammals known for their very large size, sturdy bodies and horns. They are similar in appearance to yaks, but are very well-adapted to hot and arid environments instead of cold ones. Despite their large bodies, they are exceptionally fast and strong enough to withstand a direct frontal hit, making them able to effectively charge at any threat. They have no known magical abilities and eat a wide variety of plants.§!"
 dragon_race_trait:0 "Dragon"
 dragon_race_trait_desc:0 "§LDragons are colourful, sapient and winged lizards capable of breathing fire or frost. They vary dramatically in size depending on their age, with young adults being bipedal and similar in size to a griffon or pony, while the largest and oldest known dragons can be several stories high and quadrupedal. Dragons are a mostly solitary species and are often seen as dangerous and awe-inspiring by the other species who usually fear them. Dragons have magical abilities, consume gems and crystals to sustain themselves and are known to have a desire to gather "hoards" of precious goods, though it may simply be a romanticized interpretation of their physical need for precious stones as they are lithovores.§!"
 camel_race_trait:0 "Camel"
 camel_race_trait_desc:0 "§LCamels are hardy quadrupedal mammals who live in the most extreme of arid landscapes. The distinct humps on their backs are crucial to their ability to survive for long periods without food or water. As such, they have developed a history and tradition of nomadism, though many have become settled. They are thus often the only sapient creatures who can regularly and safely travel and live within the harshest deserts. They are primarily herbivorous, but can eat meat or even any material they can find if no plants are available.§!"
 cat_race_trait:0 "Abyssinian Cat"
 cat_race_trait_desc:0 "§LBipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Abyssinian cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and they are seen as lazy two-faced schemers. Like other cats, they are obligate carnivores and tend to avoid sweet food and milk.§!"
 centaur_race_trait:0 "Centaur"
 centaur_race_trait_desc:0 "§LAnatomically speaking, centaurs are strange creatures: their lower body is almost that of an enlarged pony, but their upper body is a peculiar mix of bovine and caprine, similar to that of a minotaur. Uniquely, they have six limbs: four legs and two arms. Bulging with red muscles, centaurs are renowned for their martial skill and athleticism. However, only very few centaurs are capable of using magical abilities. Historically tied with gargoyles, interspecies marriages between centaurs and gargoyles are commonplace. Both species have versatile hands and are also omnivores.§!"
 donkey_race_trait:0 "Donkey"
 donkey_race_trait_desc:0 "§LDonkeys are small quadrupedal equines, similar in size to ponies. They have less inherent magic than ponies, thus lacking cutie marks or magical abilities, but make up for it by being hardy, tough and resilient. They also have a reputation for generally being stubborn and pessimistic. Most donkeys live in northwest Zebrica, though a sizeable minority exists in Equestria. They are herbivores.§!"
 gargoyle_race_trait:0 "Gargoyle"
 gargoyle_race_trait_desc:0 "§LGargoyles are bipedal creatures with a fearsome appearance. They have thick manes and long tails similar to those of lions and large, leathery wings on their backs similar to those of thestrals. Gargoyles have a strong magical affinity with stone and mountains and are known to be excellent masons. Historically tied with centaurs, interspecies marriages between centaurs and gargoyles are commonplace. Both species have versatile hands and are also omnivores.§!"
 giraffe_race_trait:0 "Giraffe"
 giraffe_race_trait_desc:0 "§LTallest of all known sapient races, giraffes are quadrupedal ungulates with extremely long necks. Their coats have spotted patterns and their heads have horn-like ossicones. They have little affinity for magic and live exclusively in south-eastern Zebrica. They are herbivores. Above all, giraffes are heartless creatures.§!"
 hippogriff_race_trait:0 "Hippogriff"
 hippogriff_race_trait_desc:0 "§LHippogriffs are a quadrupedal race native to Mount Aris. They are similar to griffons, having the front half of an eagle, but are taller and have the rear half of an equine rather than a feline. Theories about hippogriffs being the offspring of horses and griffons have not been proven to be true. In addition, hippogriffs can use a shard from the magical Pearl of Transformation to change into seaponies, aquatic fish-like creatures. In both forms, they are primarily carnivorous and mostly eat fish.§!"
 horse_race_trait:0 "Horse"
 horse_race_trait_desc:0 "§LHorses are sometimes considered to be the same race as ponies, but there are several notable differences. Most obviously, horses are much larger in size than ponies and lack cutie marks. In addition, there are only two subgroups, earth horses and unicorns, with no equivalent to pegasi. Horses favour more arid environments, being able to thrive in harsher conditions than ponies. Like ponies, they are herbivores.§!"
 kirin_race_trait:0 "Kirin"
 kirin_race_trait_desc:0 "§LLike ponies, kirin are small equines. They have bushier manes that wrap around their neck, slightly longer ears, curved horns, scaly carapaces, thin tails, and tufted, cloven hooves. Unlike ponies, they have no subgroups and all kirin have magical horns. Due to their affinity to fire, kirin transform into flaming creatures known as nirik when they lose their temper. They are also omnivorous.§!"
 llama_race_trait:0 "Llama"
 llama_race_trait_desc:0 "§LThere are two races inhabiting the Andelayan mountains known as llamas and alpacas. Due to them being very similar to one another, they are often considered to be the same race, though alpacas are generally smaller. Both are quadrupedal camelid creatures with long necks and thick, white wool that keeps them warm in the cold. Their bodies are adapted to high altitudes and they are expert climbers. Both are known to be fond of spitting on each other and are herbivores.§!"
 harpy_race_trait:0 "Harpy"
 harpy_race_trait_desc:0 "§LHarpies are bipedal avian creatures, similar in appearance to wild tropical birds. Like griffons and hippogriffs, they use claws for grasping, but are unable to fly due to vestigial wings. As such, they have developed an affinity for the sea rather than the sky, and are known to be expert sailors. While preferring plant food, harpies do sometimes eat meat.§!"
 yeti_race_trait:0 "Yeti"
 yeti_race_trait_desc:0 "§LYeti are bipedal mammalian creatures covered in thick, white fur, which allows them to survive in cold temperatures. They are divided into two subgroups: "true" yetis and storm creatures. The former are very tall, while the latter are short and hunchbacked. Storm creatures are practically an eccentric warrior caste who do not speak and wear masks on their faces. Both types of yetis have bulky bodies, hands with three large fingers and sharp fangs, but there are some differences as well: "true" yetis have cloven hooves, while storm creatures have paws and tails. They are generally a highly territorial and violent race, prone to infighting without a strong leader. They have no known magical abilities and are omnivorous. Contrary to popular belief, "true" yetis do not have natural horns. The misconception comes from the Storm King's infamous Horned Crown.§!"
 zony_race_trait:0 "Zony"
 zony_race_trait_desc:0 "§LAs their name would suggest, a zony is a cross between a zebra and a pony. Thanks to the relative similarity of these two equine races, a zony may inherit features from both ends of the available genetic spectrum: As one example, many have the distinct colours of ponies and the stripes of zebras combined. Zony offspring produced by a pegasus or a unicorn parent do not have horns or wings, unlike thestral-zebra hybrids who can have the latter.§!"
 human_race_trait:0 "Human"
 human_race_trait_desc:0 "§LHumans are bipedal monkeys. Frankly, they are really smelly.§!"

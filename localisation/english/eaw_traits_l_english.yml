 pony_race_trait:0 "Pony"
 pony_race_trait_desc:0 "Ponies are small, colourful and sapient equines. The term "pony" traditionally encompasses three subgroups which are the earth ponies, the pegasi and the unicorns. Earth ponies are characterized by their sturdier physique. The pegasi are somewhat lighter than their earthbound cousins and have a pair of wings that allows them to fly. The unicorns are also lighter but have a distinctive horn on their forehead which allows them to practice magic and use spells. An extremely rare subgroup called the Alicorns have features of all three: strong physique, wings and a magical horn. Finally, every pony has a cutie mark, a magical symbol upon their flanks that appears during the latter phase of their development. The cutie mark is a not well-understood phenomenon and illustrates a special talent or personality trait of the pony who bears it. It has therefore a significant cultural importance to many pony societies throughout the world."

 thestral_race_trait:0 "Thestral"
 thestral_race_trait_desc:0 "Thestrals or batponies are a subgroup of ponies identifiable by their leathery bat-like wings and sharp fangs. Due to centuries of separation, they are often considered a separate race, despite sharing much in common with other pony subgroups. Like ponies, their flanks have a magical cutie mark. They have the ability to see in the dark but have no magical abilities beyond those of earth ponies and pegasi. While it is not an absolute rule, many thestrals behave as nocturnal creatures. They are sometimes called bats, even among themselves though it is sometimes seen as derogatory compared to the more neutral term of thestral, and has historically been associated to the figure of Nightmare Moon, though the truth is much more complex."
 zebra_race_trait:0 "Zebra"
 zebra_race_trait_desc:0 "The Zebras are equids similar to earth ponies but recognizable by their striped black and white coat. Their flanks bear cutie marks, albeit they are far more abstract in appearance than those of ponies. They have magical abilities but most of their magical practices involve the craft and use of potions and communion with spirits. Unlike their pony cousins, zebras tend to live in more arid climates."
 penguin_race_trait:0 "Penguin"
 penguin_race_trait_desc:0 "The Penguins are a sapient species of small, bipedal, flightless and aquatic avians. They have a wide array of physical appearances as several types of penguins exist. Extremely able at swimming and incredibly resilient to the cold, they are very-well adapted to cold and polar environments. Most penguins have no known innate magical abilities but are capable of wielding magical items."
 bear_race_trait:0 "Bear"
 bear_race_trait_desc:0 "Bears are large mammalian creatures known for their large size, powerful claws and lush fur. They have no magical abilities to speak of. While they appear friendly and to some cuddly, they can have quite the temper and are among the most ferocious opponents one can find. Curiously, not all bears exhibit sapience and most are simply wild animals. However polar bears, a type of bear with white fur, are for the most part sapient creatures. And remember: only you can prevent forest fires."
 changeling_race_trait:0 "Changeling"
 changeling_race_trait_desc:0 "Changelings are a sapient species of pony-like insectoids. They have transparent insect wings on their back and thus are capable of flight. Their most recognizable feature is their magical ability to shift their form, voice and even size to a minor degree in near-instantaneous speed. They are also capable of magically draining the emotion of love felt by other species and to feed upon it. While they are able to survive without it, feeding on love allows them to feel and perform better and shapeshift for longer periods than they would otherwise. These abilities have gave them a rather sinister reputation among other species, particularly as many are willing to use aggressive means to obtain love."
 griffon_race_trait:0 "Griffon"
 griffon_race_trait_desc:0 "Griffons are sapient creatures who are half avian and half feline. They have six limbs: two avian-like arms with claws, two feline-like back legs with paws and two feathered wings on their back. Thanks to their wings they are able to fly, which makes traversing rough terrain easy for them. They are also known to be relatively strong creatures but lack significant magical capabilities as they are only capable of enchantments and incantations. They are said to be a greedy and gold-obsessed species but this is just a lie invented by insolvent debtors."
 yak_race_trait:0 "Yak"
 yak_race_trait_desc:0 "Yaks are large sapient quadrupedal mammals, recognizable by their thick coat and large horns. They have extraordinary resilience to the cold and high altitudes, which combined with their surprising agility make them particularly adapted to mountainous environment. They have no magical abilities. Yaks tend to have short tempers and are easily insulted. A violent act known as "smashing" is a prominent feature of most yak cultures."
 deer_race_trait:0 "Deer"
 deer_race_trait_desc:0 "Deer are relatively small sapient quadrupedal mammals. They are recognizable by their large antlers and thick patches of fur around their necks.

Despite having no particular abilities in aquatic environments, the deer are renowned seafarers."
 diamond_dog_race_trait:0 "Diamond Dog"
 diamond_dog_race_trait_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs are sapient canine creatures capable of bipedal movement. They can see well in the dark and prefer to live underground. Thanks to their powerful digging claws, they are able to extract resources and dig tunnels with ease. They have no magical abilities whatsoever, but most dog societies have a great expertise with the mundane aspects of crystals."
 minotaur_race_trait:0 "Minotaur"
 minotaur_race_trait_desc:0 "Minotaurs are sapient creatures who have the head and lower half of a bovine and the torso and arms of a primate. They are known to be strong but lack magical abilities, which they make up for with their dexterous multi-fingered appendages known as "hands". Unlike most other sentient races, they are exclusively bipedal, which also makes them much taller."
 undead_race_trait:0 "Undead"
 undead_race_trait_desc:0 "The undead are usually animated magical creatures, made from the remains of creatures infused with forbidden magic, and can therefore take a wide array of forms. However, other forms of unlife exist thanks to the twisted imagination of our world's necromancers, such as vampires, ghouls, liches and so on."
 buffalo_race_trait:0 "Buffalo"
 buffalo_race_trait_desc:0 "Buffalo are sapient quadrupedal mammals known for their very large size, sturdy bodies and horns. They are similar in appearance to yaks, but are very well-adapted to hot and arid environments instead of cold environments. Despite their large bodies, they are exceptionally fast and strong enough to withstand a direct frontal hit, making them able to effectively charge at any threat. They have no known magical abilities."
 dragon_race_trait:0 "Dragon"
 dragon_race_trait_desc:0 "Dragons are colourful, sapient, fire-breathing winged lizards. They vary dramatically in size depending on their age, with young adults being similar in size to a griffon or pony. The largest and oldest known dragons can be several stories high. Dragons are a mostly solitary species and are often seen as dangerous and awe-inspiring by the other species who usually fear them. Dragons have magical abilities, consume crystals to sustain themselves and are known to have a nearly physical need to gather "hoards" of precious goods though it may simply be a romanticized interpretation of their physical need of crystals to live."
 human_race_trait:0 "Human"
 human_race_trait_desc:0 "Humans are bipedal monkeys. Frankly, they are really smelly."

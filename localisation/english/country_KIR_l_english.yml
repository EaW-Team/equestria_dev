### National Focuses ####

## Three and a Half Year Plan ##
KIR_focus_1:0 "In the Vermilion Realm"
KIR_focus_1_desc:0 "With the ratification of the Hyacinth Accord and the departure of the Equestrian delegation, it is time for the Matriarch Superior to bring The Silence to an end in earnest and allow her realm to focus on modernization and rejoining the global community. A grand assembly of the brightest minds both within and without Kiria will serve as the basis upon which to begin our modernization efforts."
KIR_focus_2a:0 "Welcome the Delegates"
KIR_focus_2a_desc:0 "Delegates from across the Realm are arriving in Vermilion on a daily basis, bringing with them their own experiences and ideas on how to propel Kiria into the modern era in just a few short years. Many more come from beyond its borders, educated in foreign nations and exposed to their culture. All of their ideas will be useful in rewriting Kiria's future and starting a new chapter for the nation."
KIR_focus_2b:0 "Dispatch the Envoys"
KIR_focus_2b_desc:0 "While those living in Vermilion learned almost immediately that the imperial decrees that created The Silence have been repealed, there are countless thousands of kirin living in rural villages who are still unaware that their fortunes are soon to change for the better. Imperial heralds shall venture forth throughout the Realm and find every last village to share the Matriarch's good news."
KIR_focus_3a:0 "An Industrial Convocation"
KIR_focus_3a_desc:0 "If the Realm is to leap frog over a hundred years of missed progress and modernization, then it will need kirin educated and trained abroad to make it happen. Fickle Current will use his literati ties to the kirin diaspora to bring many of the kirin species' best and brightest minds home to help modernize the nation."
KIR_focus_3b:0 "The 3½ Year Plan"
KIR_focus_3b_desc:0 "The rapid modernization of Kiria will be a chaotic process that can only be sustained for so long. The Matriarch has proclaimed 'The Grand Gallop Onward', aiming to fast-track a century's worth of lost progress in three and a half years. The Plenum will have to deftly manage the tumultuous transformation of Kirin society and culture, if Kiria is to emerge intact from this rough and hasty metamorphosis."
KIR_focus_3d:0 "The Reform Bureau"
KIR_focus_3d_desc:0 "The Reform Bureau is a centralized executive body created for the All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival and granted a limited amount of imperial mandate by the Matriarch herself. It serves as the central governing body of the rapidly changing Realm, and it is here that the final drafts of bills are hammered out before being presented to the Matriarch Superior."
KIR_focus_3e:0 "Reestablish Rulership"
KIR_focus_3e_desc:0 "Over the course of The Silence's century-long stranglehold on the Realm of Kiria, the absolute authority of the Dynasty waned throughout the countryside as contact with Vermilion ceased to exist. A fresh round of imperial decrees and a reassertation of Matriarch Rain Shine's divine authority will begin to reassert her authority over the Realm, though some might chafe under our resumed governance."
KIR_focus_4a:0 "Call Upon the Diaspora"
KIR_focus_4a_desc:0 "From the very beginning of The Silence, some of our most talented and educated kirin fled the Realm to look for a better life elsewhere in the world. For a century, those kirin and their descendents have flourished abroad, gaining skills, knowledge, and capital that they could not gain here at home. We must bring them back to Kiria and ask them to help contribute to the modernization of our nation."
KIR_focus_4e:0 "In the Vermilion Court"
KIR_focus_4e_desc:0 "The delegates at the Plenum have begun to coalesce into different factions with their own ideas for how the modernization of Kiria should look, far from the heterogenous mixture of ideas and experiences that our Matriarch originally hoped for. But even still, the three parties that have formed at the Plenum do not represent the voices of all of her subjects..."
KIR_focus_4f:0 "The Office of Transmission"
KIR_focus_4f_desc:0 "Understanding the impossibility of having every kirin in the Realm venture to Vermilion to share their ideas and complaints with the Matriarch Superior, Matriarch Rain Shine has decreed that the Office of Transmission be established to receive letters and appeals from her subjects and bring them to her immediate attention, so that they may be discussed during gatherings of the Plenum."
KIR_focus_6b:0 "Resettle Kirin Returnees"
KIR_focus_6b_desc:0 "As the diaspora returns home, these long lost sons and daughters of Kiria need a place to live. Thankfully, Kiria is a vast realm full of land, and most of its towns and cities are underpopulated, meaning it will be easy to find homes for them all. This has the added benefit of boosting the average literacy rates in our population centers, even if it comes with a wide variety of potentially subversive foreign ideas."
KIR_focus_6c:0 "The Council of the Verdigris Rotunda"
KIR_focus_6c_desc:0 "The Morning Secretariat has long served as the Matriarch Superior's counciling body, offering advice and interpretations of Concord's will to the Matriarch to inform her rule. Since its conception, it has been entirely populated by priests and mystics from The Way of Fire, whose concerns are often more spirtual than temporal. A new Morning Secretariat must be appointed to guide Kiria in a new era."
KIR_focus_7b:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
KIR_focus_7b_desc:0 "Kiria's first modern university, the All-Kiria Collegium will train the next generation of native kirin intellectuals, with the assistance of professors and scholars educated in foreign lands such as Equestria and Yale. However, with new ideas come new dangerous thoughts. Will we let our professors teach freely, or should they be monitored by the Reform Bureau to weed out radical thought?"
KIR_focus_8a:0 "Industrialise the Breadbasket"
KIR_focus_8a_desc:0 "The farmland between the branches of the Great Mellifluve River is the most fertile in the land. With the benefits of modern farming techniques and tools, it alone could produce enough food to feed every kirin in the nation three square meals a day. Investment in the breadbasket will strengthen the nation as a whole for years to come, and ensure that no kirin goes hungry ever again."
KIR_focus_4c:0 "The Road to Vermilion"
KIR_focus_4c_desc:0 "The roads that once connected Vermilion with the rest of Concord's realm have long since been overgrown, owing to their disuse during The Silence. Using priests to recruit local laborers to the cause, clearing and reestablishing these roads will be crucial to once more unifying the realm under Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's rule."
KIR_focus_5b:0 "Scholar-Monk Travelling Syndicates"
KIR_focus_5b_desc:0 "Monks and priests have long been the preeminent backbone of Kiria's education system, traveling across the land to spread their teachings of The Way of Fire with the common kirin, and training those who enter their order to read and write. By recruiting these traveling syndicates to educate the populace, we can make bold steps in combating illiteracy throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_5d:0 "The Laws of the Realm"
KIR_focus_5d_desc:0 "While we have moved to enact new laws and decrees to improve the standing of the realm, there are still many harsh laws that exist from The Silence. One such law makes the transformation into the nirik state a capital offense punishable by death. Though loosely enforced throughout The Silence, a debate rages on the necessity of this law as the realm modernizes at a rate never seen before."
KIR_focus_7a:0 "The Role of the Way of Fire vis-à-vis the State"
KIR_focus_7a_desc:0 "Since the creation of the Vermilion Realm, the nation has been ruled as a theocracy, with The Way of Fire and Concord's teachings inextricably entwined with every facet of governance and daily life. But now a proposal is crossing the Plenum floor to extricate the inextricable. Is it possible to partially secularize this centuries-old theocracy, or is the mere suggestion of that possibility nothing but heresy?"
KIR_focus_7f:0 "The Role of the Matriarch Superior"
KIR_focus_7f_desc:0 "The position of the Matriarch Superior is one of unlimited divine authority bestowed on the Matriarch by Concord herself. Her powers are broad and poorly defined, and any decree she issues is to be considered law as soon as it is proclaimed. Such archaic methods of governance have no place in a modern nation, and so it is time to codify the powers of the Matriarch Superior and her government."
KIR_focus_8e:0 "Restoring the Bureaucracy"
KIR_focus_8e_desc:0 "Following the imposition of The Silence, the system of bureacrats and administrators that allowed the nation to function as a cohesive whole has since collapsed. It is time to appoint new advisors, governors, and administrators to once more take control of the Realm, bringing the various local administrations back under the Matriarch's control and restarting the economy."
KIR_focus_4d:0 "Technological Imports"
KIR_focus_4d_desc:0 "If we are to advance as a nation, we cannot afford to waste time rediscovering technologies that have long since been perfected in foreign lands. By asking the returning kirin literati for help in supplying the nation with copies and examples of state of the art technology, we can reverse-engineer our own designs and rapidly scale up our industrial capabilities in a very short timeframe."
KIR_focus_5h:0 "Land Repossessions"
KIR_focus_5h_desc:0 "Much of the Realm's land falls into one of two categories: unpopulated bastions of nature, or sprawling subsistence farms. By concentrating our efforts on reorganizing our farmland and making in-roads into untapped nature reserves, we can greatly expand the amount of available land we have for building projects, allowing us to increase the density of our growing industrial base."
KIR_focus_5a:0 "Geological Surveys"
KIR_focus_5a_desc:0 "Kiria is full of untapped potential when it comes to our resources. What we produce today only scratches the surface of the Realm's potential. We know that our hills are full of natural resources that have yet to be properly exploited by industrial excavation operations. All we have to do is fund geological surveys to find the best deposits and encourage excavation companies to dig them up."
KIR_focus_5c:0 "The "Three Strengths" Campaign"
KIR_focus_5c_desc:0 "The modernization efforts of the Plenum have long been championed by the 'Three Strengths' campaign, which promotes Harmony, Heritage, and Homeland as its three most important values. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that each strength has been taken up by a different clique as their championing point. One of these cliques will naturally resonate more with the kirin people than the others."
KIR_focus_6h:0 "Northern Industry"
KIR_focus_6h_desc:0 "Fragrance and Rhapsody were two important bastions of modernization before The Silence, and both cities resisted its imposition to various extents, planting the seeds for future modernization efforts. Now, they will be some of the first cities to benefit from the resurgence of modernization, and are already constructing massive industrial complexes to capitalize on this change."
KIR_focus_6a:0 "Agrarian Consolidation"
KIR_focus_6a_desc:0 "As kirin moved out of the cities at the beginning of The Silence, they set up subsistence farms across the countryside wherever they could find land. Most of these farms are small and poorly managed, reliant wholly on manual labor to grow any crops. Consolidating clusters of these farms under one manager and bringing in modern farming equipment will increase their productivity and free up valuable land."
KIR_focus_7c:0 "The Riverine Economy"
KIR_focus_7c_desc:0 "The Great Mellifluve is the lifeblood of central Kiria, its vast waterways connecting distant towns and cities while providing fertile ground for farmland in between. Investing in the local economy that has grown around the river will make a strength of our nation that much stronger, allowing us to create a booming business growth in our heartlands that fuels growth throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_8b:0 "Open Up the Ports"
KIR_focus_8b_desc:0 "The port of Fragrance was once the most important port in all of Kiria, connecting our nation with traders from as far away as Griffonia. Fragrance's port was shut down when The Silence began, and its harbors have fallen into decay. With enough investment, however, we can return Fragrance to its former glory, and Fragrance can once again connect us to the rest of the world."
KIR_focus_9b:0 "Riches of the Mellifluve"
KIR_focus_9b_desc:0 "The far branches of the Mellifluve once carried their exports all the way down its waters to the city of Verdant, where they were organized and recorded before being launched to the rest of the Realm as valuable products or to the world as trade goods. The towns along these branches have long since withered with the collapse of the economy, and need our help to become prosperous once more."
KIR_focus_10a:0 "Urban-Led Modernisation"
KIR_focus_10a_desc:0 "Modernisation, as has been seen time and time again, starts in the cities and trickles down to the countryside. Though our urban centers declined during The Silence, we can rebuild them with new infrastructure that can support the modernisation of the realm. This will have the side effect of allowing us to draw more kirin into our cities, bringing them to whole new levels of productivity."
KIR_focus_8g:0 "Verdant Manufactories"
KIR_focus_8g_desc:0 "The city of Verdant is proving to be a fertile ground for the growth of modernisation in the realm. With an abundance of labor and room to expand, the working class in Verdant is growing faster than perhaps anywhere else in Kiria. But with all this new labor comes the spread of new and radical ideas, and the workers that build factories today may get ideas about taking them back tomorrow..."
KIR_focus_9a:0 "The Trans-Kiria Railway"
KIR_focus_9a_desc:0 "If Kiria is to become united and modern, then a way of bringing people and goods from one side of the nation to the other is absolutely essential. While the Great Mellifluve has long served as a crucial highway for our realm, it cannot reach everywhere. The construction of modern and standardized railways throughout the realm will bring our people together like never before."
KIR_focus_9c:0 "Kiria on the World Stage"
KIR_focus_9c_desc:0 "We have come far in our reforms, and the world is beginning to take notice. It is time that we invite delegations from all across the world to Vermilion to witness not only our traditional culture, but the advances we have made. This isn't all fun and games however; Kiria needs help to move into the modern era, and making a good impression on our foreign peers will make them more likely to lend us aid."
KIR_focus_11a:0 "Breakneck Industrialisation"
KIR_focus_11a_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization of our Realm, at a rate never seen anywhere else in the world, has come with its own host of challenges. One of the most critical of these is the need for skilled and unskilled labor, and we have gone to great lengths to attain workers for our modern society. But bringing so many kirin to one place to work for the gears of capitalism comes the risk of radical leftist ideas spreading around..."
KIR_focus_4b:0 "The Autumnal Premiership"
KIR_focus_4b_desc:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze is a young kirin left in charge of the greatest undertaking in kirin history, with consequences that will shape our history for decades to come. It is a lot of responsibility for one mare to shoulder, but she is determined to shoulder it, and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has entrusted in her almost unlimited authority to choose the path of the nation's modernisation."
KIR_focus_5e:0 "The Charter of Rights"
KIR_focus_5e_desc:0 "As we move away from the society of our past to the society of a modern age, we have the opportunity to learn from the struggles of other nations. Industrialization was often brutal on the laborers that fueled it, and protections for these workers only came after they were forced to endure unimaginable suffering. Let us guarantee protections for our workers so they do not have to needlessly suffer as well."
KIR_focus_6d:0 "Repeal the Quiescence"
KIR_focus_6d_desc:0 "The Quiescence was a series of decrees that went along with The Silence that banned the study of science, religion, philosophy, and many other forms of education in the realm. As a result, our society has stagnated, and much of the populace is illiterate. If we wish to educate a new generation of kirin, the Quiescence must be repealed in its entirety."
KIR_focus_8f:0 "An Imperial Constitution"
KIR_focus_8f_desc:0 "It is time to draft a constitution that will lay out the powers and privileges of each branch of our new government. The authority of the Matriarch Superior will be defined, and the responsibilities of the Morning Secretariat clearly laid out. However, the Realm lacks a modern judicial system, and it is up to the Premier to come up with a proposal for one that will best serve the interests of the Realm."
KIR_focus_3c:0 "Reassemble the Banners"
KIR_focus_3c_desc:0 "Kiria once possessed an impressive military supported by the Banner System, where each city contributed soldiers to a local Banner that could be rallied and commanded at the Matriarch's discretion. These soldiers would then be given land following their service, creating an entire class of proud soldier-citizens. It is time to rally these soldiers once more to face the threats of the modern era."
KIR_focus_4g:0 "Recommission the Rhapsody Arsenal"
KIR_focus_4g_desc:0 "The Rhapsody Arsenal was once the forefront of kirin weapons invention, and gained fame across eastern Zebrica for the quality of the cannons they manufactured. But for a century now, the arsenal has been closed and abandoned. It is time to reopen the Rhapsody Arsenal and combine the inventions of the modern era with the ingenuity of the kirin that once made it so renowned."
KIR_focus_5g:0 "Recall, Rearm, Regroup"
KIR_focus_5g_desc:0 "Reassembling the Banners was a start, but there are currently too few kirin who have answered the call to form a functional modern military. We must start by organizing a limited conscription and drafting peasants and commoners to create regional militias that, with proper training, may one day join the Banners and provide the backbone for our modern army."
KIR_focus_5f:0 "The New Standard Army"
KIR_focus_5f_desc:0 "It is difficult to create a modern army from scratch, but we will have to try regardless. Standardizing army doctrine and training regimens, laying out the benefits and terms of service, and acquiring foreign weapons and surplus equipment will go a long way in providing the basis to build the New Standard Army upon."
KIR_focus_6e:0 "Found the Motor Bureau"
KIR_focus_6e_desc:0 "The days of marching an army from one end of the nation to the other is over. A truly modern army is able to move its troops to where they need to go using motorized equipment. Fickle Current has offered to use his funds to procure Griffonian trucks and establish a motor bureau that will aid in researching and producing trucks to allow our army to motorize."
KIR_focus_7d:0 "Doctrinal Modernisation"
KIR_focus_7d_desc:0 "Modern wars are not fought with infantry formations, pitched battles, and sheer force of will. Modern wars are won by well-planned and coordinated actions defined by a military's doctrine that dictates how the army should act. Developing our own land doctrines will be useful for modernising our army and giving it the ability to fight effectively in the field."
KIR_focus_6f:0 "Kirin Rifle Designs"
KIR_focus_6f_desc:0 "Our species is blessed by Concord in that every individual can use basic telekinesis to manipulate objects and hold weapons. We can use this gift that we have been blessed with to create weapons ideal for our species that only we can use, rather than relying on the designs of other nations. If we want to create a functional modern army, then we need guns made here at home, and we need a lot of them."
KIR_focus_8c:0 "The Massicot War School"
KIR_focus_8c_desc:0 "The training grounds of Massicot once were the pride of our army, where thousands of soldiers could be trained in the art of war. The War School has been closed for a century now, and no new students have passed through its doors. To rebuild our army, we must reopen the school and begin training the next generation of soldiers."
KIR_focus_7e:0 "Vanguards of a New Age"
KIR_focus_7e_desc:0 "The kirin vanguards have long been the best of our best soldiers. Lightly armed and armored, they fought as deadly skirmishers at the front of our armies, whittling the enemy down and threatening their flanks while the main host moved in to engage. But in the age of gunpowder and mechanized warfare, we need to adapt our vanguards to incorporate modern hit and run tactics into their arsenal."
KIR_focus_8d:0 "Seafarer Marines"
KIR_focus_8d_desc:0 "The Sycee Trading House has long employed seafarer marines in Griffonia to protect its ships from pirate attack when moving valuable goods along the high seas. These marines are largely members of the diaspora, and would be better served protecting their homeland rather than business interests. We will negotiate the assimilation of Sycee's seafarer marines into our Banners to bolster our army's capabilities."
KIR_focus_9e:0 "Through Flame and Fury"
KIR_focus_9e_desc:0 "The Vermilion Banners were once the most feared and professional fighting force in eastern Zebrica, but The Silence has allowed it to decay into a shell of its former self. If we are to complete the rebuilding of our magnificent army, then we must encourage the bravery of our soldiers in the field and the innovation of our philosophers behind it."
KIR_focus_9d:0 "The Experimental Armored Corps"
KIR_focus_9d_desc:0 "The modern battlefield heavily features the use of bulletproof armored vehicles, which can create an unstoppable spearhead at the front of an offensive, or deliver a decisive counterattack to an enemy breakthrough. While we currently lack the industry to create state-of-the-art tanks, we can invest in light armored vehicles as a stopgap until our industrial capabilities expand further."
KIR_focus_4h:0 "A Vermilion Armada"
KIR_focus_4h_desc:0 "Our once proud navy was mothballed, and later scuttled, as a result of The Silence. We control a large swath of coastline in eastern Zebrica, yet we have no navy to patrol it. It is critical that we begin to build and assemble a modern navy to keep our coastlines safe and allow us to project our force over the waves that we rightfully rule."
KIR_focus_6g:0 "Develop the Eastern Seaboard"
KIR_focus_6g_desc:0 "The kirin living on our seaboards were almost entirely reliant on fishing to survive throughout The Silence; as a result, the eastern seaboard in particular is woefully underdeveloped. We can make use of these scattered fishing villages to cobble together local workforces for new dockyards and shipyards along the coast that will boost our naval production and economy."
KIR_focus_7g:0 "The Fragrant Flotilla"
KIR_focus_7g_desc:0 "Sitting at the bottom of the Fragrant harbor are three old warships, once the most modern ships in the Realm, but scuttled during a sailor mutiny in the city during The Silence. They have been underwater for decades now, but expeditions have confirmed that they are still in decent condition. Raising these three ships and retrofitting them will allow us to field three outdated but formidable ships in our new navy."
KIR_focus_9f:0 "Purchase Equestrian Naval Blueprints"
KIR_focus_9f_desc:0 "We do not have time to develop modern naval ships from scratch, but we do have friends who are already at the forefront of naval thought. We will benefit from our close ties to Equestria to acquire modern blueprints for ships, weapons, fire control systems, and more that will allow us to begin to construct a modern navy."
KIR_focus_10b:0 "Reclaim Auburn Isle"
KIR_focus_10b_desc:0 "The pirates of Nacre on Auburn Isle have long been a nuisance to the Realm. Their constant raids along our coastline have destablized us for too long, and their punishment is overdue. We will sail forth with our new navy and our modern army and put an end to the pirate menace in Nacre!"

KIR_ARMY_0:0 "The New Kirian Army"
KIR_ARMY_0_desc:0 "The initial reforms have been remarkably successful in bringing our old Banners from obscurity caused by The Silence, and slowly turning them into a modern army. However, there is a lot of room for improvement, if we want Kiria to truly be a respectable military power once again, able to protect its kirins from the dangers from beyond."
KIR_ARMY_0_tt:0 "\nGains Dynamic Modifier: §YThe Vermilion and Kirian Army§!, which grants dynamic bonuses to §YLand Combat§!, §YAir§!, §YNaval§!, and §YMilitary§! Modifiers."
KIR_OFFICER_1:0 "New Army General Staff"
KIR_OFFICER_1_desc:0 "After The Silence, Kiria lacked experienced officers and general staff, with their only experience being quelling rare revolts against the matriarch’s decrees. This is beginning to change but our General Staff still requires some reforms, if we are to make Kiria’s army a truly modern and competent one."
KIR_OFFICER_2:0 "Bannerkirin to Cadres"
KIR_OFFICER_2_desc:0 "Banners have been the backbone of the Kirian army for centuries, but while the system has served us well so far, it is not without its flaws. We need to start reforming the bannerkirin into a proper professional army. Their experience, combined with a more modern conscription system, will allow our army to be a force to be reckoned with."
KIR_GUERILLA_1:0 "Soldiers of the Land"
KIR_GUERILLA_1_desc:0 "We cannot expect Kiria to forever be safe from other powers in the world. Sooner or later, we’ll have to defend ourselves. We must ensure it is as difficult as possible for our enemies, by teaching our soldiers guerrilla tactics and using our homeland to our advantage."
KIR_GUERILLA_2:0 "The Partisan Anvil"
KIR_GUERILLA_2_desc:0 "An enemy invasion may penetrate deep into the Realm before a counteroffensive can be marshalled. Until then, our stay-behind forces will delay the invaders as much as possible. Once the tide of battle turns, the guerillas will pivot to preventing the invaders' retreat, entrapping them so that they may be smashed on the partisan anvil by the hammer of our counterattacking armies."
KIR_FORCES_1:0 "Kirian Esprit de Corps"
KIR_FORCES_1_desc:0 "Our special forces can tip the scales in our favour during the war. If we keep their morale high, they’ll be able to perform to their best capability, therefore we need to ensure they are always satisfied with their work and ready to fight for Kiria."
KIR_FORCES_2:0 "Left-Behind Snipers"
KIR_FORCES_2_desc:0 "Even if our enemies manage to penetrate into our land, we can use small marksmare brigades, left behind the enemy lines on the occupied territories. They would ensure that the enemy can’t hold on to the occupied land so easily, and show the conquered kirins that there is still hope."
KIR_FORCES_3:0 "Designated Marksmares"
KIR_FORCES_3_desc:0 "Trained snipers can be incredibly beneficial for our armies, able to spot enemies and attack them from great distances, giving our soldiers room to breathe. By training marksmares and incorporating them into our divisions, we will gain a significant edge in battle."

KIR_FORCES_4:0 "The Alpine Corps"
KIR_FORCES_4_desc:0 "Around Vermilion, and on our borders with the deer and llamas in the north, Kiria is covered in steep mountains. While they are already irreplaceable for defensive purposes, trained mountaineer corps could also use them to our advantage for daring attacks. Unlike our enemies, we know these mountains, and it’s time to make use of it."
KIR_MELEE:0 "Traditional Swordsmareship"
KIR_MELEE_desc:0 "Though melee weaponry in most nations was mostly replaced with rifles decades ago, and even Kiria starts to embrace this change, our vanguards are one of the best swordsmares in the entire world. Instead of abandoning this tradition, we should teach the vanguards how to incorporate their weapons in the hit-and-run tactics."
KIR_VANGUARD:0 "The Vanguard Elite"
KIR_VANGUARD_desc:0 "The vanguards were and still are the fastest, deadliest, and most well-trained soldiers in our army. We need to make sure of their centuries of experience and tradition, in order to provide significant support for our regular army. We’ll train them to be deadly units, adapted to modernity, yet still representing Kirian traditions."
KIR_PARAS:0 "The Parachute Rangers"
KIR_PARAS_desc:0 "The advent of aviation gave us access to many new tactics, that were previously not possible. One of them is using specialized banners that would drop behind enemy lines to wreak havoc. If we focus on training such divisions and creating ways to supply them better, it’ll allow them to operate on enemy territory more efficiently."
KIR_BORDER:0 "The Frontiersmare Armed Service"
KIR_BORDER_desc:0 "Kiria’s borders are long and behind them are many creatures who would gladly take a piece of our Realm. We cannot devote the entirety of our army to protecting them all the time. We need to establish regiments of Frontiersmare, brave kirins who would patrol our borders, warn us of an incoming invasion, and be the first to stave it off."
KIR_CONSCRIPTION:0 "Realm Conscription Ordinance"
KIR_CONSCRIPTION_desc:0 "If Kiria is attacked, we need to have enough kirinpower to defend it properly. We’ll introduce new laws that will allow us to draft a significant chunk of our population to the army. However, forcing the kirins to constantly serve is not only not the harmonist way, but it would also be demoralizing to our citizens. Therefore, those laws will only be able to take place during crisis, and our army will be kept as small as possible at other times."

KIR_PEACECONSCRIPT_Modifier:0 "Conscription Laws Cost while at Peace"
KIR_SUPPORT_1:0 "Army Motorization"
KIR_SUPPORT_1_desc:0 "Trucks are a useful tool for the transportation of troops and supplies. Unfortunately, due to the still-lingering effects of The Silence, we do not have a lot of experience with their use for military purposes. Thankfully, our generals believe that those shortcomings should be easy to make up for if we give it enough time."
KIR_SUPPORT_2:0 "Onhooves Supply Lines"
KIR_SUPPORT_2_desc:0 "The vastness of Kiria, combined with its dense forests and steep mountains, can make properly supplying troops a logistical nightmare. However, we can mobilize small groups of onhooves porters that would be in charge of delivering supplies to our troops in difficult areas. They wouldn’t be as effective as a truck or a train, but they could reach places where those would fail us."
KIR_SUPPORT_3:0 "Pacification Police"
KIR_SUPPORT_3_desc:0 "In the event of war, we might be forced to occupy portions of the enemy’s territory to achieve victory. In that case, we would have to develop methods of handling the local population. We cannot be too harsh to them and make them see us as their enemies, but we must also be strict enough to ensure they would not disturb our further military operations."
KIR_MILITIA:0 "Territorial Volunteers"
KIR_MILITIA_desc:0 "During wartime, it is very likely that even the non-conscripted kirins will want to support our war effort and take up arms in the defense of Kiria. It would be a good idea to allow them to channel this fervor and form the divisions of territorial volunteers, should the need arise."
KIR_NAVY_1:0 "River Gunboats"
KIR_NAVY_1_desc:0 "The Great Mellifluve and other rivers are the lifeblood of Kiria. It is crucial that we learn how to utilize them not only for trading but also for military purposes.

KIR_civil_war_focus_1_desc:0 "The Silence and the Way of Fire, intentionally stifling they may be, certainly guaranteed one thing: stability and safety. With the Silence ripped away haphazardly, a braying cacophony of dissent and war now rings in the ears of everykirin. As Premier Autumn Blaze battles a severe mental breakdown, Kiria has been thrust into the scalding inferno of death and chaos, where its survival rests on the slimmest knife's edge."
KIR_civil_war_focus_2a:0 "Rally the Realm"
KIR_civil_war_focus_2a_desc:0 "All loyal kirin, rise to arms! The traitors march on Vermilion, threatening both our way of life and life itself! They will not stop until every last kirin who seeks to preserve a peaceful way of life is gutted and buried in a mass grave. They come to destroy the Matriarch Superior, to annihilate the very spirit of the Kirian nation itself. By Concord, we will not succumb!"
KIR_civil_war_focus_2b:0 "The Emergency Decree"
KIR_civil_war_focus_2b_desc:0 "Though they may pontificate about their benevolent intentions, the Serene Tendency is a hegemon in Kirian politics. It was a common occurrence for Autumn Blaze to even reach out to the NAKP in order to avoid ceding influence to the Circle. Such concerns are mere memories now, and the unshakeable devotion of the Serene Tendency is precisely what we need to cool the flames which draw terrifyingly closer each day."
KIR_civil_war_focus_3a:0 "The Party's Resources"
KIR_civil_war_focus_3a_desc:0 "As the party favored by Premier Autumn Blaze and her successor Fern Flare, the RaHP sits atop a treasure trove of wealthy benefactors, influential connections, and popular support.

It is one of many sacrifices necessary to survive, not just to prevent the disintegration of the party, but to rescue Kiria itself."

KIR_civil_war_focus_3b_desc:0 "The drums of war beat heavy in the distance as Fern Flare gives a peremptory order to Winter Frost and her Serene Tendency to mobilize fully. As masses of faithful peasantry march with fervor in their eyes to the front lines, the awe-inspiring Serene Mystics, elite shock troops of the Way of Fire, are ready for battle. Traitors tremble in fear to the beat of hooves marching under Concord's banner."

KIR_civil_war_focus_3s_desc:0 "In the lives of today's kirin, and their grandsires, and their grandsires before them, the Matriarch Superior was always apart. An untouchable, inaccessible figure, nearly divine to her devoted subjects. Such a foolish tradition in retrospect, now that a generation marches to die in her name. The people must know who they fight for, and remember what their efforts mean."
KIR_civil_war_focus_4a:0 "Invoke the Accord"

KIR_civil_war_focus_5b_desc:0 "Kiria is not just a nation; it is an idea, a hope. A dream of harmony between kirin, of prosperity, of peace. This is something that Fickle Current and his band of fickle traitors could never understand. A better Kiria cannot be bought, it cannot be produced by a factory. It is in the soul and spirit of those who remain loyal, even in the face of temptation, to the Matriarch Superior."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5c:0 "The Territorial Volunteers"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5c_desc:0 "In war there are no easy choices. With a heavy heart Rain Shine has approved the formation of a new quasi-military detachment labeled the Territorial Volunteers. By definition composed of those unfit for standard military service, the Territorials serve as a reserve garrison force, the final, ragged line of defense when all else is lost."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5d:0 "Reforging the Banners"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5d_desc:0 "The specter of war has not haunted Kiria for centuries, permitting the once-magnificent Thousand Banners to wither away like flowers come wintertime.

KIR_civil_war_focus_5f:0 "Purge Corrupting Influences"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5f_desc:0 "Just as fire can warm a house or cook food, it can devour and destroy should it burn too bright. In such a manner, the Rising Fire has become a raging inferno, some twisting the original precepts of the Way of Fire far beyond anykirin's wildest nightmares.

KIR_civil_war_focus_6a_desc:0 "Surrounded by a swirling maelstrom of death, a spark of hope returns with Applejack, an Equestrian element of harmony and the pony perhaps most responsible for the revolutionary events in recent Kirian history. Such momentous news has even stirred Autumn Blaze from her repose, and it is both the Premier of Kiria and the shattered mare inside who meets with her mentor and friend."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6b:0 "The Eastern Redoubt"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6b_desc:0 "A relatively peripheral region of Kiria, the Maritime Range is sequestered from the areas most directly threatened by the war. Stifled by the Silence, it was a strip of fallow land devoid of industry. Now, guarded by the near-impenetrable Quartz Mountains to the west, the Range must serve as the nucleus of emergency naval production, fortified by the strongest protection on short notice."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6c:0 "Running Battle"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6c_desc:0 "Unlike our enemies, Vermilion possesses one great advantage: land. We cannot afford to annihilate the entire Kirin population through grueling stationary conflict.

KIR_civil_war_focus_6d:0 "Resolute Defence"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6d_desc:0 "Despite the initial shock, we maintain an advantageous position in most senses compared to the insurgents. The theory prevailing in the high command is that stalemate is a defeat for the opposition. Digging our hooves in is the most surefire way to win this war."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6e:0 "Inquisitor-Confessors"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6e_desc:0 "Today, devotion is in short supply. There yet remains one group which remains unfaltering in its faith, however. Those Way of Fire monks trained in the fundamentalist tradition are servants, body and soul, to the will of Concord and the Matriarch Superior. Though unleashing them may be dangerous, Kiria will be able to rest easy knowing that heresy and treason will soon be the faintest of memories."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6f:0 "The Mystics Militant"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6f_desc:0 "The most martially talented and supremely dedicated of Kiria's monks, known as the Serene Mystics, swear a magically-binding oath to defend Concord and Her chosen with all they are. Should they betray this oath, it is said, holy flame slowly immolates them from the inside. Whatever the case, their wrath in battle is terrible to behold, and galvanizes our forces."
KIR_civil_war_focus_7a:0 "The Student Volunteers"

KIR_council_focus_1_desc:0 "Free from the misguided and foolish court of Vermilion, it is up to Chairkirin Fickle Current to steer the Emergency Council of North Kiria through the troubling times ahead. But first we must decide how to approach Vermilion: with flowers of peace, or flowers of war?"
KIR_council_focus_2a:0 "Patriotic Obligation"
KIR_council_focus_2a_desc:0 "The Realm of Kiria is the home of all kirin, and it is our duty as a species to safeguard its prosperity. However, the corrupt clergy that controls the Matriarch Superior and the seat of power in Vermilion cannot be reasoned with. We must free the Matriarch by force and restore the Realm to peace!"
KIR_council_focus_2b:0 "Loyal to the Homeland"
KIR_council_focus_2b_desc:0 "Though we may have claimed our independence, the Matriarch Superior is and always will be the spiritual leader of the kirin people. She is Concord's avatar on earth, and to let her fall is not only an affront to the Realm, but to Her very heavens themselves. We must cooperate with Vermilion to secure the safety of the Matriarch and in turn peacefully secure our own future."
KIR_council_focus_treasury:0 "Inspect the Treasury"
KIR_council_focus_treasury_desc:0 "The NAKP is, in effect, an extension of the interests of the many corporate donors and partners that keep Fragrance solvent and our nation running. As such, we are able to leverage the significant financial resources of our prestigious corporate partners to achieve economic feats the rest of the Realm can only dream of. We just have to make sure we stay in the black and everything will be fine..."
KIR_council_focus_army:0 "Mobilise the Party"
KIR_council_focus_army_desc:0 "The NAKP is only as strong and financially stable as its members, and like a saturated market, they need to be encouraged from time to time to contribute to our coffers so we can continue to grow. By incentivizing the kirin of the Greater Providence region to increase their contributions to the party, we will be able to extend our reach into sectors previously closed to us."
KIR_council_focus_3a:0 "The Northern Compact"
KIR_council_focus_3a_desc:0 "If Fragrance will ever command enough might to guarantee our independence from Vermilion, we must tempt the other major population centers of the north away from Vermilion's rule. Championing the unique cultural differences that separate us from the kirin of the heartlands and fostering the notion of a Greater Providence will be key to making this dream a reality."
KIR_council_focus_3b:0 "Picking Up the Pieces"
KIR_council_focus_3b_desc:0 "The failure of the Grand Gallop Onward and its consequences have been a disaster for the kirin race. However, using money from the NAKP's treasury, we can begin to pick up the pieces and attempt to build back better and stronger. We will hire new workers, import new machines, and subsidize new industry to overcome Vermilion's failure in modernizing our society."
KIR_council_focus_4a:0 "The Verdant Glens"
KIR_council_focus_4a_desc:0 "Despite all of Fragrance's wealth and power, it is still a dense urban city, with little in the way of agriculture within its jurisdiction. However, the provinces of Apricot Glen and Vernal Glade just up the Carmine River are filled with fertile farmland. It is imperative that we win over Fragrance's backyard and bring this land into the fold."
KIR_council_focus_4b:0 "Rhapsodic Overtures"
KIR_council_focus_4b_desc:0 "Rhapsody is Kiria's largest city by a large margin, and as such it is incredibly important that we bring it into the fold if we hope to survive against Vermilion's inevitable overtures for reunification. The city is ruled by an entrenched religious group known as the Procurate, but should we focus our efforts on appeasing them or appealing to their citizens?"
KIR_council_focus_4c:0 "Fund Northern Development"
KIR_council_focus_4c_desc:0 "We have planted the seed for a renewed industrialization effort in the north; now it is time to water it and watch it grow. We must be willing to commit even more resources and funding to our nascent industries if we want to see them grow to new heights and drag Kiria out of destitution and poverty."
KIR_council_focus_4d:0 "Aid from the Diaspora"
KIR_council_focus_4d_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is our connections to the many wealthy members of the Kirin Diaspora, descendants of those who fled the Realm at the imposition of the Silence a century ago and who only prospered with their new businesses in Griffonia and Equus. The NAKP was made by and for this wealthy diaspora—how about we remind them of this fact with a few fundraising banquets and balls?"
KIR_council_focus_5a:0 "Kiria's Radiant Coast"
KIR_council_focus_5a_desc:0 "The city of Radiance has historically been the main port for foreign dignitaries visiting Vermilion from abroad, but the Silence reduced it to a dying backwater. Nowadays, it is home to a unique blend of northern natives and the returning members of the Kirin Diaspora, giving the city a unique identity that we must find a way to exploit to encourage it to throw its lot in with Fragrance."
KIR_council_focus_5b:0 "Court the Procurate"
KIR_council_focus_5b_desc:0 "Rhapsody's Procurate is the key to making significant headway in aligning the city's desires with our own. However, Rhapsody surely sees themselves as our equals, if not our betters. Despite how foolish such a notion may be, we must be sure to keep the Procurate happy if we want their cooperation during the plebiscite."
KIR_council_focus_5c:0 "Provisional Industrial Central Planning"
KIR_council_focus_5c_desc:0 "If we want to get the most out of our economy, we must be willing to find which of our partners have been underperforming and give them a firm squeeze to make up for the difference. Our corporate partners are incredibly important to the function of the NAKP, but they can be quite stingy when it comes to spreading the wealth around. Perhaps we should nationalize some of their assets to get the most out of them?"
KIR_council_focus_5d:0 "Secure Our Power Base"
KIR_council_focus_5d_desc:0 "With all the time and money we have focused on winning over the surrounding states of Greater Providence that still profess loyalty to Vermilion, we cannot forget to pay attention to those that have already declared for us in and around Fragrance. But what is the best way to do that: a broader campaign in our cities, or diverting funding into tangible quality of life improvements?"
KIR_council_focus_5e:0 "Radio Free Kiria"
KIR_council_focus_5e_desc:0 "The radio is one of our most important tools in pushing the party message out to our citizens and securing their loyalty by ensuring that they hear what we want them to hear. But it could be used as a tool for profit as well, supposing we allow anykirin to buy time on the airwaves. But is such an investment worth the risks?"
KIR_council_focus_6a:0 "Plebiscite for Northern Self-Determination"
KIR_council_focus_6a_desc:0 "The pollsters have been hard at work, and we have invested significant capital in drumming up support for the Plebiscite for Northern Self-Determination. It is time to allow the kirin of Greater Providence to vote on their future.\n\n§RThere is no turning back now.§!"
KIR_council_focus_6b:0 "The City-State Economy"
KIR_council_focus_6b_desc:0 "The ultimate ideal in a self-sustaining and growing economy requires our urban and industrial centers to be fully independent and equipped with everything they need to turn a profit. The number one roadblock to such efforts, however, is an insufficient labor pool. We shall encourage the poor kirin of the countryside to move into the cities where they can be more useful to our economic machine."
KIR_council_focus_6c:0 "Resume Industrialisation"
KIR_council_focus_6c_desc:0 "Now that we have finally achieved momentum on reversing the disastrous failure of the Grand Gallop Onward, we are beginning to see some of the fruits of our labor. The engine of industry is now running on its own, and it will only continue to grow stronger by the day."
KIR_council_focus_7a:0 "The Northern Economic Rebound"
KIR_council_focus_7a_desc:0 "The industrial capacity of the north is unmatched, as is the tenacity of our people. We have perservered through economic crisis and the rumblings of a market collapse, and come out the other side stronger for it. It is time to celebrate, because Fragrance has achieved what Vermilion never could: the successful rejuvenation of kirin industry and our entrepeneurial spirit!"
KIR_council_focus_7b:0 "Educate the New Generation"
KIR_council_focus_7b_desc:0 "It is the duty of the old generation to educate and make way for the new. Today, the first children of the Diaspora are being foaled on kirin shores, marking the successful return of Kiria's long-lost sons and daughters. It is imperative that we provide them the best education we can afford to give them all the tools they need to succeed in this brave new world we have made for them."

KIS_reconcile_focus_1a:0 "Hold a Party Congress"
KIS_reconcile_focus_1a_desc:0 "To achieve independence while remaining supportive of Vermilion is a task that will require careful juggling of priorities, promises, and practicality. We must hold a party congress with the entirety of the NAKP's leadership to outline our plans and make sure that we maintain our cohesion in these confusing times."
KIS_reconcile_focus_1b:0 "The Twin Flowers Movement"
KIS_reconcile_focus_1b_desc:0 "Vermilion, like Fragrance, is a beautiful and vibrant flower, but it risks being cut down by the lawn mower of the Rising Fire's heresy. If all of Kiria is to one day become a beautiful garden, we must stand with Vermilion against the threat from the west and let the future bloom."
KIS_reconcile_focus_2a:0 "One Kiria Declaration"
KIS_reconcile_focus_2a_desc:0 "As there is only one goddess in the heavens and one Matriarch on earth, so too is their only one Kiria to protect. Though we may have severed our political engines from Vermilion's devices, we are still kirin living in the Realm of Kiria, and so it is our duty to return peace and prosperity to its fragrant fields and verdant valleys."
KIS_reconcile_focus_2b:0 "Democratise the Association"
KIS_reconcile_focus_2b_desc:0 "As we move to loosely entwine our people with the idea of a safe and secure Vermilion, we must be willing to democratize the NAKP in some measure. To make sure that we do not lose our way during this cooperation, the people must be allowed to express their opinions through the vote, and thus help chart the NAKP's course alongside the planning of our Chairkirin."
KIS_reconcile_focus_3a:0 "The Assembly of Northern Kiria"
KIS_reconcile_focus_3a_desc:0 "The Assembly, a loyal and toothless paradox of a tool — a legislature whose decrees are not binding; that proudly proclaims its independence from the Association, yet gathers only-occasionally at the Chairkirin's behest; the (albeit democratically-elected) representatives to which travel to Fragrance on the Party member's dime, to discuss the Party's agenda within the Party's capitol."
KIS_reconcile_focus_3b:0 "Prune the Iron Chrysanthemum"
KIS_reconcile_focus_3b_desc:0 "The Iron Chrysanthemum is, at best, a group of enthusiastic patriots, or at worst, an armed gang of thugs willing to get their hooves dirty at the NAKP's bidding (and gold). Let us nip any potential problems in the bud by officially incorporating the Order as a paramilitary branch of the NAKP, complete with its own strict chain of command and training to keep it under control."
KIS_reconcile_focus_4:0 "A Northern Constitution"
KIS_reconcile_focus_4_desc:0 "Our new constitution will be the first in the world to classify corporations as creatures and codify their rights alongside those of our citizens. Foremost among their rights is the right to pursue their interests unfettered by policy and regulation. While some might draw issue with the lack of workers' protections, people aren't as profitable as corporations are."
KIS_reconcile_focus_5a:0 "Parting Ways"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5a_desc:0 "We have accomplished what we have long sought after: the independence of Fragrance from the rule of Vermilion. But it is a muted affair, devoid of fanfare, as we separate from Vermilion peacefully in exchange for pledging our support for the Realm against the Rising Fire in the west. But at least we're free, right?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5b:0 "The Junior Partner"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5b_desc:0 "War with Vermilion will be destructive and dangerous, and we have little hope of standing on our own. Perhaps it is best that we arrange some limited return of Fragrance to Vermilion's rule. While guaranteeing most of our rights and independence, we will still be expected to kneel before our rivals... but isn't this preferable to the alternative?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6a:0 "The Peony Accords"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6a_desc:0 "If we are to defeat the Rising Fire, we must formalize our cooperation with Vermilion. The Peony Accords will arrange for the creation of the Kirian United Front, and as we march together in unity, Rising Sun must know that her time as the bane of Kiria's existence is coming to an end."
KIS_reconcile_focus_6b:0 "Enshrine Our Autonomy"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6b_desc:0 "We are well on the way to codifying our autonomy, and soon we can make our bold proclamation into legal reality. But a legal code means little to the average kirin of Greater Providence. We should instead make this legal declaration be something tangible that they can witness with their own eyes. Perhaps the leftover pieces of the Grand Gallop Onward are a good place to start..."
KIS_reconcile_focus_7a:0 "Promote Regionalism"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7a_desc:0 "Greater Providence is something of a patchwork of regions with different laws and traditions, and administering it as a commmon whole is a nightmare, to say the least. A blanket approach is impossible, so we have no choice but to let the regions grow independently, at the behest of the free market. Maybe we could speed that development up with some investment?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7b:0 "The Viceroyalty"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7b_desc:0 "It is time to officially reconcile our relationship with Vermilion. Our diplomats have agreed upon the terms of the establishment of a Viceroyalty in the north and the guarantee of our autonomy. Chairkirin Fickle Current will serve as the first Vermilion Viceroy and will lead a parallel government to Vermilion, but at the end of the day, we still acknowledge the supremacy of the Matriarch's domain."

KIS_reconcile_focus_7c_desc:0 "Now that we have settled the diplomatic matters necessary to establish our Viceroyalty, it is time to focus on improving our military cooperation with Vermilion. We shall establish a system of viceroyal banners using soldiers provided by Vermilion and equip them with modern equipment produced here at home to represent the first of our joint military ventures."
KIS_reconcile_focus_8:0 "The Confederal Union"
KIS_reconcile_focus_8_desc:0 "With the matter of our independence secured and settled, we should reorganize our territory into a more efficient nation effectively led by the NAKP. Though we claim legitimacy through the deference to Matriarch Superior Rain Shine in all spiritual matters, this is in reality simply lip service, and the Matriarch has no influence on affairs within our borders."
KIS_reconcile_focus_8a:0 "The Confederal Guard"
KIS_reconcile_focus_8a_desc:0 "Through the charitable donations of some of our most wealthy patrons and party members, we have organized the funds to acquire state of the art Griffonian artillery pieces and motorized equipment. These arms will go a long ways toward our efforts to put an end to the menace of the Rising Fire."
KIS_reconcile_focus_9:0 "The War of Containment"
KIS_reconcile_focus_9_desc:0 "The Rising Fire is a threat that we must contain before it spreads out of control like a raging wildfire. We shall fight alongside Vermilion to put it down, but we should also keep in mind that a strong Vermilion may not be to our benefit. Perhaps it may be better to contain the Rising Fire instead of extinguishing them to keep Vermilion weak..."
KIS_reconcile_focus_10:0 "The Post-War Settlement"
KIS_reconcile_focus_10_desc:0 "We must make preparations for the end of the War of the Double Secession and the inevitability of our victory by organizing the means to demobilize and settle our affairs in the post-war world. After all, business will be booming, and we best be ready to capitalize on it when the post-war boom starts."
KIS_reconcile_focus_11:0 "A Bastion of Stability"
KIS_reconcile_focus_11_desc:0 "Through our influence, we have helped put an end to the War of the Double Secession. Kiria is stable once more, and the menace of the Rising Fire has been dealt with. We can take pride in knowing that it was by our hoof that peace has returned to the Vermilion Realm, and all the kirin of the Realm will see Greater Providence as its bastion of stability."
KIS_reconcile_focus_12:0 "Reform and Opening"
KIS_reconcile_focus_12_desc:0 "With the business of war behind us, it is time to focus on the business of the future. The Chairkirin has prepared many reforms to pass through the NAKP that will help modernize the north and bring us up to parity with the developed nations of the world, and there's no better time than the present to start passing them."

KIR_council_focus_x:0 "The Minutiae of Independence" ##Rage, Rage! 'gainst the Dying of the Light - Commune of Fragrance/Revolutionary Fragrance Focus
KIR_council_focus_x_desc:0 "Independence is more than just a bold statement and patriotic fervor; it takes the combined efforts of dozens of legislators and hundreds, if not thousands, of dedicated kirin to make it a reality. We must fill our administration with competent kirin to ensure that our fledgling nation can stand on its own hooves during this crucial time."
KIR_council_focus_x1a:0 "State-Corporate Partnership"
KIR_council_focus_x1a_desc:0 "The state relies on the corporation to provide it with taxable income and goods to trade with foreign countries, while corporations rely on the state to provide them with a support structure and the means to protect their investments. If we want to get the most out of both, we must make the two all-but inseparable entities to guarantee their effective partnership."
KIR_council_focus_x1b:0 "Office for Economic Development"
KIR_council_focus_x1b_desc:0 "To guarantee the productive independence of the state and the loyalty of our people, we must invest heavily in developing our society along lines that are beneficial to the NAKP and the party's infrastructure. The creation of social programs all championed with a pro-NAKP slant will ensure that our citizens are more firmly supportive of the party."
KIR_council_focus_x2a:0 "Joint Venture for the Port of Sycee"
KIR_council_focus_x2a_desc:0 "The port of Sycee is home to the Sycee Trading House, one of the oldest merchant banks in Kiria, and one of the strongest to survive the disastrous imposition of The Silence. We must work closely with this bank to furnish it with a new and modern home in its original city, and in return, Sycee will allow the state the use of some of its resources and infrastructure."
KIR_council_focus_x2b:0 "Northern Defence Industrial Complex"
KIR_council_focus_x2b_desc:0 "For as long as there is war, or at least the prospect of war, the military-industrial complex will remain one of the most profitable business ventures known to creatures across the world. As it so happens, war in Kiria is a very real prospect, and we are in great need of bolstering our defenses. Perhaps we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement with the complex..."
KIR_council_focus_x2c:0 "Shelter the People"
KIR_council_focus_x2c_desc:0 "The kirin of the north, and even the weary refugees from the heartlands, need a government willing and able to look after them. By encouraging immigration to the north and spending lavishly to provide for the people, we will grow our population and begin to recoup our investment through a larger source of taxable kirin."
KIR_council_focus_x3:0 "Codify Corporatism"
KIR_council_focus_x3_desc:0 "Like a good business, society is at its most productive when cleanly delineated into its component parts and effectively managed by capable administrators. We shall take this practice one step further and officially codify corporatism into our societal laws, making each sector of our society one self-contained part of an efficient and profitable national machine."
KIR_council_focus_x4a:0 "The Brocade Mining and Resources Consortium"
KIR_council_focus_x4a_desc:0 "Raw materials have been the lifeblood of any nation since the dawn of time, and this has not changed in the modern age. Northern Kiria is pitifully underdeveloped and woefully unexploited, and so we must rectify this issue immediately. We shall establish a new mining consortium for prospect for desperately-needed resources and bring them to our markets as quickly as possible."
KIR_council_focus_x4b:0 "Acquire the Collegium"
KIR_council_focus_x4b_desc:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium was the brainchild of Cypress Snow and Chairkirin Fickle Current, and since our separation from Vermilion, it has languished in a state of decay under the hoof of those unwilling to invest in its success. Let us divert some funds to lure its scholars and staff away from Vermilion and give them a safe haven to continue their valuable work here in Fragrance."
KIR_council_focus_x5:0 "Fuel For Progress"
KIR_council_focus_x5_desc:0 "There is a reason industrialization is often referred to as an engine of societal development: not only does it power the transformation of our society, but it needs fuel of its own to properly function. With precious few resources to fuel the engines of progress in the north, we must invest in alternative means to acquire fuel to keep our economy humming along."

KIR_council_mil_focus_X:0 "Raise the Righteous Regiments"
KIR_council_mil_focus_X_desc:0 "The Righteous Regiments once served as part of Fragrance's local garrison, and their history goes back even further to the days of kirin warlords. Though they have been disbanded since the beginning of the Silence, reinstating these regiments will allow us to call upon the proud history of Fragrance in her defense once more!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_3:0 "Motorization Drive"
KIR_council_mil_focus_3_desc:0 "Trucks will be an important feature of the wars of today and tomorrow, and we are woefully undersupplied at the moment. The ability to quickly carry heavy equipment and supplies to an army extends and enhances our combat missions, all in all creating a stronger and more effective fighting force."
KIR_council_mil_focus_2:0 "Militarize the Cadres"
KIR_council_mil_focus_2_desc:0 "All aspects of our society and government need to, for the time being at least, be fully devoted to the war to come. We must make sure that the current reality is woven into everything we do, reminding our citizens that they need to be ready to fight for their country, and that they should devote every day toward achieving victory!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_6:0 "The First Armor Unit"
KIR_council_mil_focus_6_desc:0 "With modern wars being fought with deadly automatic weapons and lethal shrapnel, putting an indestructible monster of steel on the field of battle can overwhelm enemy defenses while protecting our own soldiers in the process. Tanks are the future, the armored tip of the spear that will drive through enemy lines, and we need to get them in our armies now!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_4:0 "Analytics Initiative"
KIR_council_mil_focus_4_desc:0 "Information is everything, and especially so on the battlefield. Knowing the likely moves of our enemies while keeping our own plans a secret can make or break a battle or a war. We must devote extra effort to our analytics departments to ensure that we gain as much of an intelligence advantage over our foes as we can!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_5:0 "War of Position"
KIR_council_mil_focus_5_desc:0 "Gone are the days when two large armies would smash against each other in an open field, with the loser fleeing in disarray. Modern armies are simply too large to bring to bear all at once, and so taking and holding key positions is the way that wars will be decided. Improving the ability of our forces to move to strategic locations and defend them against enemy attack will be the key to success."
KIR_council_mil_focus_1:0 "Fragrance Aerodrome"
KIR_council_mil_focus_1_desc:0 "The ability to fight in the skies and rain death down on an enemy from above was something only griffons and pegasi could do for the longest time. But with the invention of the aeroplane, that capability is now something that any species can achieve. If we control the skies, then we control our fate!"

KIR_militarist_focus_1a:0 "Northern Armament"
KIR_militarist_focus_1a_desc:0 "If we are going to fight, and more importantly, win a war against both Vermilion and the Rising Fire communists, we must embark upon a massive industrialization and conscription drive to put a capable army in the field. Through encouraging patriotic donations and a conscription lottery, we will fill both our coffers and the ranks of our armies at once!"
KIR_militarist_focus_1b:0 "Provident Destiny"
KIR_militarist_focus_1b_desc:0 "We are amazing creatures, the chosen creations of Concord, the embodiment of Her will and the custodians of the final spark of the Primordial Flame that birthed the world. Is it not then our destiny to reclaim the glory that was robbed from us by Vermilion's incompetence and the Silence?"
KIR_militarist_focus_2:0 "Mobilize the Literati"
KIR_militarist_focus_2_desc:0 "Where the rest of the Realm of Kiria is filled with poor peasants and religious figures, Fragrance is a haven for the intelligentsia of the kirin race. Our enlightened and wealthy people shall pave the way for innovation and solutions to age-old problems, giving us an edge over the intellectually stagnant holds of the Matriarch and Rising Sun."
KIR_militarist_focus_3a:0 "A Gentle Hoof"
KIR_militarist_focus_3a_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is the backing of the corporations that support the NAKP, but they can be incredibly stingy and selfish, loathe to part with money or machinery. We should remind them that the free market isn't exactly free, and they should be willing to donate some of their manufacturing capacity for our armament effort if they don't want to deal with new tax hikes."
KIR_militarist_focus_3b:0 "Death's Head Brigades"
KIR_militarist_focus_3b_desc:0 "The Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum is currently little more than a rag-tag band of street thugs and criminals operating on the NAKP's gold, and hardly what one would call a professional fighting force. But what if we change that? Given some actual training and competent command, we could turn the Order into a powerful fighting force to call upon in the war to come."
KIR_militarist_focus_4a:0 "Command the Economy"
KIR_militarist_focus_4a_desc:0 "The free market is great and all, but in a struggle of life and death, wasting resources on producing frivolous things is hardly the solution to keeping our country safe. We should more forcefully insist that our industrial concerns dedicate their efforts toward the products we want them to make, at least until we have emerged victorious."
KIR_militarist_focus_4b:0 "Pro Patria Mori"
KIR_militarist_focus_4b_desc:0 "Is it not the greatest glory to die for one's country? Is there anything more rewarding than to give one's life in service of returning Kiria to the glory that Concord promised us? Death in battle is nothing to fear, for we shall all return to Concord's flames when we die, and become one with the fires of creation once more. Arm yourselves, and fight for your country!"
KIR_militarist_focus_5a:0 "Overseas Investors"
KIR_militarist_focus_5a_desc:0 "We have many contacts in Griffonia that would be willing to lend us money, equipment, and perhaps even military support, should we come to them with an acceptable deal. By providing land and resources as collateral, we can satisfy potential Griffonian investors in our cause. Or perhaps we could turn our attention further westward..."
KIR_militarist_focus_5b:0 "The Reliable Party"
KIR_militarist_focus_5b_desc:0 "The NAKP is primarily funded by the donations of our wealthy party members and the party dues the corporations pay to us. But with war on the horizon, what they currently donate is not enough. These are some of the wealthiest kirin in the world, though; surely they can spare a bit more money for the party?"
KIR_militarist_focus_5c:0 "Corporate Freeholds"
KIR_militarist_focus_5c_desc:0 "We must encourage the corporations to increase their donations to the party treasury in the name of patriotism, and our propaganda efforts are already putting public pressure on them to do so. But it would not do to anger the corporations, lest they leave the nation entirely. Therefore, we need to provide some kind of incentive to get them to pay up and stay..."
KIR_militarist_focus_6a:0 "The Liaison Office for Military Commissions"
KIR_militarist_focus_6a_desc:0 "With regional conflicts erupting all throughout the world, there is no shortage of mercenary companies willing to fight for the highest bidder. Though negotiating with mercenaries and brigands is beneath us, if we simply set up an official office to negotiate with "official military commissions", we could hire the expertise of these experts of war with no difficulty at all."
KIR_militarist_focus_6b:0 "The Directorate of Production"
KIR_militarist_focus_6b_desc:0 "We must continue to streamline and organize the armament effort of our company, and the best way to do that is to set up the Directorate of Production. This office will instruct our industrial base on exactly what we need to produce to win the war, and will ensure that the rigid quotas it establishes are met through any means necessary."
KIR_militarist_focus_7a:0 "Quid Pro Quo"
KIR_militarist_focus_7a_desc:0 "If there is one universal truth, it is that anything can be accomplished by throwing enough money at it. Thus, we should follow these wise words and throw enough money at our infrastructure and industrial problems to hurry these projects up."
KIR_militarist_focus_7b:0 "Crush the Fourth Column"
KIR_militarist_focus_7b_desc:0 "The enemies of Kiria are fourfold; barbarians, degenerates, and infidels without, and the red menace within. Even as we fight the Rising Fire, we must safeguard the homefront against their twisted and subversive lies. We can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration, indoctrination, subversion, and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids!"
KIR_militarist_focus_7c:0 "Changeling Largesse"
KIR_militarist_focus_7c_desc:0 "Now that we have agreed to terms with the Changelings, all we have to do is sign off on them with their representative, one businessbug by the name of Finicus Vesali. Though it seems that there might be some... interesting little tidbits tied up into our treaty of cooperation that warrant further examination..."
KIR_militarist_focus_8:0 "For Realm and Rights!"
KIR_militarist_focus_8_desc:0 "The NAKP represents the triumph of the kirin spirit: anykirin can accomplish anything if they set their mind to it, and the free market rewards those with ambition and drive over the lazy in our society. Through our hardwork and dedication, we will claim our ultimate destiny: to become the hegemons of Eastern Zebrica that we were always destined to be!"
KIR_militarist_focus_8a:0 "Labour Reform"
KIR_militarist_focus_8a_desc:0 "To encourage the productivity of our laborers, we must offer certain incentives to them. Wonderful policies such as the quota system will tie worker wages to the amount of goods they produce, rewarding productivity, and those that enlist in the service of the military will enjoy luxuries such as 30 minute lunch breaks and weekends off."
KIR_militarist_focus_8b:0 "Wartime Necessity"
KIR_militarist_focus_8b_desc:0 "Nokirin likes taxes, least of all the corporations, but sometimes it's just what we have to do. There will probably be a lot of hurt feelings in increasing the corporate tax rate from 5% to 10%, but if we promise to lower taxes down to 2% afterwards, then they'll come around to the idea eventually, right?"
KIR_militarist_focus_8c:0 "Seize Our Destiny"
KIR_militarist_focus_8c_desc:0 "The time has finally come, and we've made all the preparations we can make. With our new army and powerful industrial base backing us up, we shall unite the Realm of Kiria once more, bringing Vermilion and the Rising Sun to heel. The NAKP will reign supreme over the Realm, and under our leadership, we shall move the kirin race into a brave new world!"
KIR_council_focus_pirate:0 "A Favour Owed"
KIR_council_focus_pirate_desc:0 "Fickle Current made an ally while dealing with the pirates of Nacre. With the war in full swing, it's time to summon the pirate queen Roaring Fire to our side and bolster our forces on land and sea."

KIR_empire_focus_1:0 "Providence Dawning"
KIR_empire_focus_1_desc:0 "At last, we are in control of the whole of the nation. The false idols have been broken, and now it is time for the NAKP to enforce their vision over all of Kiria. A new dawn is rising, where wisdom and reason rule, not the superstition of the Way of Fire or the zealotry of the Rising Fire. A happy medium, where industry is King."
KIR_empire_focus_2a:0 "Restore the Matriarch"
KIR_empire_focus_2a_desc:0 "Despite the fact that she has been coddled by traitors and communists for years, the Matriarch Superior still lies at the heart of Kirin culture and society. A Kirian government without her would never have the backing of the Way of Fire or the majority of Kirin. It is time to restore Rain Shine to her place of spiritual power, while she concedes temporal affairs to the NAKP."
KIR_empire_focus_2b:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
KIR_empire_focus_2b_desc:0 "While the Grand Gallop Onward was a complete and utter failure under the guardianship of the old government, the NAKP will not be so quick to rush headlong into destruction. We will succeed where others failed, for the Empire's industry and intelligensia is behind us. By any cost needed, Fragrance and the realm at large must prosper."
KIR_empire_focus_3a:0 "The Vermilion Consignation"
KIR_empire_focus_3a_desc:0 "There are very few in Kiria who we, and by extension the Matriarch Superior, can trust. But if there is one thing that will always ensure loyalty, it's money. That's why we know the corporations have our back. By them remaining loyal to the crown we both prosper, and that is why it is time to devolve further power to the corporations, legitimizing them as great feudal vassals of old."
KIR_empire_focus_roaring_fire:0 "Just Reward"
KIR_empire_focus_roaring_fire_desc:0 "It's time to pay Roaring Fire her due. She played her part in seizing control of the southern oceans for the NAKP, and so now it's time to give her what she wants: free reign in the South Kirin Sea. Her place in the new order is secure, as long as she keeps paying her taxes."

KIR_empire_focus_3b_desc:0 "Per the Indentured Service Compensation Scheme, those accused of financial crimes shall be bound to provide labor for the state until the point at which their debt is paid in full. While participating in the Compensation Scheme all living expenses shall be added to the debt of the laborer as per Subsection-9a. Complaints should be filed to the Bureau For Fair Kirin Treatment, which is located... somewhere."
KIR_empire_focus_3c:0 "The Imperial Kirian Army"
KIR_empire_focus_3c_desc:0 "Rising from the ashes of the old Banners, the new Kirin military is free from the shackles of the old order. Bankrolled by the Vassal-Corporations and with the full support of the Matriarch Superior, soon there will not be a finer fighting force in the world."
KIR_empire_focus_4a:0 "The Chairkirin's Mandate"
KIR_empire_focus_4a_desc:0 "The Chairkirin has a vision for Kiria, one that will not be bound by old notions of tradition and the agrarian idyll. Efficiency is the greatest moral guide, and anything second to capitalist perfection is a failure in the eyes of the Matriarch and the NAKP." ##you can elaborate more on the individual programs in the decision descriptions
KIR_empire_focus_4b:0 "Show Them the Way"
KIR_empire_focus_4b_desc:0 "The order of the Way of Fire is filled with seditious and treasonous elements that threaten to undermine our rule. However, the Way of Fire is too important to the kirin of the Realm to abolish entirely. We will focus our efforts on shifting legitimacy away from this institution and toward one more friendly to our goals."
KIR_empire_focus_4c:0 "Anti-Banditry Operations"
KIR_empire_focus_4c_desc:0 "Banditry continues to be a problem in the lawless and loosely policed frontiers. Let us establish a fitting doctrine to keep these lawless criminals under control and strengthen our hold on the Realm."
KIR_empire_focus_4x:0 "Civil Defence"
KIR_empire_focus_4x_desc:0 "Much of the misguided peasantry of the Realm sees us as foreign conquerors, but that is simply not so. Unfortunately, illiterate peasants cannot be reasoned with in good faith. Thankfully, martial law and the firm hoof of a strong civil defence force will be much more persuasive."
KIR_empire_focus_4y:0 "A Professional Military"
KIR_empire_focus_4y_desc:0 "Like all businesses the military must be run like a well-oiled machine. No leaks, no mistakes, no ifs, ands, or buts. Absolute disciple and absolute loyalty must be given from all our commanders and soldiers, as well as the corporations who back the defenders of Kiria. Anything less should amount to heresy, or at least be worth a fine."
KIR_empire_focus_5a:0 "The Twelfth Vassal-Corporation"
KIR_empire_focus_5a_desc:0 "So far we have codified a total of eleven vassal-corporations in service to the Matriarch Superior. But we yet have need for another. We can't let all our vassals get too wealthy without taking a slice of the pie for ourselves, and so shall be born the Corporation of Kiria, an extension of the NAKP and the Chairkirin's control over the economy; the ultimate tool to cement our influence in the Kirian sphere."
KIR_empire_focus_5b:0 "The New Realm Party" ##Suffrage Lottery or Guild Corporatocracy
KIR_empire_focus_5b_desc:0 "It is time to reinstall at least the dressings of a functional democracy; namely, the right to vote. But we would be foolish to give that right freely back to the uneducated kirin of the Realm; rather, we will focus on finding a system to make sure that the majority of votes are controlled by party loyalists."
KIR_empire_focus_5c:0 "Rural Pacification Campaigns"
KIR_empire_focus_5c_desc:0 "The small, unnamed villages scattered throughout the rural regions of the Realm are breeding grounds for rebel sentiment and partisan activities. We must decide how best to address these small hubs before they allow the rebel problem to fester and spread even further than it has."
KIR_empire_focus_5d:0 "Consolidate the West"
KIR_empire_focus_5d_desc:0 "The western reaches of the Realm are a lawless land where anything goes. We should consider pouring more money, resources, and loyal kirin into the west to consolidate our control, but this runs the risk of sucking up more resources that would be better used elsewhere."
KIR_empire_focus_6a:0 "The Imperial Code"
KIR_empire_focus_6a_desc:0 "The Realm is safely under our supervision, and it would not have been possible without the economic backing of the corporations and partners that made our victory possible. As a result, we have parceled out the land of the Realm for their use. Now, we need to convince them to reinvest the profits they'll generate using the Realm's resources back into the Realm itself."
KIR_empire_focus_6b:0 "Torchbearers of Progress"
KIR_empire_focus_6b_desc:0 "We've made great strides in consolidating our control over the Realm, and with the aid of our loyal vassal corporations, much of the Realm has been pacified one way or another. Let's put the finishing touches on our takeover of the Realm and secure Kiria for the NAKP and progress everywhere."
KIR_empire_focus_6x:0 "Modernise or Consolidate?"
KIR_empire_focus_6x_desc:0 "One of the most important things for an army is how efficiently it is able to move its troops both at home and abroad. Two schools of thought have emerged among our generals and theorists: should we modernize our rail capacity to move supplies and troops in bulk, or pivot toward the flexibility air transport allows us?"
KIR_empire_focus_6y:0 "Power Projection"
KIR_empire_focus_6y_desc:0 "It is not enough to hold your power close to your chest, so to speak. A true regional power, and even something more, knows it's best to project our power abroad, where our influence can be felt beyond our borders and our military can operate anywhere. While we still have some work to do on that front, modernizing our air power will allow us to project it like never before."
KIR_empire_focus_6z:0 "The Shipping Lanes"
KIR_empire_focus_6z_desc:0 "The sea is incredibly important to the strength and economic security of our nation, and so it must not be neglected. The coastline of Kiria is its source of vast power, and the watersheds of the Great Mellifluve and Carmine River allow our naval power to project even inland. It would be foolish not to double down on our strengths."
KIR_empire_focus_7x:0 "Disband the Thousand Banners"
KIR_empire_focus_7x_desc:0 "The Thousand Banners has been the main system of military recruitment and organization in the Realm since the end of the warlord era, but unfortunately this means they harbor unrealistic nostalgia for the days of old. We should disband the old banners that may have loyalties to the previous regime and install a new military with unbreakable loyalty to the NAKP."
KIR_empire_focus_7y:0 "Expand the Merchant Navy"
KIR_empire_focus_7y_desc:0 "If we want to make the Realm a land of commerce and wealth, we need to make sure that our shipping lanes are safe and secure. Let us lean on the Sycee Trading House's extensive experience at protecting their overseas shipping and make sure our ships are safe no matter how far from friendly ports they may roam."
KIR_empire_focus_8a:0 "Carve Up the Pie"
KIR_empire_focus_8a_desc:0 "Kiria is prosperous, and business is booming. Now that we are firmly in control of the Realm, we should begin parceling out sectors of the market and industry to the highest bidder. The VasCorps will pay handsomely for lucrative government contracts, and the wild speculation over which VasCorps shall win which contracts is driving market prices up, up, up!"
KIR_empire_focus_8b:0 "The Corporate Tithes" ##1K gold per month per corporate vassal, Resolve Accounting Errors
KIR_empire_focus_8b_desc:0 "Just as we owe much of our success to the support of our loyal VasCorps, the corporations owe their newfound record profits and riches to our business-friendly policies and mutual cooperation. The state has sacrificed much to make the corporations happy, so it is time they begin to repay the debt they owe us."
KIR_empire_focus_8c:0 "Industrial Sectorisation"
KIR_empire_focus_8c_desc:0 "The Realm of Kiria is blessed with abundant land, ease in transporting goods along its many rivers, and a vast amount of cheap peasant labor. By designating special development sectors, we can more efficiently manage our abundant resources to create more factories, faster than ever."
KIR_empire_focus_8x:0 "The New Martial Class"
KIR_empire_focus_8x_desc:0 "The kirin who fought valiantly for us to save the Realm from superstition and socialism have become an important backbone in our society. These soldiers stand a cut above the rest and are an inspiration for all. We should impress this on the population and bolster the ranks of the new martial class, through experienced veterans or wealthy party donors purchasing commission."
KIR_empire_focus_9a:0 "Renegotiate Rhapsody"
KIR_empire_focus_9a_desc:0 "There yet exists a realm within our own, where the power of the NAKP and its vassals is not yet secure. The city of Rhapsody stands defiant against us, stuck in their old ways, and shielded by the Procurate. They insist on being given special status within the Empire; a silly notion, really, if only they didn't control the city's great Arsenal. Let us invite the Procurate to Fragrance to help resolve our differences."
KIR_empire_focus_9b:0 "Liberate the Markets" ##Factory Investment Cost
KIR_empire_focus_9b_desc:0 "To ensure that the free market is, well, free, we need to make sure that there is no restrictive red tape or anti-business clauses holding back the free flowing exchange of money. The VasCorps, while eternally loyal and cooperative with our regime, are unfortunately all too prone to stifling a good deal on our end to make their own shareholders richer. Perhaps that should change..."
KIR_empire_focus_9y:0 "The Kirian Soldiery"
KIR_empire_focus_9y_desc:0 "Given the size of the Realm, it is infeasible to expect the professional army to quickly respond to all threats, both without and within. Let us instead invest our treasury in creating MilSets, specialized, permanent settlements that are populated by soldiers and veterans who can quickly respond to any threats and contain them until the military can respond."
KIR_empire_focus_9z:0 "Results-Oriented Tactical Warfare"
KIR_empire_focus_9z_desc:0 "Bandits linger in the west, hindering our efforts to pacify the Realm. They survive by siphoning recruits and supplies off of the local towns like a parasite. Well, if they act like parasites, then we shall treat them as such. Sometimes, the host has to endure suffering to ensure the parasite dies."
KIR_empire_focus_9x:0 "Imperial Vermilion"
KIR_empire_focus_9x_desc:0 "We have secured the Realm, and now it is time to look outwards. It is Concord's will, and the will of our shareholders, that we expand the Realm's control beyond its current borders.

KIR_republic_focus_new_dawn_desc:0 "The unworthy in Vermilion and the faithless in Fragrance have shown their hoof, and Concord has struck it down. Their "Grand Gallop" has failed because the divine has decreed that now it is our time to rise above those who have so foolishly led Kiria to ruin. We are the Rising Fire! We are the flame that shall never die! The flame that burns brighter than the heavens themselves! Onwards with Concord's grace!"
KIR_republic_focus_sacred_revolution:0 "The Sacred Revolution"
KIR_republic_focus_sacred_revolution_desc:0 "Kiria can only be saved from ruin if we take quick and decisive action to unseat the Way of Fire and rescue the Matriarch in Vermilion. The longer we wait, the more powerful our enemies grow, and eventually, their might will be nigh-invincible. By rallying the peasants together under the revolution and striking hard, we can defeat our enemies before they ever have a chance to resist us!"
KIR_republic_focus_back_hoof:0 "On the Back Hoof"
KIR_republic_focus_back_hoof_desc:0 "Kiria can only be saved from ruin if we methodically wear down our enemies until they lose the will to fight. We are guided by the sacred light of Concord through Her emissary, Rising Sun, and we will fight through a thousand years of struggle and sacrifice to see victory. We will outlast our enemies and grind them into dust, then claim our victory when they can resist us no longer!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_1:0 "Minutiae of Revolution"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_1_desc:0 "If the Revolution is to succeed, then we must mobilize everything and everykirin to support it. Any able-bodied fighters we can get our hooves on will be given weapons and pressed into service, and our workshops, though not as efficient as the industrial factories of Fragrance, will work day and night to produce whatever equipment we need to win!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_2A:0 "All Must Give!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_2A_desc:0 "All weapons are needed for this fight for the soul of our blessed Realm. Every antique blade, black powder musket, and rusty set of armor must be turned over to Concord's holy army so that it may do battle against the forces of Vermilion. We will fight tooth and nail, and we will triumph!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_2B:0 "Rally the Kirin"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_2B_desc:0 "Arise Kirin of the west! Concord calls you to action! The decadent and faithless have led our nation to ruin and have failed to deliver on their supposed divine mandate. It is up to all of you to forge in blood and fire a new order for the faithful!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_3:0 "The Matriarch-Protector"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_3_desc:0 "High Priestess Rising Sun has led the west through many dark moments to prepare for this struggle. Only she has Concord's divine mandate to protect Kiria and bring it back to prosperity, and while we struggle to rescue the Matriarch Superior in Vermilion, Concord has chosen Rising Sun to be our Matriarch-Protector and lead us to victory!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_4A:0 "A Make-Do Government"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_4A_desc:0 "Everything we do, we do for the good of the Realm. When we call upon our followers to give what they can, they give without complaint, knowing that everything they give us, we use to the best of our abilities, unlike wasteful and apathetic Vermilion. Together, we sacrifice for the greater good, and one day, we shall partake of the fruits of our hard labors."
KIR_republic_focus_shared_4B:0 "Piety and Patriotism!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_4B_desc:0 "To be pious is to be patriotic, and to be a patriot is to stand among the pious. Our revolution to liberate Kiria and realize Concord's divine will cannot be accomplished without pious patriots from all throughout the Realm. Worship and give thanks to Concord, for she believes in our revolution and will bring us to paradise!"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_5:0 "Industry of the West"
KIR_republic_focus_shared_5_desc:0 "While we lack industrialized machinery and resources, we know how to make use of our greatest resource: our patriotic and pious kirin, and the fervor they hold close to their hearts. If we decree something be constructed or assembled, they will find a way to do it, using little more than their hard work and endless labor. Say the word, and it shall be so!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2C:0 "Fortress Chrysanthemum"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2C_desc:0 "Chrysanthemum is a fortress without walls, a castle without a moat, yet still it will stand stronger and more resolute than either. For the people of Chrysanthemum are its defense, the stones and mortar that hold up its walls, and should any enemy try to take our Fortress Chrysanthemum, they shall know no respite from our brave partisans fighting in the streets!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3B:0 "Defenders of the Path"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3B_desc:0 "As the struggle against Vermilion grows ever bloodier, there are those that rise above the rest and make their value known. Hoof-picked by Concord herself to lead our revolution to the realization of her divine will, these kirin are true patriots that we cannot do without."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4A:0 "An Army of Guerillas"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4A_desc:0 "Everywhere the enemy turns, they will find the faithful arranged against them. If we cannot beat them on the open field of battle, then we shall attack from behind their lines. If we cannot beat them under the bright sun, then we shall beat them under the cover of night. The faithful will be everywhere, and our enemies will know no peace."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4B:0 "Verdant's Liberation"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4B_desc:0 "Verdant is the place where it all began, where the island communities professed the first tenets of our faith that would become the Rising Fire. For too long, it has been held in Vermilion's hooves. It is time to take the birthplace of our revolution back, and free the City of Stilts from the Way of Fire!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4C:0 "Sparks that Set the Prairie Ablaze"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_4C_desc:0 "The revolution against Vermilion is a holy revolution for the safety and future of the Realm, and kirin all throughout it grow ever-more disillusioned with Vermilion's apathy. To turn the peasants of Kiria against Vermilion and incite them to rise up everywhere, all it takes is a few well-placed agitators and a hoofful of newspapers, for even a single spark can start a prairie fire."

KIR_republic_focus_SR_2A:0 "The Fury of the Pious"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_2A_desc:0 "Oh holy Concord! Deliver onto your faithful servants triumph! Our fire shall burn hot like the fire of creation! The Primordial Flame sealed inside our Nirik forms shall be the guiding torch of our victory over those who have failed you. Give us strength so that we may be your torch, and our strength shall never be tainted by fear."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3A:0 "Steel for the Forges"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3A_desc:0 "The lands of the west are poor in resources, but not in ingenuity. Over the years, our people have amassed collections of metal objects, from plows to woks and everything in between. We will call out to the commoners to donate what they can, and we shall use the donations of the faithful as steel for our forges."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3C:0 "The People's Workshops"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3C_desc:0 "Without factories, our industrial base is entirely centered around small, inefficient workshops that employ a dozen or so kirin each. But what we lack in quality, we can more than make up for in quantity. We shall organize a drive to create more workshops throughout our lands, and working together, these workshops will be able to keep pace with the industrial powerhouses of Vermilion and Fragrance."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4C:0 "The Path Militant"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4C_desc:0 "Our military is centered around the communes throughout the Realm, with each village and commune acting as a local command center for our forces in the field. As the war drags on, they have become more efficient and more militant in their beliefs, allowing our soldiers to fight better and with greater fervor than before."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_5B:0 "Seize the Libraries"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_5B_desc:0 "The written word can be a source of great knowledge and wealth, but unfortunately, our own lands are short on books and knowledge on the latest technological advancements. Everywhere we go, we must make good use of seizing any and all knowledge we can get our hooves on, and bring it back to Chrysanthemum to study and reverse-engineer it."

KIR_republic_focus_SR_1A:0 "Priest-Commissars"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_1A_desc:0 "As our forces march into battle, they shall all be accompanied by priest-commissars comprised of our most faithful and fervent mystics. With the priests' prayers spurring them onwards, our soldiers will fight even better, knowing that even if they die, their sparks will be returned to the Primordial Flame, and they shall be watched over by Concord Herself."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_1B:0 "Doctrine of Momentum"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_1B_desc:0 "The further we press into Kiria, the more unstoppable we become. Success breeds success, and as Vermilion begins to crumble, the kirin of the Realm will realize that Concord has entrusted her divine will to us, not to the pretenders in the capital. Like an avalanche, what is started cannot be stopped, and instead only grows stronger until all who stand in its way are swept aside and destroyed!"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_2C:0 "One Million Strong"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_2C_desc:0 "Our cause is one held near and dear to the hearts of every patriotic and pious kirin of the Realm, and as such, we have no shortage of recruits both young and old to fill our ranks. So long as a single kirin of the west still draws breath, then the revolution has not failed!"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_2B:0 "Do Your Duty!"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_2B_desc:0 "Everykirin must do their service to Concord. Everykirin has value to the fight ahead. Nokirin stands alone against the heretics of Vermilion. We shall exact divine justice together or we shall all meet our deaths, and as the holy missionaries of Concord, we can not afford to die."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3B:0 "Ploughshares to Swords"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_3B_desc:0 "Everywhere the enemy treads, if there is a kirin able to fight, then we will fight. Farmers and laborers, strong and proud from working the fields their entire lives, still have scythes and pitchforks they can use in battle if need be. Wherever the enemy advances, we shall mobilize everykirin we can to turn them back and destroy them."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4A:0 "Charity of the People"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4A_desc:0 "The peasants grow food not only for themselves, but for the Realm as a whole. The fruits of their labor are meant to further the worship of Concord, and right now, there is no better way to worship Concord than to supply our soldiers in the field. Knowing that, our peasants will be more than happy to donate whatever they can to keep our soldiers in the fight."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4B:0 "The Sanctified Banners"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_4B_desc:0 "If we are to be successful, we cannot afford to suffer dissent and dissidents within our holdings. Any who oppose or work to subvert the righteous path of the Rising Fire will be rooted out and destroyed. We will not suffer heretics and we will not suffer traitors. Concord will not allow it."
KIR_republic_focus_SR_5A:0 "Leading From the Front"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_5A_desc:0 "How can we preach the revolution if we do not show that we are willing to fight and die for it? We cannot afford to stay static and grow disconnected with the pious fight happening at the front. Where the army ventures, so too will our capital, and with Rising Sun among the soldiers at the front, they will be inspired to overcome any hurdle, no matter how difficult!"
KIR_republic_focus_SR_6:0 "Kiria, To Arms!" ##Not One Less! - save this title for FRV.
KIR_republic_focus_SR_6_desc:0 "Victory is close! All we must do is fight a little harder, a little longer! Now is not the time to grow lazy and complacent. Everykirin must fight twice as hard to achieve victory! Concord's divine will cannot be stopped!"

KIR_republic_focus_BH_1A:0 "Calculus of Necessity"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_1A_desc:0 "Our enemies are too strong and numerous to best in a stand up fight. But that does not mean we cannot fight. The deeper into our lands they drive, the more they will suffer. Villages will fight to the last, and they will have to pay with lives for every inch of ground taken. Through cold calculus and unwavering determination, we will defeat the unstoppable tiger with a simple stick."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_1B:0 "The Scorched Earth"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_1B_desc:0 "We cannot afford to let our enemy march into our lands and live off of them as they try to crush Concord's divine will. Everywhere they advance, they will find nothing but scorched fields and burned villages, and their supply lines will be constantly under attack and pressure. We may starve, but they will starve with us."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2A:0 "Do Your Part!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2A_desc:0 "No matter how hard we fight, we cannot win if we do not have enough kirin willing to fight and die for the revolution. We shall send out bannerkirin into every last village and find new recruits for the army. Everykirin must do their part, and everykirin must be willing to die to achieve victory. Only then can Concord's divine will be realized."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2B:0 "Concord's Apostles"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_2B_desc:0 "The strength of the Rising Fire lies in its connection and understanding of the commonkirin, not in its opulent ceremonies and majesty like the Way of Fire. The commoners have always been receptive to our message, and so we shall send out preachers and mystics into Vermilion's lands to agitate insurgency and uprisings. Vermilion cannot defeat us if their homefront is in turmoil!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3A:0 "Metal and Mettle"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3A_desc:0 "We only need one thing to defeat our enemies in Vermilion, and that is the mettle to fight on when everything seems hopeless and lost. All throughout our lands, all patriotic and pious kirin will fight with whatever they can find, and everykirin will strive to strike one of Vermilion's dogs down. Every soldier we kill brings us one step closer to victory!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3C:0 "Fight for Every Inch"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_3C_desc:0 "Even when battles are lost, if the soldiers survive to fight another day, then we can still win. We will attack our enemy everywhere we can, whether that be on the front lines or in their reserves. Every inch of our land will be paid for in blood, and soon Vermilion's forces will drown in a sea of crimson!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_5A:0 "A Rifle in Every Hoof"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_5A_desc:0 "We cannot hope to win this war using only simple weapons forever. Sooner or later, we will run out of bodies to throw at the enemy. If we are to survive, then we need to put modern rifles in the hooves of every soldier, bringing us to parity with our enemies."
KIR_republic_focus_BH_5B:0 "Vanguards of the Land"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_5B_desc:0 "As the war drags on, our soldiers in the field have gained valuable experience fighting a powerful enemy. The best of the best have been organized into our vanguard companies, our light infantry capable of punching above their weight and checking Vermilion's advances. We must put greater emphasis on Vanguard recruitment and build up a bigger force of these valuable soldiers!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_6:0 "Revolution or Death!"
KIR_republic_focus_BH_6_desc:0 "Everykirin must understand that death is preferable to defeat! If we lose, then the Realm will once more be under the grip of the hedonists and the corrupt, but if we die, then we die knowing that we did our part to stop them. Revolution or Death! There are no alternatives!"

kirin.1.t:0 "Daybreak Over Vermilion"
kirin.1.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine set her brush aside and watched as the last of the black ink dried on the flattened scroll of parchment before her. It had taken her weeks to get to this point, but now, for the first time in her 36 years of rule, she had signed an Imperial decree that would be read all throughout the Realm of Kiria. With that final brushstroke, and with the copies that the scribes would make in the morning and distribute to the far reaches of the country, The Silence, her mother's legacy, would come to an end after over a century of stagnation and decay.\n\nIt did not make her happy. If anything, Rain Shine felt nervous, wondering if what she was doing was the right thing for her subjects — subjects she had never met before. But her thoughts were stolen away from that when a servant entered and announced that Autumn Blaze was waiting to see her, and the mare in question entered a few moments later at Rain Shine's behest. Autumn bowed before her Matriarch, though Rain Shine keenly noted the awe and reverence the lesser kirin offered her at witnessing her regal body, and stood up. "You wished to see me, Matriarch?" Autumn asked.\n\n"I did," Rain Shine said, and her magic lifted a separate scroll off of her desk, neatly wrapped in a vermilion ribbon, and passed it to Autumn Blaze, who took it in her own telekinetic grip. "With The Silence ending, I am bringing together kirin from all across the Realm to discuss how we can rebuild our nation and bring it into the modern age. I am calling the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival... and as the mare who was so instrumental in helping the Equestrian delegation reach Vermilion, I want you to be its Premier."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked shocked at the sudden responsibility, but she nevertheless nodded and bowed again. "I... I'm not sure if I'm ready for that responsibility, Matriarch, but if you think so..."\n\nRain Shine cut her off with a wave of her hoof and an assuring smile."
kirin.1.a:0 ""You will do well, Autumn. I know this much.""

kirin.2.t:0 "A Letter from Autumn Blaze"
kirin.2.d:0 "Dear Applejack and Fluttershy,\n\nOh, I hope this letter reaches you two; it's not like Kiria hasn't had a functional postal system in a century, right? The hoops I had to go through just to send a piece of paper halfway across the world... \n\nI got a new job! Matriarch Superior Rain Shine (you remember her, right? The really tall kirin?) decided to call kirin from all across the realm to Vermilion to participate in the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival, and she made ME its premier! Talk about a leap in responsibility, right? I guess the Matriarch saw something in me when I helped you two make the last leg of the journey from Massicot to Vermilion. It's a lot to take on, and I'm not sure I'm the best kirin for the job, but I'll give it my best regardless!\n\nBut you should see Vermilion now! When you left, it was like a sleepy teenager asking for five more minutes of sleep, but now the city is absolutely bustling. I've never seen anything like it before! There are so many kirin from all over the realm pouring in every day to attend the Plenum, and there's this wonderful, colorful feeling of hope and excitement just buzzing through the air. I've spent a LOT of time meeting all the delegates I'll be working with during the Plenum, and two in particular really stuck out. The first is Winter Frost, one of our Way of Fire priestesses from Rhapsody, who's a bit of a stickler for tradition and knows way more about our fire goddess, Concord, than I could ever hope to learn. She's brought a whole bunch of priests and mystics in from across the realm to participate in the Plenum, and though I never studied our religion too hard, I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about. The other kirin is a fellow called Fickle Current who's been living in Griffonia all his life. I didn't even know what Griffonia was until last month! But he's the grandson of some businesskirin who fled the realm when The Silence started, and he brought a lot of the kirin diaspora back with him to start fixing up the homeland. They even arrived at the capital in automobiles imported from Griffonia, which pretty much nokirin in the capital had ever seen before. To say he made a grand entrance would be an understatement, though I think that rubbed Winter Frost and her mystics the wrong way; the two of them don't seem like they got off on the right hoof, so to say. But I'm confident with time we'll be able to smooth those issues out at the Plenum. After all, we're all working together to better our nation, right?\n\nI hope you're doing well! Wish us the best of luck for the Plenum, because we're gonna need it!"
kirin.2.a:0 "Your friend, Premier Autumn Blaze"

kirin.3.t:0 "A Letter from the Premier"
kirin.3.d:0 "Most Divine Matriarch Superior,\n\nToday marks a week since you decreed that the imperial heralds would fan out across the realm and deliver the news of the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival to the kirin of your domain. I'm pleased to report that the decree is proceeding swimmingly, apart from a few hiccups here and there, and your subjects are finally learning that The Silence is over. I've already been receiving reports from the envoys in the field that many towns and settlements are taking to the streets with joy and excitement, and I understand their feelings perfectly. You, Matriarch, are blessed with a lifespan that lasts twice as long as the rest of us, thanks to Concord's divine favor, so time must seem to feel twice as fast. Sixty years is hardly half your strengthened lifespan, but an entire generation of kirin has been born, raised, grown old, and is now passing on in that same time, having only known The Silence their entire lives. In a century from now, The Silence will have only been a fraction of your life, while it has come to dominate the lives of all of your subjects; ending it now and starting a new chapter for the kirin species fills all of us with joy and excitement at what tomorrow brings. The hardships we all were born into and lived through will soon feel like a distant memory now that we all, together, get to shape our destiny, and for that, you have won the undying love and devotion of all your subjects. I don't think I can possibly overstate just how great of a change this will be for all of us.\n\nEven still, I know this won't be easy, nor will the future we create for Kiria be what everykirin desires. Some kirin want to rapidly modernize us to catch up to the rest of the world, while others are far more cautious, remembering the disasters of modernization under your mother's rule. There will probably be bickering and arguing and fighting, but good things don't come to those who wait. They have to be fought for, and that's what we'll all be doing at the Plenum. With your guidance, I know we can create a bright new future for all kirin, and I'm thrilled to serve by your side.\n\nLet's do this together, and let's do it right."

kirin.4.t:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward"
kirin.4.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine momentarily hesitated as she took to the podium placed on the steps before the imperial palace. Her red eyes shifted downwards and scanned over the hundreds... no, thousands of faces staring up at her. She had to remind herself that this was the first time most of her subjects had ever seen her in person. Rarely had she ventured outside of the palace walls all her life, and even rarer still had been any occasions to speak to her subjects, or let them speak to her. Her ascension through her mother's funeral pyre had been a quiet and closed affair within the palace walls, and only imperial proclamations to the kirin of Vermilion would have let any know that a change in leadership had taken place 36 years ago. Now, she stood before them as their new Matriarch Superior, ready to lead them out of the darkness of The Silence that had stifled kirin society for so long.\n\n"My faithful and loyal subjects," Rain Shine began, glancing down at the prepared speech in front of her and then back at the crowd. "I know this is the first time most of you have ever seen your Matriarch. I know this is the first time you have ever heard my voice. But a new era for Kiria could not begin without allowing you to meet me. I am not my mother. I am not the mare who created the decrees and laws that created what we call today The Silence. I am not Noctilucent Charm, but I am her daughter. And today, I will begin the atonement for my mother's mistakes."\n\nSurprised murmuring passed through the crowd, and Rain Shine let that proclamation sink in before continuing. "I have set in motion a series of decrees and appointments that will bring about the end of The Silence," she said. "Today is the beginning of a new era for Kiria. But I alone cannot forge our future. It is time for all the kirin of the Realm to join me in this future we create together. The kirin people must join me on a Grand Gallop Onward, a leap that will see us modernize our industry, our technology, our agriculture, and our science. This realm that has been entrusted to us by Concord is blessed by her wisdom and favor. We kirin are an ingenious people, a people who are intimately familiar with the creative and destructive force of fire. We will use our gifts to make the most of Concord's blessing. Through hard work, grit, and fervent devotion to the fire goddess, the Realm of Kiria WILL emerge from The Silence to become a world power within a decade. There is nothing that we cannot accomplish together! So I ask you, kirin of the Realm... will you join me in The Grand Gallop Onward?"\n\nThunderous applause and ecstatic cheering was the crowd's response, seemingly audible across the entirety of the Realm."
kirin.4.a:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward begins today!"

kirin.5.t:0 "Émigrés Return Home"
kirin.5.d:0 "Fickle Current watched from Fragrance's harbor as another ship pulled into port. The ships had been arriving in Kiria's northernmost port city by the day, each one loaded with dozens of kirin making the return to their ancestral homelands. These were the kirin of the diaspora, descendents of kirin who had the good sense to flee the Realm when The Silence began. Many had longed for home their whole lives, to reconnect with their people and their families, but unwilling to sacrifice their livelihoods to scratch out an impoverished living in squalor that such a move would force upon them. But now, with The Silence ending and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine inviting all kirin living abroad to return home and help modernize the nation, the diaspora had found the excuse it had been looking for to finally cease living abroad like exiles and return home as heroes.\n\nThe ship in front of Current had sailed in from Griffonia, judging by the flags hanging from its smokestacks, and the businesskirin pushed against the crowd surging off of the ship to find one particular face. He found it on the body of a green kirin with a white mane, and as soon as the two recognized each other, they stepped forward and embraced on the docks. "Current!" the green stallion exclaimed. "So good to see you! I feel like it's been years!"\n\n"Only a few, Cypress Snow, but years it has been." The two kirin stepped back, and then Cypress followed Current as the two began to move toward an automobile parked on the cobblestone roads by the docks. "I'm glad you came," Current continued as they walked. "Though I imagine giving up a position at Greenback University had to have been rough."\n\n"Not as rough as trying to educate you back in the day," Cypress joked. "But my talents will be better suited here than in Yale. The kirin here are in desperate need of somebody to educate them. We have to bring the Realm's standards up to snuff with the rest of the world, or we will be left behind."\n\nThe two sat down in the back of the automobile, and the driver slowly pulled away from the harbor. "The return of the diaspora is something the Realm desperately needs," Current agreed. "The kirin living here are all poor peasants living in the mud of their farms. The Realm needs us if it's ever going to make itself great again, even if half of these farmers see us as foreigners trying to end their way of life. But I imagine the Matriarch will amply reward us for saving her nation when all is said and done.""
kirin.5.a:0 ""She will owe everything to kirin like us. That's a powerful debt to hold.""

kirin.6.t:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
kirin.6.d:0 "Autumn Blaze let out a sigh of relief and stretched her sore legs as the last of the bills to lay the foundation of the All-Kiria Collegium, Kiria's first modern university and heavily inspired by academics from Yale, finally passed the floor by a razor thin margin. The contentious issue that had turned what should have been a good idea everykirin could agree on into a parliamentary nightmare had been the university's stance on religion: the university was officially secular, and would not make mandatory the attendance of sermons and the observance of holy days that were crucial to The Way of Fire. Winter Frost's religious clique had fought tooth and nail to reject the proposed university's secularism, claiming that it would corrupt kirin intellectuals for generations to come and only breed heresy and disrespect for Concord, while Fickle Current and his proposed president of the new school, Cypress Snow, had claimed that removing religion from the lecture hall would allow new ideas to grow without the shackles of tradition and mysticism to hold them down. The debate had been furious and lasted for hours, and in the end, it fell on Autumn Blaze and her supporters to decide the matter in Current's favor. The university would be secular, and Cypress Snow would be its president.\n\nBut that had not been the end of it. As soon as the floor cleared from the vote, Winter Frost stood up in her booth and put her hooves on the vermilion rail separating the seats from the plenum center. "If we are going to plant the seeds of heresy in our garden, we must at least have somekirin to watch over it and pluck the weeds as necessary," she began. "I motion that the Collegium be placed under the jurisdiction of the Reform Bureau. This kind of right-wing radicalism that Current and his cronies bathe in must not be allowed to breed at our academic centers, or we will have turned our backs on Concord and the Matriarch Superior!"\n\nFickle Current was quick to respond, hopping to his hooves after only having taken his seat moments before. "You lost the fight over the university, and now you wish to cripple what you cannot control!" he spat back at her. "The traditionalists control the Reform Bureau; you would stifle our academics instead of letting them grow and blossom." Before Frost could respond, he turned to Autumn Blaze and addressed her directly. "Premier, your faction decided the last vote, so put an end to this one as well. Do not let Winter Frost and her traditionalists censor this university, or the future of the kirin literati will suffer for it.""

kirin.7.t:0 "Verdant in Bloom"
kirin.7.d:0 ""There is another issue I want to talk to you about."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked up from her tea at Fickle Current, a small frown curving her lips as she met Fickle Current's eyes. The businesskirin always wore a suit, and today was no different, even in the heat outdoors. It made him look intelligent and sharp, but also marked him as an outsider, somekirin who hadn't lived in the Realm during The Silence, instead thriving in Griffonia until the time was right to return to the home of his grandparents. Every time he said something, Autumn had to remind herself that the two of them might as well be different species; the only thing they had in common was their race, and their hopes for bringing the Realm out of the dark century of The Silence—though even in that, they differed.\n\n"These 'Rising Fire' heretics... they're growing ever more powerful in Verdant," Current continued, unaware of or simply indifferent about Autumn's frown. "Communalists who think that The Silence was a beneficial realignment of kirin society, and that our treasured Way of Fire has failed us. They've even started attracting Marksists and Stallionists to their numbers. You know what those are, correct? A violent revolutionary ideology that thrives in toppling monarchy and castrating the beneficial ventures of capitalism?"\n\n"In some opinions, yes," Autumn demurred. "But I believe in the Grand Gallop Onward. We can incorporate everykirin's ideas into rebuilding our nation. Cooperation makes us stronger."\n\n"And divisions make us weaker. They must be stopped, and they must be crushed now before it is too late," Current urged her. "Use the power of your position to officially denounce and disperse this filthy corner of our society. Do it now, before their heresy grows, and our Matriarch Superior is the next monarch to be overthrown.""
kirin.7.a:0 ""I believe in the Grand Gallop Onward. How can we gallop on if we leave kirin behind?""
kirin.7.b:0 ""The risk of the Rising Fire heretics joining forces with Marksists is too great.""

kirin.8.t:0 "The Banners of Vermilion"
kirin.8.d:0 "Rain Shine stood in the massive plaza of the open-air Verdigris Rotunda outside of the imperial palace, counting the numerous colorful feathered banners fluttering in the slight breeze of the dreary day. A small drizzle had settled over Vermilion, and two of her palace servants used their magic to keep the rain off of her regal body, but the kirin assembled in the plaza before her stood tall, stoic, and proud. Some were young, barely more than colts and fillies, while some were older, their scales weathered and cracked with the passage of time. But one thing drew them all together, and those were the colorful banners they rallied around.\n\n"You few, you proud, gallant few," Rain Shine began, addressing the crowd with a respectful dip of her head. "You are the children, grandchildren, or even great grandchildren of the last soldiers to serve in my mother's Thousand Banners. Your ancestors served well in the Thousand Banners, and were rewarded amply with land upon which to start a family when they retired. Their children, and their children's children, served after them in the Banners. Like my own family, your families became strong military dynasties that will survive the worst the world can throw at them... even something like The Silence."\n\nHer eyes shifted to look out on the plaza, noting all the empty space unoccupied by the tiny gathering of kirin in front of her. "I summoned you here through imperial decree because it is time to rebuild the Thousand Banners of Vermilion. You will be the first to serve me, should you choose to follow in the hoofsteps of your ancestors. You will be made captains and officers, and you will protect the Realm from any threats, just as your forebears did. There are not a thousand banners standing before me, true, but I look forward to the day when this rotunda is filled with a thousand colorful banners, like a rainbow fallen onto the earth. But the first banners... they will be yours, and they will be honored by Concord's blessing. So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm: who will step forward and serve their Matriarch?"\n\nShe did not have to wait long for a response. One by one, the kirin under each banner stepped forward, carrying their banners with them for Rain Shine to bless with a touch of her magic. One by one, they knelt before her and swore their oaths to the Realm, just as their ancestors once did long ago. And one by one, Kiria earned its Banners back on that day."

kirin.9.t:0 "Harmony, Heritage, Homeland"
kirin.9.d:0 "As the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival goes on, what was originally a call for reform—Harmony, Heritage, Homeland—has become a rallying cry for the three cliques that have swiftly formed with the Plenum's maturation. Premier Autumn Blaze and her supporters advocate for Harmony, a platform of liberal reformism that seeks to align the Realm of Kiria with the ideas and tenets of the Equestrian model. Renowned priestess Winter Frost and the religious sect of the Plenum believe in the kirin heritage, seeking to remember the traditions that once made Kiria a wonderful and prosperous nation, and to remember the Way of Fire and the fire goddess Concord for bringing the oftentimes violent kirin race together into a peaceful theocracy, an ideal once thought impossible six centuries ago. Those who have made Homeland their rallying cry are led by Fickle Current, the grandson of businesskirin who fled the Realm a century ago when The Silence began, and who has now become the leading voice for the return of the kirin diaspora and literati. All three have very different ideas of how to modernize the nation and shake off the vestiges of The Silence, and in many aspects, their ideas are incompatible with each other's. As the debates and deliberations drag on, one of these factions will eventually find an edge over their competitors and win more delegates over to their side. The question now becomes the following: which faction is the one truly blessed by Concord's divine wisdom?"
kirin.9.a:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze's liberal reformism!"

kirin.10.t:0 "In the Hall of the Matriarch Superior"
kirin.10.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine watched the delegates assemble in their seats for the day's session of the Plenum with a note of concern. What had started out as a heterogenous mixture of kirin and their ideas at the beginning of the plenum had differentiated itself into three homogenous groups as time went on, with kirin attaching themselves to cliques of like-minded individuals and all sitting grouped together. Discussion and mingling between the delegates had all but ceased, and now the delegates had firmly attached themselves to their preferred leader and ideals: Premier Autumn Blaze and her liberal reformists, Priestess Winter Frost and her traditionalist sect, and the businesskirin Fickle Current and his cabal of capitalists. Those three factions had turned the free-flowing exchange of ideas into hard-fought political debates, most of which were only resolved when two cliques ganged up on the third to enforce their compromise over the other party. Her presence as Matriarch Superior forced her delegates to take a step back and calm down when they began to get angry, lest one transform into a nirik in the presence of their Matriarch, yet even still, tempers readily flared.\n\nBut even her powerful and respected presence nearly failed in controlling the assembly when the doors opened and a large procession of priests and mystics in vibrant red and gold robes entered the hall, followed by a score of poor farmers. They had barely begun to fill out a bank of empty seats before Winter Frost jumped to her hooves and spat in their direction. "Heretic!" the priestess raged, pointing a hoof directly at the fiery mare who led the procession in. "Your twisted mockery of the Way of Fire is not welcome before the sacred presence of our Matriarch Superior! Leave now, or I will drag you down the palace steps and toss you out of Vermilion myself!"\n\nWinter Frost's fellow mystics joined their voices to hers, and even some of Fickle Current's clique and Autumn Blaze's allies began to boo and hiss as the Premier struggled for control. Yet none of that seemed to disturb the newcomers' leader, who simply turned about to face Rain Shine directly and bowed low. "Divine Matriarch, my name is Rising Sun, and my followers have traveled a long way to meet you," she said. Her voice was shrewd and sweet, and when Rain Shine looked into the mare's eyes, she saw a cunning cleverness hiding in their fiery depths. "You have called, and the kirin of the west have answered. The Path of the Rising Fire is here to participate in this renewal of our great nation... so long as you will have us.""

Autumn Blaze looked around the Plenum, trying to assess the thoughts and feelings of her peers as they brought the topic to table. She didn't have to wait long for Winter Frost to speak, and frowned when the priestess waved a dismissive hoof. "The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort. "The mystics of the Way of Fire have had sole representation to our Matriarchs for hundreds of years. During The Silence, they were so focused on meditation and spirituality that they failed to clue the Matriarch in on how the common kirin suffered under her mother's decrees. The Silence wouldn't have lasted this long had the Morning Secretariat had a few voices who weren't obsessed with the Way of Fire on it. We need more diverse representation. I move that we elect a new Morning Secretariat from the members gathered here in the Plenum, to advise the Matriarch on matters of our rapidly changing state as we modernize."\n\n"I agree," Fickle Current cut in from across the room. "Our Matriarch, blessed as she is with Concord's wisdom, will not be well served by traditionalists stuck in the past, when the Realm's future is in the... well, future. I will support your plan, Premier, but in return, I ask a favor." The businesskirin made a show of clearing his throat and raised his voice to make his words clear to the rest of the Plenum. "Ever since the tragedy of 902, the merchant class has been banned from seeking audiences with the Matriarch, let alone approach her in any official capacity as an advisor. I ask that the merchant class be allowed to serve on the Secretariat, and additionally, ten of the seventy seats will be reserved for business and industry representatives. It is they, after all, who are providing the backbone for the Realm's modernization.""

Autumn Blaze snapped out of her daydreaming, Fickle Current's sudden proposal bringing her squarely back into reality. She wasn't alone in that: the rest of the kirin assembled in the Plenum audibly gasped, including some of Current's own clique, and none more so than Winter Frost's traditionalist sect. "We cannot expect business and industry to be beholden to the teachings of The Way of Fire when our religious fundamentals were laid down before modernization of today's scale was scarcely dreamed of," Current continued, pushing on with a firm voice against the agitations of the Plenum. "Modernization relies squarely on one thing, and that is the free flowing river of currency from the hooves of the buyer into the hooves of the seller. When we are talking about the modernization of the present, thousands of tons of gold will exchange hooves in a season, and all of it has to be accounted for. Splitting off a portion of this gold in tithes will only hamper the rapid pace of modernization. What use does Concord have for our gold, I ask you? If we are to move forward as a nation and as a society, the stranglehold Concord's temples have on our economy must be loosened for the greater good. I therefore move that the tithes be abolished and sacred lands held by temples and monasteries be opened up for public use and private investment in an effort to speed up the modernization of the Realm."\n\n"You reject tradition!" Winter Frost screamed, and Autumn felt her gut clench as the priestess briefly flickered with fire and fury. "You do not know what it means to be a kirin! You are a foreigner trying to shape our nation in the image of heathens! Have you traded Concord's divine spark for a griffon's boundless greed?"\n\nThe temperature in the Plenum rose, both figuratively and literally, as tempers began to flare. Thankfully, it was Rain Shine who stepped forward and put a stop to the brewing catastrophe merely by standing up. When the Plenum fell silent, she narrowed her eyes at everykirin assembled.

But the Plenum could not be fair if all kirin didn't have a chance to speak...\n\n"Thank you." Rising Sun raised her head from her bow, stepped out into the center of the Plenum, and turned to address her peers. She took only a moment to collect her thoughts before she began. "Mountains are not forever," she began, her piercing eyes slowly sweeping across the crowd. "Expecting a mountain to stand tall and resolute for ten thousand years is a foal's folly. They change with the weather, worn down season by season. What yesterday we thought was unchangeable will be tomorrow changed. So too must our teachings and our doctrines. Five centuries ago, The Way of Fire was the tallest peak in the mountain range, but it is different today that it was then. There is no shame in changing and adapting to fit the times," she said, her eyes stopping on Winter Frost for a moment before continuing on. "We must change and adapt if we want to survive. But we do not dam a river when instead it could be rerouted," she said, and this time her gaze settled on Fickle Current with a slight frown. "Common sense guides the spirit of Kiria now just as it did back then. We do not need to pretend the problems of today are the same as they were a century ago, nor do we need to pretend that we must start over if we are to combat them. The Way of Fire will learn to adapt with the forces of modernization, to work with it as a graceful dance partner, promoting equality, justice, peace, and harmony for all kirinkind. It will not be swept away by modernization, but instead will guide it to a brighter dawn. It will not abandon our sacred traditions, but seamlessly marry them to the future we create for ourselves here today. So I ask you, kirin of the Plenum, this simple question: why choose yesterday or tomorrow, when we could live together in the new today that we make for ourselves?"\n\nSomehow, Rising Fire's stirring words had moved kirin from all across the Plenum to applaud her speech. The delegates would vote as she saw fit, Autumn Blaze concluded, but she frowned as she spent a few more moments to dissect the priestess' words. She had never used the term 'The Rising Fire' to label her beliefs, but Autumn knew that it was what she'd proposed. The heretic was slowly worming new ideas into the Plenum, but there was nothing Autumn could do except hold a slight frown as Rising Sun grinned at her and the votes were cast."

kirin.14.d_1:0 "Priestess Winter Frost did her best to hide her scowl as she watched her Matriarch Superior surrender her absolute authority over the Realm with ink brushed on paper. The entire Plenum had been moved outside to the steps of the Vermilion Palace, where Rain Shine read her latest imperial decree to the kirin of the capital, turning its words into law with her divine voice. But those words were not hers. Instead, they were the conniving traitors' words read through the Matriarch's voice, turning blasphemy into religious creed and curtailing Concord's divine influence on the world by weakening Her avatar. It made her blood boil, but she kept it all hidden under a neutral expression. A priestess of The Way of Fire could not go against the decisions of her Matriarch, no matter how much they irked her.\n\nInstead, she directed her ire toward Fickle Current and his cronies, their pleased expressions sickening her to her stomach. Not two days had passed since Current and the rest of his Griffonia-educated ilk had proposed a charter that stripped away much of Rain Shine's power under the pretense of simplifying and codifying the Realm's governance. Her divine authority had been transformed into legal power and stolen from her court by the Morning Secretariat, which Current and his friends had a very strong hoof in. Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\nWinter Frost wasted no time in separating with her clique when the decree was finished and the delegates were allowed to go their separate ways. The less time she had to spend in the traitors' presence, the better. Something would have to be done about them, she told herself, lest the Kiria she knew and loved one day ceased to be."

A priestess of The Way of Fire could not go against the decisions of her Matriarch, no matter how much they irked her.\n\nInstead, she directed her ire toward Fickle Current and his cronies, their pleased expressions sickening her to her stomach. Not two days had passed since Current and the rest of his Griffonia-educated ilk had proposed a charter that stripped away much of Rain Shine's power under the pretense of simplifying and codifying the Realm's governance. Her divine authority had been transformed into legal power and stolen from her court by the Morning Secretariat, which Current and his friends had a very strong hoof in. Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\n"How foolish," Rising Sun said by Winter Frost's side. "To think mortals could bend a Goddess' divine will to their own uses... perhaps The Way of Fire has lost the way?"\n\n"Quiet, heretic," Winter Frost hissed at her. "I do not need you making today any more intolerable than it already is."\n\nRising Sun merely chuckled at that. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch," she said. "This charter is just an unfortunate stopgap for the challenges we face. Our way survived The Silence, and it will survive this too." She gave Winter a sly smile as she added, "Perhaps one day you and I will see eye to eye on these things. We need not be enemies, not when our way of life is at stake.""

kirin.15.d:0 "Fickle Current slowly marched up the stairs toward the burnt-out town hall, passing by scores of kirin quietly sitting amongst the ashes in protest, their glares turned toward the imperial guards gathered around the perimeter. It was only his third time visiting Fragrance, his family's ancestral hometown, but this time he came as an ally in the government.\n\nAs soon as the news of the unrest in Kiria's once-largest city reached Vermilion, Current had immediately volunteered his time to go and resolve the matter on the Matriarch's behalf. As the procession of automobiles navigated the dirt roads between Vermilion and Fragrance, he had taken the time to read up on any information from Fragrance he could get his hooves on. As far as the reports went, Vermilion's attempt to assert its authority over its distant urban centers had been met with resistance in Fragrance, where the city's elected council refused to cede power to the Vermilion envoys up to the moment they were forcibly removed by the envoys' guard detail. The bad blood between Fragrance and Vermilion had boiled over, and a few nirik transformations had reduced the town hall to cinders. Now, the kirin protested by peacefully sitting in the courtyard of the demolished town hall, but the conviction in their beliefs had not died down in the slightest.\n\nAfter asking around, Current shortly found himself directed to Cherry Blossom, the city's mayor and organizer behind the protests. She looked up from the papers on her table as Current approached and frowned at him. "If you're here from Vermilion, then you might as well turn around and tell the Matriarch that we won't talk until her lapdogs are gone," she growled. "Fragrance refuses to negotiate with the sons of Vermilion."\n\n"What about a son of Fragrance who will turn your rags back into riches?" Current sat down across from her and set his hat down by his side. "My grandparents lost everything when The Silence ravaged our city, just like yours. But I'm back to make it right again. My friends are powerful, and they are the driving forces behind the repeal of The Silence and the return of Fragrance's industry. You have my word as a delegate of the Plenum and a devoted son of Fragrance that I will do everything in my power to return our city to its former glory by shaping Vermilion policy from within. All I ask of you is to stand back and stand by until our moment of glory comes."\n\nCherry Blossom scowled, but after a moment she nodded in agreement. "If you can save Fragrance, then by all means, do so," she said. "But know it will take a lot from Vermilion to undo a hundred years of suffering. Fragrance will not be humiliated a second time.""

kirin.16.d:0 "Autumn Blaze again touched the piece of paper rolled up and hidden inside one of the pockets in her vermilion and golden robes as she observed the festivities in the Garden of Tranquil Florescence. It had been her masterpiece of her time as premier so far, a sprawling and lively festival to welcome Kiria back into the modern world by inviting delegations from all across the world to witness the resurgence of kirin culture with the end of The Silence. Delegations from Equestria, Aquileia, Wingbardy, and the Griffonian Empire were all present, along with envoys from many other nations, all bedazzled by the spectacles of kirin folk songs and dances, pyrotechnics, gymnastics, the military drilling of the elite kirin Banners, and of course, seemingly endless kirin cuisine. The past two days had all been an effort to butter up the delegates and please them before giving her speech, in which she would politely ask for assistance from foreign nations in modernizing the Realm—modernizing a nation as large and disparate as Kiria within a few years would be impossible without outside help, after all. Hopefully, the foreign envoys would be able to secure favorable terms with their governments if they left Kiria pleased and amazed with what they saw.\n\nBut as Autumn prepared to give the speech, she still found herself wrestling with how to request foreign aid. Winter Frost and the traditionalists had pressured her to take a more moderate approach, to advocate for the righteousness of The Way of Fire and its tenet of living in harmony with nature rather than conquering it. Fickle Current, however, had urged her to found her request on Kiria's abundance of natural resources, simply waiting for foreign capital to be exploited and traded around the world. It left Autumn in an uncomfortable position: should she ask for help based on good faith and favors, or exchange the resources of her home for the money of foreigners?"

kirin.17.d:0 "To Premier Autumn Blaze,\n\nI am sending you this urgent message requesting support for the kirin of Hyacinth in recovering from a pirate attack. According to the locals, about three days before our imperial delegation arrived in the city to reassert the Matriarch Superior's authority over the coastal town, a large pirate armada appeared on the horizon and stormed the port. The pirates swiftly blockaded the port, disembarked from their ships, and stripped the town bare of any and all valuables the townsfolk possessed, even pressing some of the villagers into service aboard their ships before embarking again. Such raids are not uncommon, the villagers tell me, and have been a somewhat regular occurrence for decades, ever since a large pirate haven was established on the Auburn Isle just off of Hyacinth's coast. The pirates do not kill or burn, I am told, as they treat the coastal villages like fruit bearing trees to be cultivated and harvested when the time is right, yet the frequent raids on these villages have stifled their growth and left them too weak to fend for themselves.\n\nEvery village I visited along the coast told similar stories. It is clear that something needs to be done, but until we can rebuild a navy of our own, it seems unlikely that anything CAN be done. How are we supposed to reassert the Matriarch's divine rule over all the Realm if we cannot protect those living on our coasts? One way or another, these pirates must be brought to heel and their armada disbanded. It is the only way to create peace and prosperity for the fishing villages and harbor towns along the coast. Until the pirate menace is dealt with, we will struggle to truly end The Silence in all of Kiria, and our efforts at modernization will never be successful.\n\nPlease bring this matter to the Matriarch Superior's attention at the first chance you get. Her subjects depend on it.\n\nOur Matriarch's loyal servant,\nFirecracker"

kirin.18.d:0 ""The Plenum now moves onto the matter of the evaluation of laws passed as part of The Silence's decrees," Autumn Blaze said, pulling the next proposal across her desk and skimming over the brief attached to it. "Fickle Current, since this is your proposal, how about you get us started off?"\n\n"Gladly," the industrialist said and, standing up, he took the podium to address his fellow delegates. "Members of the Plenum, we have already gone so far in revoking and repealing many of the ill-advised decrees that constituted the hundred year decay that brought our nation to where it stands today," he said. "The faults in these decrees were easy to see and were dismissed accordingly; likewise, the laws that filled in the spaces between Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees should also be removed. Some of these laws explicitly ban little things like singing, dancing, and loud talking in public, and I think even priestess Winter Frost will agree with me that these measures are archaic and unnecessary in today's Kiria. Other laws, such as the banning of independent hierarchical organizations and capital punishment for nirik transformations, though seldom enforced, should likewise be removed. We must allow our society to grow with our nation, and these restrictions instead stunt it. Make nirik transformation a misdemeanor like public intoxication and do away with the rest, and we will be one step closer to a functional modern society."\n\nThough most kirin nodded in agreement, Winter Frost rose to voice her counterpoints. "While I may personally agree that some of these restrictions are trivial, were they not Concord's divine intention, passed through her previous avatar, Matriarch Charm?" she began. "Removing them would be blasphemy, and it is not up to us to decide what should be done. That is Matriarch Rain Shine's decision, not ours. But I must outright reject your proposal to remove the capital punishment on nirik transformations, Current. We need a strong deterrent to prevent the transformation into the nirik state, now more than ever. Remove that and we only feed more fuel to the fire. Tempers will flare, and another bout of nirik transformations will be the calamity that sees all our progress permanently undone. It is not a risk we can afford to take, and so the only way to control it is to punish it with the harshest penalty imaginable. So, kirin of the Plenum, do we abandon the safeguards that prevented the complete destruction of our nation a century ago, or do we remember our traditions and the reasons why these safeguards were implemented in the first place?""

kirin.19.d_1:0 "It was a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze calmly noted, to be able to gather with the leaders of the other factions and enjoy dinner and drinks together after a hard day of hammering out policy and reform at the Plenum. It wasn't every day that the clique leaders could put aside their differences and enjoy a meal together—Winter Frost and Fickle Current certainly weren't inviting each other over for tea after a long day arguing—but on the rare days when the Plenum could pass its agenda nearly unanimously (or at least without heated arguments), Autumn liked to take the two out for dinner afterwards and relax. It helped to remind everykirin that they were all kirin and partners in this endeavor, not enemies to be defeated.\n\n"I think we can all agree that the ending of the Quiescence was for the betterment of our realm," Fickle Current said as they waited for their meals to be brought out to them. "One by one, we've rolled back Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees that stifled our education system and banned the study of science, religion, and philosophy outside of what we already knew in 903. That's the mark of progress, right there."\n\n"The new freedom of information is helping us unravel more of Concord's mysteries," Winter Frost agreed. "Concord lives in science and philosophy as much as she does in our religion. The Way of Fire is not merely a matter of theology, it is the foundation of our society and everything that we do. Exploring how Concord's divinity influences the natural world around us is just as important as understanding how we can better strive to follow her teachings."\n\n"I recently read a report that came across my desk saying that the number of schools in the realm has multiplied a hundredfold in such a short time," Autumn added. "More kirin are gaining the gift of education than ever before, and at a higher quality than even we thought imaginable when we first started. That's cause for celebration, I think."\n\n"Agreed," Current said, and he lifted up his drink in his magic, prompting Autumn and Winter to do the same. "A toast, then, to Kiria's progress. We are making a dream that once seemed impossible into tomorrow's reality.""
kirin.19.d_2:0 "It was usually a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze noted, to gather her fellow leaders of the Plenum together for dinner after a successful and (mostly) argument-free day. It was a good way to remind everykirin that they were all on the same team and all wanted to modernize Kiria; just because they had different ideas on how to go about it, they weren't supposed to be enemies in this process. She had hoped that today would be another one of those days, where Winter Frost and Fickle Current could stop going at each other's throats for an evening over a shared enjoyment of a good meal, but it was clear that things weren't going according to plan.\n\n"Repealing the Quiescence was supposed to be a good step forward," Winter Frost bemoaned. "Opening up the study of science, religion, and philosophy was supposed to foster a renewed vigor in the exploration of The Way of Fire. But Rising Sun and her heretics have hijacked it for their own agenda! They're using modern printing presses to print thousands of copies of Her Incandescent Will, a text that was banned for good reason before The Silence, under the guise of freedom of speech! They twist Concord's divine will to suit their own heretical interpretations of a communalistic society. Who knows how many righteous followers that harlot has corrupted with her blasphemy? She should have been run out of Vermilion the moment she showed her face in the Matriarch's holy presence!"\n\nFickle Current remained unsympathetic. "Perhaps if your fellow mystics did not shun progress, Rising Sun would not be outcompeting you," he said. "You fear printing presses and the inventions of modern society. You try to copy the teachings of The Way of Fire by hoof and horn with quill and ink, and act surprised when Rising Sun's followers print a thousand copies of her texts for every one of yours? Perhaps this is why The Way of Fire is losing influence while The Rising Fire grows ever stronger."\n\nWinter Frost slammed her hooves down on the table and abruptly stood up, glaring at Fickle Current. "If you will not support Concord's teachings and her holy will, then I will not share a meal with you," she growled, much to Autumn's dismay. "I am leaving." She turned to Autumn only to say "Good night, Premier," then stormed out of the restaurant without waiting for her meal to arrive. Fickle Current merely shrugged and watched her go, keeping his thoughts to himself."

It was one of three early dreadnoughts that had formed the backbone of the Vermilion Armada before the Silence, and when it was scuttled along with its two sister ships, it had been one of the most advanced seafaring vessels in the world. Nowadays it would have been horrifically obsolete, of course, but some salvage and retrofitting would turn it into a serviceable, if outdated, foundation for a new Vermilion Armada.\n\nThe history of the ships was something that every foal of Fragrance knew well, and Current was no exception. The ships had taken part in the Armada mutinies after The Silence was passed, where the sailors of the Armada attempted to seize their old ships, mothballed for ten years by that point, and strike into the open waters as pirates, mercenaries, and smugglers; anything to provide for Fragrance's swiftly impoverished populace. Soldiers from Vermilion had suppressed the mutiny and retook most of the mothballed ships, immediately scuttling them to prevent a second mutiny. It was just another insult in a long list from the imperial capital, and the message it sent was crystal clear: Vermilion expected Fragrance to quietly huddle up and die, and any attempts the city made to save itself were treason. That humiliation stung deep, and the hateful lessons it had taught had simmered for a hundred years.\n\nBut today was a new day. Like the ships of the line returning from the murky depths of the harbor, Fragrance was beginning to return to yesteryear's glory. These ships, raised in Fragrance and launched from its drydocks, would be the first to safeguard Kiria's post-Silence maritime interests.

kirin.22.d:0 "Winter Frost tongued the inside of her cheek in contemplative thought as she watched the latest ship from Griffonia sail into port. It was a cargo freighter loaded with goods from the griffon lands, but Winter was more interested in the creatures on it. Some were griffons, a few were ponies, but most were kirin. They were all employed by the Sycee Trading House, one of Kiria's oldest trading houses, yet few of the kirin on board had ever seen their ancestral homelands. Sycee fled the Realm with its businesses when The Silence started, and had maintained its success overseas by employing members of the kirin diaspora to sail its ships and to protect them with their lives. It too was coming home, just like its employees, and Kiria had Fickle Current to thank for that.\n\nWinter herself wasn't as thankful as the rest of the Plenum about that. Sycee was brought back because it had experience fending off pirates and protecting its cargo with well-trained seafarer marines, and Kiria had a pirate problem on Auburn Isle. Kiria needed the return of Sycee's business to establish foreign trade and to use its marines as a stopgap measure until it could train its own army and navy. But this was Fickle Current's work, and everything that kirin did was done with his friends' best interests on his mind, interests that seemed to frequently overlap with making more money. While the marines might officially have been placed under the command of the Vermilion Banner Army, Winter doubted that their loyalties moved as quickly as their supposed allegiance. Were these kirin truly ready to serve their Matriarch, or were they still the Sycee Trading House's creatures? If push came to shove, Winter wasn't sure she wanted to be in the room when the Realm found out.\n\nOne thing was certain, she knew. Fickle and his cronies were strengthening their own position while addressing the Realm's problems.

Though soot and smog hung in the Fragrance air, the factory behind them was unmistakably silent, the gears of modernity ground to a halt by the striking workers.\n\nCurrent frowned and stepped out of the car, moving along behind the cordon of private detectives and security staff that had assembled to face the striking workers. He found Cypress Snow watching from a vantage point, a similarly displeased look on his face. The two nodded at each other in greeting, and then both turned their attention to the striking workers. "They don't have any Rising Fire priests with them," Fickle noted.\n\n"It's not the communalist heretics this time," Cypress said, shaking his head. "It's just the workers unionizing and sharing subversive leftist literature. They most have gotten it from Stalliongrad, or Prywhen, or Skynavia. Where it came from, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it's here now, and it's filling their heads with nonsense."\n\n"Then it looks like the Rising Fire has a modern competitor, and we have a nuisance to deal with." The sight of the protesting workers and the sounds of their chants took Current back to his days in Skyfall, where he had seen similar unrest play out before. "We know the playbook then. This is nothing we haven't dealt with in Skyfall."\n\n"Right. We bring in scabs from someplace rural and tell them they're getting good-paying jobs, which will let the factory get cheap replacement for the strikers. Then we kick the squatters out and crack some skulls if we have to. The company's pockets are deep enough to get some mercenaries together for a raid. Maybe Sycee will be willing to part with some of its marines for a bit." Cypress then turned to Fickle and frowned.

Setting it aside, the businesskirin climbed up to the top deck, dodging a few sailors hurriedly moving up and down the stairs leading into the ship's hull, and found a spot along the port side of the ship, where a marine squinted out over the waters with a frown. "Ships?" Current asked him, spotting three outdated junks sailing towards the steamer. "Are they pirates?"\n\n"We're close to Hyacinth, so aye, likely," the marine responded. "They aren't answering our signals, so they're likely part of the Nacre Armada. Not to worry, though. The forward gun on this ship can turn them all into splinters before we get in range of their muskets and cannons."\n\nFickle nodded, his ears flattening as the steamer's forward gun let loose a warning shot to ward off the approaching ships, the shell creating a plume of frothy white water where it landed. As he watched, the junks threw up the black flag, though one barely had a chance to raise it to the top of its mast before a kill shot from the steamer's gun crumpled the wooden hull in on itself. The marines let out a cheer, even as futile musket shot from the surviving junks began to splash the water off the steamer's port side, though that abruptly stopped when a booming clang rang out and the ship lurched to port, sending Fickle Current tumbling to the side.\n\n"Submarine!" somekirin yelled, but it was too late. The submarine had surfaced from directly underneath the steamer, and from its hatches burst forth a swarm of pirates, armed to the teeth with swords and antiquated firearms. Ropes flew up over the starboard rails, and the subsequent onslaught of the pirate boarding party overwhelmed the marines, who could only muster a token resistance before they lost the deck.\n\nFleeing from the carnage, Fickle stumbled through the steamer's narrow corridors, sighing in relief as he ran into a quartet of sailors armed with rifles and bayonets, prepared to fight on in a rearguard action belowdecks. But hurtling out of a side corridor was a mare garbed in splendid raiment with two swords held aloft in her magic, falling upon the unprepared sailors with her twirling blades and cutting them down in a flurry of steel.

But apart from when a slot in the door opened to give him his meals, it was barred shut. The walls of the cell were all brick, and the one time he had managed to work himself up into enough of a rage to try and tap into the nirik taboo to burn a way out of his cell, he couldn't find a flammable weak spot to set fire to. All he'd accomplished was burning his suit to ashes, and the experience had left him dizzy, disoriented, and sick. Another attempt was off the table.\n\nHoofsteps approached, and Current looked up, turning to where he thought the door was supposed to be. Keys turned in the lock, and the door squealed on rusty hinges as it opened outwards. Torchlight blinded the stallion, and he had to cover his face for a few moments to let his eyes adjust to the sudden light. When he could see again, he looked up to see a kirin mare standing over him, and he quickly realized it was the same one who had knocked him out during the ambush. "You," he croaked, recoiling slightly from her. "What do you want? What happened to the crew? To the ship?"\n\nHis response was a biting slap across his face, hard enough to rattle his teeth together. "Quiet, and listen," the mare said, frowning at him. "My name is Roaring Fire. The pirates of the Auburn Isle sail under my command, and the kirin of Nacre call me their matriarch and protector. I have come to bargain." Roaring Fire gestured vaguely to the outside world. "Your friends in Fragrance paid your ransom, and so I am letting you go. A ship will take you back to Hyacinth, where your navy is waiting to put its hoof to my neck and break the back of my armada. That is a fight I cannot win. But I know you are also staring down a fight you cannot win, and so I want to make a deal." She squatted down and thought her next words over carefully, the jewelry in her mane jingling faintly in the darkness of the cell. "I don't just have buccaneers, I have spies. I know what you want. I know that the NAKP is training paramilitaries and preparing for the worst. And should the worst come to pass... wouldn't it be better to have more friends on your side than enemies?"\n\nShe dug through her robes and pulled out a white candle with a jade wick. "This candle has been enchanted by dragon fire. Burn a message in it, and I will receive it. Your navy will take Auburn Isle, but they will not find my armada here. But rest assured, I will answer the call when you need me.""

kirin.26.d_1:0 "Fickle Current watched from the bow of an armored junk as the Fragrant Flotilla steamed into Nacre's harbor, their marines quickly seizing control of the docks and allowing the larger troop transports to dock and disgorge their troops. But he soon realized there was no fight to be had; the pirates were already long gone, just as Roaring Fire had promised, and not a shot was fired in the capture of the island. The prancing kirin banner of the Vermilion Realm soon replaced the black flag hanging from the flagpole in the center of Nacre, and the marines let out a cheer while the townsfolk sullenly watched their home fall to the invaders, their once mighty pirate armada having abandoned them.\n\n"Guess even pirates know when a fight's lost," the junk's captain remarked to Current from his side. "Smart move on their part. The Flotilla would have broken that fleet into driftwood, even if they had a submarine hiding in it. Without their base in Nacre, the armada's going to fracture and wither away. We'll have a couple more raids I'm sure, but their glory days are done."\n\nCurrent silently nodded along, remembering the offer Roaring Fire made him, and how he'd spurned it. She'd been enraged and had nearly turned nirik on him, but had enough common sense to realize when she was beat and to cut her losses and run. He doubted he'd seen the last of her, but even if he hadn't, it wouldn't be too long before somekirin did her in. The captain was right; without Nacre to supply her armada, Roaring Fire's days were numbered, hers and the rest of her pirate brethren.\n\nIt was another victory for the NAKP and the Realm as a whole."

Roaring Fire had let them take Nacre, on the assumption that she'd one day get it back. Doubtless that would be what she would ask for in return for her services to the NAKP; she'd make a useful governor at any rate, given how the kirin of Nacre loved her. In the meanwhile, she would take her armada to some other hideaway and lay low for a while, maybe sustaining herself off of raiding the Zebrides and the Zebrican southeast until Current called for her. He absentmindedly touched the small candle tucked away in his suit. One letter and a spark of fire, and he'd have the entirety of Roaring Fire's armada at his disposal.\n\nThe board was set and the pieces were in position. Now all he had to do was wait for somekirin make the first move."

"I am a proud son of Fragrance," he proclaimed, sternly scowling at Roaring Fire. "I am a reputable businesskirin and I will not stoop so low as to consorting with criminal scum to get what I need. I do not need you, and so I will not dirty myself with your help."\n\nRoaring Fire bared her teeth, and red flames began to lick at the edges of her mane. Her eyes turned piercing white, and her teeth elongated into vicious daggers as her rage started to consume her. "Insolent fool!" she growled, her voice taking on a demonic edge as she slipped closer to the nirik state. "I should flay you alive! Hammer nails under your scales and peel them off one by one! You will know pain when I am through with you!"\n\nBut Current stood his ground. "You would not dare hurt me," he stated. "If you lay a hoof on me, your armada will be hunted to the ends of the earth. You can flee from Nacre, but my friends will make sure every single one of your ships is found and sunk, and every single one of your pirates is executed for their crimes. Face it; the age of piracy is over. You are a dying breed, a last gasp of a lawless time. But I am the face of law and order in Kiria. I am the face of progress. I am the face of the future. And the future does not need you anymore."\n\nHe stood up and looked down his muzzle at the angry pirate captain before him. "You gambled everything on this, didn't you?" he asked her. "You wanted to kidnap me, to try and convince me of my own desperation so you could make a career change and be my mercenaries? We do not need more mercenaries. We can afford trained professionals should we need it, not an undisciplined pirate rabble. No, you will not save yourself this way. The only way you save yourself is to let me go, take your ransom, and try to start again somewhere else. I know it. You know it. Now let's stop dancing around the point anymore, shall we?"\n\nEven after all that, Current still harbored a little worry at seeing the half-transformed nirik in front of him, but after a few moments, the flames went out and Roaring Fire returned to her kirin form. "Fine," she spat, turning away from him. "Have it your way then. Pray that you never see me again, Current, because you do not want to see what happens when you trap a pirate like a caged animal.""

kirin.28.d:0 "Is something wrong, Premier? You've barely touched your tea." Fickle Current raised an eyebrow as Autumn Blaze held her teacup in her magic, staring at but not really drinking her oolong. "If something has come up that is bothering you, speak freely. You shoulder a great deal of responsibility as premier, yet you do not have to tackle everything alone."\n\nAutumn sighed and set her teacup down. "Kiria is about to fall into famine," she said in a dour tone. "Fragrance and Rhapsody have urbanized so rapidly with the returning diaspora that they're draining our granaries and warehouses months faster than originally planned. Our population is beginning to boom while fewer kirin work the fields now than they did in the Silence. Agricultural output isn't keeping up, and unless this year's harvest doubles last year's, kirin will starve come the winter."\n\n"We need to modernize our farming techniques alongside our society," Current swiftly concluded. "Neither you nor I are farmers, but I did learn of new techniques being developed in Griffonia before I left. One of the more interesting ones was close planting. Triple the density of seedlings in a plot, then double it once the first batch has had time to settle into the soil. The thought is that plants of the same species won't compete against each other, returning greater yields from smaller plots of land. Alongside that, we can try deep plowing the fields. The soil at the top of the earth is what crops use up year after year, draining it of fertility until it becomes barren dust. But plow deeper, and more fertile, untouched soil may be found. That would ensure healthy yields for our farmers."\n\nAutumn chewed on her lip as she tried to determine if what Current was saying was actually making sense. "Do you have any evidence that worked in Griffonia? We're not farmers, so we can't afford to act on something without proof it will work."\n\n"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the first planting season start soon?" When Autumn nodded, he continued. "The Morning Secretariat is slow. Dreadfully so. I appreciate the merits in sussing out the finer details of the proposals that cross its floor, but it sounds like we don't have time to wait on them. If we're going to adopt these techniques, a decision needs to be made now before the farmers start planting. At any rate, the Sorghum Foundry owns large plots of farmland in Peace-and-Plenty. I can commandeer their farms to test the techniques for you before the second planting season.""

kirin.29.t:0 "Altering the Deal"
kirin.29.d_1:0 "Autumn Blaze cringed as she finished her plea to the plenum only to be drowned out by a chorus of unhappy voices. She had taken to the stand to ask for the Plenum's support in extending the Hyacinth Accords with Equestria, a deal that had been very helpful in funding the Three and a Half Year Plan so far, but was deeply unpopular with both Fickle Current's and Winter Frost's cliques. Now, after arguing that a renewal of the Accords would give Kiria more funding and more resources to successfully finish the Plan, she found herself met with nothing short of revolt by the other two parties in the Plenum.\n\n"You would give Equestria a greater share of our resources, a greater control over our nation's wealth, a greater influence in the lives of every kirin in this country?" Fickle Current asked her. "Our material wealth is precious to us, and when a nation has nothing left, it at least has the resources within its own lands. We will not be turned into beggars at the Equestrian table! I will not stand for it!"\n\n"And neither will I," Winter Frost cut in. "We are a nation supported by the strength of our faith in Concord and The Way of Fire. What we are lacking is not material tools, but faith! The Equestrians do not worship Concord; they do not believe in The Way of Fire. How are we supposed to create a righteous nation if we stray from the divine will of our goddess to do so?"\n\n"We are not sacrificing anything!" Autumn protested. "We are exchanging something we have plenty of for something we have little of! The Equestrians are honest, forthcoming, and reasonable. The Reform Bureau has already made great progress on preliminary talks! The terms the Equestrians offer us are generous and honest; they favor us more than they favor them. Do not turn your backs on help that we need because we are too proud to take it!"\n\nBut Autumn Blaze could do nothing now; she could tell that the kirin in the Plenum had already made up their minds. As delegates left their seats to cast their votes and a scribe tallied them up, Autumn could only gnaw on her hooves in worry and hope that she had been persuasive enough to sell the deal."

"We have accomplished so much in the time we have been given, but it's not enough. Not yet. Don't misunderstand me, though. We've modernized faster than any nation in the world ever has, and that's a terrific accomplishment by itself. The life of every kirin in the Realm is growing better with each passing day as we shake off the last vestiges of the Silence. But I'm not going to sugarcoat it for anykirin here, though. Kiria is strained in a way it never has been before. There's so much social upheaval and cultural change that we're enduring that if we're not careful, the entire Realm could come crashing down around us. But I'm confident that we can do this without breaking our nation. We've come this far, and we won't trip and fall on our faces before we cross the finish line. With a renewed commitment to the Plenum and to Kiria, we can do this! I know we can! So please, don't give up yet! There's still so much work to do!"\n\nFickle Current quietly shook his head as Autumn's plea was met with a mild smattering of applause. "We'll never succeed with somekirin as incompetent as her in charge," he remarked to Cypress Snow, who sat next to him. "This project was too ambitious for a naive political newcomer like her. She only earned the position because she befriended the Matriarch. Rain Shine's foolish nepotism will be Kiria's undoing."\n\nCypress hummed in thought, but shook his head. "This is the most complex project perhaps any nation has undertaken in recorded history," Current's old mentor mused. "She may not be the right mare for the job, but I would be surprised if anykirin could have completed the plan in time. Faster and more efficiently, perhaps, but drawbacks like this are hardly unexpected. And to be fair to her, she has outperformed my expectations."\n\n"That won't be enough to save Kiria," Current countered. He frowned and leaned back in his seat as Autumn gathered up her papers and left the podium for the next speaker. "But I don't see a change happening any time soon. We can only hope that she does better, or the Realm will fall apart with her at the helm.""

It is my right as the chairkirin of the NAKP!"\n\nCypress flinched back and tapped his hooves together, noting the partial elongation of Current's fangs and the smoky flickering of his mane as his rage threatened to overwhelm him. "Breathe, Current," Cypress began, gently placing a hoof down on his desk. "Remember our exercises. The nirik state is unbefitting kirin like ourselves." As Current slowly calmed himself down, Cypress continued trying to soothe his former student's hurt pride. "You are still the leader of the NAKP in the Morning Secretariat. Nokirin is going to take that from you. Your party believes in you, and you have our absolute loyalty. At any rate, the appointment is not something that we can undo. Rain Shine's advisors are appointed and dismissed at her leisure. Give her time, state your case, and you may find yourself back by her right hoof in no time."\n\n"This should never have happened in the first place," Current fumed. "My authority is built on my skills and my value. What does it say about me and the NAKP if I am so easily replaced? I cannot hold our party together without the legal authority that comes from being Rain Shine's right hoof. I must have my seat back, or Kiria will move on without me.""

kirin.32.d:0 "Autumn Blaze paused outside the door of her foalhood home, having just finished dinner with her parents and a long, long, LONG time spent catching up with everything she had accomplished since moving to Vermilion as the Matriarch's premier. Her parents had been as thrilled and ecstatic about her accomplishments as ever, but even for the ever-talkative Autumn, she needed a little bit of time to herself to relax her mind and take a break. So, spying the hill she used to sled down in the winter, Autumn turned toward it and began to walk up its grassy slopes, humming to herself as she walked.\n\nIt had been an exhausting few weeks, but everywhere in Massicot, the decorations hung from buildings and strung between rooftops served as an easy reminder of the fruits of her labor. She had just finished a chaotic two weeks of trying to organize the mid-autumn festival as a national holiday, a task that, coupled with her usual duties, had left her mentally drained by the time the Matriarch had given her permission to return to Massicot and celebrate the festival with her family. The festival was in full swing, and the streets were filled with music and singing and laughter, but away from town, under the full moon, the world was quiet and peaceful.\n\nWhen she climbed the hill, however, she was surprised to find her friend Fern Flare sitting there, having a picnic dinner as she watched foals chase each other through the meadow with paper lanterns while their parents relaxed nearby. She didn't so much announce her presence as she did walk over to Fern's blanket and flop down onto it with a groan, and Fern only chuckled as she offered Autumn a mooncake. "Busy day, premier?"\n\n"Please, for the love of Concord, do not call me that tonight," Autumn groaned, taking the mooncake and biting into it. It was delicious, just as she remembered, and it put a little bit of energy back into her. But having Fern use her official title made her frown. "Fern? You ever feel like there's a huge weight on our shoulders that's gonna crush us flat if we take one wrong step? Because I do. All of Kiria is depending on me to hold things together. I'm the one standing between this happy night and civil war. I have nightmares about the Plenum erupting into a chaotic inferno, of riots in the streets, of our home burning to the ground. It's just... it's a lot, you know? It's almost too much for one mare to bear."\n\n"Then it's a good thing you're not just one mare, Autumn," Fern said. "We're all with you. You've got the Matriarch on your side. You can do this. If ever there was a mare for the job, it's you." Then she smiled at her. "Now come on, cheer up. You don't want to be thinking about your job during the festival, right?""

kirin.33.d_1:0 "Cinder Glow stepped into Autumn Blaze's office at the Premier's summons, and she immediately found the seat in front of Autumn's desk and sat down in it. "I've put together everything I could find on the Incendiaries for you," she said, placing a binder down on Autumn's desk. "Want me to give you the quick briefing, or would you rather read for yourself?"\n\n"I trust you'll get your point across," Autumn said, pulling the binder over towards herself. "I mean, that's why I hired you in the first place, right?"\n\n"Right," Cinder Glow agreed, and she took a breath before starting. "Well, it appears that the Incendiaries are supported by the Rising Fire, which I don't think should come as much of a surprise at any rate. The Rising Fire has been heavily involved in supporting the anti-modernism of the peasant farmers, and using their heretic priests to encourage farmers to join the Incendiaries is a logical next step. They're pushing for a full-blown revolution to punish the northern capitalists and the imperial administration of Vermilion for trying to cram the modernisation of the Grand Gallop Onward down their throats. Once they tear down Vermilion's authority, they want to create a communalist harmony over Kiria. Of course they see Matriarch Rain Shine as a hapless figure entangled in our own agendas, otherwise they couldn't claim any shred of divine legitimacy to keep their movement together, but their goals are very anti-Matriarch to say the least."\n\n"I see," Autumn said, nodding along. "In that case, I think it's best we get the Reform Bureau involved. We can have it take actions against the Rising Fire radicals in the Plenum, for a start, and start to address the grievances that are driving farmers into the Incendiaries' movement. But that'll only be treating the symptoms, which is all we can hope for. The Grand Gallop Onward itself is the root cause of all of this, and as much as I want to help everykirin, we can't abandon it for a few disgruntled farmers. Once it completes, the farmers will thank us for everything we did for them. I guarantee it.""

"The Incendiaries are, surprisingly enough, being motivated and organized by ultraorthodox Way of Fire priests and mystics. They see the entire modernisation deal as an affront to Concord's divine will, interpreted as the Silence decrees of Matriarch Noctilucent Charm, and they think that Rain Shine was pressured or tricked by the Equestrians into repealing those decrees and letting modernisation back into Kiria so they could subvert our religion. They want to cancel the Grand Gallop Onward immediately and roll back all our modernisation efforts so far, reestablishing harmony and peace with nature and Concord's teachings, no matter how bad The Silence was for the Realm over the past century. But perhaps the most disturbing thing is that they're starting to get the peasants to believe it too. The Grand Gallop Onward can't continue if the commonkirin start to believe that The Silence was better than this period of modernisation we're going through."\n\n"This is why I never made it very far in becoming a priestess," Autumn mused, shaking her head. "The mystics like to encourage kirin to let Concord do all the thinking for them and not think for themselves. And Concord's voice sometimes just happens to align with what the spiritual caste wants." She sighed and grabbed a piece of paper to write some notes on. "We can use the Reform Bureau to delegitimize those mystics who are supporting the Incendiaries and oust them from The Way of Fire, which should hopefully help fix things if they can't claim they're speaking with Concord's will. And it won't even bother Winter Frost and her faction, which is good. Winter might be traditionalist, but she's not THAT traditionalist. I'm sure she'll be happy to help get the ultraorthodox mystics out of her mane, too.""

It's probably not a false flag operation, but unrest and instability in the countryside would benefit them a lot, actually. If the countryside and native population is restless and angry, it further encourages the returnees to rally around the NAKP and use their wealth to help fill the party coffers, which they can use to increasingly militarize and consolidate their influence over Fragrance and Rhapsody. They've been buying a lot of modern weaponry and even bringing in tacticians from Griffonia to help train their paramilitary police forces. By all accounts, it looks like they're gearing up for a struggle, and the Incendiaries are just a pawn in their movement."\n\n"Fickle Current just keeps finding ways to turn a mare off," Autumn said, sticking out her tongue in disgust. "I knew he was sleazy, but this is just on an entirely different level. And even if he's not personally behind it, his buddies are, and he likely knows about it." She took a piece of paper and scribbled some notes down on it. "I'll have the Reform Bureau censure the NAKP and give Current and his cronies a sharp rebuke for what they're doing. Proving it in court would be an entirely different beast, but even letting them know that we're onto them and the Matriarch is displeased should put a stop to their efforts. Anykirin who's found to be responsible for this is not going to hold onto their power in the NAKP when they lose the Matriarch's favor, and power is what those kirin desire the most.""

And for now, at least, Kiria still had a reason to celebrate.\n\n"Kiria has changed so much in the past year," Rain Shine remarked. "So many new ideas and innovations have entered the lives of every kirin, from the most respected priest to the lowest farmer. And yet despite the upheaval, things have been relatively calm. Wouldn't you agree, Autumn?"\n\n"Of course," Autumn said, the colorful light of fireworks reflecting off her head scales as she nodded. "Things were rough for a bit when we started our changes, but they've mostly leveled out for now. Once we got past that initial inertia, the changes we've been implementing have been more successful than not."\n\n"And let us hope that they continue to be successful," Rain Shine said. "The Plenum and the Reform Bureau have done wonderful work in making sure that the new reforms are well-thought out and feasible, and that makes it easier for my subjects to adapt to them. If we keep up this good work, we may yet be able to finish the Three and a Half Year Plan without any great societal turmoil.""

There's been so little turmoil and unrest in the nation that I can feel Concord's approval in everything that we do."\n\n"Not bad for a mare who has no political experience whatsoever, eh?" Autumn teased, taking a jab at herself. "I'll be honest, I have no idea how things have gone this well. But the cooperation in the Plenum and the Reform Bureau has been absolutely outstanding. We wouldn't be where we are right now if it wasn't."\n\n"So let us hope it continues," Rain Shine said.

kirin.35.d:0 "The announcement of the Three and a Half Year Plan had been chaotic, to say the least. Not that Autumn hadn't expected it—she certainly had—but she had hoped it would be a little bit less chaotic than it was now. Now, with the wheels of the Grand Gallop Onward officially set in motion, she found herself trying her hardest to stay on top of everything happening all at once. And that, to be quite honest, was an exceptionally difficult task for a mare who had never entered politics before being hoof-picked by Rain Shine to be the Imperial Premier.\n\nOne way she had tried to wrap her head around everything that was swiftly transpiring in Vermilion was by inviting local leaders from across the Realm to tea. Those meetings had been very fruitful, and Autumn felt she knew more about what she was dealing with in the Realm because of them. And not only was she getting to understand the kirin from each province and city better, she was starting to see just what problems had been festering during the stagnation of The Silence that needed to be addressed. Case in point: an old bannerkirin from Verdant, an elderly mare whose grandmother before her had served in Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's banner army, and who had seen much in her long life.\n\n"The Silence wasn't so bad in Verdant," the mare said, only partly to Autumn's surprise; the older kirin generally were familiar and comfortable with the stagnation of The Silence, and weren't keen to move out of it. "There, the priests and mystics of The Rising Fire found a way to adapt the city to the decrees of The Silence. They're nothing like the kirin you brought into Vermilion to dictate policy with wealth and pedigree; no, The Rising Fire understands the common kirin, the farmers and fisherkirin, the poor and uneducated. Some here in Vermilion call The Rising Fire a heresy, but to the kirin of Verdant and the poor kirin everywhere whom they appeal to, The Rising Fire is salvation, a helping hoof where The Way of Fire abandoned them. Remember that, Premier, as you shape the future of our Realm in the majestic buildings of Vermilion. The kirin who argue with you on the floor are not the only ones who will live in the future you create. And, if push comes to shove, they certainly aren't the most numerous. The success of this Grand Gallop Onward will be decided by the governed, not the governing. Remember the poor, or somekirin else will.""

kirin.36.d:0 "Rain Shine watched with awe as the metal monster chugged into Vermilion, though she hid it under the mask of quiet and dignified splendor she'd learned to show for her subjects over the years. The newly-built Vermilion Grand Central Terminus was packed with kirin of all walks of life, jammed so close together that the regiment of bannerkirin brought on for security struggled to keep the crowd from pushing them onto the glistening steel tracks in the station. Nokirin wanted to miss the exciting event, and though Rain Shine knew that her presence as Matriarch was a formality, a media stunt, she couldn't deny that she found it all exciting as well. After all, there would only ever be one first train from Radiance to Vermilion, reestablishing the link between the Realm's capital and its traditional gateway along the coast. This moment, mundane as it normally otherwise would have been, meant something fantastic for so many kirin, and for the prosperity of the Realm itself.\n\nWhen the train finally rolled into the station, everykirin present let out a cheer and stomped their hooves for the pony engineers at the controls. As the engineers were escorted out of the engine and feted with garlands, food, and rice wine, Rain Shine serenely smiled out over the crowd. "With the completion of the Vermilion-Radiance Line, our Realm is once again a part of the outside world," she announced, to much hooting and hollering. "This marvel is the first fruit of what I sincerely hope will be a bountiful harvest between our humble Realm and our generous partners, the ponies of Equestria. Hoof in hoof, I pray to Concord in all of Her glory that our two nations will have many more partnerships of mutual friendship and cooperation such as this one."\n\nThen, to the surprise and awe of the crowd assembled, Rain Shine stepped forward with her entourage and boarded the train as kirin engineers replaced the ponies in the train engine. The train whistled as Rain Shine waved out the window, and the crowd cheered as she made herself the first Matriarch Superior to ever travel the Realm by train."

"Kaolin National has always valued individualism, hard work, and the value of the free market, but perhaps most importantly, we are firm believers in Kirian nationalism. Unlike the other powerhouses of the economy, KI is a true Kirian corporation without any roots or ties to foreign investors or capital. The Grand Gallop Onward provided wonderful opportunities to succeed, and in the economic boom that followed, KI took advantage of the tremendous demand for natural resources and raw material for the Realm's flourishing construction and manufacturing market."\n\n"A true investment in the Realm. You love to see it," Flash said, and then her tone shifted from supportive to questioning. "I do have to ask, of course, about the mass redundancy accusations, and the headlines about your lobbyists working hard to prevent the implementation of ongoing minimum wage legislation in the Morning Secretariat. How can KI claim to be a champion of Kirian interests when the company fights so hard to deny rights to its workers and punishes those who step out of line?"\n\nMoon flashed Flash a sharp glare, though it faded as she gave her answer. "Grit and hard work separate the wheat from the chaff, and KI's interests are the interests of the Realm. Our close work with the military means that success for KI is safety for the Realm.

But the farmers were poor, even if the modernisation of the Grand Gallop Onward had already begun improving their lives, and many, her parents especially, feared that they would not be able to hear it. But thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend, Autumn's parents managed to find a radio, and the entire community gathered around the staticky device as it strained to pick up Autumn's voice from Vermilion, many kilometers away.\n\n"Citizens of Kiria!" Autumn proclaimed over the radio as soon as the broadcast began. "Today is a great day. A monumentous day! The Three and a Half Year Plan, the first phase of the Grand Gallop Onward, has been a resounding success! When I first began working with her Divinity, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, as her Imperial Premier, I was admittedly intimidated by the sheer scale of the undertaking before us as a nation. But our success should not have been surprising. It took a group effort to make this work: Matriarch Rain Shine, who believed in the Grand Gallop Onward; the All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival, which put aside their differences to come together and create a new, modern future for the Realm; our friends overseas, who lent us money and their expertise to catch up on a century of missed innovations; and most importantly, you, the average kirin, the backbone and soul of our nation, who responded to our rallying cries of modernisation and helped in any and every little way you could. We could not be here tonight without you, and Concord, I am sure, is smiling upon her favored species. What we have accomplished would make her proud, and her favor will bless Kiria for generations!\n\n"Today is a day to rejoice, kirin of the Realm! Be together with your friends and family. Invite your neighbors over to drink and feast. Celebrate! And don't worry about getting a little carried away with your celebrations, as the Matriarch has declared that tomorrow shall be a national holiday in celebration! So to you, kirin of Kiria: good night, and may Concord bless you!"\n\nMusic signaled the end of the broadcast, but the farmers of Massicot had only just begun to cheer and stomp their hooves. In the center of it all, Autumn's mother cried tears of joy and pride, held close against her husband's chest.\n\nIt would be a lively night in Massicot, and all throughout the Realm as a whole."

Autumn Blaze looked across her desk at Cinder Glow and Fern Flare, two of her closest friends from Massicot turned her trusted political advisors for her job as premier. She trusted them to give her the news straight, and the looks on their faces told her that she wasn't going to like what they had to say.\n\n"The Realm is growing more unstable by the day," Fern Flare said. "Farmers are protesting against the rapid changes to society. Laborers are protesting that they aren't being treated fairly. The returning diaspora is protesting that we aren't modernizing fast enough for their liking. When those protests clash, riots start. And I think it goes without saying that where kirin are rioting, nirik soon appear. Urbanization and industrial projects are getting damaged by angry nirik setting fire to the construction zones, wasting investment money that we really need. Not to mention our bouts with famine, pollution, and pirates..."\n\n"I think she gets the point," Cinder Glow said, putting a hoof on Fern Flare's shoulder and shaking her head. Then she turned to Autumn. "In short, the realm is in turmoil. We have to do something to get cooler heads to prevail and get everykirin back on the same page. We need to remind them that we're all in this together, for the good of our country."\n\n"Yeah," Autumn said, rubbing her hoof against her nose scales as she thought. "But what could... oh, silly me, of course! The Matriarch!" She practically hopped out of her chair as a moment of brilliant inspiration struck her. "What's one thing we all share in common as kirin of the Realm? Our love for our Matriarch! The Realm wouldn't exist without her, and we owe her respect, not just because of the job she's doing, but because she's Concord's avatar in this world. I may have flunked out of mystic school, but even I know that Concord made Rain Shine one with her divinity when she ascended. So why don't we send her on tour across the Realm to visit the big cities and the little villages, and remind the kirin of Kiria that so long as Rain Shine walks among us, we still have Concord's favor!"\n\n"Do you really think it will work?" Fern Flare asked. "For all her divinity and power, Matriarch Rain Shine can't simply wave her hoof and make the Realm's problems go away."\n\n"No, but it will buy us the time we need," Autumn said. "Time enough to solve those problems in the Reform Bureau. We're in a race against time, and we need every minute we can get out of this powder keg before it explodes.""

Below it, the signatures of two dozen reputable priests and mystics put a foreboding weight to the proclamation.\n\nThe second was the imperial courier that collapsed on the steps to the Vermilion palace, beaten and bloody. In her satchel were reports of violence between the returning diaspora, who saw themselves as superior to the local commoners, and the farmers and fisherkirin of the realm, who saw the returning émigrés as foreign colonizers trying to crush their way of life. The courier had to flee Fragrance as riots started, and had been accosted by both sides for merely trying to do her job. It was a wonder she made it back alive.\n\nAfter that, bad news flowed like a monsoon, drowning the Morning Secretariat in dismay and grinding the Plenum to a halt. Rain Shine could only listen hopelessly as her premier read out the latest chaos happening across the Realm. Cultural upheaval was everywhere and clashes between tradition and modernization were commonplace. The northern coast, particularly the cities of Fragrance and Rhapsody, had practically turned into warzones between locals and the diaspora, with reports that nationalist paramilitaries had organized and orchestrated coups against the Matriarch's appointed governors, installing their leaders in their steads. But despite the chaos in the east, the populace there still paid lip service to Rain Shine as her subjects, unlike the west. There, in the rural and underdeveloped stretches of Kiria, the heretical sect of The Rising Fire had engaged in open rebellion against Rain Shine's rule. Clashes between Imperial Banners and local militias had put a dark mood over the Secretariat, and the situation only seemed to be growing more dire. And throughout it all, reports of nirik transformations and raging fires had come in from all across the nation. Kiria was dying.\n\nRain Shine excused herself from the Secretariat, having heard enough bad news for the day, and wandered the halls of her grand palace alone. She had done this to Kiria; she was the one responsible for this failure. She had tried to cram a century's worth of lost progress into three years of reform, and it had blown up in her face. She had created a dilemma worse than the one her mother faced, and now she finally understood why The Silence had been enacted at all. The kirin were simply not ready for the modern world.\n\nBut there was nothing she could do now. She had staked her authority on the success of the Plenum, and it had failed. Her decrees begging for the violence to end would fall on deaf ears. She had dug this grave for Kiria, and now it looked like she was about to lie in it with her Realm."

The Realm is fracturing, and nirik transformations are becoming more commonplace. If we don't right the ship now, even I won't be able to satisfy the demands for reform coming from the west. Kiria will be broken within a month if we don't do something to fix it, so we must. For the good of the realm."\n\nRain Shine silently nodded along as Rising Sun's words stirred up one last bit of resolve in the Secretariat. There was still a chance to save Kiria.

kirin.102.d_1:0 "It was good to be home, Rain Shine thought to herself as her servants set her palanquin down in the courtyard inside her palace. She had just returned from a successful tour of the Realm, the first she'd undertaken in her long life of seventy-some odd years, and had seen a whole new Realm she couldn't have imagined after spending almost all of those years inside the Vermilion palace. When her premier had brought the idea of a country tour to her she had at first been skeptical, but soon warmed to the idea. Now, she was glad that she had done it; the memories of what she'd seen would stick with her for the rest of her days, and they were happy memories as well.\n\nFrom Vermilion, Rain Shine had insisted on making the trek through the mountains to Rhapsody, along the path where the Vermilion Priestess and eventual first Matriarch Superior, Iridescent Dawn, had once walked on her journey to commune with Concord. From there, she traveled to Fragrance and up the Comely Cape until she boarded a steamer that took her to Hyacinth, allowing her to appreciate the marvels of modern engineering that Kiria had missed in its century-long stagnation. From Hyacinth she went to Massicot, then sailed down the Great Mellifluve to Sorghum and Vernant, with a detour to Chrysanthemum along the way. At every stop, she had been greeted by throngs of awed and overjoyed kirin, their emotion and faith in their Matriarch Superior overcoming the divides of status. Rich and poor, mystic and heretic, local or diaspora returnee, all gathered by along the roads, cheering their divine Matriarch and bowing before her.\n\nIt had been an overwhelming experience for the Matriarch, sure, but it had been worth it. Rain Shine had visited all the new advances happening under her watch, from new schools to modern hospitals to revitalized fire pagodas proclaiming a new dawn for The Way of Fire. She had seen firsthoof the rapid progress of modernization, the advancement of industry, and the transformation of the poor kirin countryside into a land of rich opportunities. But she had also seen cracks in the facade, where the dark tendrils of strife wound its way between the growing cracks of kirin society and politics. For as far as the Realm had come under her watch, it still had much farther to go, and injustices beyond measure to rectify.\n\nBut rectify them she would, she knew. With the tour complete, she had seen what she needed to see in her Realm. She had seen the wheels of progress turning, and the conflict that strove to grind them to a halt. And, Concord willing, she would do everything in her power to drive them onwards. Her little kirin depended on it, after all, and Rain Shine was determined to never fail her subjects in the way her mother had once failed them."
kirin.102.d_2:0 "Rain Shine waved from her palanquin at the gathered crowds in the city of Persimmon, full of kirin who had gathered along the streets just to catch a glimpse of their divine Matriarch Superior make her first journey outside of the Vermilion palace in all her life. At her premier's urging, Rain Shine and her palace staff had established an itinerary of cities to visit throughout the Realm to show the kirin of Kiria that their Matriarch still held the divine favor of Concord and looked admirably upon the work they were doing in the Grand Gallop Onward. So far, she had visited the cities of Rhapsody, Fragrance, Hyacinth, Massicot, and Sorghum, with stops at Verdant and Chrysanthemum yet to come. In a month, she would be back home in Vermilion, having seen more of her realm over the past several weeks than she had in her entire life.\n\nShe caught a commotion in the crowd out of the corner of her eye, and turned just in time to see a kirin mare shove her way to the front of the crowd and her horn light up. Before anykirin could react, she pulled a revolver from the inside of her coat and fired all six shots directly at the palanquin. Rain Shine felt something slice across her shoulder and some invisible force kick her in the back as the palanquin toppled over, her servants carrying it dropping it in shock and fear, their Matriarch falling into the dirt as screams of terror rang out throughout the crowd. Groaning, Rain Shine lifted herself up from the dirt, looking to her left just in time to see the would-be assassin end up skewered on the spear of one of her guards.\n\n"Matriarch! Concord's flames, you're hurt!" Her servants and guards swarmed around her, quickly righting the palanquin and all but dumping her into it as her procession beat a hasty retreat from the town. The awed worshippers that had lined the streets were gone, and Persimmon found itself suffocating in eerie stillness, save for the distant wails that somekirin had killed the Matriarch. One of Rain Shine's servants tore up their own robes to bandage the Matriarch, and Rain Shine realized she'd been shot. One shot had barely grazed by her shoulder, missing her head only for the angle she had held her neck at when the assassin fired, and another had smashed into the armor on her back, breaking loose two of the scales and leaving bloody sores in their place. The injuries hurt, but the symbolism was far more painful to her. She was supposed to embody Concord's divinity in the mortal realm. And some kirin had tried to kill her. While scales would grow back and cuts would heal, she had been attacked, assaulted, and wounded. Those injuries would never go away; they had shattered her reputation and legitimacy as Concord's divine avatar on earth.\n\nForlorn, Rain Shine ordered the procession to take her back to Vermilion. It was too dangerous to continue with the tour. Who knew how many other assassins were lying in wait in the west, ready to strike down the Matriarch if given the chance?"

Flakes of ash and hot cinders rained down around her, sizzling along her coat and leaving tiny scorch marks on her crimson robes. Chaos reigned, but she was serene.\n\nThe Rising Fire had made its move that morning. All throughout the west, organized militias of peasants, farmers, and oppressed workers rose up in unison to throw off the shackles of the east. Chrysanthemum's garrison had been ambushed all throughout the city and forced into a corner, and though they slaughtered countless hundreds of patriots and believers, they were overwhelmed and forced to flee or surrender. Though Verdant, the birthplace of The Rising Fire, remained under Vermilion's control, it wouldn't be held hostage for long. Soon, the growing strength of The Rising Fire would scorch its way east and seize Vermilion, and the corrupt and hedonistic mystics of The Way of Fire would be ousted from the country. Only Rising Sun could save Kiria, and save it she would.\n\nA building behind her let out a gush of fire as it collapsed, momentarily silhouetting the mare in harsh pink light.

The northern coup had gone off without a hitch thanks to the organisation and resources of the returnees that formed the backbone of the NAKP. Overnight, the governors of the north met in Fragrance to declare the Emergency Council for the Protection of North Kiria in response to the secession of the Fraternal Republic in the west. Once the council was called, NAKP paramilitaries moved quickly to round up and arrest all the government officials throughout the north, quickly installing their own figures loyal to the party in their places. The coordinated strike had even managed to seize all the important infrastructure in the north: arms depots, railway stations, telegraph offices, and more. A few dozen kirin had been injured in the scuffle, but the takeover had been so well planned and operated so smoothly that nokirin had died. Which was good, because then it was easier to claim self-defence to the court in Vermilion and the outside world, and move closer to officially establishing the north's independence.\n\nTruth be told, Fickle Current had been planning this move for a long time, well before the secession of the Fraternal Republic; it had just been a convenient excuse to organize the coup. And now, after issuing a radio statement the night before damning the Reform Bureau for degeneracy, corruption, and bringing the Realm to the brink of ruin, and promising that Fragrance and the NAKP would lead Kiria into a truly modern state, the north found its position slowly gaining strength and preparing to defend its independence. He would create a state for the diaspora returnees, one without the crippling decrees and hesitancy of the Vermilion court and the Reform Bureau, one that was willing to do whatever it took to bring the glories of capitalism to this long-forgotten realm.

The proclamation was issued in conjunction with a coordinated strike to seize the north's infrastructure: arms depots, railway stations, telegraph offices, and more, and was executed brilliantly, with no kirin killed in the scuffle.

kirin.106.d:0 "For the first time in over five hundred years, Kiria is at war with itself.\n\nThe first shots of the war were fired outside of Chrysanthemum, where a Banner regiment from Vermilion approached the city and demanded the surrender of the rebel forces that had seized it, claiming that their actions were backed by a divine mandate from Matriarch Superior Rain Shine. The Rising Fire forces stationed within the city, however, claimed that Rain Shine was being held against her will by the radical reformers in Vermilion, and that it was The Rising Fire that fought in hers and Concord's names, not the banners of Vermilion, and any true believers in the banner should defect and fight to free their Matriarch. It was at that point that field guns stationed on the banks of the Great Mellifluve opened fire on the banner regiment, killing scores instantly and scattering the soldiers as they fled for cover.\n\nImmediately, both sides blamed the other for being at fault. In Vermilion, Premier Autumn Blaze declared, with tears brimming her eyelashes, that The Rising Fire and all who professed its beliefs were rebels and traitors to The Realm of Kiria and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, and demanded their surrender and peaceful reintegration for the good of the Realm. Priestess Rising Sun, however, proclaimed that the Republic of Kiria was now at war with the Realm of Kiria to rescue the Matriarch from her corrupted and heretical captors in Vermilion, and called upon all kirin of the land to join The Rising Fire and save Concord's chosen avatar from the radical reformers who brought pain and ruin to Kiria. Kirin from both sides have now answered the call to arms, and divisions of hastily assembled troops are moving toward the west branch of the Great Mellifluve, with both sides ready to fight in the name of their Matriarch in Vermilion.\n\nBoth sides are determined to fight to the bitter end. Only time will tell how many kirin will die as The Way of Fire, which once unified the kirin species and ended the era of warlords, has failed in a way nokirin could ever have predicted."

kirin_loyalists.1.d_1:0 ""The situation is grim, Premier. I want to know that you have a plan."\n\nFern Flare sighed as she looked at the piles of papers and files strewn about her desk. Across from her, the High Priestess Winter Frost watched her with cold and skeptical ice blue eyes. "I'm not the premier. That's Autumn. I'm just Acting Premier while she's taking some time off for her mental health."\n\n"If I considered that mare our premier I wouldn't have addressed you by her title," Winter Frost said with a dismissive wave of her hoof. Then she brought that hoof down on Fern's desk. "The Realm is in a crisis, and Autumn is incapacitated. It's up to us to fix this mess. The banners are in disarray, and the commonfolk in the far west have fallen to heresy and are rising up against us. Autumn's foolish Grand Gallop Onward left them behind, and now we've lost them to a demagogue who twists Concord's word into a whip she uses to get what she wants. They spurn Matriarch Rain Shine while claiming to fight in her name. We have to destroy them all if we want to bring peace and prosperity back to Concord's realm."\n\n"The west isn't our only problem," Fern Flare reminded her. "Fickle Current took his friends back to Fragrance and have established their own de facto state there. The kirin of Greater Providence in the north have always been more reluctant to follow Vermilion's rule, and I've heard that even Rhapsody is tempted to throw its lot in with Fragrance. Current was clever; he made sure that Greater Providence received the bulk of the Realm's industrialization efforts, and now Fragrance has an industrial base that rivals the rest of the Realm. And as time goes on, he'll only grow stronger. We can only hope that they don't push for war as well."\n\n"If they have any common sense, they won't," Winter insisted. "For now, we must focus on shoring up the loyalty of the kirin in Eastern and Central Kiria. War is coming to their homes, and they have to be ready to defend the Way of Fire and the Matriarch Superior.""

Across from her stood the High Priestesses Winter Frost and Rising Sun, though the two mares stood about as far apart from each other as they could. Getting them together in her office had been a pain in her flank, and Fern only hoped they wouldn't start fighting in the middle of the meeting. "I'm not the premier, Priestess Frost. That's Autumn. I'm just Acting Premier while she's taking some time off for her mental health."\n\n"These are stressful times," Rising Sun agreed. "But mares of resolve will power through them for the good of the Realm. Since our premier is evidently not one, you will have to make decisions in her stead as if you are the premier."\n\nWinter Frost shot Rising Sun a look, as if offended that the heretic had even deigned to speak, but pointedly turned her attention back to Fern Flare. "The Realm is in a crisis. The banners are in disarray, and that foreign traitor Fickle Current took his friends back to Fragrance and have established their own de facto state there. The kirin of Greater Providence in the north have always been recalcitrant fools, and they've even bribed Rhapsody to put the selfish greed of the Procurate over its duty to serve Concord."\n\n"What the morally corrupt in the north take from the Realm, the west will offer in faith and virtue," Rising Sun said, a small smile curving her lips. "Fragrance may be a formidable foe, but they are nothing compared to Concord's divine will. We will strike them down for their defiance of her will. And when things are over..." She looked directly at Winter Frost, and her smile turned into a predatory grin. "Things will change.""

kirin_loyalists.2.d:0 "The smell of incense wafted past Winter Frost's nose as she sat in the Vermilion Pagoda, waiting patiently while the priests and mystics from the upper echelons of the Way of Fire made their way into the room and took their seats before her. The distant crack and pop of fireworks from the morning service punctuated the pagoda's interior, though in light of the topic on Winter's mind, she couldn't help but imagining them as the reports of distant rifles in the countryside. Concord willing, that sound would never make its way to Vermilion, but she had to be prepared for that eventuality.\n\nWhen all the mystics had taken their seats, Winter Frost slowly looked over each of them in turn. Some were young, but many, many more were old kirin, kirin who had spent decades faithfully serving the Realm under The Silence. They had done their part to keep the peace and hold the Realm together while faithfully following the Matriarch's decrees, and now she had gathered them here to explain how they would serve the Matriarch in a new way.\n\n"Concord has seen fit to test our resolve by arranging us against Her enemies," Winter Frost began. "The Realm is under assault by villains who would destroy everything the Way of Fire stands for. Everything we have struggled to achieve would be undone in an instant if we do not fight for it. So fight we will."\n\nShe took a deep breath and unfurled a scroll stamped with the Matriarch's seal before her, turning it so the other kirin assembled could see it. "The Way of Fire must lead from the front if we are to safeguard the soul of Kiria. It is not enough to be spiritual mystics and temple priests, guiding our wayward followers toward a pious life. Now we must become battlefield leaders, chaplains, and provocateurs to fight against the enemy wherever it rears its head. We will fight to restore the Way of Fire, fight for Concord's holiness, and fight to redeem our realm from treachery and heresy. We must show the Matriarch Superior our utmost loyalty and devotion, and support her in these horrid times. Some of us will fall, some of us will falter, but so too will new heroes and champions of Concord rise to the challenge. It is up to us, up to each and every one of us, to strive to become that kirin."\n\nWith one final nod, she rolled the decree back up with her magic and set it aside. "The Way of Fire must stand resolute or be snuffed out. And I will not let its flame die with me.""

Simply by speaking into it, every kirin in the Realm with a radio would hear her voice instantly, no matter how far away they were. Few kirin in the Realm had even seen her face; fewer still had ever heard her voice. That was about to change.\n\nThe studio technician gave her the signal, and Rain Shine drew the speech she'd prepared closer to her face. "Concord's blessings be upon you, kirin of the Realm," she began, her voice trembling slightly as she tried to imagine she was speaking not into a radio, but to a kirin in her home. "I have always tried to do what is best for you. You are more than my subjects, for we are all foals of Concord, each and every one of us. We are a family. And whenever I think about the consequences of my actions, I think first about how they would affect my family.\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward was supposed to be a new beginning for Kiria," she continued. "We would leave the stillness of the Silence and join the chorus of the modern world. Concord willing, I would be able to bring my family to a new life of peace and prosperity. We would follow the model of successful countries like Equestria, where democracy, constitutional rule, and the guiding hoof of benevolent leaders ensure equal opportunity and a safe and happy life for everykirin. I believe that these ideals hold water, and they are the ideal that all creatures should strive towards."\n\nShe took a deep breath and let that statement settle into the minds of her listeners across the Realm. "We are still reaching for that ideal, even in the trying times we now find ourselves in. There are those that would subvert our peaceful desires to suit their own ends. They would replace selflessness with selfishness, compassion with disdain, freedom with tyranny. They would twist the word of Concord to suit their own selfish desires. But we will not let them. I still believe in peace, but regretfully they leave us with no choice. In order to protect our family, we must discipline those that would tear it apart. I am now calling on you, kirin of the Realm, my brothers and sisters in Concord, to take up arms and to defend our future. Only together can we see the Realm out of these dark days. Only together can we once more find peace and prosperity under Concord's boundless love. And only together can we save the Realm.""

kirin_loyalists.4.d:0 "Unease settled in Fern Flare's chest as she looked out at the empty seats in the Bluegrass Pavilion, where she had scheduled an emergency meeting of the Realm and Harmony Party. A year ago, those seats would have been filled, and she would have sat in one as she listened to Autumn Blaze extoll the party's virtues and stump for the party platform. But Autumn was sick with stress, and with war breaking out across the Realm, many party members were either imprisoned, dead, or had gone off to help on the front lines. The Realm and Harmony Party was merely a shell of what it once was, but somehow, Fern needed to find the strength to keep what was left of it together.\n\nUnfortunately, for better or for worse, the current crisis gave the party plenty of reason to stick together. "We are not finished yet. Not by a long shot," Fern told the kirin gathered around her. "We were the largest and most influential of the forces guiding Kiria as it navigated the Grand Gallop Onward. The radicalism of Fickle Current and the Rising Fire have shaken many worried kirin free from their influence, and they fall to us with their fears and worries. We have the connections and resources to navigate this crisis and guide Kiria out of the darkness. Everything we have must be dedicated toward bringing peace back to the Realm and depriving those who would profit off of the Realm's misery of the means to do so."\n\n"What about the Way of Fire?" somekirin asked from her seat. "They say the war is a sign we never should have strayed from the ways of the past. From their teachings and guidance. They'll try to undermine our efforts if we don't cooperate with them."\n\n"And what will cooperating with the Way of Fire get us?" another kirin challenged. "They're trapped in theocratic dogma. We have to stay true to our promise for the Realm: a departure from conservative superstition, and a chance to bring harmony and democracy to all kirin. Fickle Current fights to carve up Kiria for foreigners, and the Rising Fire challenges our worship of Concord, our Matriarch, and our entire way of life. This is a war of ideologies; how can we hope to survive if we don't stay true to our own?"\n\n"We cannot alienate the Way of Fire by refusing to cooperate with them in this time of crisis!" A third kirin protested. "We must first focus on defeating the threats to the safety of the Realm by working together. Once the Realm is safe once more, then we can push for our principles and beliefs!"\n\nFern Flare listened to the angry voices beginning to rise around her, and she bit on her lip as she realized she needed to represent the party's will and put a stop to it before it got worse. The more she filled in for Autumn, the more she understood why serving as Kiria's premier had broken the mare."

What exactly would be in those pamphlets, pamphlets ominously titled "Resist the Traitors, Defend the Realm," had, as of yet, remained unresolved.

Now, with the pamphlets due to begin distribution that evening, a decision had to be made one way or another.\n\n"The pamphlets are to focus on building toward a harmonic democracy and resisting warmongering and tyranny," Fern Flare growled out of the corner of her muzzle. "Why is that such a decisive issue? Surely you can agree with something like that!"\n\n"Because there are more important things to remind kirin of in only a limited space!" Winter Frost snapped back. "We have to remind them about their loyalty to the Matriarch! The Matriarch is Concord's chosen avatar in this world. She is divinity made flesh! Nothing, not even your misguided calls for democracy, is more important than that! Concord gave us the Way of Fire, and She gave us the Matriarchs. Loyalty and belief in Concord's gifts is the only thing that will save the Realm!"\n\n"Concord isn't fighting this war on our behalf! We have to do it ourselves!"

"The Matriarch Superior specifically instructed The Way of Fire, through YOU, priestess, that your sect and mine are to work together for the good of the Realm. Driving home your message about loyalty to the Way of Fire at the expense of Fern Fare's beliefs in democracy or mine over the right of my kirin to worship how they choose is perhaps the greatest heresy of all. After all, it goes against the Matriarch's wishes." Then she turned to Fern Flare. "Do you think that calls for democracy mean anything to a kirin fighting for her life? No. The only thing that matters to the poor and the starving is the hope for peace. Focus instead on making promises of peace and justice, not any sort of grand call for reform. Democracy and tradition mean nothing if they do not improve the lives of ordinary kirin everywhere while war rages around them."\n\nThe three mares stopped next to the head typesetter, his suitcase of characters open and ready to be inserted into the first press.

"Autumn is personal friends with two of the Elements of Harmony. Their influence in Equestria is considerable. If we ask and invoke the Hyacinth Accord with our pony friends across the sea, they will be more than generous with leveraging what they can for our cause. We can negotiate a lend-lease agreement and even ask for some military advisors to help shape up our forces. Surely if we have the means to acquire equipment and expertise from our friends, we should by all means pursue it?"\n\n"The last thing Kiria needs is more foreigners on our soil," Winter Frost adamantly stated.

They are nothing but trouble."\n\n"Like we have much control over the Realm right now," Fern bitterly remarked.

She shook her head and frowned. "Winter Frost and I do not see eye to eye on most things. But this is something we can agree on."\n\nWinter nodded, similarly frowning.

"Been a while since I flew a Gladiator, Control. Hurricanes have a little cushion to their gear. Something that'd be really nice when landing on a dirt airfield."\n\n"We take what we can get out here, Skye. Now set her down, I heard somepony say we're due for a night in town. And I know how you've been eyeing up those Vermilion mares. Talk about eye candy!"\n\n"Can you blame me?" Skye chuckled as she gently pulled on the stick, turning her biplane toward the landing strip. The airstrip had been freshly built with Equestrian engineers, and the parkway was lined with Equestrian biplanes gleaming under the Zebrican sun. All were painted in traditional air force camo, with the exception of a black and gold stripe running down the midline of the fuselage, and the same pattern painted over the Equestrian roundels on the wings. They were all Thunderbolts planes, a volunteer air force sent over from Equestria to help their harmonic kirin allies in the ongoing civil war. The chance to fly over some distant and exotic country had been too good of an opportunity to pass up, and Skye had immediately volunteered to join the Thunderbolts and fight in the name of harmony abroad. It also didn't hurt that the pay was good... real good. She was making three times as much as she did in the Equestrian air force to fly an outdated biplane and sortie against an enemy that could barely afford anti-air guns. All in all, it was like a hunting trip, except her weapon was an aeroplane and her quarry were rebellious kirin fighting against harmony. Her wingponies were all comrades, and they weren't soldiers, just employees of the Realm and Harmony party, which made it about as relaxing a war as Skye could imagine. And the pony in the control tower was right; Skye was definitely enjoying the chance to sample some of the local wildlife while on leave, to put it one way.\n\nStill, she couldn't help herself. As she approached the runway, she yanked hard on the stick, sending her aircraft into an aileron roll just before landing. After righting the plane and feeling the landing gear shudder as they hit the dirt, her radio crackled to life one more time."

He was getting better at this, he thought to himself; while never a particularly athletic kirin, Lucent had resolved to use a bicycle to make his commute to the temple where he'd taken up teaching electrical engineering ever since the All-Kiria Collegium shuttered its doors with the outbreak of civil war. The benefits were twofold; his bike didn't need gasoline unlike his automobile, which was such a precious resource for Vermilion's armed forces that any waste couldn't be spared, and it helped him stay in shape. After all, if the war took a bad turn, Vermilion would soon be putting a rifle in his hooves to defend the Matriarch, regardless of his status as an intellectual and the former professor of electrical engineering at Manehattan Polytechnic.\n\nAs he wheeled his bicycle up the driveway to his front door, he waved at his neighbors sitting on their porch drinking tea. They waved back, and one of the two mares drinking tea stood up and leaned against the railing. "Can I ask you something, Doctor?" she asked him, her local accent coloring her words in a way that Doctor Lucent was still getting used to after living his entire life in Manehattan. "Why didn't you go with the rest of them?"\n\nLucent paused and cocked his head. "Rest of them?" he asked back. "You mean the members of the diaspora that went with Fickle Current to Fragrance?"\n\n"The very same," the mare answered. "I heard that they're rich in Fragrance. That Current stallion keeps them well cared for. They even opened a new college there. So why stay in Vermilion?"\n\n"Because it's not about money." Lucent shrugged. "I was foaled in Equestria, and I grew up being taught about friendship and peace and harmony. When the Silence ended and kirin started coming back to our home, I couldn't help but join in. I wanted to show everykirin here what it was like to live in a country as wonderful as Equestria, and it's not a dream I've given up on yet. We'll get through this; there's still a chance for harmony in Kiria yet." Then he touched his hoof to his horn as if tipping his nonexistent hat and left his neighbors to think about his words."

Fern Flare watched them with the camp's commander, Scarlet Rose, as the next line of defense prepared to take the field for the future of Kiria and its Matriarch. "They seem better than the last time I was here," Fern remarked to the commander.\n\nScarlet Rose nodded. "When you were last here, the Banners were in chaos. We were fighting a war with militias and ad-hoc bannerkirin regiments. Nokirin was truly ready for a war, but there it was. Yet we survived our trial by fire, and things are improving, albeit slowly."\n\n"Mmhmm." Fern Flare watched the soldiers training for a few seconds of silence before steering the conversation towards the real reason she had decided to visit the training fields. "I heard that these bannerkirin were provided by Winter Frost," Fern Flare said. "Devouts she managed to scrape together from some of the villages in the mountains. And I also heard that she wants to expedite their training and put them under the command of some of her Valiants."\n\n"You heard right," Scarlet said. "And I would be wary of it if I were you. You should know even better than I do that that mare is always working an angle. Way I see it, she's worried that the Realm and Harmony Party is getting too much power. Most of our commanders in the field are part of Autumn's party, and I bet if you made them choose, they'd stick with her over the Way of Fire and the priests sitting in their temples. Winter doesn't like that, so she wants to have her own bannerkirin regiments serving the faith first and the Realm second."\n\n"Yet we all fight and serve the Realm, no matter who we agree with more," Fern said, a frown forming on her face. "I don't like that at all. We shouldn't be dividing the loyalties of the troops in the field. That's going to cause more problems down the line, I can already tell." She thought for a moment and tapped her hoof against her chin. "There are more ways to serve the Realm than fighting, I suppose," Fern said, feeling out her thoughts.

All the assembled kirin part of the first regiment of the Volunteer Guard 1st Corps were smartly dressed in their parade uniform, and a tall vermilion and pink banner fluttered at the head of the corps. Their regiment had been proudly christened 'Realm and Harmony' by the Realm and Harmony Party, and Fern Flare knew that they represented the best of the best of the Vermilion banners. But what really struck her about the kirin assembled before her for inspection was how young and full of vigor they were.\n\nShe turned to the bannerkirin commander, who turned to face her expectantly. "Commander Bright Burn, was it?" she asked, and the commander gave her a nod. "Your regiment is a model for the rest of the banners to aspire towards. But I can't help but notice that most of your soldiers barely look like they've seen twenty winters."\n\n"Many of them haven't, ma'am," Bright Burn responded, to Fern Flare's surprise. "We're all volunteers from various walks of life, but these are our prime years, as strong as we'll ever be. We've all decided to dedicate them to the Realm and to the Matriarch. Even if we die, at least we'll die in the name of Harmony."\n\n"Teenagers and young mares and stallions shouldn't be so ready to die," Fern Flare said, taken aback. "You have your entire lives ahead of you!"\n\n"And what would those lives mean if the Realm falls, ma'am?" Bright Burn asked her. "I graduated from the Royal University of Canterlot and intended to work my way into the Royal Guard someway, somehow. But when Premier Autumn ended the Silence and announced her intent to reform the Realm in the model of the adoptive country I had grown to love so much, I changed my plans to return here and help her. Now, the best way to help her is to fight for her. Every one of us knows that we might die, ma'am, but we also know that there are countless more who cannot fight for what's right. If we die so that somekirin else can live in peace and plenty, then we are willing to make that sacrifice."\n\nThe bold statement took Fern Flare's words away, and all she could do was clumsily nod her understanding.

kirin_loyalists.12.d:0 "Commander Firetail looked out at the recruits that had gathered in the town with a mixture of admiration and concern. Admiration because so many faces had gathered willingly in the town to pledge themselves to the Territorial Volunteers. Concern because most were too old or too young to be deemed fit to serve in the banners themselves. But Firetail had put out a summons through all the surrounding villages for willing volunteers to enroll with the Territorial Volunteers to protect their homes, and over a hundred kirin had answered that call.\n\nEven if they had all been young and fit adults, the weapons they brought with them would hardly make them more than a mob. Most carried sabres and arquebuses, and those that didn't held farming implements by their sides. Firetail had brought a crate of modern rifles with him and his entourage, but that would barely equip a third of the kirin assembled here today. But it would make do. After all, it wasn't like they were marching these kirin off to war.\n\nHe watched as his officers helped divide and organize the volunteers by village and hamlet. The Territorial Volunteers were never intended to be a professional fighting force; it was only to police the hinterlands so that the able-bodied kirin could go fight on the front lines. But they had an advantage that even the fit and valiant conscripts lacked; this land was their home, and they knew it well. Any river crossings, any mountainous passes, any hidden dens and coves, these kirin knew about, and the invaders did not. They could use the land to their advantage, multiplying their ragtag force while mitigating the strengths of their enemies. And on top of everything else, these kirin fought for their homes and their families, and nothing else. There was no greater motivator than doing whatever it took to defend one's own.\n\nThey were motivated, they were trusted by their neighbors, and they were willing to stand up when nokirin else could. For that, Firetail knew they would exceed his expectations."

She watched from the sidelines as a band played and young mares and stallions danced on a dance floor, each dressed to the nines in their dress uniforms. Tonight was the graduation ceremony for the current cohort of kirin from the Massicot War School, and these proud kirin, now finally having attained their officer's rank after months of brutal and intense study and drill, found themselves enjoying one last chance to relax and celebrate as if there wasn't a war going on.\n\n"So young and innocent," Autumn could only remark with a sigh when Fern Flare joined her at the side of the dance hall. "But happy, too. It feels like it's been forever since I felt anything like they do."\n\nThe rueful remark elicited a look of concern from Fern, but she let it slip by without challenge; she was just happy to see Autumn participating in something social for once. "We had to graduate them six months early, but plenty of them will finish their training on the battlefield," Fern said. "We'll send the best to the front lines, and the rest will go to Vermilion and other administrative hubs to help keep the wheels turning. Their job is just as important, if not moreso. But I'm confident they will succeed."\n\nAutumn nodded and took a sip of her drink, feeling the burn of alcohol crawl down her throat and humming. "Most of these kirin have RaHP pins, don't they?" she observed, pointing at a pair of stallions dancing together not too far away.\n\n"We've been able to keep a good grasp on who gets admitted to the War School," Fern admitted with a shrug. "All these kirin strongly believe in harmony, just like the last few cohorts we've graduated through the school. We're building a strong force in the field that believes in what we're fighting for."\n\n"Strong as it can be with dwindling enrollment," Autumn said, and Fern arched an eyebrow in surprise. Autumn could only laugh. "I'm still the Premier, you know, even if I've done a terrible job of acting like it. I did my best to catch up on what I missed before tonight, and I noticed that enrollment has been flagging. Fewer and fewer kirin are meeting the party's criteria for admittance, and it's starting to get concerning.

She'd come a long way from the daughter of farmers; now she was sitting in the Matriarch's study, sharing tea with the embodiment of Concord's divinity made flesh.\n\nAfter the usual pleasantries, Rain Shine set her cup back on its platter and smiled at Fern. "I've enjoyed getting to know you better, Fern, so I hope this will not come across as rude if I ask about Autumn's health. She is a dear friend of mine. Is she doing well?"\n\n"She's getting better," Fern assured her. "Hopefully, it won't be too long before she's sitting here instead of me. Until then, I'm only doing my best to fill her place." She set her own cup down and touched the folder she'd brought with her to the meeting. "I have a proposal that I would like your thoughts on. The war..." she hesitated at the look of sadness that flashed across Rain Shine's face, if only to disappear behind divine neutrality as quickly as it arrived. "It's not wise to make premature conjectures, but it is wise to be prepared for all outcomes. This one in particular considers territory lost to the secessionists." She opened the folder with her magic, revealing the dozens of documents stuffed inside. "We've organized plans for stay-behind brigades, equipment caches, and resistance training for soldiers and operatives. Volunteers will disguise as civilians and help sabotage critical targets. Only... we've had to rely more than we'd like to on the Way of Fire."\n\n"Oh?" Rain Shine's brow furrowed. "You make that sound like a bad thing."\n\n"The devout are the backbone of our resistance efforts, and their zealotry will be helpful in fighting against impossible odds," Fern Flare admitted. "But zeal can be counter-productive, and the Way of Fire sees this war as a personal affront to Concord Herself... and you. I'm afraid that in their hooves, resistance could quickly become terrorism. Devotion is a powerful motivator, but times have changed. The Way isn't the be-all and end-all that it used to be. The kirin fight for other ideals now; a democratic future, yes, and their loyalty to you, their Matriarch, but also for their homes and families. We don't need sleeper cells of zealous terrorists, but a network of trained organisers who can sustain long-term resistance efforts with grassroots support."\n\nAt that, she closed the folder as both mares frowned at it.

kirin_loyalists.15.d:0 "The doors to the throne room opened unexpectedly, interrupting Matriarch Rain Shine's conversation with Fern Flare. All heads turned toward the open doors, where a raggedy kirin stallion stepped forward, a confused soldier worriedly following right on his tail. It took her a second, but Rain Shine soon recognized the commander of the Banner of the Covered Cage, Kiria's obscurely infamous secret police who once enforced the edicts of The Silence. "Commander Ember Wane, to what do I owe the—oh my!" Rain Shine exclaimed upon seeing the soaked red bandages on his leg and shoulder. "What happened?"\n\n"Bandits on the road. Nothing to worry about," Ember Wane replied, though the response was forced through gritted teeth. He stopped in front of Rain Shine's throne and gave her a stiff bow. "Reporting for duty, Matriarch."\n\n"You are in no position to report for duty," Fern Flare insisted, looking the stallion over with equal parts concern and wary. She'd learned more than she would have liked to have known about the Covered Cage in her time in Autumn's stead; the Covered Cage had doggedly enforced the edicts of the Silence during Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's rule, and they supposedly exacted extreme punishments on villages that refused to comply. But she also knew why Ember Wane was supposedly here. "What happened to your banner?"\n\n"Scattered. Dead. I don't know," Ember replied with a sigh. "When the Silence ended, we were at our weakest. And we were never officially recognized by the Matriarchate. Most simply left for greener pastures, or tried opposing the seditious secessionists on their own. My Banner is spent."\n\n"I'm sorry," Rain Shine apologized, bowing her head. "If I had known how much we could have used your aid, we would have reorganized the Banner sooner. As it stands, we need all the help we can get."\n\n"My Banner may be gone, but I'm still standing," Ember said, rising from his bow. "And I will help any way I can.""

kirin_loyalists.16.d:0 "Ember Wane stood on a grassy hill, looking out over the gentle slopes and curves as dozens of trucks arranged themselves in the field behind him to unload their ancient contents. There had once been a town here, but not many kirin knew it; the Banner of the Covered Cage, the organization he proudly served, had expunged its heresy from the Realm decades ago, leaving not a trace of the kirin who had once defied Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's will. But those kirin had created marvels in their heresy; perhaps it was fitting that he had brought them here to see if their memory could at last serve the Realm.\n\nThe kirin behind him hauled crate after crate out of the backs of the trucks, and when they arranged them in the field, they cracked open the boxes to reveal dusty clockwork golems fifty years old. As the laborers positioned and unpacked hundreds of crates on the hillside, Ember Wane walked to the side where several artificers sat with all sorts of monitoring equipment, including a half dozen thin and curly metal antennae jutting out of bulky boxes. In front of the artificers, a battery of howitzers had been assembled, aimed down at the field where the test would begin. If the golems went rogue upon being activated, Ember was certain to ensure that he lost nothing other than a few dozen rounds of ordinance.\n\nSoon, the laborers' work was completed, and they withdrew to safety, leaving the chiliad of golems standing stiffly in the field. All Ember had to do was spare the artificers a nod, and the other kirin did the rest; shouting orders to each other, they ran through their procedures, and then somekirin pressed a brass button on one of the antennae boxes. The air thrummed with charged static, and everykirin held their breath as they waited for a response.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the golems began to jerk, and bellows of steam erupted from their metal hides as they powered up. They stood in place, awaiting command, and at Ember Wane's raised hoof, the artificers set the golems to march 50 paces forward. In lockstep syncopation, the constructs responded to the order, their thundering hooves the only thing audible for a mile. After 50 paces, they stopped in unison, awaiting their next orders, and Ember let a pleased smile adorn his muzzle."

kirin_loyalists.17.d:0 "The peaceful stillness over the lake was broken with riotous yelling, sending a pair of cranes fleeing skyward to escape the commotion. Down by the shoreline, the locals of a nearby town followed a procession of Way of Fire priests to the water, where a cadre of soldiers hauled several bound, beaten, and broken kirin onto a small barge. Some of the prisoners fought back, some cried, and some seemed resigned to their fates.\n\nAs the congregation formed into an unruly semicircle by the shoreline, the seniormost priest turned to address the crowd. "The kirin you see before you have been tried and convicted of heresy most damning," she announced in a solemn voice. "They have acted against the interests of the Matriarch, of the Realm, and of Concord Herself in pledging themselves to the lies and deceit of the Rising Fire. For that, they have been condemned to a heretic's death, so that their heresy may serve as an example to those who would turn their back on Concord."\n\nOne by one, the soldiers on the barge roughly forced the prisoners into flame-retardant sacks, sewing the only opening shut with a heavy cord attached to leaden weights. The last prisoner kicked and screamed as she realized what was about to happen, and it took three soldiers to force the writhing and thrashing mare into her sack. "No!" she screamed at the top of her lungs. "I'm innocent, I swear! I love Concord! I love the Matriarch, no, don't do it!" But her cries fell on deaf ears, and a gag was forced into her muzzle before she herself ended up inside a sack like her fellow condemned.\n\nAs the soldiers pushed the barge out into the middle of the lake on poles, the priest only continued her sermon to the crowd. "When we die, our bodies are burned so that our flame may rejoin the Primordial Fire that Concord nurtures in heaven, but what is doused in water may never burn. Thus is the fate of all heretics; the fish shall feast on their flesh and leave little but their sodden bones behind, and so their souls shall remain bound to this world in eternal torture. Let this serve as a lesson and warning to those that would take up arms against the Matriarch and the Realm: heresy shall always be punished, and only true devotion will make Concord proud of her foals."\n\nHer final words were punctuated with the first of several splashes as the soldiers kicked the writhing sacks into the lake."

Inside, representatives of those factions still loyal to Vermilion gathered to witness a landmark historical accord to be delivered by Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. WIthin the hour, the Matriarch would take the unprecedented step of condemning persecution of the Rising Fire, who had remained steadfast allies of Vermilion in these troubling times even despite their religious differences with the Way of Fire.\n\nOf course, it would never be that simple. Before the Matriarch arrived, representatives of both sects had squared off over some of the details in the soon to be announced proclamation, their grievances championed by Rising Sun and Winter Frost as the two mares all but literally butted horns in the center of the Secretariat. "Do you think I cannot see what this is?" Winter Frost challenged, baring teeth that had started growing unsettlingly long as she did her best to control her rage. "As soon as your heresy is unshackled you and your followers will do everything you can to spread it like a pestilence upon the Realm."\n\n"If you strip the right of the Rising Fire to coexist with the Way of Fire, then my supporters and I will walk out of this room and make our peace with the North," Sun threatened. "You will be on your own to face Fickle Current's industrial fury."\n\nWinter sneered, but she recognized the fangs in Rising Sun's threat. "I will not renege my support in the eleventh hour," she finally assured Sun. "But the Way of Fire is the state religion of Kiria, and it has been our salvation for centuries. I want a clause added to the accord that expressly states that the Way of Fire holds primacy over the Rising Fire in all matters, especially in what is taught and sponsored by the state."\n\n"You accuse me of trickery for personal gain and then seek to subordinate me to your orthodoxy?" Sun challenged, bristling. "I will never allow such a clause to find its way into the accord. If you really want a sign of good faith, how about this: we will agree to let the Way of Fire be the practiced state religion if you agree to not interfere with our right to profess our beliefs. I get what I want, you get what you want. Happy? If not, I withdraw my support of this accord, and Vermilion itself.""

"Speak, Snowfall," she told the acolyte. "You would not be here if it weren't important."\n\n"It is important," Snowfall admitted, and she took a deep breath. "The Way of Fire has had overwhelming success in encouraging Vermilion to see things from our point of view, as I'm sure you're aware. We've almost entirely overpowered the dissenting voices in the Rising Fire, drowning them out in the truth of Concord's word."\n\nWinter Frost blinked and cocked her head.

They could leave Vermilion, turn their backs on us. We're stronger with their support than without it. I just think... perhaps this is too much of a good thing, High Priestess.

Perhaps it was cliche for a mare with her name, but the hot days of summer had always been her favorite, and even if she couldn't get outside to enjoy the heat, she always liked the crackling blaze of a fire, of feeling the smoke tickle her nostrils and the back of her throat. There was an old saying among the kirin, something along the lines of 'play with fire and expect to be burned', but Rising had never been burned before. Not even when she held her hoof over the open flame of a burning brazier devoted to Concord within one of Her many temples, letting the pink and blue flames lick against her hoof.\n\nHer ears perked at the sound of the temple doors opening behind her, and she gracefully turned around to greet her visitor. She recognized Dayspring Rose, one of her most faithful acolytes and personal pupil, and a smile adorned her muzzle. "Dayspring, my child," she said, warmly, pleasantly. "Do you care to pray with me?"\n\n"I would enjoy that, Priestess," Dayspring said, momentarily bowing her head. "But before I do, I have something I'd like to discuss..."\n\n"Speak," Rising Sun said, and she turned back to the burning brazier, sitting before it as she let its heat wash over her. Dayspring did the same, sparing the fire a look before hesitantly turning toward her mentor.\n\n"We have had outstanding success illuminating the kirin of the Realm in the ways of the true faith," Dayspring began.

Matriarch Rain Shine is always going to support the Way of Fire," Dayspring admitted, even if it put a frown on Rising Sun's muzzle. "That is who she is. That is what the Realm is, at least for now. The Way of Fire still holds tremendous sway over the Realm if only through its history. If we crush their voice, force them out of the future of the Realm... I'm afraid they'll do something drastic."\n\nRising Sun thought on that for a moment, then nodded. "Yes, that is wise," she agreed. "Perhaps I have been pushing Winter Frost too hard.

He looked around, orienting himself in the small town before trotting off to the well-lit windows of the inn. All the while, thunder rumbled in the distance, though Clementine knew it wasn't from a storm. He wondered how close to this little no-name village the frontlines had drawn now.\n\nWhen he entered the inn, he scanned the room and the number of kirin gathered inside before he found the liaison he was to meet with. She was a large mare, especially for a kirin, and muscles toned from years of hard work on a farm rippled under her red coat as she moved and joked with her companions. Clementine, on the other hoof, had never worked on a farm in his life; born and raised in Equestria like much of the Diaspora, he had volunteered to return to Kiria at the behest of Autumn Blaze and the Realm and Harmony Party to spread the ideals of Harmony to his struggling homeland. To say the red mare intimidated him was an understatement.\n\nNevertheless, he had a job to fulfill, and fulfill it he would for his country and its way of life. The red mare and her comrades looked Clementine over as he approached, and a few snickered behind their hooves, but the stallion did his best to brush that aside and speak with confidence. "Red Dawn, my name is Clementine. I was sent by the RaHP to aid and assist in the defence of this town in any way possible. The RaHP hopes that by fostering cooperation with the Rising Fire along the frontlines, we can work together to create a more harmonic and peaceful Kiria when the dust settles. I've spent most of my life living in Equestria, and I believe that by following their ideas of harmony and cooperation, we can make a Kiria as great and prosperous as them."\n\nRed Dawn raised an eyebrow at the scrawny stallion in front of her and snorted in amusement. "You really think you can fix Kiria with some fancy ideas you learned in some far away place, kid?" she asked him. Before he could answer, she let out a laugh and scooped the young stallion up in a muscular foreleg, dragging him to her side in a crushing hug that left him wheezing for breath. "Don't worry, kid.

Two weeks ago, she had instructed one of her junior acolytes to put forward a motion in the Morning Secretariat to suspend the collection of tithes and donations to Way of Fire temples and monasteries in order to procure funds to support the ongoing war against the NAKP, and as she had predicted, the motion had ignited a spectacular firestorm in the chamber. She had carefully arranged several of her best orators and even enlisted in the aid of economists and advisors to make clear what should have been a simple choice, but that damnable priestess Winter Frost and her allies had initiated what had essentially become a filibuster campaign to kill the motion by bringing in mystic after mystic to lecture to the Secretariat about the moral virtue and religious significance of the tithes. Somehow Winter and her friends expected the rest of the Secretariat to believe that allowing the priests to continue to leech off of the poor and impoverished like parasites pleased Concord, but Rising Sun and the rest of her followers knew all too well that the Way of Fire simply wanted to maintain their hedonistic lives while the rest of Kiria burned around them.\n\nBut now it seemed like Winter had finally run out of notable kirin to bring before the Secretariat, and even the harmonists of the Realm and Harmony Party, so eager to let everykirin have their voice heard, were sick of the debate. Seizing her chance, Rising Sun once more brought up a vote to end debate on the matter, and Winter Frost's traditionalist allies were swiftly outvoted by unanimous votes from their opposition.

Many of the heretic's bills were easily shot down by Winter's coalition of traditionalists and members of the RaHP that remained suitably pious to Concord's divine teachings, but this most recent one had become a thorn in her side that she couldn't quite make go away.\n\nLast week, Rising Sun had brought forward a motion to allow the provinces to choose their own regional administrators rather than allowing the Way of Fire to appoint temporal clerics throughout the land as it had traditionally done for centuries. Such a change would normally be too radical to draw substantial support from Fern Flare's Realm and Harmony Party, but the illusion of democracy had proven an alluring temptation for too many of its members. But Winter Frost knew better. She knew the heretical sway Rising Sun and her cult had on the commoners of Kiria, and how quickly the ambitious mare would seize control of the countryside by installing her cronies in a new secular administration with the unwitting aid of the masses she led astray. Kiria needed the spiritual guidance of the Way of Fire, and only pious officials who governed with Concord's favor could keep Kiria together and free of sin and corruption. So rather than let Rising Sun try to sway more votes to her side with her honeyed words and treasonous tongue, Winter decided to take a gamble and force a vote now, even if she didn't know for sure how much of the RaHP was likely to defect to Rising's side."

She knew Rising Sun was ambitious, but what she was proposing threatened to completely destroy the tense cooperation between the Rising Fire and the Way of Fire that Kiria needed to survive the ambitions of Fickle Current and his allies in Fragrance.\n\nIt all centered around a motion innocuously titled Motion No. 43. In it, Rising Sun issued a direct challenge to the primacy of the Circle of Serene Tendency in the Realm of Kiria by pushing to install a Rising Fire mystic as one of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's spiritual advisors. To anycreature unfamiliar with Kiria and the Way of Fire, such a proposition would seem harmless, but the motion itself was practically blasphemy in the eyes of High Priestess Winter Frost and the hardliners who rallied around her. Historically, the Matriarch Superior always kept four spiritual advisors close at hoof, one for each part of her Realm: Greater Providence, the Vermilion Realm, the Western Mellifluve, and Zaikiria. These advisors lived with her in the Vermilion Palace and always had her ear when few other kirin in the entire Realm did, and all four had traditionally been selected from the Circle of Serene Tendency, the ultimate religious authority of the Way of Fire through which all the temples in the Realm subordinated themselves to. But the Rising Fire had displaced the Circle's primacy in the west, and Rising Sun sought to capitalize on that by replacing the advisor of the Western Mellifluve with one of her choice, and thus break the Circle's monopoly on the Matriarch's ear. It would be a recognition from the Matriarch of the legitimacy of the Rising Fire, and in a theocracy like Kiria, Fern Flare wondered whether the Realm could survive such a controversy.\n\nBut Fern Flare knew that her party would be the deciding vote in the deadlock between the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire, between Winter Frost and Rising Sun, and she decided to push for a vote before somekirin turned nirik in the Morning Secretariat. She just needed to decide on which direction she wanted to whip her party's votes: support the primacy of the Circle of the Serene Tendecy and preserve its privileges at the expense of Rising Sun's support, or allow the Rising Fire to have their voice in the Matriarch's ear and keep them happy at the risk of destabilizing the realm and national unity in the long run?"

So why are the rest of them so greatly opposed to it?"\n\n"Think of the big picture," Flash replied, and he gestured across the aisle to where Winter Frost and her allies sat with stern frowns on their muzzles as they listened to a young Rising Fire acolyte address the Secretariat. "Priestess Frost wants to focus instead on non-military manufacturing around Aureolin. Why is that? The answer she gives the Secretariat is that when the war is over, armories and munitions factories would be ill-suited for industrializing and modernizing the poor and rural west. Civilian jobs would suit that much better. And she's right. But there's a far more obvious reason, though of course, nokirin will say it."\n\nDayspring blinked, frowned, and then cocked her head. "She doesn't want the west to have military industry. But why? Are we not allies against the foreigners in this war?"\n\n"Allies of necessity, Rose," Flash corrected her with a small shake of his head. "We needed to join forces to repulse the NAKP and their corruption and greed. But this war has not brought the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire closer toward reconciliation. Today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and it is best to not arm a kirin you do not trust and then turn your back on her."\n\nDayspring nodded in sullen understanding, and on the Secretariat floor, somekirin motioned for a vote to end the debate.

The soldiers of The Way of Fire and The Rising Fire turned on each other up and down the front, slaughtering their former allies in a vicious bloodbath. Caught in the crossfire, the harmonists of the RaHP responded to attack with counterattack. Divisions disintegrated and the chain of command lay in ruins. There was only one rule: kill or be killed, no matter who stood at the other end of your rifle.\n\nAs Vermilion burned, the Matriarch disappeared into the smoke. Nokirin knew what happened to Rain Shine, but there was no sign of her as the days passed and the flames died down. Was she dead? Was she hiding? Her body was never found, but then again, not much remained of the palace when the ashes settled.

She was about to declare a powersharing agreement that had been hammered out between The Way of Fire and The Rising Fire over countless sessions of negotiating throughout the war. She was about to announce a project of reconstruction to bring Greater Providence back into the fold and begin a cautious modernization to rebuild Kiria where the Grand Gallop Onward had failed.

We must continue this process with diligence and strength, to set an example for the commonkirin who have been led astray. Govern with honour and virtue. In the name of Concord.

Now it is just a particularly powerful and well-equipped army with overt pro-democratic leanings. What to do? Let's marginalise him and his supporters. His support comes not only from young officers, but junior bureaucrats and party functionaries too. It is unsavoury but we must divest them of their positions. We can't just force them out - that would be improper, make them angry and split the party.

They also criticised us, the RaHP, for betraying Autumn's legacy. the Massicot War School has always been a hotbed of pro-democracy radicalism, especially during the war. It was founded by and controlled by the RaHP, after all. the incident came dangerously close to a mutiny when the provost-commander of the College threatened to send in military police against the protesting cadets, who were unarmed. in the end the protesters dispersed and no charges were pressed, probably because the College leadership were sympathetic to the protesters. but still this is a disturbing episode. it shows that radical sections of the army, in particular the junior ranks, are becoming increasingly hostile to the New Era."

This engine is a fusion of modern electrical and mechanical engineering and Kirian geomancy and numerology techniques. Cutting-edge. Geomancy and numerology are primarily passive pursuits, stuff like diviniations and making prophesies, but in the Atmospheric Displacement Propulsion Engine this Kirian thaumaturgical science is used to great effect. The engine at the ship's bowsprit displaces the air in front of the ship, allowing its sails to catch the pressure that billowed in from behind. It's a kind of indigenous Kirian magitech that will be created by pre-existing characters from different factions of the civil war, symbolising what Kirian unity can accomplish (sort of like the Concorde jetliner). The lead developers are Sage Snoot, a Kirian theorist and scholar of geomancy and numerology, Doctor Lucent Shine, an engineer trained in Equestria, and the project is bankrolled by Fragrance Enterprise, with the engine being mounted on a special hull produced by its dockyards. Speech, ceremony, celebration, at the boat-launching. Matriarch Rain Shine christens the boat. Give the boat a name. It is a sleek, armoured destroyer, with three distinctive red-and-black fully battened sails. the distinctive sails give it an impressive flair, impressive and intimidating, uniquely Kirian, but has the downside of increasing its profile to enemy spotters. The ADPE is restricted to small craft, maximum destroyer size, because even with the magitech sails cannot propel large and heavy ships."

kirin_pirate.1.t:0 "Pirate Raids from the Auburn Isle"
kirin_pirate.1.d:0 "Autumn Blaze skimmed through the last report attached to the Imperial Census of the southern coastline before setting it aside. So far, she had read fifteen reports from Imperial administrators who had visited the coastal towns to take stock of the situation along Kiria's coastline, and each of them had been largely the same. Punctuating all the droll figures on population numbers, tax determination, and analysis of the local economy were reports of pirate attacks and raids. Autumn knew that there was a strong pirate presence in Auburn Isles, where an entire armada of pirates operated out of the port of Nacre, and she had been aware that they somewhat regularly raided the coastline for goods and bodies to press into service. But the caveat that bothered her in each of these reports was that they were apparently getting more frequent and destructive. What had once become an irregular occurrence for these towns was beginning to happen with a concerning amount of regularity. Pirate attacks were surely increasing and growing more organized, and the red sails of the pirate junks had even been spotted prowling off the coast of the Great Mellifluve river, searching for ships to prey on carrying goods out of the kirin heartlands. It was a bold move given the number of ships that ventured across those waters, and Autumn didn't like that one bit.\n\nFor now, the pirates were still only raiding small fishing villages and coastal towns, and staying clear of more populated and patrolled locales. But it couldn't be denied that the increasing occurrence of attacks and the wider range the pirates seemed to be patrolling was a bad omen for things to come. If the pirates were growing bolder, then it would only be a matter of time before they started attacking more lucrative targets. And with the realm still struggling to pull itself out of the stagnation and decay of The Silence, the last thing it needed right now was a series of pirate attacks destabilizing the coastal economy. Something would have to be done to stop the pirates before this problem spiraled out of control, or the consequences would be severe."

kirin_pirate.2.t:0 "Piracy in the South Kirin Sea"
kirin_pirate.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For years, ships sailing around the eastern coast of Zebrica have skirted around the isolated coast of the Realm of Kiria, avoiding the pirate den of the Auburn Isle by taking their ships out into deeper waters. But now, pirate activity in the kirin seas has increased dramatically, and so have the attacks on foreign vessels. As the Realm of Kiria undergoes its breakneck modernisation following the ending of The Silence, the pirates of Auburn Isle have lashed out with a desperate frenzy of raids and attacks, seeming as if they seek to delay the inevitable by seizing as much loot as they possibly can. As the problem spirals out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that the waters around the Realm of Kiria are dangerous, and any ships sailing around Eastern Zebrica should be well-prepared to fend off attacks until the situation is brought under control."

kirin_pirate.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The situation in the South Kirin Sea has reached a new level of danger, as it has been reported and confirmed by Feathesian and Kirin authorities that the pirates of Auburn Isle have managed to seize a Feathesian submarine off the coast of the pirate safe haven. The submarine reportedly suffered engine problems two weeks ago, forcing it to surface near Nacre. It was swiftly set upon by the pirates, and the captain of the submarine surrendered the vessel, where it was towed back to Nacre with the crew in chains. After pressuring the crew into repairing their submarine, the pirates have begun to employ it in surprise attacks on merchant ships and convoys that wander too close to Auburn Isle with terrifying effectiveness. With a modern submarine on their side, who knows just how much worse things will get before they get better?."

kirin_pirate.4.t:0 "Pirates Splinter Teak"
kirin_pirate.4.d:0 "Jade Lotus was the first from her village to spot the red sails of the pirate junks on the horizon.\n\nShe had sailed out of Teak's harbor with the rest of the fishing ships that morning, but had separated from them to check her crab pots further to the east from where they had decided to cast their nets for the day. It was just her in her little boat today; her father was ill at home, recovering from a bout of the flu, so she had had to venture out alone that morning. Now, with the red sails of the pirate junks baring down on her, she wished she at least had the protection of the rest of the fishing fleet with her. Even if she unfurled her square sail and rowed as hard as she could, she knew there was no way she'd be able to outrun the pirates. Instead, she could only brace herself for the inevitable.\n\nAs the fleet approached, one ship broke off from the others to intercept her dinghy while the rest continued on in the direction of Teak. Jade could only gulp and look up at the hulking ship soon looming over her, its rails lined with hardened kirin grinning down at her. The pirates tossed a rope ladder over the side, and one wolf-whistled down at her. "Why don't you make this easy for us, little lady?" one of the pirates shouted down to her. "Save us the effort so we can catch up with the rest of the fleet."\n\nFrightened beyond belief, yet still harboring a spark of defiance, Jade grabbed her wooden harpoon in her magic and pointed it up at the pirates. "Leave me alone!" she shouted back. "P-Please! I-I don't have anything to give you!"\n\n"Is that so?" Before Jade could react, two pirates jumped down onto her boat, rocking it back and forth and nearly tossing her overboard. She jabbed at one with her harpoon, but the pirate deflected it with her sword while the other one clubbed Jade on the back of her head. The mare groaned and fell to the floor, her vision swimming as the two pirates loomed over her.\n\n"She's a pretty one, isn't she?" the stallion remarked to his companion. "I think I'll take her back to Nacre and make her my wife." Then he knelt down in front of Jade and lifted her chin with his hoof, blowing a little kiss at her when she managed to focus on his face. "Don't worry, you poor thing. I'll take good care of you back home. I'll shower you with treasures and we'll make sweet love under the moonlight. You won't want for anything ever again. How does that sound?"\n\nJade had no response. With a final terrified sigh, her eyes rolled back into her skull, and darkness overcame her."
kirin_pirate.4.a:0 "I'm sorry, father..."

kirin_pirate.5.t:0 "Investment Losses"
kirin_pirate.5.d:0 "Candlelight struggled to make out anything around his ship as it plowed through the heavy fog sitting on the water. The fog was so thick that the electric lantern burning at the bow of the ship was little more than a yellow halo somewhere ahead of him. The mood of the crew on the ship was tense as the engines hummed and thrummed, churning the unsettled water and pushing the ship onwards through the haze.\n\nHe turned to his navigator, who scratched at the fringes of his lower mane as he pored over the maps in the bridge. "Are we past Auburn Isle yet?" he asked, trying to trace the progress his navigator had plotted on the map. "There's rocky shoals and some coral around it that I'd rather we not crash into. Not to mention the pirates. If that storm hadn't turned us closer inland, I would have preferred giving that island a wide berth. Sycee doesn't pay us well enough to tangle with pirates."\n\nn"We have marines to protect us, and they have modern guns," the navigator retorted. "At any rate, we should be almost around Auburn, if our instruments are correct. From there it should be smooth sailing to Verdant."\n\nCandlelight opened his mouth to reply, but the ship shook as something slammed into it from the side with a metallic clang. Shouts rang out through the fog, and Candlelight ran to the bridge windows to see kirin in salt-stained and mismatched garb jumping off of wooden vessels onto the deck from either side of his ship. Black powder weapons let out sharp reports with a flash of sparks, and as the first of the marines on deck fell in the ambush, the pirates snatched up their modern weapons and began firing on the rest. And every second, more and more jumped onto his ship...\n\nCandlelight's face paled. He knew the battle was over before it even began. The pirates must have followed his lantern through the fog, and with the wind on their side, they had glided in without making a sound. The ship and all of its goods were theirs, and he wasn't about to die to protect the Sycee Trading House's product.\n\nHe wasted no time in formally surrendering when the pirates stormed the bridge."

kirin_pirate.6.t:0 "Maritime Chaos in the Kirin Seas"
kirin_pirate.6.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Due to the uncontrolled nature of the pirates rampaging through the Kirin Seas, foreign shipping traffic has been dramatically reduced as no nations are willing to risk placing more of their sailors' lives in danger to sail around Eastern Zebrica. The Realm of Kiria has so far been unable to muster any kind of meaningful response to the raids, and no other nations with sizable navies are willing or able to commit their navies to eradicating the problem for the kirin, citing more pressing naval concerns elsewhere. In the face of the mounting economic and political toll of the pirates' uncontested control of the East Kirin Sea, the newly-reorganised Kirin government at Vermilion risks domestic instability and foreign scrutiny for their continued inaction in addressing the pirate menace, having effectively surrendered control of their coastal waters and shipping lanes to the pirates of Auburn Isle."

kirin_pirate.7.t:0 "The Blockade of the Great Mellifluve" ##maximum of 7 raids over the 3 1/2 year period
kirin_pirate.7.d:0 "Pond Frog looked up from the flooded rows of the rice paddie as the hulking junks sailed into the mouth of the Great Mellifluve, using the southerly winds to force themselves about two hundred meters upstream before lowering their red sails and dropping anchor. The ships arrived in three ranks, with the first and third lines turning their bows toward the shore and arranging their broadsides up and down the river, and the second rank oriented north and south with their guns trained on the shore. There they sat and there they waited, their red hulls practically glowing like fire in the morning sun as the blockade settled in.\n\nIt did not take them long to ensnare their first victim. A merchant ship sailing down the river was forced to turn to port and drop its anchor to pivot before reaching the blockade, but before it could open its sails and catch the wind to sail upriver again, longships launched from the junks rowed out to it and swarmed the ship. Within minutes, the crew was subdued and the captured ship was sailed into the protective embrace of the pirate blockade, where it was anchored until a treasure fleet could be amassed and sailed away to safety. As the hours rolled on, ship after ship fell into the same trap, with even ships sailing up the river from the South Kirin Sea to Verdant falling victim. By the end of the day, and by the time Pond Frog finally was ready to go home, the pirates had amassed seventeen ships in their protective bubble.\n\nThe farmer simply shook his head as he packed up his tools and waded out of the flooded fields. At least the pirates had more valuable prizes to keep them entertained than rice. To the merchants and their ships, the appearance of a blockade in the Great Mellifluve had likely been a horrific surprise. But to Pond Frog, it was nothing new. Kiria had been a broken and defunct country when his father was a foal, and his father's father before him. Nothing had changed, despite all that talk coming out of the capital. The Realm was still broken, and Pond Frog didn't see it getting fixed any time soon."

kirin_crisis.1.t:0 "The Poisoned Lifeblood of Kiria"
kirin_crisis.1.d:0 "The horrific reek of sewage and pollution struck Autumn Blaze like a slap to the face as soon as she stepped out of the train car in Verdant's train station. Even a few hundred meters from the shoreline, the Great Mellifluve stank like rotting fish and foul eggs. Cinder Glow gagged as she followed Autumn off the train, and she quickly pinched her nose shut with a cleft hoof. "That smells horrific!" she shouted over the hiss and whistle of the steam engine behind them. "What crawled up Concord's divine rear and died?"\n\n"This is terrible," Autumn said, wincing as she made her way from the train station toward the river. Sickly kirin dotted the streets, leaning against the walls and grimacing, while others briskly trotted to where they needed to go, noses covered with cloth masks to keep out the stench as best they could. When the delegation from Vermilion arrived on the shores of the Great Mellifluve, they found them covered with dead and rotting fish, the once blue waters of Kiria's lifeblood a sickly green and black. To their horror, they saw a few kirin on one of the island communes of Verdant dropping buckets into the poisoned water to bring back to their homes. It was little wonder Verdant was so full of sickly and starving kirin.\n\n"The factories upstream are causing this," Autumn said. "I read reports that they were dumping industrial waste into the Mellifluve, but I didn't imagine it was this bad!"\n\n"It's not just the factories either," Cinder remarked. "Farmers are dumping fertilizer into their fields, and it's all running off with the rain. And the cities are exploding in population. They don't have anything near robust enough sewage systems to deal with all the waste. All of that is getting dumped into the river, and it all flows downstream to Verdant."\n\n"We have to step in and do something to stop this," Autumn decided. "We can't let these kirin languish like this. The pollution is killing them, and if we don't do something about it, it'll kill Verdant itself!""
kirin_crisis.1.a:0 "If we don't save the lifeblood of Kiria, then our nation will die!"

kirin_crisis.2.t:0 "The End is Nigh!"
kirin_crisis.2.d:0 "Littlescale maneuvered her tiny dinghy through the many canals of Verdant, her pole clutched tightly in her magic as she pushed it against the canal floors. "River clams! River clams!" the filly yelled, rattling her bucket of clams with a hoof as she passed by countless kirin sailing up and down the canal with her. "Two for a tael! Five for two! Clams are clean and tasty, the pollution can't get in their shells!"\n\nShe finally reached the mouth of the canal and turned left, making her way toward the Coruscating Lagoon, Verdant's largest water market. Hundreds of little boats bobbed in the green and black waters filled with countless peddlers like her selling their wares to kirin that sailed past. But today, the calls and cries of peddlers were silent, and hundreds of kirin watched from their boats and the shorelines as a tall stallion in fiery red and orange robes stood on a barge in the middle of the lagoon. Curious, Littlescale pushed her dinghy closer to hear what he was saying.\n\n"Verdant has been abandoned by Vermilion!" the stallion said, and Littlescale recognized him as a priest of the Rising Fire sect that dominated Verdant. "We have been left to rot in filth and sewage. We languish in the waste that they pollute the lifeblood of Kiria with! Our children and elderly are stick and starving, and the air hangs heavy with the stench of death and disease! Our beautiful waters, once as blue as sapphires, are now black with acid! Who is to blame for this? It is the greed of the northerners and the vanity of the east! Vermilion drags us into a new age, an age of marvelous modernization, or so they say. But look at what their industrial revolution has done to our home! We suffer and die because they chase greed and power. Greed and power! The Plenum in Vermilion has abandoned Concord's teachings. They have forgotten Her tenets! And worse yet, they have poisoned the mind of our beloved Matriarch, forcing her to chase progress and growth over a harmonious relationship with nature. It must end!"\n\nThe crowd murmured its approval, but the priest was not finished yet. "If we allow the greed and corruption in Vermilion to fester, then Kiria will be ruined in a few short decades. They must be stopped, and the corrupt hedonism of the so-called priests and mystics of The Way of Fire must be put to an end. So I ask you, kirin of Verdant, will you stand with me and my brothers and sisters as we take back what is ours? Will you stand with us as we save our home from pestilence and plague? Will you stand with the Rising Fire against the depredations of fickle Vermilion?"\n\nHe was answered with applause and cheering, and even Littlescale clapped her hooves together. The Way of Fire had abandoned Verdant and all who lived in it. It was time to look for new guidance to save her home."
kirin_crisis.2.a:0 "The Rising Fire shall save Verdant and carry out Concord's will!"

kirin_crisis.3.t:0 "The Great Typhoon"
kirin_crisis.3.d:0 "Rain Shine awoke that morning feeling refreshed and well-rested. Vermilion was draped in gray as the clouds above continued to rain on the city, with the occasional gust of wind rattling the foundations of her palace, but it did not bother her. She always slept better when it stormed outside, and she loved to sit in her morning room and read the teachings of Concord with a cup of ginseng and listen to the rain pitter-patter on the roof. But as she prepared to sequester herself away in the morning room, she turned first to a page for her morning briefing of the day's events.\n\n"It is bad news, your Divinity," the page said, bowing his head low. "Last night's storm was the dying gasp of the terrible typhoon that struck our east coast two days ago. We spent all day yesterday assessing the damage, there was simply so much destruction wrought along the coastline. The heavy rainfall and strong winds caused massive flooding, landslides, and widespread damage to buildings, farms, and infrastructure. We don't know how many kirin lost their lives, but we expect it to be at least five hundred. The coast needs aid immediately if we are to mitigate some of the damage."\n\nRain Shine was taken aback; even though she had made considerable effort to learn more of the affairs of the Realm she was supposed to rule since ending the Silence, sometimes she still felt like she was kept in her gilded cocoon, isolated from the world outside. "Then I shall send the aid the coast needs immediately," she declared. "I will write an official proclamation this morning. Is there anything that is already being done?"\n\n"The priests and mystics of The Way of Fire have organized donation and charity efforts to bring taels and food to the hardest hit regions, your Divinity. Fickle Current has also asked the members of the diaspora to donate funding toward rebuilding the region. If there is any silver lining to be found in this catastrophe, it is that their funding and involvement will help to modernize the coastline now that the land has been cleared by the storm."\n\n"The Way of Fire and the diaspora rarely get along," Rain Shine observed. She had at least learned enough through the Plenum to understand that much about her subjects. "If they do not learn to work together, I fear their efforts may hurt more than they help." She dismissed the page with a wave of her hoof. "See to it that Fickle Current and Winter Frost receive my direct instructions to coordinate their efforts. We cannot afford to let this crisis grow worse.""
kirin_crisis.3.a:0 "It will be done, your Divinity."

kirin_crisis.4.t:0 "The Fire Rises where the Tide Recedes"
kirin_crisis.4.d:0 "It had been a long few weeks in Vermilion for Autumn Blaze. Ever since the Great Typhoon smashed into the eastern coast and left ruin and devastation all along the coastline, Vermilion and the Morning Secretariat had been thrown into turmoil. Securing funding and a disaster relief plan should have been an easy first step that everykirin could agree on, but when it came time to decide who should provide the money and where it should be directed, the Secretariat ground to a halt. Partisan fighting forced the bill to drag on and on, and while the Secretariat argued amongst themselves, the kirin living on the coast suffered in wait for help that was taking too long to arrive. It had taken Autumn bringing Rain Shine into the Secretariat and asking her to issue decrees to arbitrate on the relief plan that had finally started to get things moving, but it had been too little, too late. It seemed like every kirin in the capital soon started blaming the Plenum for the failure to aid with disaster relief, from the most conservative Way of Fire mystics to the most ardently nationalist diaspora returnees. Even farmers and laborers have started to speak out against the government, and it became increasingly clear to all the members of the Plenum that the kirin of the Realm blamed them for the suffering along the coast.\n\nBut that was not the end of the bad news. As Autumn looked through her day's reports, she found a report from an aide traveling the region and detailing the situation. In lieu of proper governmental support, the Rising Fire religious sect had taken it upon themselves to step in and provide aid to those hit hardest by the typhoon. While this was good for the kirin along the coast, it foretold disaster for the authority of Vermilion over the Realm, as the Rising Fire grew in strength and support in the east to bolster their stronghold over the realm in the west. The intervention by the Rising Fire has created a surge of popular grassroots support for their communalistic ideals at the expense of the Way of Fire and Matriarch Rain Shine's authority, who could soon find themselves squeezed by communalist heresy from both sides. And should the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire come to blows..."

kirin_crisis.5.t:0 "Kirian Venom"
kirin_crisis.5.d:0 "By the time Internal Affairs arrived at the scene of the crime, the constable and local militia had already started arranging the bodies by the rail tracks for identification. He frowned down at the twisted remains of the rails, warped and curled by an explosive blast. Two hundred meters away, the train that had been carrying passengers from Vermilion to Chrysanthemum lay on its side, its windows broken and its frame crumpled, the Trans-Kiria Rail insignia decorating its exterior pockmarked with bullet holes. Even this long after the attack, one of the wheels on the caboose still turned lazily beneath the afternoon sun, the momentum from the crash still whiling away on well-greased bearings.\n\nAffairs quickly located the constable and pulled him aside to get the details right from the kirin who likely knew best what was going on. "What happened here?" he asked him. "Those rails were blasted apart. Was it bandits?"\n\n"Absolutely," the constable said. "Their bodies were littered all around the train. They got enough gunpowder to blow the rails and derail the train, but they only had swords and scythes, while the guards had rifles. They paid dearly for what they stole."\n\n"And what did they steal?" Affairs asked.\n\n"Chrysanthemum was expecting Lady Zenith Bloom to arrive today," the constable said. "The NAKP had dispatched her to the city to establish a western branch of her party in Chrysanthemum, or so we had been told. She brought a lot of gold bullion with her, too. Somehow the bandits found that out and laid their ambush. Lots of kirin died here today." The constable shrugged. "There were no survivors from the train. We haven't found Lady Zenith's body yet, but we assume she's among the dead somewhere. At any rate, this seems like the last hurrah for those bandits. Not likely to be many of them left after they tried rushing riflekirin with swords."\n\nAffairs nodded and thanked the constable for his time before he left. He could only look at the carnage around the rails and shake his head. Was this one final act of glory for the bandits of the west? Kiria was changing so quickly and so drastically that even bandits had to know their time was coming soon. Perhaps it was one final statement from a dying breed of kirin, one final chapter to their story for the world to remember them by. So many things were changing these days that Kiria would need an epitaph for the old ways within a few years."
kirin_crisis.5.a:0 "The world is changing, and Kiria has no place for outlaws anymore."

kirin_crisis.6.t:0 "Strife and Want in Peace-and-Plenty"
kirin_crisis.6.d:0 ""A messenger here to see you, Premier," Cinder Glow warned Autumn Blaze before the imperial messenger hurried into Autumn's office. Autumn looked up from her paperwork and opened her mouth to offer the messenger a greeting, only for the kirin in front of her to quickly toss a half-dozen scrolls down onto Autumn's desk before she could get a world out. "There is a famine in Peace-and-Plenty," the messenger said, bowing her head. "I didn't even need to read the messages to know what they were about. I saw it with my own eyes. The farms are failing and kirin are starving in the towns. Those letters almost certainly are asking for Vermilion's help in solving the famine."\n\nAutumn was taken aback, and it took her a few moments to find the words to respond. "Peace-and-Plenty is in a famine? How could that be? When Fickle Current proposed implementing new farming techniques there, he said they would be limited to the Sorghum Foundry's private farmland. How can the entire breadbasket of Kiria be starving?"\n\n"Sorghum owns more farmland in the area than you think," the messenger explained. "They officially only own 300 acres of farmland around the city limits, but they forced several thousand more acres of farmland owned by independent farmers into sharecropping after they helped to create and then bought up titles to the land in the name of the Matriarch with the help of the NAKP. The farmers own and work the land at Sorghum's leisure, and earlier this season Sorghum forced them all to adopt new planting practices if they wanted to keep the land."\n\nAutumn Blaze was shocked and taken aback. Of course, Current had neglected to mention that little detail when he proposed his new farming techniques. And now that they had all failed, they were taking down Peace-and-Plenty with them. How was Kiria supposed to feed its people if its most fertile and prosperous farmland had failed? If Peace-and-Plenty was struck by famine, Autumn could scarcely imagine how terrible things were about to become for the rest of Kiria. "I... thank you, messenger," she said, staring off into space above the mare's head. "Leave the notes and you are dismissed. I will... I'll try to find some way to deal with this all... somehow...""

kirin_crisis.7.t:0 "The Fragrant Smell of Chaos"
kirin_crisis.7.d:0 "Coal Fire stood in the darkness of her bakery as the sounds of rioting and looting filled the streets outside. She couldn't see much past the boards she'd nailed over her windows and door, but she knew the mob was getting closer. Soon, they'd decide to turn their fury on her bakery, and all she had to defend herself with was a black powder pistol her grandfather owned. She was terrified at the thought she'd have to use it. She'd never killed anykirin before. Could she do it if her life was on the line?\n\nIt had been a scary few weeks in Fragrance, especially for bakers like herself. Grain supplies had collapsed with the famine in the countryside, and Coal didn't have enough flour to make bread for anykirin more than herself and her parents. Fragrance had started importing food to combat the growing crisis, but that had just made the prices on food staples rise dramatically. Just to make ends meet, Coal had had to raise the price on a loaf of bread from one tael to fifteen, and she'd already had to chase down a few colts who tried to steal from her when she wasn't looking. But despite all of that, Coal had hoped she'd be able to get through the tough times until Fragrance solved its food issues.\n\nThen Old Leatherscales died. Somekirin had beaten the amiable, grandfatherly bard to death on the street corner where he played the spike fiddle by day and slept by night, and looted his corpse of its valuables. A few days later, the authorities hanged a colt from a tree across the road from Old Leatherscales' corner - a street urchin from the countryside who they claimed was responsible for the murder. The response from the Fragrance's community of rural migrant workers, experiencing the brunt of the food shortage and scapegoated for the city's growing ills, had been explosive and furious. A mob quickly formed and started looting the granaries across the city, and once those were empty, turned their attention to the local bakeries. Until now, Coal's had been spared their attention, giving her time to prepare. But they were coming, and it wouldn't be long before they tried to steal what bread she had left.\n\nGlass shattered across the street, and Coal snatched the pistol in her magic, the weapon quivering in its red aura. Vermilion needed to do something to save Fragrance from itself. It had to. Only the Matriarch could stop the growing violence that was swallowing the city. And if they were fast enough, maybe they could save Coal and her family as well."

kirin_crisis.8.t:0 "Tea Time with the Divine"
kirin_crisis.8.d:0 "Autumn Blaze took another sip from her tea, watching as Rain Shine did the same across from her. It was funny how life was, sometimes. Here she was, sharing tea with the Matriarch Superior of Kiria, and making idle conversation as friends. She knew that the kirin sitting across from her was a divine being to which she should show respect and devotion, but she had grown so comfortable in the Matriarch's presence that she saw her as a friend she could speak freely with like any other kirin.\n\nOf course, given the situation of Kiria, the world of politics could not be escaped forever. "Fickle Current approached me with a request today," the Matriarch began. "He is growing concerned with a movement that calls themselves the Incendiaries. Have you heard of them? They have a substantial base among the peasant farmers, and they give them an outlet to channel their frustration against modernization into. The farmers fear losing their land for infrastructure and urban projects, and instead believe in land justice, collective ownership of the land, and a resurgence of religion in our way of life. They have even started attacking and damaging new projects that are being constructed, and the kirin building them."\n\n"I heard about the attack on the dam near Chrysanthemum and the granary fire at Cornsilk," Autumn said. "But truth be told, I have so much going on that I haven't been able to give it proper attention. I think I read that they're loosely affiliated with the Rising Fire; at the very least, they're certainly friendly enough with that sect of our religion. If they're being organized, that poses a big problem for us."\n\n"Even still... I am sympathetic to their plight," Rain Shine said. She sighed as she added, "I spent sixty years of my life isolated in Vermilion, oblivious to the suffering of my subjects. And now they are being thrust into a brave new world just as quickly as I have. They are scared and confused, and I don't want them to be hurt because they are afraid." After a moment's pause, she pursed her lips and looked away. "I want you to learn more about the situation and recommend a course of action, Premier. Find me a solution that is best for everykirin, and I will make it so.""
kirin_crisis.8.a:0 "Of course, Matriarch."

kirin_crisis.9.t:0 "An Incendiary Decision"
kirin_crisis.9.d:0 "Autumn Blaze bowed as a formality when Rain Shine's attendant led her into the Matriarch's reading room. Normally, such a greeting wasn't necessary between the two friends, but when other kirin were around, it wouldn't do to act disrespectfully to the country's divine Matriarch Superior. Autumn had at least learned enough about politics to realize a slip up as small as that would give her rivals an opening to try and take her down in the next gathering of the Plenum.\n\nBut when Rain Shine dismissed the attendant and the two kirin were all alone, Autumn smiled and joined Rain Shine by her side on the floor. "I've spent some time looking further into the Incendiaries matter," she said, and she placed a folder full of papers before the Matriarch. "And I mean, phew, those kirin are sure going crazy. They're not really a huge problem right now, but if we let it grow out of control, this incendiary situation is going to grow into an inferno. So the way I see it, you can either strongly condemn the Incendiaries and their movement, or express sympathy and ask them to cooperate so that we can actually get to the root of their problems and help them out."\n\n"I see," Rain Shine noted, but then she frowned. "And why would I not simply choose the sympathetic route? They still are my subjects, despite their lashing out."\n\n"Because... well frankly, Matriarch, there's a chance they won't listen to you," Autumn said, anxiously rubbing her hooves together. "You're our divine Matriarch Superior by all the rights and blessings of Concord, which means your word is Her will as well, and kirin should listen to you immediately. But the Incendiaries might be too mad at the state and the government to listen to you. And if kirin in the countryside are ignoring your divine voice, then that undermines your authority to a considerable degree." She sighed and shook her head. "As much as I hate to admit it, I think that the condemnation is a safer option. You can call upon all faithful kirin in the land to report on Incendiary activity and aid the authorities in cracking down on the movement. That way, you're appealing to kirin who already respect you, rather than those who don't. They'll listen to what you have to say, so you don't have to worry about losing face with them. But you're going to make the Incendiaries a LOT angrier if you condemn their movement." Then she bitterly chuckled and added, "Oh, forgive me if I say it, Rain Shine, but I am so glad I'm not our Matriarch Superior right now. I'm not the one who has to make the decree.""

kirin_crisis.10.d:0 ""The Plenum now gives the floor to Governor Amber Grain of the Auspicious Clouds Prefecture."\n\nAutumn Blaze watched as the governor made her way to the center of the Plenum's chamber to speak. The mare must have been in her late sixties, but she carried herself with a fire and brimstone air about her that made her seem imposing and youthful despite her age. And she wasted no time launching into the reason why she had requested this audience with the Plenum in the first place. "My prefecture is in chaos and lawlessness!" she snapped, harsh eyes sweeping over the assembled delegates as if they were axes and the kirin were trees. "Bandits are emerging from the countryside to prey on our new flows of trade and commerce, dead for so long. They attack kirin on the roads in broad daylight, because they know nokirin will stop them! Where is the Vermilion Banner Army? Where are the soldiers? Things are too out of hoof for my constabulary to handle on its own. My prefecture, as well as the rest of the western prefectures, need direct action from the army, yesterday!"\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward should be modernizing the countryside and providing kirin with better jobs and more opportunities than ever before," Fickle Current countered. "The only reason there would be a bandit problem would be because of a misuse of the funds and aid the Plenum has sent the prefectures."\n\nAmber Grain scowled at him. "You were born wearing that suit, weren't you?" she snapped at him. "If you spent one single day of your life toiling in the fields or working in one of those deathtraps you call factories you'd understand why kirin are turning to banditry. All these companies buying up and reshuffling farmland is displacing farmers off of land their families have worked for generations, and half of them won't even go into the cities to work in factories when they see the maimed and mutilated begging for taels in the streets because they lost hooves or horns on the job. And the foremares there work their labor to the bone for little more than a tael an hour, with no protections and no rights. What else is a kirin without skills to do but turn to banditry? So until you fix that up, the West needs soldiers if we're going to deal with this bandit problem!""

kirin_crisis.11.t:0 "Harmony with Nature"
kirin_crisis.11.d:0 "Autumn Blaze and Winter Frost watched side-by-side as five priests and priestesses of The Way of Fire led a procession of followers down to the banks of the Great Mellifluve outside of Vermilion. Singing, chanting, and simple music tapped out on a drum and chimes accompanied them down to the water's edge, where the assembled kirin waded out into the blue waters of Kiria's lifeblood. Autumn, for her part, was just happy to see the clear blue of the water return once again. The poison in the rivers was receding, and Verdant had already made great strides in recovering downstream. It was something the Plenum and the Morning Secretariat could be proud of, at least. Well, maybe not Fickle Current and his cronies, but the rest of the Kiria...\n\n"It's still not as clear as I remember it," Winter Frost solemnly noted, her eyes wandering away from the ceremony and toward the deepest blue of the river. "There's still poison in our lifeblood. Just less of it."\n\n"Completely eliminating pollution was an impossible order," Autumn explained. "We would have to cease our modernization completely. You know we can't do that. Kiria needs this modernization to rejoin the world. But we could at least limit how much factories could dump into the river, and force them to explore other means of dealing with their waste." She hesitated before adding, "Thank you for convincing the mystics of The Way of Fire to support our efforts. We wouldn't have been able to do it without them."\n\n"The sixth tenet of The Way of Fire says we must live in peace and harmony with nature," the priestess said. "This is not harmony, but perhaps it is peace. If the future children of Kiria can benefit from what we do today, then I will sleep easier for having my mystics find compromise outside of Concord's divine wisdom."\n\nAs the chanting in the water came to a close, two of the priests waded back to the shoreline and set fire to the fuses protruding from a rack of fireworks. One after the other, the fireworks shot into the air with colorful sparks and briefly dazzling displays of light. Winter Frost bowed her head at the display of thanks to Concord, and Autumn did the same after a moment. It was the perfect end to a peaceful day, and Autumn was thankful that she and Winter could share it in friendly company instead of as bitter rivals on the Plenum floor."

Where the town had almost been completely destroyed by the Great Typhoon slamming into Kiria's east coast, all of the nation had come together to help rebuild the coastline. Where there was once destruction and desolation, peace and prosperity had taken its place. And now, with the reconstruction efforts complete, the townsfolk of Radiance had taken it upon themselves to thank those who had saved them with a feast for the scores of volunteers who rebuilt their town.\n\nIt was the same throughout much of the east coast, Rain Shine noted as she strode into the town as the surprise guest of honor. Kirin were happy to see her, and the glee and relief in their faces led her to softly smile back at them. Recovering from the typhoon had been a group effort, with kirin from all walks of life working together. Soldiers, bureaucrats, returnees, mystics, peasants, and even NAKP cadres and local Rising Fire leaders had all contributed to rebuilding the coastline. It was what Rain Shine had wanted to see from her subjects as Kiria embarked on the Grand Gallop Onward, and what she saw here today instilled confidence that her efforts were not for naught. If the cooperation and prosperity in Radiance was a barometer for the Realm as a whole, then obviously the kirin people were doing something right.\n\nThat pleased Rain Shine more than any amount of respect or devotion her subjects gave her."

kirin_crisis.13.t:0 "Sharing What Little We Have"
kirin_crisis.13.d:0 "It had started with a single cart rumbling down the dirt road to Fragrance. That cart, pulled by an elder kirin who had seen dozens of seasons come and go, had been loaded to the brim with as much wheat as it could hold. And when he arrived in famine-stricken Fragrance, he merely unhitched himself from the cart and wandered off, only returning to the cart once it was empty to take it back to his farm. Day in and day out, the elder kirin would make the trip to the city, giving away his one cartful of wheat to anykirin who needed it. He became a hero to the local kirin, and when his cart broke a wheel on the journey into town, the smith made him a new one for free as a sign of thanks.\n\nIt wasn't long before the story of this humble farmer spread throughout the countryside. Shortly after, where before there was one cart, soon there were two, then five, then ten. More and more farmers gathered up everything they could spare and began making the journey to Fragrance, delivering it to kirin in need for free. Within a month, the same started happening in other hungry cities in the realm. The poor peasant farmers with barely enough land to feed their families started to solve a crisis that the NAKP and the large consortium farms could not, and in doing so, began to knit their communities together. With food filling bellies once again, the tempers began to cool and kirin started seeing each other as friends once more, not as rival hungry mouths that would take their next meal away. Even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself spoke to the nation of the movement, and issuing an imperial decree to establish a national Farmers' Day as a holiday in thanks to the peasant farmers for saving the nation from famine by sharing what little they had.\n\nAs for the farmer who started the movement? He simply returned to his farm without giving anykirin his name, unwilling to be put in the national spotlight as a hero. In his own words to one reporter that managed to track down his homestead: "I just did what I thought was right. Kirin were hungry, and I had something I could spare. Simple as that.""

kirin_crisis.14.d:0 "It had only taken five minutes for the last bandit cell outside of Amaranth to collapse. The local constabulary, supported by a company of Vermilion banners, had surrounded the bandit hideout and demanded the surrender of everykirin inside. When the bandit leader insisted on fighting to the death, a single shot from a markskirin ended her rule far quicker than it began, and her followers shortly thereafter surrendered to the banners.\n\nMidnight Candle watched with a small frown on her face as the bandits were led away from their encampment one by one, with banner soldiers guarding the column on either side. The bandits certainly didn't look like the vicious marauders they were in the stories parents told their foals; rather, they were poor and broken kirin, many well into their middle ages, many more barely old enough to be considered adults. Some had foals clinging to their legs or backs, crying in fear as their parents were dragged away to await their fate. All of it hurt Candle's soul, and she couldn't help but mention it when the company commander walked by.\n\n"They may be poor farmers just trying to feed their families, but they're bandits, Candle," the officer said, shaking his head. "Desperation doesn't forgive the killing and stealing they've done."\n\n"We should be helping them, not imprisoning them," Candle countered, and she touched her red and orange robes for emphasis. "The Rising Fire wants to help all the kirin of the land. If we work together to support one another, then farmers wouldn't have to turn to banditry to support their families. The Way of Fire only imposes order and treats the symptoms of unrest, but it does nothing to weed out the root cause."\n\nThe officer just shook his head. "I don't disagree with you," he began, "but how far should we let an individual push their interests when it hurts so many more? If we are ever to move forward as a nation, we need to unify and deal with the problems at hoof. Maybe one day we'll be able to stop kirin from turning to a life of banditry, but all we can do now is play catch up and stop the ones who already have." He patted Candle on the shoulder and gave her a small nod. "Go back to camp and ready a service for the troops, chaplain. I'm sure there will be plenty more like you who want to know if what they're doing is right in Concord's eyes.""

Their clothes and coats were smeared with black ash from countless sacred fires, and one had even tied gunpowder-coated string into their mane, though he hadn't lit the sparkling fuses before making his appeal to Rain Shine. "Where is our Matriarch?" the mare among them asked.

But I feel I must reiterate, Premier, that the resources they extract are important for our modernisation efforts. It cannot progress smoothly were they to be interfered with."\n\n"All of the mountains must be declared sacred property!" the other stallion priest exclaimed. "They are Concord's by right.

kirin_crisis.16.d:0 "Coin Counter paced back and forth outside of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's study, trying her best not to show her anxiety or break out in a nervous sweat at her impending meeting with Kiria's absolute theocratic leader. She had never met the Matriarch before, nor so much as seen her in person outside of anything resembling an official function of the state, and here she was about to spend ten, fifteen, maybe even twenty minutes in conversation with her, one on one, about a matter of absolute economic priority. She was terrified that she'd completely forget what she needed to say and then stare at the Matriarch, dumbfounded, like a deer after the invention of artificial lights.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she set her folder down on a nearby table and began to leaf through its pages to remind herself on what she needed to say. In Fragrance and Rhapsody, the returnee population had become so entrenched in their ways that they had established a de facto parallel authority to the imperial administration that consisted entirely of their most respected (and wealthy) businesskirin, intellectuals, artists, and other high-profile figures. That was a political problem all in its own, but the economic problem at the route of it came from these figures' desire to use their own paper money over the Kirin tael, the gold coin that had been around since the creation of the Realm. The diaspora's paper money was based on the Sycee Trading House's bank notes, which they called 'scrips', and were backed up by the massive stocks of silver and gold Sycee possessed in Griffonia, which they were slowly but surely moving back to Kiria. The scrips were far more popular (and stronger) than the Kirin tael in the northern cities, and were undoubtedly responsible for strong economic growth and investment among the returning diaspora, but it undermined and devalued the tael the more it circulated. And now, Coin Counter had to explain the situation to the Matriarch and ask for her opinion on what should be the official currency of Kiria. The money was, after all, minted and circulated under her divine authority.\n\nThat left Coin Counter with a tough pitch to sell. Should she try to convince Rain Shine to disallow the use of the diaspora scrip, strengthening the Kirin tael and reasserting Vermilion's dominance over the north but slowing its economic growth? Or should she convince the Matriarch to accept the scrip as acceptable currency alongside the tael, even at the risk of devaluing the official currency further, to encourage the growth of the north even more?"

But while the rest of the Realm read and ratified the constitution, the city of Rhapsody quickly rejected a part of the constitution relating to the implementation of the new judicial system. After a quick talk with her advisor, Fern Flare, she soon figured out why.\n\n"Rhapsody has always had this important judicial institution that they're fiercely proud of," Fern Flare explained. "The Procurate of Rhapsody is this entire system where the priests with the greatest seniority in the city can serve as absolute arbiters and judges in any cases or complaints they take an interest in. It's a system where right and wrong is decided solely by whoever is highest in the pecking order, and it's been entrenched in the city for a long time, even during the peak of Vermilion's power. I can understand why they don't want to let it go."\n\n"They have to, though," Autumn protested, frowning at the letter of Rhapsody's rejection. "They can't just accept part of the constitution and keep their own judicial system. The constitution is needed to standardize our laws and practices across the entire Realm so it's easier to govern. They can't even claim that they're doing it for The Way of Fire; even Winter Frost agreed to it, and she's THE voice of our religion in Vermilion."\n\n"In Vermilion, but not in Rhapsody," Fern Flare quickly countered.

kirin_crisis.19.d:0 "Autumn Blaze would be the first kirin to admit she had no experience with the art of war, and so she had long tried to put matters of warfare into the hooves of experienced and studied kirin she could trust. But the newest dilemma on her desk was one that she had to attend to personally as the imperial premier. With the modernisation of the country, and the dawning reality that the world the Realm had returned to was even more dangerous than the one it had cut ties with a century ago, Kiria was in desperate need of a modern, functional, and supplied army to protect its borders. That left Autumn, as its premier and effective head of government, in dire need of a solution to bolster the banners and provide for Kiria's security throughout the process.\n\nAutumn tapped her pen to her lips as she tried to recall what she'd learned at her last meeting with the officers of the Vermilion Banner Army, and that was when an idea came to her. On the western border with the zebra natives and griffon colonizers existed many regional militias that had maintained their military traditions throughout the Silence to protect their lands from raids across the river. They were antiquated and fought with swords and outdated battle tactics, but they were organized, well-trained, and had a strong identity as warrior-kirin. Better yet, when the news of the Grand Gallop Onward reached the western border, they had immediately reaffirmed their oaths of loyalty to Vermilion and Matriarch Rain Shine. There was a possibility in here to do something with them and bolster the army as a whole.\n\nAutumn snatched a sheet of paper off her desk and prepared to write down a proposal for the Reform Bureau, but she hesitated before putting ink to paper. These units were hardly top of the line; what they possessed in discipline they lacked in equipment and modern doctrine. Would it be better to let them keep their organization as autonomous military units and adopt them into the Banner Army, or dissolve and disperse them to integrate them into the growing banners as a whole? Keeping them together would please the martial families of the west, but it would also hurt the spread of new ideas. But dispersing them into the army would allow them to be better trained and more effectively used, and the mixture of ideas from throughout the Realm would help dilute any biases of the western soldiers; The Rising Fire was very popular in the west, after all, and it could be a risky endeavor to let those beliefs grow unchecked..."

kirin_crisis.20.d:0 "Sometimes, it was days like this that reminded Autumn Blaze just how little she understood about Kiria, despite being its imperial premier. She had always known that the Realm was a large nation home to many diverse kirin culture groups, but never before had she faced the problem of having to use a translator to speak to kirin who lived under her jurisdiction. But as a group of kirin from Verdant brought a petition all the way up to the Morning Secretariat for them to resolve, Autumn felt like she was beginning to grasp just how monumental a challenge keeping the nation together during the Grand Gallop Onward would be.\n\nAfter sorting out some confusion with the translator, and with the assistance of members of the Secretariat who hailed from Verdant, the issue at hoof became much clearer. Verdant, diverse as it was, had its own dialect of the kirin language, to the point where it was difficult for Autumn, who was from Massicot, to understand what they were saying. While the language the majority of the Realm spoke and the dialect Verdant spoke used the same script, their pronunciation, grammar, and vernacular were extremely different. But the crux of the issue rested on what Fickle Current and his NAKP party had been attempting to do in the city. The NAKP had begun to offer language classes in Verdant to help the local populace learn how to speak the Vermilion dialect of kirish, which had angered the local leaders in Verdant, especially the mystics of The Rising Fire, who felt they were being scolded for supposed 'backwardness' by the bourgeoisie colonizers from the north. Their demands were quite simple: that the NAKP leave the city and cease attempting to teach Vermilion kirish in Verdant's schools and teahouses, and let Verdant proudly embrace its cultural heritage instead of letting it be erased by the influence of the north. When their demands triggered outrage from the NAKP members seated in the Morning Secretariat, who claimed that it was the right of the NAKP to conduct these educational ventures to promote patriotism for the Realm as a whole, Autumn quickly realized that it would come down to her and her supporters to decide whether to accept the petitioners' plea or not."

Maybe it was the way his eyes seemed to pick her apart whenever she spoke, or the slight crookedness of his muzzle, a memory from some traumatic injury long in his history. More likely it was the way he spoke, and what he spoke about, that made her feel ill at ease. Not even Matriarch Rain Shine sitting by her side made her feel any better.\n\n"Thank you for that... lengthy history on the Banner of the Covered Cage, Ember Wane," Autumn said, picking her notes up and jogging the pages together. "I never knew that Matriarch Noctilucent Charm had created an organization so... loyal and dedicated to enforcing the policies of The Silence. Coming from a small farm in Massicot, I never would have imagined that one of the Matriarch's banners was dedicated to rooting out any attempts to turn back the clock and go back to what life was like before The Silence. That's, uh... quite a doozy."\n\n"It was necessary," Ember Wane grunted in a gruff voice. "Kiria's survival depended on making sure The Silence was followed. We worked in the shadows to make sure that it was. My family, and the families of all my bannerkin and comrades, have spent generations enforcing it, without thanks or recognition for our hard work. We have always been loyal to the Matriarchs, first to Noctilucent Charm, and now to you, Matriarch Rain Shine. And now, with Kiria changing and The Silence ended, I come to you on behalf of the Banner of the Covered Cage to ask for official recognition of who we are and what we did in the century since 903. It is time that we are no longer forced to live in secrecy, but be rewarded for our faithful work. Do this, Matriarch, and we shall serve you however you see fit, with no more reason to hide in the shadows."\n\nBefore Rain Shine could respond, Autumn nervously cleared her throat. "Y-Yes, well, we're all thankful for your work. I know I'd want recognition too if I had to do what you guys did. But Matriarch... we can't be too hasty here." When Rain Shine raised an eyebrow, Autumn sucked in a deep breath. "The Banner of the Covered Cage... well, from what Ember Wane has told us, they check out with stories we've heard from peasants and farming villages about organized groups of bandits that would sack towns that tried to reorganize their own societies during The Silence. I don't think Ember is going to try to deny that his group was involved in that. So we have to be careful here; do we really give official recognition to the Covered Cage given how the public would feel about that? Or do we just... keep this under the rug, for the time being?""
kirin_crisis.21.a:0 "The Banner of the Covered Cage will be recognized for their hard work."
kirin_crisis.21.b:0 "It is too soon to officially acknowledge the Banner's existence."

kirin_crisis.22.t:0 "The Last Sunrise of Sunrise"
kirin_crisis.22.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine retreated to her study after her lunch, a worrying thought pricking at the back of her mind. Ever since Ember Wane had come to her seeking recognition for the Banner of the Covered Cage, her thoughts were troubled by what her Premier had said and what that meant for her realm. Had this paramilitary group really been operating without limits and without check for this long? It bothered her that she knew so little about them. They were apparently organized by her mother, and had been operating under her command for decades. Now they claimed to be loyal to her as Kiria's ruling Matriarch. They could be useful, there was no doubt, but Autumn Blaze had made it clear that working with them was a double-edged sword, and would come with its own host of problems.\n\nChief among them was a record she found in a tattered scroll that reported on their progress to her mother. Though it was short and laced with jargon, Rain Shine was able to suss out the real story inside of the banner's report. It detailed an "intervention" in the town of Sunrise, and how "quick and decisive action" by the banner had "dismantled the heretical society" inside of Sunrise. It sounded so clean on paper, but when Rain Shine brought up other reports and letters that had been sent around the time of the banner's actions, it painted a far bloodier story.\n\nSunrise had once been home to a millenarian sect of The Way of Fire, who believed that the Vermilion Dynasty had failed Kiria, and that Concord could never be so cruel as to punish the entire Realm with something as harsh as The Silence. Instead, they believed that the Vermilion Dynasty had acted out of corruption and greed, and had smothered Kiria with The Silence in its lust for absolute power. But at the turn of the millennium, Concord would bestow a new avatar on Kiria to overthrow the Vermilion Dynasty and return Kiria to greatness, and so the town and its inhabitants refused to follow the decrees of The Silence and prepared for the new avatar's arrival. By all accounts of the time (what few there were), the city of Sunrise was peaceful and prosperous, open to sharing its wealth with its neighbors, and had modernised in its own way—at least until the Banner of the Covered Cage descended on the town. The inhabitants were slaughtered to the last for charges of heresy and defiance of The Silence, and the entire town put to the torch. All this the Banner had done in the name of the Matriarch and Concord, and though the story had become something of a folk tale in kirin society, the reemergence of the Covered Cage would surely reignite those stories and fill the peasants and farmers of Kiria with outrage.\n\nIt left Rain Shine at a terrible impasse. She didn't know what she should do about the story of Sunrise and the Banner of the Covered Cage. Should she come clean to her subjects, apologize for the decades-old massacre, and condemn the actions of the Covered Cage? Or should she suppress the incident as best as she could, in the hope of maintaining peace and calm?"
kirin_crisis.22.a:0 "The Realm must come clean about its past if it wants to move forward."
kirin_crisis.22.b:0 "The knowledge of what happened in Sunrise would do more harm than good."

kirin_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]On the steps of the Vermilion Palace with the Matriarch Superior of Kiria by her side, Premier Autumn Blaze proudly proclaimed to the world that the Realm of Kiria had concluded its ambitious Grand Gallop Onward and was ready to rejoin the international community. Many thought that cramming a century's worth of technological and societal advancements into three and a half years of modernisation would be an impossible feat, but the kirin have managed to achieve it nevertheless. With a new major power entering the stage in Eastern Zebrica, many neighbors of the kirin are now left to wonder just what a resurgent Kiria means for them, and how they will tip the global balance of power."

kirin_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Fickle Current, chairkirin of the NAKP, addressed the Realm of Kiria by radio today to propose the idea of a Northern Compact to listeners across the realm. Identifying that the cities of Fragrance, Rhapsody, Radiance, and all the towns in between are in a different watershed from the Great Mellifluve, which serves as the unifying cultural force of central Kiria, Chairkirin Current proposed that the kirin of the north band together to protect their traditions and autonomy from their brethren in Vermilion and the south. He then announced that in the interest of creating a promoting a strong and wealthy Northern Compact, the NAKP aims to hold a regional Plebiscite in the near future where all kirin of the north can vote on whether or not to join with Fragrance's Compact. Though this action has raised cries of protest and anger in Vermilion, it is unclear if Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has enough political influence to stop the vote."

kirin_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The controversial Plebiscite for the creation of the Northern Compact for Self-Determination, a massive political undertaking by the NAKP in Fragrance, drew to a close today as the final votes were tallied across the Greater Providence region. To the shock of Vermilion and the relief of Fragrance, an undeniable majority of kirin in the Greater Providence region voted to secede from the Realm of Kiria and join the Council of North Kiria in the formation of a Northern Compact. As the kirin of the north celebrate in the streets, the Plebiscite has dramatic consequences at home in Vermilion. With Greater Providence splitting from the Realm of Kiria, a large amount of Vermilion's industrial power has changed hooves, depriving it of resources it needs to combat the unrest in its westernmost regions. Time will tell if this will tip the balance in the struggle between The Way of Fire and The Rising Fire."

kirin_news.4.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The controversial Plebiscite for the creation of the Northern Compact for Self-Determination, a massive political underaking by the NAKP in Fragrance, drew to a close today as the final votes were tallied across the Greater Providence region. To the shock of Fragrance and the relief of Vermilion, the NAKP failed to secure a substantial majority of the votes in favor of secession, making any such movements unlikely to happen.  Several months of anxiety have come to an end in Vermilion, who will manage to cling onto their northern industry and population centers, and the results of the Plebiscite mark a devastating blow for the Council of North Kiria. With the matter of the Plebiscite now settled, Vermilion is free to focus its attention on dealing with the unrest in its the Realm's west, and the repudiation of the NAKP's efforts may be the death knell of Fragrance's ambitions."

The NAKP was swift to champion the results of the contested vote, even though it was declared unlawful by Vermilion, and sent an ultimatum to Matriarch Superior Rain Shine to respect the will of the kirin of the north or suffer the consequences. Rather than risk an all-out war with Fragrance and a massive insurgency throughout the region of Greater Providence, Matriarch Rain Shine has agreed to the ultimatum and allowed Fragrance to annex its northern states without bloodshed. This is a great victory for the NAKP and a disastrous blow against Vermilion's authority, but this is likely not the end of the NAKP's ambitions."

When Vermilion issued no response to the ultimatum, Fickle Current declared from Fragrance that a state of war now exists between the Council of North Kiria and the Vermilion Realm. Fierce fighting has already broken out between pro-independence and pro-Vermilion militias throughout the region of Greater Providence, and troops from Fragrance have been mobilized to the border to liberate the north."

With Fragrance and the NAKP aggressively campaigning to convince the kirin of the north to secede from the Realm of Kiria, the Matriarch evidently felt that such a tour was necessary to to prevent the loss of these valuable industrialized lands. Though there is an undeniable sense of discontent throughout Greater Providence with the state of Vermilion's rule, and many of Rain Shine's closest advisors have warned her about the potential dangers of venturing into the north, the Matriarch is determined to see the tour through. This may be the last time the Matriarch is able to freely set hoof in the north if her gamble fails to rouse enough loyalist support to foil the NAKP's plans."

While Current has not officially be declared a traitor in Vermilion, it is undeniable that he is the de facto head of state of a breakaway nation that has repudiated Vermilion's authority, and there is some risk in setting hoof in lands still administered by the Realm of Kiria. However, the local authorities within Greater Providence have declared that they will not interfere with his tour, and Vermilion will not dare to cause a crisis by ordering his arrest during it. Only time will tell if Current's tour will be successful or merely a distraction."

kirin_news.9.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The last vestiges of the All-Kiria Collegium shuttered its doors today and abandoned its campus in Vermilion. Once a proud institution championed by the NAKP during the Grand Gallop Onward, authorities in the Realm's capital hounded its faculty and students over charges of subversive thought following the secession of Fragrance and the north at the NAKP's behest. Rather than let the foreign intellectuals scatter to the winds, however, the NAKP has promised the former faculty of the Collegium a brand new campus and funding to educate kirin in Fragrance, and many have readily accepted on the promise that the state will not interfere with their work and research. Vermilion, already beset by many different crises, now finds itself facing one of brain drain as well."

The announcement was seen as a surprise by many, given the great lengths that the NAKP went through to claim autonomy and independence for Fragrance and Realm's north following the failure of the Grand Gallop Onward. Current, however, has condemned the Fraternal Republic of the Rising Fire as a fundamentalist death cult that aims to destroy kirin civilization, history, and culture, and so has taken a stand alongside Vermilion to end this threat for good. But Current is a shrewd businesskirin, and one can only wonder what he will expect in return for Fragrance's assistance to Vermilion."

Closer scrutiny of the Peony Accord reveals that this defensive pact is primarily directed against the Fraternal Republic as a shared enemy, and is slated for annulment the moment western Kiria is pacified.

While this would seem to go against the narrative of independence for the north that the NAKP has championed for so long, Vermilion's influence in the Viceroyalty is limited, and, Fickle Current, now Viceroy of Providence, has only sworn an oath of allegiance to the Matriarch Superior to support the Realm however he sees fit. Greater Providence will retain a large degree of independence, though undoubtedly both sides will soon test the legal boundaries of the new Viceroyalty. Time will tell if it will be successful."

The measure, which was approved and applauded by political figures both in the Vermilion Realm and in the territories of Greater Providence controlled by Fragrance, formally recognizes Northern Kiria as a sovereign state under the sole jurisdiction of the NAKP, situated in Fragrance as its capital. While the Union continues to recognize the Matriarch Superior as its spiritual and religious head of state, there is no doubt after the NAKP's landslide victory in elections held throughout the north that the north is now its own nation state free from the influence of Vermilion."

It is hard to argue with his proclamation; though the former premier's government still simmers in resistance and a low-intensity guerilla conflict against the Rising Fire continues to burn in the west, the flags of Greater Providence flying throughout all of the Realm's major cities state the Chairkirin's claim as absolute fact.

Many assumed that the Matriarch would have gone into exile or hiding as the NAKP slowly wrested control of the country away from her supporters, but with the war concluded, she has returned to her throne in Vermilion. How or why is anycreature's guess, but the Matriarch reaffirmed her role as the avatar of Concord on this world and the guardian and protector of the Kirian people, as the Matriarchs Superior always have been, and stated that Fickle Current would serve as the Realm's new Imperial Premier. Finally at the conclusion of her speech, the Matriarch apologized to the people of Kiria for the failure of the Grand Gallop Onward as a consequence of her misguided judgments, but promised that with the NAKP's support, she would not make such mistakes in the future."

The Realm had not all that long ago secured the heartlands of the Fraternal Republic and sent its leadership scurrying westward into the mountains, where the haggard remnants of the Republic's army invaded and subdued the disorganized resistance of Taungpau in a desperate bid for land and time. While the Rising Fire now governs the kirin, llama, and alpaca natives under a military occupation, the Realm of Kiria appears disinterested in continuing their campaign into the mountains.

They concluded their statement with a message directly to Chairkirin Current, reminding him that it would be in the nation's best interests to be receptive to the VasCorps opinions, and expressed their wishes that any future business decisions such as this one be first presented to the corporations for their thoughts on the matter.

Reported inside was a skeleton of a tall, slender equinoid, lacking the scales of a kirin and protruding from its forehead a long, curved, and wickedly sharp horn. The possibility of fakery notwithstanding, this is the first time the remains of an eastern unicorn have been found. In mythology predating the Way of Fire, the kirin race was created as the progeny of interbreeding between the eastern unicorns—reputed to have prodigious magical ability, flowing manes, lithe figures, and elegant horns—and dragons.

kirin_council.1.d:0 "Today, Fickle Current felt like the most powerful kirin in the world. As he stood behind the podium placed before Fragrance's city hall, he let his eyes wander over the hundreds, if not thousands of kirin that had gathered to hear him speak. They ran the gamut from NAKP higher-ups to its supporters and soldiers to just the commoners of Fragrance, a city wronged by Vermilion, a city that had finally found its moment for vengeance. As he stood there, Current could only imagine that this was what it felt like to command the kind of power and devotion that Matriarch Rain Shine owned in the imperial city. But unlike her, he would not let it go to waste.\n\n"Kirin of Fragrance," he began, microphones booming his voice throughout the plaza and down several city blocks. "Yesterday, our great city stood at a crossroads. Vermilion was failing, its modernization efforts collapsing into wreck and ruin. They were unable to do what they needed to do in crushing the lawless heretics to the west, and in their undoing, they sought to drag us down with them. But Fragrance shall bow to Vermilion no more. We are the bastion of modernization and industrialization; we are the shining beacon that brought hope to our Matriarch's realm when all else had failed it. And now, as her realm reaches the our of darkness, the kirin of Fragrance and the north, under the trusted guidance of the NAKP, shall mobilize our incredible resources and belief in our own righteousness to save it. We shall save Kiria from the death throes of the Silence! We shall save Kiria from the superstition that has plagued it for too long! And we shall save our Matriarch from the forces of communalism and the poisoned lies of the Way of Fire's self-serving mystics! For with Fragrance leading the way, Kiria will finally know peace and prosperity the likes of which it has never known before!\n\n"So stand with me, kirin of the north. Stand with the NAKP, and let us all save Kiria!""

kirin_council.2.d:0 "Fickle Current and Cypress Snow sat on the balcony of a restaurant overlooking the Chrysanthemum Plaza in front of Fragrance's city hall. As the sun set on the city, scores of kirin bustled too and fro, setting up polling stations, lines, and ballot boxes. It was much the same throughout the rest of Fragrance, and the north as a whole. For tomorrow, the most important vote Fragrance had ever held would take place: the decision of whether to commit the formerly unthinkable and take up arms against Vermilion.\n\n"We stand on the precipice," Cypress mused, setting his chopsticks down. "A decision that could either bring ruin to the Realm or heal it. And the worst part is, we do not know which choice leads to which outcome."\n\n"If we could see the future, then we wouldn't need a vote," Current agreed. "Both options are valid. Half of the NAKP wants to focus on industrialization while the Matriarch fights the Rising Fire in the west. I can see where they're coming from; if we industrialize while the imperial realm burns, then we can come to the negotiating table with the Matriarch after the war as equals, not lessers. After all, they will be desperate and hungry; we won't be."\n\n"And yet there are those who seek the more direct path. They want war." Cypress sighed and rubbed his nose scales. "I've seen war and death in my time in Griffonia. You saw it too, when Kemerskai and his supporters marched into Griffenheim in 978. The Matriarch is the heart and soul of Kiria; we may not agree with her, but she is the one thing that holds our species together, even despite the civil war. The more militant heads in the NAKP wish to march south and free her from the clutches of Autumn Blaze's harmonists and Winter Frost's mystics. But should our armies conquer Vermilion, what happens to the Matriarch then? Does she end up like Grover V, driven into exile only to return and crush us, delegitimizing our fight and our cause? Will she stay in Vermilion and support us? Or do we succeed where Kemerskai failed and commit the unthinkable?"\n\n"I wish I could know," Current said, shaking his head. "But that is something for us to worry about tomorrow. The people of Fragrance will decide for us. Let it never be said that we are undemocratic. Tonight, let us enjoy one last night of calm before the storm.""

kirin_council.3.t:0 "The Moment of Truth"
kirin_council.3.d:0 "The polling places were filled the moment the sun rose that morning. Countless kirin from all walks of life flocked to the polling centers, each and every one eager to let their voice play a part in shaping Fragrance's future. Throughout the city, and throughout the north as a whole, an entire cross-section of the NAKP's ranks could be assembled just by looking at the kirin gathered there. The old members of the bourgeoisie crossed paths with their militant and youthful compatriots, who in turn mingled with urban intellectuals and wealthy investors. Kirin who clearly served in the NAKP's paramilitary arm smiled for pictures with the foals of middle class families, while capitalist magnates freely campaigned for the votes of the kirin present with free food and fanfare. To Fickle Current, who watched from afar throughout the day, it looked like a carnival, although this carnival threatened bloody business at the end of the day. How many kirin would still be smiling and cheering when their husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters took up arms and went off to fight should the vote demand war?\n\nIt took until sundown for the voting to finally taper off. By that point, Current had retired to get some sleep. As the counting went on throughout the night, he knew for a fact that tomorrow would be a busy day. But he didn't even get that much; at three o'clock in the morning, his phone rang, and when he answered it, an NAKP lieutenant informed him that the counting had finished.\n\nFragrance's new chapter had begun."

In the time between receiving the phone call in the middle of the night and now, he had gotten precious little time to prepare a speech, much less rest. There was too much that needed to be done, missives to be drafted, orders to be sent out. The prospect of war on the horizon left little room for error in Fragrance.\n\nBut of course, as leader of the NAKP, he had to address the kirin of Fragrance and the north about this historic day. So, speaking from within Fragrance's city hall, his voice broadcast on radio so kirin all throughout the Realm could hear it, Current finally let the world know just what had transpired in the north. "My brothers and sisters in Fragrance, my compatriots in the north, and all kirin who struggle under the superstitions of the wicked in our Realm," he began, all the while arranging his speech on the table in front of him so he wouldn't have to turn any pages. "Today is a historic day for our Realm. For today, we have embarked on a long and difficult journey to save the Realm. Matriarch Superior Rain Shine is beset on all sides by villains and scoundrels, hypocrites and hedonists. While The Rising Fire and The Way of Fire bicker and fight in the far western reaches of the Realm, our Matriarch remains in Vermilion, a prisoner to the priests and mystics our religion has surrounded her with. They control her every move, her every action, her every word. She is their captive, their puppet, who dances on the strings of failed ideals and backwards religious dogma. Kiria cannot be saved so long as she remains in the clutches of those who hold Vermilion on this day.\n\n"But she will not be held there forever," Current continued, firming his voice with passion and patriotism. "Fragrance is militarizing, and with the help of the returning diaspora, our brothers and sisters abroad, we shall march south to save the Matriarch. With righteous patriotic fervor, we shall cut our way through the degenerates and incompetents who this very moment keep the Matriarch locked in her palace in Vermilion. We shall offer them no quarter, no negotiations. We shall only offer them this one chance: turn aside from the mystics and Equestrian sympathizers who keep the Realm in their clutches. Turn aside from the dangerous heretics and revolutionaries that want to burn our Realm to the ground. Only Fragrance and the NAKP can save Kiria. Lend us your voices, lend us your support, lend us your arms. And together, we shall save Kiria, and we shall save the Matriarch. Concord bless us all!""

Our Realm was fashioned under the guidance of our great Matriarch Superior to put an end to our primal rages. But now, heretics under the leadership of the traitor known as Rising Sun have taken up arms against our Matriarch and seek to topple our way of life. That cannot stand.\n\n"I would be lying if I said that Fragrance and Vermilion have never felt ill will toward each other," he continued, frowning at the microphone in front of him. "But never have we dreamt of taking up arms against our Matriarch. We are loyal subjects of Matriarch Rain Shine, and as such, we owe her our support and respect. That is why I am calling on my brothers and sisters in the north to prepare to fight for our Realm. The north shall embark on a campaign of industrialization that will make the Grand Gallop Onward look like but a small step. We shall mobilize into an army of the people and march south to join our fellow countrykirin in stomping out this heretic menace. Our Realm cannot profit from a civil war; it will only render us weak and crippled, right at the hour when we need to be our strongest. So we shall endeavor to end it, and when the dust is settled and the Rising Fire is destroyed, then, Fragrance, can we approach Vermilion as equals, and ask with civility that old wrongs be righted. But for now, we prepare to fight for our Matriarch. We shall get through this dark night, and with Concord's blessing, we shall see brighter days once more!""

"The Banner of the Covered Cage then slaughtered the inhabitants of the town down to the last, justifying their actions as mandated by the decrees of the Silence, and in line with the wishes of Concord and Matriarch Noctilucent Charm," the intelligence officer concluded, sitting back down in his chair. "It's been covered up ever since, at least to the best of Vermilion's ability. Of course, we quickly figured out the truth once The Silence ended and we could establish a functioning intelligence network in Fragrance, and now Rising Sun has made the rest of the country aware of it too. The question now is: what do we do about it?"\n\n"The anger of the common masses is a potent tool," Cypress Snow said, scratching at his beard. "Used right, it could be a great boon to our cause. But it could also backfire dramatically. I doubt many of the farmers in the north see us as any better than the kirin who massacred Sunrise decades ago. Perhaps there is merit in issuing no statement about this whole affair, and letting the anger of the commoners dissipate with time. After all, we'd just be playing into Rising Sun's hooves to rile us all up."\n\nHe turned to Current, who still sat deep in thought. "Well, Current? You're the chairkirin of the NAKP.

kirin_council.7.d:0 ""Our coffers are hardly what you would call 'full', but as you can see, neither are they particularly empty."\n\nFickle Current and Cypress Snow whistled in awe as Dr. Ardent Bloom gestured through the open vault door beneath the NAKP's central headquarters in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza. Behind that two meter-thick vault door were countless ingots and bars of gold, neatly stacked on reinforced shelves and lining the walls of the massive vault. The vault itself was close to full, but it was just one of many doors filling the basement of the party's headquarters, and as Dr. Bloom had described it, it was the only one that was often used. "All of our financial, commercial, and industrial interests around the globe, from all across Griffonia, Zebrica, and even Equus, direct a portion of their profits back here to fund the growth and operations of the NAKP," the economist explained. "We're the best for their business, after all. That is further supplemented by our wealthy donors who frequently grant us lavish gifts to nudge the needle of progress in the direction they feel is favorable. The party maintains complete control over the entirety of the industry in the north of our fair realm; that means that our coffers and our business dealings with the companies aligned with us are the de-facto economy of the Emergency Council. And when you hold complete control over the economy, you hold complete control over the state."\n\nFickle Current scratched his chin. "Impressive," he concluded. "The North is like a massive corporation, then, and its employees are its citizens. This would make it the most powerful corporation in the world."\n\n"And with that power comes great opportunity," Cypress added. He pointed to the gold stacked high in the vault. "Grease the right hooves with some money, write up a few tax liens for our largest partnering companies, grant a few gifts to a few kirin in the right places, and we could gain a material advantage in the ruins of the Grand Gallop Onward. This could greatly further the interests of the NAKP."\n\n"Money exists to be invested," Current agreed. "And it takes a shrewd businesskirin to make the best investments." He nodded at Dr. Bloom. "Thank you for the tour, doctor. This has proven most enlightening.""
kirin_council.7.a:0 ""You want it? It's yours, my friend, so long as you have enough gold.""

kirin_council.8.t:0 "Winning Over Friends"
kirin_council.8.d:0 "Fickle Current looked around at the team of pollsters, party loyalists, and local governors and mayors that he had assembled in Fragrance to help chart the path forward. They had all traveled to the city to assemble an important effort that could make or break Fragrance's fortunes: the Northern Compact for Self-Determination, and the canvassing and polling operation that would attempt to turn it into a reality. If it failed, Fragrance's dreams of total independence from Vermilion might never be realized.\n\n"Our preliminary survey and polling suggests that Rhapsody and Radiance might be receptive to the idea of unifying with Fragrance, but at the moment, they're held in place by inertia and devotion to Vermilion," the team's top pollster, Simple Survey, explained. "They're afraid to separate themselves from Vermilion and the Matriarch, even despite the instability throughout the Realm. But, with enough effort and enough funding, we may be able to change minds and garner popular support for a plebiscite on whether or not to join the Northern Compact. As it stands, we're too weak to survive against aggression from Vermilion, but if we can win over some more friends and all the land and factories that come with them, we might just have a chance."\n\n"Then it needs to be done," Fickle Current agreed. "If we can get more of the north to fall in line behind us without firing a shot, then that's one more bullet we can save for Vermilion when the time comes. It helps us that the north is used to its autonomy compared to the rest of the Realm, even from the days dating back before The Silence. The Great Mellifluve ties the center of the Realm together and homogenizes its culture, but Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Radiance are not part of its watershed. The culture and identity of the north is uniquely our own. We can push that message to help encourage the formation of the Compact, and finally secure that clean break from Vermilion that the north has been looking for for so long."\n\nWithin minutes, everykirin present voted unanimously to proceed forward with the daunting canvassing operation. The Northern Compact would be made a reality."

kirin_council.9.t:0 "Harmonizing with Rhapsody's Rhapsody"
kirin_council.9.d:0 "Sifting through one saved letter after another, Fickle Current again reviewed the correspondence between the NAKP and Rhapsody that had been assembled for his review. The matter was an important one, and it regularly kept him up late these past few days as he attempted to slowly convince the leadership of Rhapsody that its interests and the NAKP's interests were one in the same.\n\nThe short version of the matter was that Fragrance needed Rhapsody's cooperation to survive. Rhapsody was, to Fragrance's chagrin, Kiria's most prosperous city, and the addition of its population and industrial base to Fragrance's own would nearly double the might of the nascent Northern Compact. That was why it was so important that the plebiscite succeed in the city, but to guarantee its success, the NAKP would have to navigate around Rhapsody's political establishment. Despite how much the city had claimed to support The Way of Fire in its past and throughout The Silence, the kirin of Rhapsody had been fairly lax with their enforcement of the doctrines and edicts of The Silence, disagreeing with former Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's interpretation of Concord's will. This was largely due to its ruling system of religious courts and prosecutors, collectively known as its Procurate, which managed to appease Vermilion with its rulings and subsequently avoid enacting the harshest measures of The Silence. That same Procurate had only grown in strength since 903, and if the NAKP ever wanted to bring Rhapsody into its fold, it had to find some way to appease the Procurate.\n\nBut Fickle Current frowned as he read through the correspondence again. Was the Procurate really necessary? Rhapsody's citizenry was enlightened and very independent, and while they respected the Procurate, they frequently challenged it in court, unafraid to settle disputes over law and legal matters using its own courts against them. It left Current with an interesting dilemma, and two angles of attack that could possibly bring Rhapsody into the fold: did the NAKP attempt to appease the establishment and win over the Procurate's support, or appeal to the citizens of Rhapsody and put pressure on the Procurate to accept Fragrance's offer of unity from the bottom up?"
kirin_council.9.a:0 "Appealing to Rhapsody's Procurate is the most direct approach."

kirin_council.10.t:0 "A Gateway to the Gateway"
kirin_council.10.d:0 "Simple Survey scratched his chin as he reviewed the information the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis had gathered for the NAKP. The subject at hoof was the matter of pressuring Radiance and the Viridian Coast into joining the Northern Compact through the plebiscite. The scenario was an interesting one, as the two locales were quite different from each other. While the Viridian Coast featured a growing petit bourgeoisie fueled by the mingling of diaspora returnees, influential kirin from Rhapsody, and the local northerners that lived on its farms and fished off its coasts, Radiance was a hotspot for the returning diaspora, and the city that once served as the international Gateway to Vermilion was home to a rapidly growing middle class of traders, merchants, craftskirin, and other professionals. Given the NAKP's resources, it made sense to try and tailor its campaigning and canvassing efforts to either one group or the other. Simple Survey just had to decide which one to recommend to Chairkirin Current.\n\nSnatching a pad of paper and a pencil, Survey started to sketch out a potential strategy for each locale. If the NAKP supported canvassing efforts targeted to the kirin of the Viridian Coast, they could champion the diverse background of the proud northerners that had turned the backwater into an important hub of wealth and productivity in the north, and have an easier time in garnering their support for the Northern Compact. Conversely, if the NAKP focused on Radiance, they could appeal directly to the moneyed, intelligent, and sensible diaspora settling throughout the city, and build a strong connection with the kirin living there based on their Equestrian and Griffonian sensibilities from their time spent abroad. Those kirin were the bread and butter of the NAKP: highly educated and wealthy kirin resistant to the superstitions of the peasants throughout the Realm. It only made sense to continue to appeal to the base, after all, but winning over Radiance at the expense of the common kirin of the north could lead to problems down the line.\n\nBut in the end, Simple Survey could only recommend one approach to the chairkirin. And that approach was..."

kirin_council.11.t:0 "Investing Capital"
kirin_council.11.d:0 "Budgeting meetings were hardly glorious when Kiria existed in a state of chaos and fire, but they had to be done nevertheless. Fickle Current, who presided over the meeting as the NAKP's Chairkirin, reflected to himself how similar running a company and running a business were. Even when the nation was on fire and teetering on the brink of collapse, meetings and strategies still needed to be organized, just like in a company on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nBut thankfully, the Northern Compact was on the ascendancy, not the decline, and these budgeting meetings had their focus on investing in the future rather than staving off immediate danger. Here in the meeting with him were three kirin: Simple Survey, the chief strategist from the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis; Cherry Blossom, Fragrance's mayor and the mare who had taken it upon herself to represent the interests of the other states in the north to the NAKP; and Dr. Ardent Bloom, the NAKP's chief economist who had one of the most influential voices in deciding how the party should spend its money. Each of the kirin was there to pitch their ideas for investing the NAKP's treasury, and Fickle Current heard them all in turn.\n\n"A factory-dockyard complex in the Comely Cape will provide the Compact with long-term industrial output and economic growth," the strategist said. "If we're to survive tomorrow's challenges, we need to be adequately prepared."\n\n"Infrastructure projects in the Comely Cape and Fragrance itself will be much more valuable, not only to our industry, but also to our citizens," Cherry Blossom countered. "Facilitating the ease of movement of goods and kirin from place to place is an investment we cannot look over."\n\n"Why not take some of our development capital and invest it in the Griffonian and Equestrian markets?" Dr. Bloom asked. "There's plenty of gains to be made from investing in them, given the world situation. We just need to make sure we're investing in the victors of today's wars and not the losers."\n\nThey were all valid points, and Current knew none of the other kirin present would side with another's proposal over their own. He would have to make the final decision."
kirin_council.11.a:0 "Simple Survey is right; we need to invest in our industry."

kirin_council.12.d:0 "Mayor Cherry Blossom blew a breath of air out of the corner of her muzzle as she waited for Fickle Current's secretary to admit her to his office. It annoyed her deep down inside that this foreigner had taken such complete control of her city, even if she was still the mayor. She had been elected in the waning years of The Silence and had served Fragrance faithfully since then, but Fickle Current and his moneyed buddies quickly bought out any and all political power and influence in and around the city, leaving her playing second (or third, or fourth) fiddle to the returning diaspora. But he was making good on his promise to return Fragrance to its glory days, at the least; so long as he did that, she could tolerate the NAKP's stranglehold over her city for as long as she needed to.\n\nThe secretary finally announced Current was ready to see her, and Cherry Blossom opened the door to his office and stepped inside. The foreign-born kirin looked up from his desk at her, pushed some papers to the side, and held his forehooves together. "Mayor Blossom. To what do I owe the visit?"\n\n"I'm here to give you some advice on your Plebiscite," she said, pulling over a seat and sitting down across the desk from him. "I know you and the NAKP have been campaigning very hard throughout the north to turn your dream of the Northern Compact into a reality, and I very much hope you succeed. But I fear that you're ignoring the kirin that support you here at home while you focus all your efforts abroad."\n\nFickle Current cocked his head at that. "And what do you mean by that? That the NAKP should invest in canvassing efforts in our home territory? The pollsters already show that they support the Northern Compact whole-heartedly, or at least well enough that we don't have to worry about losing their support."\n\n"You might lose OUR support by ignoring this city and the surrounding countryside," Cherry Blossom retorted. "The kirin of Fragrance and throughout the Council of North Kiria could use some reminder of the NAKP's dedication to them. Campaigning funds could instead be spent on improving the quality of life of everykirin living in our little corner of the north, improving the health of the Council in the long term. Why waste money politicking when it could be used to help kirin instead?""

kirin_council.13.d:0 "Though Fickle Current had arrived in Rhapsody on business, he indulged his inner tourist for a moment after stepping off of the train to take in the mountainous city's beautiful architecture. Colorful buildings and pagodas had been nestled among the mountain's slopes on terraced blocks, with carefully maintained cobblestone roads winding this way and that as the procession of NAKP kirin ascended from the train station to the massive temple sitting on the crown of the city. Perched high atop a massive terrace overlooking the rest of the city, the holiest of the Way of Fire temples in Kiria, and the home of Rhapsody's Procurate, looked every bit like a castle or palace watching over its citizens. That was fitting, Current felt; despite their religious pretense, Rhapsody's Procurate was a council dominated by priests just as politically and judicially shrewd as they were religiously devout.\n\nHis delegation was welcomed to the temple by young acolytes, and soon they found themselves standing in the middle of the chamber, where the priests and mystics of the Procurate sat in tall, high-backed chairs ringing the floor. They were all wizened kirin, and one old mare seated in the center looked old enough to have seen the beginning of The Silence with her own eyes. It was to this mare, Heavenly Fire, that the NAKP presented their gift of a priceless porcelain vase made to commemorate the first Matriarch Superior's ascension in the sixth century, and to whom Current laid out the NAKP's offer to admit Rhapsody into the Northern Compact.\n\nAfter several minutes to talk and deliberate with her peers, Heavenly Fire fixed Current with coal-black eyes set in her wrinkled face. "Rhapsody holds no love for Vermilion after the debacle of the Grand Gallop Onward," she said, her voice wavering with age and effort. "The young Matriarch misunderstands Concord's will, like her mother before her. We believe that Fragrance offers a better path forward, and the Procurate is willing to join with the NAKP on one condition: that the criminals and thugs that call themselves the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum never be allowed to step hoof in this city."\n\nIt was an odd request, but not an unexpected one. "The Order provides important services for our top members and most charitable donors," Current countered. "Sure, they may act in manners that the Procurate might deem unscrupulous, but those services are nevertheless invaluable."\n\n"They are thugs and miscreants who operate outside of Concord's holy law," Heavenly Fire retorted, but Current could see he had piqued the interest of some of her peers. "I will not have them in this city.""

kirin_council.14.d:0 "If there was one thing that helped smooth over the exhausting and often frustrating work of drafting directives for the NAKP, it was doing that work over a meal with a friend. Fickle Current found himself doing just that with Ardent Bloom, the two kirin enjoying an afternoon ginseng oolong tea with a side of spring rolls and steamed dumplings as they pored over the Provisional Industrial Central Planning scheme that Current planned to introduce to the NAKP's next legislative session. But there was a sticking point, one that had driven the two kirin back and forth for the better part of an hour as they tried to reach an acceptable compromise.\n\n"No, there is no way you can spin it that will make the trading houses happy," Ardent said with a resolute shake of his head. "Anything related to nationalization will only incense them. It violates the free market principles the NAKP is founded on. Don't forget that the trading houses and corporations have creaturehood status in the Council, and they have voices in its decision-making as well."\n\n"As much as I support the rights of the corporations, they have to be willing to give back when asked. They can't take and take and take, and never expect to have to give every once in a while," Current said with a heavy sigh. "Our position is tenuous, and this is a matter of national wellbeing. The corporations need to direct their resources toward efforts that will forward our national security above all else if they even want to have a Kiria to invest in when all is said and done."\n\n"Then if you want to get them onboard, you need to compromise," Ardent suggested. "Assure the corporations that any such nationalization measures are merely temporary, and allow them to exempt a portion of their assets if they are willing to purchase that exemption with a donation to the party. It's better than trying to chain them to the Council against their will and refuse to listen to their complaints. Don't forget that you need to respect their business interests; I wouldn't expect to stay on very long as Chairkirin of the NAKP if you incur their wrath.""

kirin_council.15.d:0 "Fern Flare rarely got the opportunity to decide policy directly with Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, but unfortunately, the current situation demanded it. She found herself in Rain Shine's palace in Autumn's stead, and between Rain Shine's frazzled and decidedly less-than-divine appearance, and Winter Frost's frustrated, borderline furious expression, she felt like a fish out of water. But Autumn needed some time to rest and recover; the stress from trying and failing to hold Kiria together throughout the Grand Gallop Onward had taken a considerable toll on her, and crippling migraines left her barely able to stand up straight for more than an hour at a time. She only hoped her friend would get better in time; Premier material, Fern Flare knew she was not.\n\nBut the world stopped turning for nokirin, and there were still countless crises that needed to be resolved, with or without Autumn. The current one involved the plebiscite in Greater Providence orchestrated by that traitor, Fickle Current, and his cronies. It was an issue that had filled Winter Frost with a tempestuous rage, and today's meeting was no different. "That godless creature is trying to lure the faithful away from us," Winter spat. "This plebiscite of his is just an attempt to illegally and unlawfully steal our land and people from us. They try to weaken us further when we are already so fractured and weak. It can't be allowed to proceed."\n\n"But it's democratic, isn't it?" Fern Flare countered. "The kirin of the north are still going to vote, and even if the kirin of Greater Providence don't share all our traditions and beliefs, I doubt we'll see them vote en masse to separate from Vermilion. Still, the NAKP wants to do this without bloodshed, and that gives us negotiating power to make it hard for the Plebiscite to succeed."\n\n"How so?" Rain Shine asked. "I don't want any of Concord's subjects to die over this matter. If it can be done peacefully, then we should do it."\n\n"We've had some contact with the NAKP over this issue," Fern Flare explained. "If we offer to accept a treaty with them making the Plebiscite legally binding, then we can pressure them to set the bar for secession at 75% of the vote in every state in Greater Providence. Once that's done, we can begin our own campaign to make sure they don't get the votes to reach that threshold."\n\n"We do not negotiate with traitors," Winter said, frowning at Fern. Then she turned to Rain Shine. "Declare it illegal, and put an end to their subterfuge right here and now. Proclaim that we will never accept its results. It's the only way to keep the realm together.""

After tentatively reaching out to Vermilion, the diplomatic arm of the NAKP had managed to secure the Matriarch's guarantee that Vermilion would recognize the legality of the Plebiscite and, if the NAKP could garner the votes, would allow the north to secede into the cultural union of Greater Providence. Current was less pleased about the threshold they had to meet: Vermilion would not recognize the Plebiscite as successful unless each and every state in Greater Providence voted to secede with 75% of the votes. It would be a tall task to reach that benchmark, but it was a goal they would strive for regardless.\n\nCypress Snow shared many of the same thoughts when Current informed him of Vermilion's decision. "They may think they've stolen a base on us, but the game's not over yet," he said as the two lounged in Current's office. "But it's nothing money can't fix, and money is something we know how to scrape together like nokirin's business. I think it's doable; we just have to put our backs into it, is all."\n\n"My thoughts exactly," Current said, and his magic pulled out a bottle of vintage rice wine he'd ordered to celebrate. Pouring two glasses, he passed one to Cypress, who took it in his own magic. "But we might as well celebrate our successes before we get back to work, no matter how small, right?""

kirin_council.17.d:0 "Fickle Current had been hoping for better news from the NAKP's diplomatic arm, but the report he received on the negotiations in Vermilion was disappointing. Though the NAKP had tried to dispatch kirin to Vermilion to pressure the Matriarch into recognizing the Plebiscite as a legally-binding vote, Rain Shine had issued a response condemning the Plebiscite and refusing to acknowledge the results of any vote to secede from the Realm. That put the NAKP in a bind; how could they claim to be offering the kirin of Greater Providence a chance to join Fragrance in their own nation without shedding blood if Vermilion refused to recognize the vote?\n\nWhen he shared his concerns with Cypress Snow, the elder kirin and his former mentor merely shook his head. "Vermilion may not recognize the vote on paper, but they will have to recognize the will of their people should we make it clear to them," he said. "If there is an overwhelmingly large margin of votes to join Fragrance, Vermilion will have no choice but to respect the vote or else risk having a revolt on their hooves."\n\nCurrent raised an eyebrow. "Overwhelmingly? What vote do you imagine by that?"\n\n"Nothing short of 80% I feel," Cypress answered. "That much popular support would trigger the secession of those states, regardless of what Vermilion or their local leaders feel. But the level of support has to be the same, or higher, everywhere; no state is likely to be bold enough to make the first move if they're uncertain the rest of the north will follow them to Fragrance."\n\n"And if we don't hit that mark?" Fickle Current asked. "If we're short of it by about 10 or 15%, say 65%, then the referendum is disputed. Both sides will feel vindicated by the outcome. It might come to blows anyway."\n\n"Which Vermilion doesn't realize," Cypress said, disgustedly shaking his head. "They've created a powder keg in the north, and nokirin can back down. We tried to give them the easy way out, but they refused. Well, you know what they say; you reap what you sow.""

Hour by hour, overwhelming votes in favor of secession tallied up throughout the north, slowly assuaging the fears of the NAKP staff that had gathered around the radios to listen to the results being broadcast through Fragrance. It took three days for the last of the votes to come out of the tiniest villages throughout the north, and in some places the final vote rested on a knife's edge in favor of secession, but it was soon official. Four out of every five kirin in Greater Providence voted to turn their backs on Vermilion and join Fragrance, and perhaps to the surprise of many, Vermilion relented without a fight. All the Matriarch asked for was thirty days to finalize the cessation of government activities in Greater Providence and to withdraw local authorities, and then the north would be squarely under Fragrance's jurisdiction.\n\nWhen the news broke the following morning, jubilant kirin took to the streets in celebration, hanging banners, flying flags, and singing songs. Finally separated from the misguided and selfish kirin in Vermilion that had ruined their city a century ago, the kirin of Fragrance were finally free, and finally able to share that freedom with the rest of Greater Providence. All throughout the north, kirin organized impromptu parades and celebrated the final outcome, while the NAKP declared a week of celebration and marked the day as the day of Greater Providence's official independence from Vermilion. For Fickle Current, it was the culmination of a hard-fought struggle, but only the latest high point in his short time as Chairkirin of the NAKP.

Local authorities pledged their allegiance to Fragrance, and those that didn't were chased out of town by the local populations determined to split with Vermilion. Even Rhapsody's Chief Magistrate of the Procurate, Priestess Heavenly Fire, made a brief statement on the radio announcing that the kirin of Rhapsody have spoken, and the city would lead the rest of Greater Providence in joining with Fragrance in the interests of protecting their unique cultural identity, an identity not shared by the kirin along the many branches and tributaries of the Great Mellifluve.

Sure, it looked like they were likely to score majorities for secession in several states throughout Greater Providence, but not by the margins they had hoped. It seemed that the kirin of the north were hesitant to break with Vermilion, and when all the votes were finished, it became clear that the dreams of the Northern Compact were dead on arrival. Without an overwhelming majority, no states would break with Vermilion and join with Fragrance in its march to the future.\n\nWhile Vermilion crowed in victory, angry hooves were pointed in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza as the NAKP tried to come to terms with the defeat and find somekirin to blame. Unfortunately for Fickle Current, his position as Chairkirin of the NAKP meant most hooves pointed at him. By the time he angrily stormed out of the NAKP's war room, he was infuriated and embittered, and beginning to feel vulnerable. All the speeches, all the crowds, his visits to Rhapsody and Radiance... how could they have been so impressive in person and come to so little at the polls?\n\nIt would likely take time to find the answer, but that was hardly a comforting thought.

Despite Matriarch Superior Rain Shine declaring the Plebiscite illegal and unlawful, the NAKP had organized the vote anyway, and they had claimed victory in the polls, though it was naturally far more complicated than that. Though enough kirin had voted in favor of secession to claim a supermajority of votes, at least a quarter of the votes cast throughout the north were in opposition to the idea of a Northern Compact, and instead longed to stay connected with Vermilion. And the rights of those kirin, no matter that they were in the majority, needed to be protected.\n\nBut could Vermilion afford to protect them? That was something Fern Flare and Rain Shine struggled to answer as they tried to formulate a response to the ultimatum. The conflict with the Rising Fire in the west left Vermilion stretched thin enough as it was. Could they afford to divert resources and banners to the north if they refused Current's ultimatum and the NAKP pressed forward with war? And what of the kirin who voted for secession? Even if the NAKP lost and Fragrance was humbled, would they see the banners marching through their cities as Vermilion's authority reasserted in the north, or as the conquering armies of a foreign nation? How could they afford to keep the north integrated into the realm if it was conquered, not restored?\n\n"What do we do?" Rain Shine asked Fern Flare, pain in her voice. The prospect of fighting more of her subjects hurt her more deeply than any wound ever could. But Kiria could ill-afford to lose Rhapsody and Radiance, two of its most important cities and industrial centers. It would cripple them in a way from which they might never recover.\n\nIn that moment, Fern Flare wished that Autumn Blaze was here, so that she did not have to make the decision that could lead to more suffering in Kiria in the Premier's stead."

The kirin, a mare by the name of Springtime Sonnet, was unlike the majority of the diaspora that had returned to Fragrance over the years. While most of the kirin who returned to Kiria were from Griffonia, Springtime was from Equestria, and most kirin families that had immigrated to Equestria had found life enjoyable enough there to find little reason to leave. But Springtime had left a comfy position as a broadcasting executive in Fillydelphia to help organize the NAKP's new broadcasting stations in Fragrance, and had specifically requested blocks of air time during the afternoon and evening to use as she saw fit. That was what Cypress has summoned her to his office to discuss today; after all, the radio was one of the NAKP's most invaluable tools on properly educating and informing the kirin of Fragrance, and it wouldn't do to have anything undermine its unified message.\n\n"Radio Free Kiria," Springtime explained, "can be far more than just a tool of the NAKP. In fact, it needs to be if you want it to not only become successful, but profitable as well."\n\nThat raised Cypress' eyebrow. "Successful and profitable? It's already successful enough as it is. The news broadcasts, the talk shows, the educational programming—all of it is carefully curated to advance the official party stances of the NAKP. If it does that, then it serves its purpose of furthering our goals in the long-term."\n\n"For all your talk of free markets and self-regulation, you can be very hypocritical when it comes down to it, can't you?" Springtime rolled her eyes. "Here's my suggestion: allow independent broadcasters to purchase air time on the RFK's stations to air whatever they feel like. The NAKP will still, of course, maintain exclusive rights over the primetime hours, and nothing has to be cut from its programming to make room for this. That's why I reserved select hours for my own use when I helped set the system up: to hold them for independent broadcasting, free from NAKP censors. Within a month, the kirin of Fragrance and beyond will determine what gets broadcasted by consumer taste, and the ethos of supply and demand that the NAKP champions so fiercely. Sure, there may be some kirin with differing views who purchase air time, but the kirin who listen to the RFK will help the market to regulate their access and message to the realm. I see only positives from opening up the air waves in such a manner. How about you?""

Rhapsody stood at the center of the Plebiscite as the shining jewel of the Greater Providence region, and as such, both the NAKP and Vermilion loyalists had campaigned hard to sway the votes of the kirin living in the city. That, of course, meant that prominent figures from both sides were regular fixtures in the city, but it seemed like nokirin except for her had the foresight to imagine what would happen if Fickle Current and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine crossed paths in the city. And it was a good thing she had imagined such a possibility, because it was happening right before her eyes.\n\nOn one side of the monastery's great courtyard stood Fickle Current, surrounded by his NAKP cronies and rank and file members who were more than willing to engage in mob violence if their Chairkirin demanded it; on the other, Rain Shine and several mystics and diplomats from Vermilion stood in the center of a ring of disciplined Banner soldiers, outnumbered by the NAKP's side but more than willing to rise to the challenge in the defense of their Matriarch. Between them, Heavenly Fire had directed Rhapsody's Guards Vigilant to keep the two parties separated lest somekirin do something everykirin would soon regret. And with a crowd gathered around the perimeter and growing by the minute, Heavenly knew that the news of what happened here today would very quickly spread its way across Kiria and then throughout the world like an uncontrollable wildfire.\n\nStill, she sensed an opportunity for a bit of showmareship that would benefit Rhapsody by bringing even more attention to her city, and so she dispatched acolytes to both sides with a modest proposal. It didn't take long before they returned to her with the responses of each side, and she allowed herself a small smile through chapped lips on her wrinkled muzzle. She issued one last command, and soon, several more acolytes brought out a beautiful zitan wood table and a pair of matching chairs. They positioned them under a great sandalwood tree in the middle of the courtyard, and soon Rain Shine and Fickle Current emerged from their respective crowds to meet in the middle. Then, they sat down, and with scribes standing nearby to write down every word, they each began to debate their stances on the Plebiscite."

kirin_council.22.t:0 "The Debate of the Century" ##for both KIS and KIR
kirin_council.22.d:0 "There was no form to the debate, no structure to adhere to; the conversation that arose between Fragrance's exceptionally educated, traveled, and shrewd businesskirin and Vermilion's reserved, cloistered, yet keen divine avatar of Concord took some time to find its footing, but once the smalltalk was out of the way, both kirin dived into the matter at hoof. Both delivered versions of the remarks they had campaigned to the kirin of Greater Providence, with Fickle Current emphasizing the cultural differences and distinctions between the kirin north of the Great Mellifluve watershed and those within it, while Rain Shine hammed home the basic fact that they were all kirin, and unlike those who had been led astray in the west, devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire was as strong a unifying force as any throughout the Realm of Kiria. But it wasn't until almost a solid hour of patient back-and-forth, of position, jab, and deflection, that Rain Shine found an opening to gain the upper hoof in the debate.\n\nAfter whittling away at Current's defenses by pressuring him into explaining what the kirin of his ancestral homeland meant to him when he had been born in distant Griffonia, Rain Shine immediately seized on Current turning the question back on her, and her lips curled into a pleased smirk before softening into a mother's caring smile. "No matter what happens in this vote, all the citizens of Kiria will be my precious Kirin. I think it is no secret to anykirin present that every day I watch my beloved Realm tearing itself apart with war and ideology is another day that I quietly suffer at the thought of the misery my subjects are forced to endure. Kiria, I love you; nocreature in the world can deny that. My love for you will always be firm and unconditional, and if the kirin of the north seek to part ways with me, I am willing to let you go. I do not wish to force anykirin into something they do not wish to be a part of. Sometimes love means letting your children find their own way in life. I only ask that you ask yourselves if this is what you really want, if you really want to part ways with me. Do not let anykirin else tell you what you should think or what you should believe; only ask yourself if you share their beliefs, and you agree that they have your best interests in mind. And only then, I feel, will you be able to make a decision that you can live with, not one that you made simply because you were pressured to do so."\n\nThe look on Fickle Current's face told her everything she needed to know, and the applause from the gathered crowd was proof that her riposte had hit her mark. Though Current was quick to try and dismiss her speech as just a veiled attempt to guilt kirin into staying with Vermilion, Rain Shine knew it would be her words, and not Current's, that would be broadcast throughout the Realm in the days to come."

kirin_council.23.t:0 "The Modern Providence"
kirin_council.23.d:0 "It was a perfect day for tea with a friend, Mayflower Bloom thought to herself. She and her friend, River Lily, sat by the window in one of Rhapsody's many, many teahouses, the bright and sunny day making a picturesque backdrop over the rolling hills and slopes descending from the city down to the coast. The teahouse was alive with chatter from its many patrons, and River did enough talking for two; apart from positing a question or leaving a comment here or there, Mayflower was free to enjoy her tea as she listened.\n\nThe radio in the corner of the teahouse crackled to life with the fanfare heralding an announcement from the NAKP, and the teahouse grew quieter as kirin stopped their conversations to listen to what it had to say. When the music was finally over, a mare's voice jumped on the airwaves, lightly colored with static from the distant transmission. "Modernisation! It's what the NAKP stands for!" the voice said, full of energy and pride. "While the rest of the Realm languishes in yesterday, the NAKP is driving Greater Providence forward into the world of tomorrow! That's why Chairkirin Fickle Current signed the Three Moderns program to accelerate the renewal of our society. And just what are these 'Three Moderns', you might be asking yourself? Well, it's simple: modern industry, modern society, and modern Providence. Under Chairkirin Current's ambitious program, the NAKP will strive to expand our industry, transform our society, and create a new Greater Providence that will be the envy of the world!\n\n"But he can't do it alone!" the mare continued. "He needs your help to make it happen! That's why the Chairkirin is asking for every patriotic mare, stallion, and foal to make a donation to their local party branches. Modernising Providence is a daunting task, but with your contributions, we can bring our dreams a little closer to reality! So what are you waiting for, my fellow patriots? Support the NAKP today!"\n\nThe announcement concluded with some more music, and River turned back to Mayflower with a sparkle in her eyes. "The NAKP does so much for us," she said. "We should try to return the favor. Say... didn't you say that you have family helping them out in Fragrance? You're a scientist! You should join them, too!"\n\nMayflower thought about it for a moment. Her cousin was one of the NAKP's top economists; maybe he'd be able to land her a job? "It's worth a try," Mayflower said. "I'd love to see what I'd be able to accomplish with the NAKP's resources...""

kirin_council.24.t:0 "The Enlightenment of the NAKP"
kirin_council.24.d:0 "Fickle Current waited patiently as the rest of the kirin of the NAKP's Executive Council read the proposal he had drafted, a cup of Abyssinian coffee steaming on the table by his idle hooves. He could tell by the mixture of expressions on the board's faces that what he proposing elicited interest, disgust, and a little bit of everything in between. When he decided that he'd given them enough time to gather the general gist of the document, he interrupted them with the explanation he'd spent the previous night perfecting. "We can hardly claim to be a modern and cosmopolitan future for Kiria if we do not embrace the trappings of enfranchisement," he announced, tapping his hooves together. "The Realm as it stands is entangled in religious-fundamentalism and superstition. The many priests and mystics of The Way of Fire hold disproportionate sway over the common kirin, and when one backs their teachings with the will of a supreme being, the populace becomes a very stupid beast to control. But if we introduce the right to vote to the kirin of the Realm, empower them with the notion that their beliefs can change the world, we accomplish two goals: we strip power away from the priests that govern the Realm, and we give our people a stake in their government, investing them in its defence in a way we could never accomplish before."\n\n"But what if subversive voices gain sway?" one of the kirin sitting at the table asked. "Dissent could amplify like never before, and even in a victory at the polls, large minority could spell a catastrophic blow to the legitimacy of the majority."\n\n"Which is why enfranchisement will be limited," Fickle Current explained. "Local and regional positions are the most visible to the populace but the least impactful on national policy; we shall let them have as much say at the local level as they want. But positions in the upper echelons of the NAKP will require party membership to vote on and run for, and the Executive Council will be our tool to control. I've had some clerks hard at work codifying its rules; so far, the first draft is as thick as a phonebook. Nokirin will ever be able to read it front to back and figure out how it works. That gives us leeway to maintain our grip on the country's policy. Please feel free to read it if you like, but I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Wealth, above everything else, still determines the makeup of the Council."\n\nThe rest of the councilkirin slowly nodded, satisfied, and Fickle felt a smile curl the corners of his lips. What he neglected to mention was that he codified the powers of the Chairkirin to directly appoint three out of the ten seats on the Executive Council and remove them at will. Power like that would all but ensure his grip on the NAKP would remain unchallenged."
kirin_council.24.a:0 "Power to the people means greater power to the privileged."

kirin_council.25.t:0 "Putting Order in the Order"
kirin_council.25.d:0 "Fickle Current regarded the kirin in her neatly pressed uniform and shined boots in front of him with a stern frown. "Are you going to let me finish?" he barked at her, his patience well-past the point of wearing thin.\n\n"I won't be lectured by a suit on how to run the Order," the mare spat back at him. "How much fighting have you done in your life, Chairkirin? Leave the management of the Order to the professionals."\n\n"Are you a professional, Tempered Steel?" Current asked her, an eyebrow raising. "As far as your record goes, you're a mercenary who took the chance the NAKP offered you to make your own paramilitary militia. That is why I'm requesting that you acquiescence with the Executive Council's latest decree. The Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum is an invaluable tool to the NAKP; it allows us to enforce our will where regular soldiers aren't suited. What I want to do is take it to the next level. We will reform it into a proper paramilitary formation with its own strict military hierarchy, induction requirements based on donation, and mandated military training in tactics and logistics for all of its officers. I will not have wealthy civilian soldiers who will spend a Saturday afternoon ordering their own brigade of armed soldiers about as they please, but a disciplined, drilled, and dedicated fighting force ready to answer the beck and call of the NAKP. These reforms will require some pruning of the unsavory elements of the Order, but rest assured, you will remain its leader, and you will only answer to the Chairkirin, who happens to be standing right in front of you. I'll even authorize some funds to use at your discretion to kickstart these reforms. Does that sound agreeable to you, commander, or shall I find somekirin else to lead my new Order?"\n\nAfter a moment, Tempered Steel blinked, awkwardly chuckled, and scratched her hoof against her opposite foreleg. "Uh... yeah, actually, now that you say it outland. I've always been looking forward to taking the next step. The Order has so much more to offer the NAKP. I merely assumed that you were confronting me about the Orders, well, less-than-legal 'trading' business."\n\n"Your smuggling runs?" This time it was Current's turn to smirk. "Who do you think signs off on the shipping manifests when they enter Fragrance's markets? Who do you think frees up cargo space on our chartered ships for a little extra room in the hold when they travel to Skyfall? One way or another, that money makes its way into Fragrance's economy... and there's nothing wrong with that, now is there?""
kirin_council.25.a:0 "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, you know?"

kirin_council.26.t:0 "The Assembly's Allowance"
kirin_council.26.d:0 "The representatives trickled in from all throughout the northern reaches of the Realm of Kiria, from the land that was de facto under the control of the NAKP. They all made the pilgrimage from their towns and villages to Fragrance, where they gathered in the city's grand town hall to conduct their business. The chamber floor was a little too small for everykirin present, but they made do nonetheless, as no kirin was willing to miss out on the first gathering of the Assembly of Northern Kiria just to get a little more personal space.\n\nThey were kirin from society's upper echelons, whether they be business owners, wealthy donors, or influential spiritual leaders, and they had all been elected by the kirin of the towns they represented. But they all had one thing in common, even beyond that: they were all present by the good graces of the NAKP, which had actively campaigned on their behalf to their constituents as a reward for adhering to the party dogma. This week, the NAKP had summoned them all to Fragrance to discuss the state of the northern Realm under Fragrance's dominion, and they would spend the rest of the week identifying problems and proposing solutions to the party leadership, which would eventually take them up the chain of command to the Executive Council and the Chairkirin, provided that their resolutions were deemed important enough to take time out of those kirins' busy schedules to address them.\n\nBut independent of that, the NAKP had also placed a measure on the Assembly for it to address itself. The matter concerned how to utilize the budget the NAKP was willing to dedicate for the Assembly to use to address the nation's problems, now and in the future. Three camps very swiftly formed in the hours of debate that were consumed by this one topic. The first proposed to use the money to repair the damage from the unrest and turmoil of the civil war, improving the quality of life for kirin throughout the north and minimizing the disruption of the ongoing conflict. The second suggested instead on using the money to bolster the military to better provide for the protection of their citizens and quell any unrest from subversive activities. The third and final group suggested instead to use this money to invest in the functions of the Assembly in the future, arguing that wise investment would allow the Assembly to become independent of NAKP funding and allow it to address a wider range of problems in the future."

kirin_council.27.t:0 "Standing Together, Separately"
kirin_council.27.d:0 "The meeting thus far had been far smoother than either Fern Flare or Fickle Current had imagined it would be. Tense, certainly, but quite smooth, all things considered. Fern had been surprised Current had made the pilgrimage to Vermilion to seek reconciliation between the Kirin capital and Fragrance, and Current had been surprised to find Autumn's closest advisor serving in her stead as Premier of Kiria. Perhaps both kirin had been most surprised about how willing the other side had been to reach an agreement to slowly stitch Fragrance back into the Realm.\n\n"If I may ask... why?" Fern Flare abruptly questioned, interrupting the minutiae of hashing out a treaty of cooperation and friendship between Vermilion and Fragrance. "When the Grand Gallop Onward fell apart, you and all of your cronies fled Vermilion and cleaved the north off of the Matriarch's realm. And now you want to come back?"\n\n"It's more complicated than you would think," Current said, following a moment's hesitation. "The kirin of Greater Providence want many things, but war with Vermilion is not one of them. The Matriarch Superior is, and always will be, our spiritual leader and unifying icon. Making war against her is a cultural blasphemy that not even a century of living in Griffonia can shake from us in the Diaspora. On top of that, war is only profitable if you're a third party, not if your lives are being lost and your infrastructure ruined in vicious fighting. But, perhaps most importantly, the potential for a future Kiria dominated by the Rising Fire is a thought none of us can bear."\n\nHe sighed, and he loosened his tie with a tug of magic. "Personally, I feel many of my colleagues in the upper echelons of the NAKP have lost their nerve. For all their bluster and bravado, war is not something they wanted to entertain having only recently returned to our homeland. But if we work with Vermilion, and offer all the resources we have at our disposal, we should be able to crush these heretics before it becomes deadly enough to be called a war."\n\n"I hope so, too," Fern Flare agreed. "It's been centuries since kirin have fought kirin like this. Hopefully by working together, we can keep this from getting any worse.""
kirin_council.27.a:0 "Better the enemy we know than the one we don't."
kirin_council.27.b:0 "There's still hope the Realm can come together again."

kirin_council.28.t:0 "Independence Without Fanfare"
kirin_council.28.d:0 "Chairkirin Fickle Current stood by the window in the boardroom, choosing instead to look outside at the sprawling city of Fragrance while the rest of the NAKP's executive council reviewed the final draft for Fragrance's impending declaration of independence from Vermilion's rule. It was a gray day: the clouds were gray, the streets were gray, the buildings were gray, even the mood was gray. There was no rain, and barely a whisper of wind, but the air hung heavy with what might have been, and what had been avoided.\n\nIt was a necessary step; of that, Current had no doubt. Fragrance and the natives of Greater Providence had been allowed to declare their de facto independence from Vermilion, in exchange for curbing the ambitions of the NAKP and respecting the right of Vermilion's rule over the Realm of Kiria. There were many in the party who longed for a war of domination over Vermilion, but more reasonable voices had correctly concluded that war would be a risky endeavor more expensive than it was worth pursuing. Instead, Fragrance was to join Vermilion in crushing the heretic threat in the west, and could now devote its resources toward domestic projects. One dream that could still be realized was the cultivation of the distinct kirin cultural identity of Greater Providence, that domain that existed north of the Great Mellifluve's watershed. It could let Fragrance chart a new course for the future, one that recognized the needs and attitudes of the kirin of the north, rather than subordinating them to the whims of Vermilion in the south. The clouds were gray, but instead of rain, maybe they would break up and let in some sunlight...\n\nWhen the matter was settled, another proposal was raised by one of the executives: would Vermilion appreciate a gift of materiel aid to soften the blow? If Fragrance could spare guns and other war equipment, it might smooth the declaration over with Vermilion. After all, it wouldn't do to try to cooperate to destroy the heretics but always looking over one's shoulder for a knife in the back..."
kirin_council.28.a:0 "Vermilion has never come to our aid. They're indebted to us as is."
kirin_council.28.b:0 "The Rising Fire threat goes beyond old history. Send them what we can."

kirin_council.29.t:0 "Hardly Relaxing"
kirin_council.29.d:0 "It took Fern Flare little difficulty to track Autumn Blaze down with the latest news from Fragrance. Her close friend, though still officially Kiria's Premier, could either be found in one of two places: her residence in Vermilion, or in the hot springs near the palace. Today, the mare was in the latter, sitting in a spring in a quiet corner of the bathing area up to her shoulders in the hot water. When Fern announced her presence with a quiet cough, Autumn flinched, but upon recognizing her friend, she relaxed slightly, if not by much. "Are you here to join me, Fern?" Autumn asked. "Or is it about my... job."\n\nShe shuddered as she said the last word, and it hurt Fern to see her feel nothing but worry and dismay about the role she'd once taken so enthusiastically to. Hopefully that would resolve itself in time, but Kiria could ill-afford to wait until Autumn pulled herself together. "The NAKP issued a declaration of its independence yesterday," Fern informed her. "It was a simple statement, not quite as bombastic as many of us thought it was going to be. But it means the same, with or without pomp. Fragrance refuses to take orders from Vermilion anymore."\n\nAutumn sighed and sank deeper into the water, until the steamy water lapped at the bottom of her muzzle. "Anything else?" she muttered, refusing or unable to look Fern in the eyes.\n\n"They... offered us weapons and supplies to help stabilize the Realm," Fern said. "Fragrance wants to see a stable and safe Vermilion. It's better for business that way. They wouldn't get any business with the Rising Fire, after all. What should we tell them?"\n\nFern could tell that Autumn wanted nothing more than to slip beneath the waters and stay there as long as she could, but both kirin knew Fern would still be waiting for her answer when she resurfaced. "I'm tempted to refuse," Autumn admitted. "Fickle Current betraying us put Vermilion in such dire straits to begin with. And now he wants to make it up to us with guns? They're part of the problem, and their generosity isn't the solution. But..." she sighed again. "Can we really afford to spurn generosity at this point?""
kirin_council.29.a:0 "We need everything we can get, even from those who betrayed us once."
kirin_council.29.b:0 "Fickle Current's gifts are always poisoned. We refuse."

kirin_council.30.t:0 "Kiria Refuses Our Gifts"
kirin_council.30.d:0 "Vermilion officially responded to our offers of providing them equipment and material with a polite declination. Why Vermilion would repudiate our gifts is anykirin's guess, but it likely has to deal with the tense issue surrounding our secession. Premier Autumn Blaze supposedly feels betrayed by our secession from Vermilion's authority, and any recognition of our gift could be seen as tacit recognition of the legitimacy of our independence. Whatever their reasons, Chairkirin Fickle Current has already taken steps to make sure that this equipment doesn't go to waste."
kirin_council.30.a:0 "At least we've avoided war with Vermilion."

kirin_council.31.t:0 "Trickle Down or Well Up?"
kirin_council.31.d:0 "Fickle Current considered himself a shrewd businesskirin, but even he had to admit that he wasn't the most skilled at manipulating numbers. The NAKP's chief economist, on the other hoof, was practically a wizard when it came to Fragrance's finances. Dr. Ardent Bloom's office was filled with boxes stuffed with reams of finance records, economy predictions, and more business dealings than one could shake a stick at. He was also certain that countless under the table agreements were written down on paper somewhere in Dr. Bloom's cluttered office, the kind that had the potential to bankrupt even the most powerful of the trading houses. How he kept it all under control was beyond him.\n\nBut he hadn't gone to see the economist just to comment on his office clutter. Instead, he had gone to him for advice. "The legal teams are working on codifying the laws of our independence, and making our statement a reality," Current explained to the doctor, who watched him with polite interest but kept a pen scratching away at a piece of paper with his magic all the while. "But if we're going to proclaim our independence, then we need to do something to make it mean something real to the kirin of Greater Providence. We need to embark on renewed industrialization efforts, pick up the pieces from Vermilion's failed experiment. You know the financial situation of the NAKP better than anykirin. What's your recommendation?"\n\n"Depends on how ambitious you are," Ardent Bloom answered him, and his magic collected a few folders from different boxes around his office. He spread them out before Current, though he continued to talk while Current leafed through their contents. "The free market is a wonderful thing, and it follows the money regardless of where it leads. Industrializing the north will be profitable... eventually. Companies will make safe investments in new industry, and when those labors bear fruit, they'll reinvest it back into the economy. This trickle down effect will achieve a powerful industrial base in time. But, if you're willing to offer them incentives, they'll happily take more risks and speed things up a little. The best way to get a corporation whose sole function is to turn profits for its shareholders to take a risk is to let them do it on somekirin else's credit. Question is... are you willing to give them your letter of credit?""

kirin_council.32.t:0 "Fragmented Growth"
kirin_council.32.d:0 "Fickle Current was swiftly growing to loathe puzzles. Assembling a functional state following its severance from the host nation was like trying to assemble a colossal jigsaw puzzle, only to find out that half of the pieces were in another box. It took trial and error to find which pieces matched with each other, but with the additional threat that he could only try so many times before the pieces broke and the picture would forever be tarnished, if it was even completed it all.\n\nHis current issue was one that required a delicate touch and a couple dozen more jigsaw pieces to painstakingly fit into the puzzle. Greater Providence was a patchwork of regions and subdivisions, each with their own government, laws, and civil bodies, shackled to unique cultural quirks and differing economic drivers. Applying one broad policy over such a patchwork of states would likely be beneficial to some and detrimental to others, and the disparity could hamper the effectiveness of the measure at large. Instead, the best way forward was to rely on and encourage the independent growth of these states. The free market would carve out its niches in the north and settle enterprises into regions that best suited their needs and goals. But, as with everything else, such measures would take time.\n\nCurrent frowned as he thought about it. Time was a valuable commodity, maybe even more so than wealth. Doubtless the growth of these patchwork regions could be accelerated with the right incentives to adventurous businesses. But was such an investment wise? Would its return be worth the amount of capital it would take to successfully incentivize the trading houses to develop the north?"

kirin_council.33.d:0 "Envoys from the city of Fragrance, sent out on behalf of Fickle Current, Chairkirin of the NAKP, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], seeking to attempt a diplomatic resolution to end the bloodshed that has engulfed the Realm in the War of the Double Secession. Chairkirin Current is willing to mediate an end to the war in Fragrance, expressing the urgency with which the war needs to be concluded. If the conflict continues to drag on, famine, disease, and anarchy will cripple the Realm, and leave us fighting over a pile of ashes. Is ruling the ruins of Kiria really worth fighting for more than what we already have?\n\nCurrent's envoys have also come prepared with preliminary terms to begin negotiations with. First and foremost, Vermilion and Chrysanthemum will have to recognize the right of the other to exist, and promise not to suppress the rights of followers of The Way of Fire and The Rising Fire in their respective territories. Additionally, a more favorable border will be established between our domains by Vermilion ceding Verdant to Chrysanthemum and the rule of The Rising Fire. In exchange, Rising Sun will protect the rights of free navigation up and down the Great Mellifluve to all nations, and will refrain from attempting to expand her influence beyond the banks of the Great Mellifluve, with the exception of any territory acquired from Vermilion over the course of the war, which she will be allowed to keep. Lastly, the proposed treaty urges each party to make a promise to mediate any future disputes through diplomatic channels and not through the use of force.\n\nThe treaty is an interesting proposal, and offers us a way out of the bloodshed. But it is unlikely to be popular with our people; we have fought for so much, and what we will be settling for is much less than we promised them. But is the price of continuing the war too steep? And how can we trust the other side?"

After eating something light for breakfast, he left his home behind and went for a pre-dawn walk. His path took him down to the sandy shores outside of the city limits, where he was all alone save for scuttling crabs and the crashing of waves against the beaches. Eventually, he stopped and sat down on the sand, his gaze turned toward the east, waiting for the sun to reveal itself on the dark horizon. It gave him time to reflect on all he had accomplished so far as the NAKP's unquestioned chairkirin.\n\nWar had come to Kiria for the first time in centuries; now, it was over. He may have helped escalate it by organizing Fragrance's secession when the Grand Gallop Onward failed, but he had played a decisive role in ending it. The threat posed by the Rising Fire had been largely neutralized, and peace had once more returned to the Realm. And it was thanks to his efforts that it was so; he knew he would be remembered for many, many years because of what he had accomplished.\n\nBut it was not without some chafing and disagreement from within the party. Current had had to cut deals as he could and make compromises to keep much of what he'd gained for Fragrance. Submission to Vermilion as the Viceroyalty of Greater Providence had been seen by many in the party as a stab in the back to the idea of an independent Fragrance, but the reality had been that there was no other choice. Fragrance had been too weak to survive on its own, and only in submission to Vermilion would it be allowed to keep much of the freedom Current had bought it. But the kirin of Greater Providence were still proud of what he had secured for them: pride in their northern identity, pride in its recognition from Vermilion, pride in the safe and predictable future Current had promised them. Their futures would be bright and profitable, and at the end of the day, was that not all that they wanted?\n\nThe sun began to rise, an orange glow on the horizon, slowly growing brighter as the minutes passed. As Current felt its light begin to warm his coat, he allowed himself a smile. In Kiria's hour of darkness, Fragrance had been its beacon of hope and peace. It had positioned itself as an ideal for all kirin nations to model themselves after, a rational and logical nation ruled by reason, not superstition and religious dogma. Perhaps, in the end, that was all that mattered."

And it was thanks to his efforts that it was so; he knew he would be remembered for many, many years because of what he had accomplished.\n\nIt had been everything that most members of the party had sought: true independence and the right to self-determination, free from religious superstition and interference. Though Fragrance and the NAKP recognized Matriarch Superior Rain Shine as the one true spiritual and religious head of state of kirinkind, she held no legal authority over Fragrance, leaving the north free to pursue its own designs and chart its own course through the waters ahead of it. Some in the NAKP grumbled that they should have gone further, should have taken steps to ensure their dominion over the rest of the Realm, but would such actions really have been worth it? Would it have been worth it to jeopardize their independence for the sake of greed? The kirin of Greater Providence were happy with their independence, and they were proud of what they had done to end the war with the Rising Fire. What more did they need that they did not already have? Their futures would be bright and profitable, and at the end of the day, was that not all that they wanted?\n\nThe sun began to rise, an orange glow on the horizon, slowly growing brighter as the minutes passed. As Current felt its light begin to warm his coat, he allowed himself a smile. In Kiria's hour of darkness, Fragrance had been its beacon of hope and peace. It had positioned itself as an ideal for all kirin nations to model themselves after, a rational and logical nation ruled by reason, not superstition and religious dogma. Perhaps, in the end, that was all that mattered."

It was nice to have them and many other of his Literati friends together under one roof again, and even better that they could finally do so in Kiria. Many of them had feared that they would not live long enough to see this day; some of them didn't. Those lost friends were dearly missed, but Cypress knew they were with them in spirit. If the Way of Fire mystics were to be believed, they lived on in the primordial spark of the kirin race, returned to the fire from which they were born, and the fire that lived inside the breast of every kirin.\n\nThe topic of conversation had drifted hither and thither throughout the afternoon, though recent events had settled it on military matters. It was no secret that things were tense between the NAKP and the government back in Vermilion; at this point, war was less a question of "if" but "when". He decided to clear his throat and head off any more talk of military matters before it grew heated. "Friends, I am glad to have you all here, although I wish it were under better circumstances," he proclaimed, interrupting the ongoing argument. "We've come from many walks of life: professors, corporate advisors, historians, and many more. And now we're all reunited in service of the NAKP and making Kiria what we've always dreamed it should be. But for now, let's not let our talk linger on the art of war. It is a costly art, after all, and I fear that we shall all grow sick of it entirely too soon.""

"Allowing kirin to buy their way out of the conscription lottery was a genius move. Mixing a sense of patriotic duty in contributing to the war chest along with the option to exempt your family from military service has meant war bond purchases have risen over 500% in the past month alone. It's a win-win for both sides: the NAKP gets the money we need to buy guns and continue our armament effort, and our beloved donors get to keep their sons and daughters off of the front lines."\n\n"Indeed," Survey agreed. "I just hope that this doesn't thin the ranks too much."\n\n"Why would it?" Dr. Bloom asked. "It doesn't mean the lottery pulls fewer numbers. It just means that we conscript those who can't or won't donate money to the war effort. The poor fill our armies, and the rich fill our coffers. Nothing wrong with that.""

"Good evening, fillies and gentlecolts throughout our beloved Realm!" the announcer's voice greeted with a crackle of static. "Tonight, we have a very special program for you. Our very own Chairkirin, Fickle Current, will be discussing an important question with Dr. Cypress Snow: what makes a kirin? I won't keep the answer to that question from you, and instead I'll turn the microphone over to the Chairkirin. Chairkirin Current, Dr. Snow, the show's all yours."\n\n"Thank you," Fickle Current said. "So, Dr. Snow. Let's skip the introductions; everykirin listening in now knows who we both are. Let's dive right into the heart of the topic at hoof: what is the nature of the kirin spirit?"\n\n"It's a simple answer with many layers to it," Cypress responded. "The outermost layer is perhaps the easiest for everykirin listening at home to understand: we are Concord's chosen people. We are the keepers of Her will, the custodians of the Primordial Fire that birthed the world. Out of all the creatures that inhabit this world, from ponies to griffons to zebras, it was the kirin species that Concord bestowed Her most powerful gift: our flame, our fury, our passion."\n\n"And yet we have all been taught since we were foals to refrain from using Her gift," Fickle Current countered. "The nirik state is a terrible blight."\n\n"To call it a blight is a misconception, one pushed by The Way of Fire," Cypress said, delivering the counterpoint with practiced ease. "Our fire and fury is a tool, not a curse. It is, however, a dangerous one. An axe is a tool that can kill, but it can also shape and create. So too must we use our passion wisely to create, not destroy. In the late 800s, the Realm was on par with Equestria for technological supremacy, thanks to our investments in steam and clockwork technology, but The Silence cost us a century of valuable time. Imagine what could have been but for misplaced superstition!"\n\n"I can, and I encourage everykirin listening at home to do the same," Current said. "The NAKP is the harbinger of a new future for Kiria, and we all have a part to play to make it a reality. We must cast down the heretical Rising Fire and cleanse the ranks of the Way of Fire of those who bury the Realm in superstition for their own gain. We must strive to unite Kiria under its rule and purge the misguided elements that have held us back for so long. That is our destiny, and I have no doubt that the enlightened kirin of Greater Providence will be the ones that lead the Realm back into the glory we deserve.""

"You like it, May?" he asked her, and he smirked as he held out a foreleg to show off the epaulettes on his shoulder.\n\nMayflower suppressed an amused snort and tried to hide the look on her face by turning back to the tea she was preparing for the two of them. "I didn't take you for an army type, Ardent. How in the world did you end up as a... what did you say it was? Brigand-General?"\n\n"Brigadier-General," Ardent clarified with an annoyed growl. "And I'll tell you how. With war on the horizon, the NAKP was looking to make the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum a more professional force to be the tip of the spear. Yesterday, the Order was just a bunch of street thugs, bandits, and yes, brigands, hastily assembled into a kind of informal police force to do the party's bidding. But now that the Order's putting together the Death's Head Brigade, they needed money to lure some of the best marines the trading houses have to offer into its ranks, and to equip them with the best Griffonian ordnance we could buy. So I made a contribution, and they awarded me with a rank befitting of my gift."\n\n"And how much was that?" Mayflower asked, finally finishing their tea and pouring it into two waiting cups. From everything it sounded like, nokirin was going to listen to somekirin who bought their rank when it came time to fight, least of all Ardent, who was more at home in his spreadsheets and ledgers than he was on the battlefield.\n\n"A little more than a week's worth of pay," Ardent said with a shrug, but he quickly chased it off with a smile. "But this is just the beginning. Right now, the Order has to buy the best from elsewhere, and it needs the money to do that. One day, though, the true patriots of Kiria will produce the best equipment and the best soldiers the world has ever seen!""

What was it, his fourth of the night? Fifth? He didn't know, and it was probably better that way. His nerves were fraying, and though he was hardly a heavy drinker, he was reaching for something to help soothe them. After all, he was about to make a very difficult request, and the hit to his reputation would take some time to recover.\n\nHe looked out at all the kirin slowly filing into the grand ballroom of 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, many of them clutching drinks in their colorful magical auras, and all of them dressed to the nines. They were all members of the pinnacle of modern kirin society, the highest of the Diaspora's high society, and they had all paid 5000 Griffonian idols a head to attend the night's fundraising festivities. And here Current was about to ask them for more.\n\nWhen they had all gathered into the ballroom, Current took the microphone to thank them for their charity and give them all a pat on the back for having the means to afford the exorbitant entrance fee, as he knew all socialite types craved. That part of the speech was easy; then came the hard part. "And now, I'd like to remind everykirin of the reason why we're having this ball tonight, and how much more we all have to give to make our dreams a reality," he said, steeling himself for the inevitable reproachful looks from those gathered before him. "We will soon be finding ourselves in a war, and a very expensive one at that. Suffice it to say, the coffers of the NAKP are simply inadequate for waging war against our foes in Vermilion. Therefore, I regretfully ask of you all if you have anything else you can spare for the war effort, the NAKP will be greatly appreciative of any and all contributions. When the war is won, we will, of course, remember your generosity in the future."\n\nThe scoffs from the gathered kirin and the sniffs of disgust made Current feel like somekirin was pulling his scales off one by one with a pair of pliers, but he did his best to maintain a smile through their murmuring. That was nothing, however, compared, to the words he overhead Silver Silks, heiress to the Sycee Trading House and the single wealthiest kirin present at the party, mutter to her friends. "Begging is quite unbecoming of the Chairkirin, wouldn't you agree? I suppose we should give him what he wants. Elsewise, he may become even more desperate at the next gala, and that just won't do at all."\n\nTheir tittering bit deep, but Current swallowed that embarrassment regardless.

They're unpredictable, and you don't know what you're in for when the debt is called." He sighed and shook his head. "But it's a necessary evil, is it not? We need overseas investors, and our contacts in Griffonia are happy to give us funds if we lease them land, property, and resources as collateral. If we lose, we won't have to worry about our creditors in Skyfall or Flowena calling due, but if we win..."\n\n"There is another option that's not with our usual Griffonian contacts," Ardent said, steepling his hooves as he considered whether or not to press forward. But at Current's curious look, he continued. "The Changelings have caught wind of our offer. I don't know how, but when you're dealing with a race of shapeshifting insects, I suppose it only makes sense that they would. They're interested, and they're offering exceedingly generous terms."\n\n"How generous?" Current asked. In his experience, the more generous the terms, the larger the knife hidden behind a creature's back.\n\n"They want the same things as our Griffonian business partners, but they're more interested in property than resources, and they're willing to pay more for it — much more. But..." Here he hesitated, then sighed and continued. "They're negotiating through Main Hives Industries, their largest industrial conglomerate. It's all run through one bug named Finicus Vesali, and I'll warn you, he's no slouch when it comes to the negotiating table. He probably knows how to cut a deal as well as you do, Current. Long story short, I don't trust them."\n\n"And to make a short story slightly longer?" Current asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Well, the Changelings, unlike Skyfall or Flowena, have the means to collect if we don't pay up," Bloom said. "And they want land more than anything else. You'd think an industrial powerhouse like them would want resources above anything else. Something's fishy, and I don't like it... but at the end of the day, it's your call.""

Sure, it resembled an equine, but the insectoid facsimile created an 'almost but not quite' appearance of a pony or kirin that it bothered him. But even moreso than his appearance was his shrewd intelligence and clever wit, forcing Ardent to use every scrap of resourcefulness and experience to keep up with the deal-cutting businessbug.\n\n"You can drop out at any time, and we'll terminate the contract," Finicus Vesali said to him, and not for the first time, turning those words into a threat pressuring Ardent to do the opposite and uphold the deal as agreed upon. "But of course, we'll have to resolve all the clauses in our agreement. The NAKP will be held responsible for any damages to the equipment we're supplying to your factories, and it will be held accountable should any equipment produced here find its way onto the other side of a changeling battlefield. I think you'll agree that it's only fair to say that Kirin-made guns produced with Changeling-leased equipment taking Changeling lives on the field of battle is a messy can of worms that nocreature wants to open. Oh, and we maintain that we Changeling Queendom has the right to demand the immediate return of any and all equipment loaned to the NAKP for the duration of the contract. I hope this is all agreeable to you, Dr. Bloom?"\n\n"Yes, it is," Dr. Bloom managed through gritted teeth. He knew what was in the contract, so nothing Finicus said to him was a surprise or a lie, but having it read aloud to him made the walls of the box the Changleings were putting the NAKP all the more apparent. "Is there anything else, Herr Vesali?"\n\n"One last thing," and at this, Finicus smiled and set the pen held aloft in his magic down on the table. "The Foreign Office of the Changeling Heer asked me to convey a message while in Fragrance, so here I am, conveying it. In accordance with the secret treaties Vesalipolis has negotiated with Fragrance, the Queendom will be contributing an expeditionary force to support the NAKP's near-term combat activities. Of course, it goes without saying that the Korps will be commissioned as a 'non-state actor force' via the Liaison Office and its operating expenses covered in part by the NAKP.

It was a relatively small affair, not something that the NAKP had publicized to the common kirin. After all, the word 'mercenary' held a sour taste in the mouth of the average upstanding citizen, and that was the essential function of the Office: to organize, recruit, and supply mercenary companies that were willing to get their hooves or claws or what-have-you dirty in exchange for generous pay, no questions asked. Officially, these military units would consist of foreign volunteers sympathetic to the cause of the Association, which was technically true, but this pretext fooled nokirin.\n\nEven so, Current couldn't deny that it was a viable business model. The world was such a powder keg that there would always be a demand for soldiers of fortune, the willingness to pay for an elite force capable of greater things than the poorly-disciplined conscript armies of the world. Zebrica and Griffonia in particular were lands filled with conflict and strife, and there, an experienced mercenary company could be the means to alter the course of a war.

But his power was still limited by those who pulled the strings behind the scenes, and right now, they were all in one room, and they were not pleased with him.\n\nSilver Silks, the heiress to the Sycee Trading House and quite possibly the wealthiest kirin in all of Kiria, had a scowl on her face, and there was a reason the ember at the end of the cigarette lodged in its jade holder burned blue and pink, not orange. "The NAKP's recent propaganda is a problem, Chairkirin. Your populist slogans are throwing dynamite into a hornet's nest, one that the corporations—your donors, mind you, and the ones who generate 45% of the NAKP's annual budget, by my last estimate—are standing under, unprotected. 'Patriotism', if that's what you call the anarchy you're fostering, is reaching such a feverish pitch that any action we take that the populace deems 'unpatriotic' will hurt our bottom line."\n\n"And that's exactly what you want, isn't it?" The new voice was from the quiet and diminutive stallion sitting at the far end of the table from Fickle Current, wearing a bronze-and-pewter monocle so broad and thick that it practically covered half his face. Fulgent Focus, one of the masters of the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild, seemingly shifted in anxiety as all eyes around the table turned toward him, but he pressed his point regardless. "Yours was a two-pronged attack, expertly executed. Your propaganda drives patriotism to such a fervent frenzy that anything deemed unpatriotic by the public is met with harsh criticism and repudiation, and you come directly to the leaders of the NAKP's most cherished corporate partners to ask us for money once the price of refusal is clear. Am I wrong to state that is the true purpose of this meeting?"\n\nFickle Current was cut off guard by Fulgent's surgical cleave right to the heart of the matter, and the honeyed words and clever talking points he'd practiced before the meeting were suddenly thrown out the window. "Well... yes, it is, Artificer Focus. No point in denying it now, since you've so clearly laid the stakes out on the table." Current stood up and leaned forward, placing his hooves on the finely veneered mahogany table. "I want the corporations to increase their donations to the NAKP. We need increased funding if we are going to fight and win a war that will by all estimates be incredibly destructive and deadly. I could go about raising funds through other means, such as increasing the corporate membership dues, but I think it's clear we would all prefer to walk out of this meeting with a consensual agreement rather than an imposed one.""

What will we be getting out of this in return?"\n\n"Legal jurisdiction the likes of which the world has never seen before," Fickle Current stated, and despite the scowl she had a moment earlier, those words caused Silks' eyebrow to raise in interest. "In exchange for increased donations and public statements supporting the NAKP's claim to rule Kiria and unequivocal support for the party platform, the NAKP will use its regional bureaucrats and governors to enforce limited land requisitions on commonly-owned property within our jurisdiction, and transfer the deeds to our corporate donors in the name of development. We will further amend our constitution to extend corporate sovereignty over the lands bestowed upon you as payment. The land is yours to govern and manage as you please; any laws you create and administer will be enforced in supremacy of local laws in those territories."\n\n"Any laws?" Fulgent asked, and not without suspicion. "I fail to believe that the NAKP will be so laissez-faire with lands under its jurisdiction. And any seizure of lands under the domain of Rhapsody will not be accomplished without strenuous resistance; like all clerical types, the Procurate will not return power once granted so readily. Do not make promises that you are not ready to keep, Chairkirin."\n\n"I never do. Business dealings only go so far as one's word." Satisfied, Fickle Current took his hooves off the table and returned to his seat. "I'll have accountants and representatives hammer out the details with your people at a later date. But I think it's well-evident that the interests of the NAKP and our generous corporate allies follow close alignment. I don't imagine that we will have any issues fostering and maintaining an agreeable relationship, now and in the future.

"The Griffonian Republican revolution in 978 was a failure that saw initial success but devolved into chaos and hopelessness by the time it had run its course," he proclaimed, and he turned to face the dozens of NAKP cadre and officers seated in the lecture hall before him. "The Griffonian Empire was once a strong, absolutist nation, but the inherent challenges of decentralization and the privileges of the vassals opened the door for revolutionary fervor that destroyed it from within. The natural order of society was upended, and during the vicious fighting between monarchists and republicans, the communists and trade unions, the red rats of society, grew exponentially in size and filled in all the cracks that had formed. Like water freezing in the cracks of great stones, they widened those cracks and wedged apart what was once a solid body. They thrive on instability and turmoil, breed in it, and it will no doubt happen to us when we march on Vermilion."\n\nThe chalk flew toward the words 'RISING FIRE' and circled it thrice before dropping back into the tray at the bottom of the chalkboard. "The Rising Fire claims to be a religious movement, but they are in reality a communist movement. They already have their spies whispering lies and treason in the ears of our workers here in Fragrance, promising the bloody glories of class struggle, of collectivism, of the despicable facade of 'creatures' rights'. It is not their interpretation of Concord's teachings that will be the menace of their legacy, but their Marksist-Stallionist ideology. As chaos reigns in the war, they will grow stronger, even as we march closer to victory. And so, it is important that we root it out now, before we march to war."\n\nCypress stomped a hoof on the ground to emphasize his point. "Communism is a disease, and like a disease, it will multiply endlessly until it is bested at great cost, or until it kills its host. But today, we shall inoculate Kiria against this disease. Each of you have a task at hand to play in the coming hours. You have been chosen to lead the state's counteroffensive against the subversive elements in our midst. You will destroy the fifth column, and through its destruction, bring stability to our beloved Greater Providence and steel our resolve for the war to come.

Now, lacking the ability to even arrange a timely meeting with Fickle Current, much less summon him to her office, Cherry could only hold a one-sided conversation with the Chairkirin over the radio.\n\n"The constitutional principles of the Party-State are straightforward," Fickle Current said, the radio coloring his voice with static. "Everything the Party does is built around the idea that anykirin can have a path to success through hard work and individual grit. The free markets allow the kirin of the north to buy and sell to and from whom they please. The freedom to create and sign contracts allow kirin and businesses to add legal enforcement to any deals arranged by both sides. The right to work ensures that all kirin can pursue employment and not be coerced into joining unions and other bodies that would siphon off their hard-earned paychecks for the follies of collectivization. Together, these principles will allow us to reclaim the destiny of the kirin people as the hegemons of Eastern Zebrica, a status we were well on our way to claiming before the Silence interrupted our progress."\n\n"Will they, though?" Cherry murmured to herself, though she imagined having the opportunity to say those words to Fickle Current's face. "What of the commoners who work in your factories and plow your fields? What of the soldiers who die holding the guns you sold them? Who really gets the wealth and comfort you promise: the kirin of the north, or you and your cronies?"\n\nShe sighed and shook her head. "None of you were elected by the kirin of Fragrance," she grumbled, glaring down at her idle hooves. "You held party votes and referendums. I was chosen by the kirin of the city you rule over. But at the end of the day... what am I to the Party-State?""

kirin_council.46.t:0 "A Maritime Rendezvous"
kirin_council.46.d:0 "Fickle Current wondered what insane part of him had been so foolish to go through with this plan. The other night, he had finally decided to send a message to the pirate queen, Roaring Fire, using the enchanted jade candle she had given him after their meeting in Nacre. He'd wondered if he would ever get a response. To his surprise, one was quick in returning, instructing him to board an unassuming red and blue fishing junk in the waters just outside of Fragrance's harbor. He'd taken every precaution to ensure his safety, stationing boarding parties on nearby boats, sharpshooters on the rooftops of harborfront buildings, and even a diving team led by a hippogriff mercenary in the waters below the junk. Still, he had no idea what would happen when he stepped onto that boat. For all he knew, he'd be leaving it with his throat slit open, unceremoniously dumped into the water.\n\nThe rowboat he sat in bumped against the side of the junk, and moments later, a simple rope ladder was tossed over the side. Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Current hesitantly climbed up the ladder until he stood on the junk's rolling deck. The kirin onboard gave him quick glances, but otherwise pretended he wasn't there, leading to him heading for the open cabin door at the stern of the ship. When he opened it and stepped inside, he saw the mare he was looking for, kicking back in a wooden chair with her hooves on the table, still covered in her colorful and garish pirate attire.\n\n"Sit," Roaring Fire said, gesturing to a seat across the table from her. Then her magic pulled out two porcelain cups and poured rice wine from a jar into each. "Drink. After all, what better way to celebrate our new... let's call it a business venture. I know people like you like to keep your terminology clean, as if that changes the nature of the deal just because you call it one thing versus another."\n\n"What you call something matters very much to the kirin who hears its name," Fickle said, sitting down in the offered seat with a frown. He lifted the cup of rice wine to his nose, grimaced after taking a sip, and then forced himself to take a long sip of it. It was strong, much too strong for his tastes, but he went through with it as a common courtesy to the mare sitting across from him. "Let's cut to the meat of it, then. Tell me about your forces. What can you contribute to the war effort?"\n\n"Enough to matter, but not what you're likely hoping for." The pirate queen knocked back her cup of wine in a gulp, than poured another one and drained half of it before continuing. "Our junks aren't oceangoing cruise liners, and we had to scuttle a lot of our largest ships when we left Nacre. We have enough ships to keep ourselves afloat and in business to prey on merchant shipping, but not anything that could take a hit in a stand-up fight from a metal warship.""

kirin_council.47.t:0 "The Matter of Submarine Swashbuckling"
kirin_council.47.d:0 ""Mmmm... yes, the submarine. Our wild card." Roaring Fire grinned, showing enough teeth to remind Fickle Current of a shark. "We stole that from the Feathesians a while back. What about it?"\n\n"What about it?" Fickle raised an eyebrow. "Do I need to spell it out? Having that on our side would be a great boon to the NAKP's merchant navy. You could scrape together a hundred wooden junks for me, and they wouldn't have anything near the value of that submarine. The Party would keep it fueled and supplied for you, and you'd be able to keep any salvage you can get your hooves on using it. That would make a difference for the war effort."\n\n"It would... if I still had it." While Current blinked in surprise, Fire downed her second cup of wine and started working on her third. "We had to leave the submarine behind when we left Nacre. We didn't have the fuel to maintain it, and replacement parts for a submarine are hard to come by out in the Kirin Sea. I hid it in a cove on the off-chance we'd be able to recover it someday, a chance that you just might be able to take for me." Then she lifted her legs from the table, and her chair slammed back onto all fours with a thud. The pirate queen leaned in over her teacup and raised an eyebrow at Current. "Get me that sub back and I'll make sure not a single ship gets to your enemies. But that's neither here nor there for the moment. In the meanwhile, I can help you in other ways as well. I can have my kirin patrol the waterways of the Great Mellifluve in our smaller junks, harassing supply lines, providing support for river crossings, the likes. Alternatively, I've had to double up on crews on some of my ships since we had to scuttle so many. They're experienced buccaneers, and they love a good fight. If you want, I can dock some of my junks and give you their crews to fight with. You provide us with equipment, I can give you a crack team of marines willing to fight better than any of those pansies you're bringing in from Griffonia. So long as we get a fair share of the loot, of course. So, what'll it be?""

With the plants gone, sunlight slipped into the hidden cove, reflecting off the still waters before illuminating the stone dome enclosing the shoreline within. She and her salvagers from the Sycee Trading House had followed the instructions passed along by the NAKP, unsure of what exactly they would find. But now, moored in the hidden harbor, she saw the prize, and understood why the NAKP had been so desperate to get its hooves on it.\n\nA submarine had been beached on the shoreline, and she recognized it as Feathesian in make from her type abroad in Griffonia. It had obviously been abandoned for some time, given the rust that had become to form over its hull, but at first glance, it at least looked intact. The name 'Dolfijn' had been painted on the side, and there was even a small pile of torpedoes, ammunition, and black barrels of oil stacked up in the back of the cove, well out of reach of the tides. Once all of that was loaded back onto the ship, they could have a tugboat drag it out of the cove and haul it back to Fragrance for repairs. In no time at all, it would be seaworthy again, and the NAKP would have another weapon at its disposal."

kirin_council.49.d:0 "Fickle Current stood by the window in his office and looked westward. Beyond the horizon, the Realm was burning, though few kirin had been able to make sense of it thus far. All anykirin in Fragrance knew was that the squabbling Triumvirate that ruled from Vermilion had gone down in flames—quite literally. Current had read the assessments and reports from the front that described the NAKP's enemies turning on each other in their trenches, and forward units had described entering the Vermilion loyalists' fortifications only to find charred bodies and blackened, boiled bloodstains along the walls. At night, the battlefield would glow with a blue and pink light, and the howls of monsters wailed into the darkness. By all accounts, the loyalist alliance has collapsed into violent nirik warlord splinter states, and a second inferno like the days before the Way of Fire had descended upon the Realm. Rather than making the war easier to fight, Current knew, it might have just gotten even harder. Feral, mindless nirik were monsters who ignored pain and cared little for self-preservation.\n\n"Sergeant Black Soot here to see you, sir," Current's secretary alerted him, and the NAKP's chairkirin turned around to find a charcoal gray mare standing by his desk. The insignia of the Death's Head Brigade glistened on the mare's shoulder, and in her magic was a soot-streaked book.\n\n"One of our spies was in Vermilion when the Triumvirate collapsed," Sergeant Black Soot said, and she set the book down on Current's desk. "He was by Autumn Blaze's side and was feeding us information since the war began. Thankfully, he managed to flee the capital as it burned to the ground, and the Brigade rescued him from deep behind enemy lines. Lines that were filled with nirik, mind you."\n\nFickle Current knew when a kirin was angling for more taels, and he gave her a nod. "Thank you, sergeant. I'll see to it that you're well rewarded. Now, what is this?" he asked, pointing to the book.\n\n"An excerpt from Autumn Blaze's personal journal," Black Soot said. "For your eyes only." Then she bowed her head. "My team will await further orders, sir." Current dismissed her with a wave of his hoof, then pulled over and opened up the book. Many of the pages were blackened and crumbled into ashes at the slightest touch, but one entry still remained: the last one. Autumn's usually flowing calligraphy was erratic and smudged, but behind the ash and what looked like blood, it was still legible."

kirin_council.50.t:0 "The Spoils of the Realm" ##Post-War Events
kirin_council.50.d:0 "As Fickle Current entered Vermilion, safe in the middle of an armored convoy, he couldn't help but look over the Realm's capital and think back to when he first arrived what felt like a lifetime ago. Back then, he had arrived in an automobile, a piece of machinery so alien to the locals that they could only stare at it in awe and fascination. It had been difficult to cut a path to Vermilion over the Realm's ruined and abandoned roads, but he had done it anyway to make a statement: the future was coming to the backwards Realm. Now, at the end of a brutal civil war, the similarities between then and now seemed almost laughably remarkable, like a bad case of deja vu. With blood and iron, the NAKP had cut a path through Vermilion's defenders, once more bringing the future to the doorstep of Kiria.\n\nThe battle for the capital had taken a toll on its rustic splendor, with many buildings gutted by bombs and artillery and entire blocks reduced to ashes from uncontrolled fires. But apart from a few bullet holes in the walls and the odd crater around its periphery, the Vermilion Palace loomed over the scarred city, utterly untouched. Fitting, then; the Realm could only hold together so long as the constant presence and assuring infallibility of its Matriarch Superior remained unblemished, and even in war, the idea still held true.\n\n"The Matriarch's personal guard refused to fight with our forces," Cypress Snow said as he watched from the seat next to Fickle Current. "They retreated into the palace when the city fell. They haven't budged since. By all reports, the Matriarch is still inside."\n\n"She's too soft to push the kirin who protect her to kill in her name," Fickle Current said. "Besides, the army had orders to not push on the palace at all. We couldn't risk anything happening to the Matriarch. We may hold all the power in the Realm, but she's the one who holds it together with her mere presence. Half of our soldiers fought thinking they were trying to save her from her prisoners. We would lose anything if we so much as hurt a scale on her body."\n\nCypress Snow only nodded at that. "True enough. But the war's over. It's time for her to come out and do her job.""

kirin_council.51.t:0 "A Prisoner's Dues"
kirin_council.51.d:0 "Tempered Steel sat on the gravel beside the train rails with the rest of his banner... or what was left of it. In the final defense of Vermilion, his unit had been surrounded and captured by the NAKP; since then, he'd known nothing but chains around his legs and a painful notch in his horn that stopped him from summoning any magic. It was a simple but effective means of controlling prisoners; the notch would heal over time and his magic would return, but the memory of the pain of having a chisel driven into the root of his horn was as effective a means as any to make sure he didn't try to use it while under guard. So long as the guards fed him and didn't bring back the chisel, he was fine keeping his head down and waiting until he was finally free.\n\nA cadre of NAKP soldiers stood before the group of prisoners, rambling about some important service to the Realm they would all be partaking in shortly. "Under the leadership of the NAKP, Greater Providence has marched south and restored order to the Kirian Realm," the mare at their head announced. "We have delivered the Kirian people from the degenerated government of the Premier in Vermilion and the heretic communists of the Rising Fire. As such, indebted as the Realm is to the heroic sacrifices of the north in its expedition to rescue the Realm, the industry of the cities of Vermilion and Verdant, the seats of the traitorous regimes, shall be forfeited in penance for their crimes. These resources shall be relocated to the north to allow the NAKP to better conduct the reconstruction of the Realm after the civil war, and you all will join your former regimes in punishment for supporting them. You will take part in the relocation effort, disassembling the factories here in Vermilion, and bringing them to Fragrance. When your labors are completed, perhaps then you will be ready to rejoin the Realm as honest citizens."\n\nThe NAKP soldiers began to force the prisoners onto their hooves, and Steel reluctantly rose to his with a sigh. Hard labor wasn't anything he couldn't handle. He just doubted that the NAKP would be so willing to let him and his comrades go when their task was complete."

kirin_council.52.d:0 "Cold Forge blinked at the set of blueprints before her and scratched her chin. The were factory floor plans, drawn up by some of the finest architects and artificers the NAKP had on hoof, but they were practically alien to her. She wasn't an engineer, an architect, or even a businessmare. She was a captain in the Imperial Vermilion Military, and before that, a humble blacksmith outside the city of Fragrance. But when the NAKP arrived in Fragrance years ago, she'd thrown her lot in with them, and now, somehow, she found herself staring hopelessly at blueprints while labor crews broke ground on a new factory next to the river before her.\n\n"Exciting, isn't it?" asked the stallion standing next to her, the collar on his suit cinched so tightly with his tie that Cold Forge could see his mane bunched up beneath it around his neck. She could only nod in agreement, feeling completely out of place wearing a business dress, her flanks feeling exposed by the skirt she'd traded her uniform for. She couldn't even remember his name, but he was here to help get her set up as the foremare of this newest factory. It was all part of the NAKP's latest initiative to provide the new Imperial Vermilion Military with the means to be self-sustaining, able to produce its own equipment and munitions without being a draw on the state treasury. The factories would be administered by officers, and the workforce would be drawn from the rank and file, in essence turning each building into a regiment of its own. There would be no strikes, no slowdowns in production; the soldiers would follow the orders of their foremares and keep the factories effortlessly chugging along. At least, that was the idea. Cold Forge bet that her incompetence would get kirin up in arms in a week.\n\nBut hey, she was a captain, and she knew how to command the respect and loyalty of her troops. That's why they put her in charge of this factory, right?"

Soldiers armed with pistols sat in the cab, while in the bed in the back, three kirin sat hunched over, their forelegs chained together and then to the floor. Each squinted and tried their best to shield their faces from the wind, and the smell of chemicals drifted in from afar.\n\nOne of the prisoners in the back turned her head toward her unfortunate companions. "A grim fate awaits us, but at least we have this moment of peace together," she said, raising her voice to be heard over the roar of the truck's engine and the wind. "What did they get you two for?"\n\n"Bad business," the stallion in the truck answered. "I took a loan from the Sycee Trading House and fled with the money when the war started. Stupid idea on my part. I thought the NAKP would lose and I'd get to keep the money, but they didn't, and somekirin sold me out."\n\n"Greed was your folly, as it will be for those who enslave us," the second mare in the truck said. She looked up, squinting towards the sky and the first bright stars beginning to emerge. "I am a mystic of the Way of Fire, and I spent my time and energy working on the front lines as a nurse, to heal the injured and perform last rites for those who needed them." The priestess shook her head. "The northerners and the foreigners, they have no respect for Concord's emissaries, to accost one of Her humble servants in such a manner."\n\n"I was a quartermaster for the army," the first mare began. "I was at the front to coordinate supplies to the troops and I was captured as well. Where do you think they're taking us?"\n\n"North, to the Comely Cape," the businesskirin answered. "Sycee runs a prison factory there. So long as you meet your quotas, they take care of you. All things considered, it's probably the best we could have hoped for."\n\n"I heard stories of factories of misery beneath Fragrance," the quartermaster said. "They do all sorts of terrible things to you there. Medical experiments and other crimes. I think the Bloom family has a hoof in it, but..." She shook her head. "It's all hearsay. And I hope that's all it is."\n\n"Whatever is in store for us, faith in Concord will help us persevere," the priestess assured them. "She would not let her foals languish in such misery forever.""

Fickle Current smiled as he watched the servants at 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza pour the bubbling delight into the glasses of everykirin present, and a pleasant chatter broke out around the table. He thought back to that night many months ago where he promised victory to the kirin in this room, and now, surrounded by the heads of the powerful corporations that had made it possible, they finally had a chance to celebrate at a lavish feast. After wartime rationing, it felt good to finally break open some bottles of fine Aquileian champagne, and he knew he wasn't the only one to think so. Even Silver Silks' happy tittering marked a stark contrast from the Sycee heiress' often haughty demeanor, and her mood was matched by the rest of the elite gathered around her.\n\nAs the servants brought out platter after platter of fine food, Cypress Snow stood up at Fickle's right and raised his glass in his magic. "It's been a long struggle for all of us, but it delights me to see that all our efforts were not in vain. The NAKP has triumphed over the rotten mockery of a dying Realm, and now it is up to us, the victors, to set it right. While the Matriarch Superior and the Vermilion Dynasty remain indisputable and, indeed, a stabilizing factor for the Realm as a whole, we have a chance to mold the future into one of our own making.\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward failed for many reasons," Cypress continued, and the kirin gathered gave him their rapt attention. "The national bureaucracy was incompetent, for one. One needs to look no farther than the former premier's failed efforts to coordinate such an ambitious undertaking. But perhaps the simplest answer is that this land is full of backwards peasants and optimistic idealists who were never meant to hold the levers of power. That right belongs to the kirin who have the means and knowledge to wield them. To us. And may we create a better future than the one we inherited from the Realm."\n\nHe was met with applause, and with one last nod, Cypress sat down.

"And I believe he put it simply and eloquently, as he always does. The failures of the Realm stemmed from its corrupt, rotten, and homegrown systems. To put it another way, the failure of the Realm was a Kirian problem, but it is not a kirin problem. All of us have our roots in the Diaspora. We were born and raised in Equus and Griffonia, not in Kiria. We are all products of a modern era, one shaped by the pressures and incentives of the industrial revolution. We are not Kirian, but we are kirin, and it will take a modern breed of kirin to create a modern Kiria."\n\nCurrent raised his glass, and the rest of the kirin seated around the banquet table all did the same. "We have everything we need to remake the Realm. We have the knowledge, the acumen, and most importantly, the will to turn this Realm into something else. When I asked for your support long ago, I promised you would be rewarded. Now you will be. I won't ramble on about the terms and conditions, because I know you already have seen them. Today's decree shifts the responsibilities of governance and the levers of power away from the incompetents and into your hooves.

kirin_council.55.d:0 "For Dr. Ardent Bloom, corporate charters were like something akin to the miracle of life. One simple document, once drafted, scrutinized, rewritten, vetted, and submitted, could bring to life a titan of economic potential, birthing a new corporation from nothing but scattered ideas and empty pockets waiting to be filled. Whatever it would accomplish, whatever markets it would shake up, it all started in the drafting room where it was nothing more than an idea in the minds of ambitious creatures.\n\nUnfortunately, when politics barged its way into the drafting room, things tended to get messy. Before Ardent was the initial draft of the charter for the Corporation of Kiria, a monstrous entity in its own right that represented the interests of the Empire in a business setting akin to the vassal-corporations of the Vermilion Dynasty. While the technical details had been filled out, such as the number of shares that would comprise the corporation, and how those would be distributed, the broad strokes of the charter had remained annoyingly blank, and that was all due to the ever-meddlesome politics.\n\nThe original purpose of the Corporation was a simple one: it would serve as the governing body of the territories and protectorates outside of the Empire, providing Vermilion with a direct interface with its far-flung possessions beyond the borders of the Realm. But now there was a fight over whether it should have rights in the Realm proper. On one side was the NAKP, who argued that it would be an effective tool to allow the government to resolve disputes at home by giving it a seat at the bargaining side of business. On the other were the VasCorps, leery of the NAKP gaining too much influence and pushing into their spheres of influence like a market competitor, not a governing body. It was an ugly fight, and growing uglier by the day, and both sides had begun to tug on Ardent's ear to sway the matter one way or the other.\n\nArdent sighed and rubbed his temples. Much like the miracle of life, the miracle of business was often just as messy."

kirin_council.56.d:0 "Silver Silks yawned and idly twirled her cigarette holder in her magic, watching the smoke trail from the end as some NAKP peon named Simple Survey or something like that prattled off on something about voting rights. Silver genuinely wished she was anywhere but here; the stallion speaking had a terribly grating voice, and this meeting was the type of thing she would usually delegate somekirin else to attend in her place. But when the NAKP had summoned representatives from all the corporations to attend to discuss the matter, Silver's advisor had suggested that she attend the meeting in person in case it was important. But all Simple Survey had done was make some kind of half-baked lesson in the values of democracy and suffrage in the Empire, and Silver was bored. She'd need to find a new advisor after she got home and fired the old one for suggesting she attend this boring meeting.\n\n"And now, to the meat of the matter," Survey said, and Silver sighed in relief and pointed her ears up to at least take in the crux of the matter that she'd wasted her day on. "The NAKP values democracy, of course. When done correctly, and under the guidance of a benevolent state apparatus, the private sector, and the mature leadership of the national Party, democracy facilitates and enshrines the principles conductive to commercial-esque competition in a free marketplace of ideas, engendering an incentive for political organizations to provide the best value service to stakeholder-electors. Thusly, the Party, in its wisdom, and to achieve this vision of a harmonic and stable democratic system of governance, will implement limited electoral reforms to allow stakeholders from all sections of society to determine Kiria's political direction.\n\n"How will we accomplish this?" Survey continued, and  a slide projector clicked over to a set of bullet points. "The executive council has come up with two proposals, which we will vote on. The first is an electoral system wherein propertied individuals and entities will be able to cast votes proportional to the total value of their assets. This will encompass corporations, landowners, and those other propertied stakeholders in society. There is also an alternative: the so-called "suffragette lottery" model, wherein kirin purchase "franchise shares". There is a lottery that determines which 30% of the shares will become actual votes. Don't be put off by the utter radicalness of this proposal, good friends; of course, corporations can purchase franchise shares en masse, but the marginal element of randomness is supposed to act as an equalizer."\n\n"Good, good, can we get on with it, though?" Silver asked, finally exhausted enough by the meeting to raise her voice and force a vote. The entire ordeal mattered little to her; as the wealthiest kirin in the Realm, she knew her voice was the loudest no matter how the NAKP pitched its sham democracy."

Chenar looked like so many other villages she'd seen throughout the civil war; a vacuous ruin filled with crumbling and destroyed buildings and stripped of almost the entire adult population. Countless kirin had been forcibly sent off to war, and most never returned. All that remained behind were the elderly who tried to tend burnt and fallow fields, and those too young to fight.\n\n"It's a village full of foals," the NAKP stallion said behind Black Lotus. "Young and impressionable. Once the rural pacification program makes its way here, we'll make plenty of loyal peasants to support the regime in the future."\n\n"Must you state the obvious so openly and carelessly?" Black Lotus said with a roll of her indigo eyes. She paused in the middle of the street for a moment as a trio of foals chasing a ball scampered by, and then continued onwards. "Chenar is a hive of our enemies. Bandits prey on the town, and so too do the Rising Fire guerillas. They openly attack our convoys, and they draw new recruits and supplies from the surrounding countryside. It's a situation that has to be dealt with before we could expect any sort of return for our investments."\n\n"If this is a guerilla hub, then we need to smash it apart," the NAKP soldier said. "You've done plenty slash and burn missions, right, Officer Lotus? This should be old hat to you."\n\n"Killings and reprisals only work when there is somekirin left to kill or punish," Lotus said with a roll of her eyes. "There's barely anykirin left in Chenar as is. Just the young and the old. Sure, some killings would serve as a good warning to nearby towns not to side with our enemies, but perhaps a different approach would work best." Her eyes lingered on the foals for a moment, and the corners of her muzzle turned down in a thoughtful frown. "If we focus on a different approach and invest in the town, pouring money into reeducating these simpletons, then our investment might return to us many times over.

Her secretary nodded and shut the door behind him as he left, and Leaves straightened her dress and leaned back in her chair with a sigh. She could only hope that her meeting with this 'special agent' would liven up her day a little. Fridays were slow as could be, and her mind was already wandering to meeting up with her marefriends after work and seeing if they could attract the gazes of any stallions at the teahouse. Hopefully that scale polish she'd gotten earlier in the week would pay off...\n\nHer dreams seemed to be surprisingly answered when a stallion in his mid-thirties stepped into her office. His mane was wild and unkempt and the coarse hairs lining his muzzle gave him a rugged look. He wore an Iron Chrysanthemum uniform that had obviously seen plenty of use out in the west, but he'd modified it with patches and charms of jade and bone. And when he shut the door behind him, his magic removed a worn-out hat from atop his head and he gave her a respectful nod. "Ma'am."\n\n"Oh, hello," Fall purred, sitting up straighter for a moment only to lean on her desk and smile wide. "Please come in, sit down. I'd like to hear all about this report of yours... and any of your adventures out in the wild, wild west, if you'd care to share." She'd always been fascinated with tales of the west, of the rugged protectors of Greater Providence bringing the rule of law to the lawless and looking ravishing while doing so...\n\n"I'm just here to share what we've learned, ma'am," the stallion said. He dropped a folder full of files on her desk with a glow of his horn. "It's more or less what the department was expecting. The western regional authorities require more funding and resources to finish up the consolidation of the west. That means more kirin and more money."\n\nThat soured the mood, and Fall stuck her tongue out in disgust. "The Bureau for ReConstruction and Integration is on a tight enough budget as is," she said. "We can't afford to waste any where it won't do us much good." She crossed her forelegs and thought for a minute, but ultimately decided to save those thoughts for Monday. It was almost time for her weekend to start, anyway, and she knew exactly how she wanted to start it. "Say, are the rest of your companions as adventurous as you are, soldier? Maybe together we can discuss this further, find a solution. Over tea tonight, perhaps?""

kirin_council.59.t:0 "Reinvesting Dividends"
kirin_council.59.d:0 "As Fickle Current watched kirin filter into the Morning Secretariat, he felt, for the first time, at ease to be inside its grand halls. During the Grand Gallop Onward, these walls were filled with bickering rabble, seditious communists, and superstitious mystics, all trying to pull the Realm into pieces with their poorly-conceived ideas. Now, however, a finer breed of kirin found their seats inside the building. Corporate-vassal executives, captains of industry, NAKP grandees, and kirin of wealth and fame took the places of idealistic reformers and unwashed peasants. For the prosperity of the Realm, there was no better upgrade.\n\nOnce everykirin had taken their seats, and after a short introduction by a party official, Current took to the stand and spread out his papers across the rostrum. "Over the past several weeks, the NAKP has undertaken a grand cataloging of the Realm's natural resources and industry. A Grand Survey, if you will. And I am pleased to report that it has been a great success. As Chairkirin and Imperial Premier, I speak on behalf of the Association in reaffirming the indisputable fact that the Vermilion Dynasty, headed by the Matriarch Superior, remains the sole owner in perpetuity of all land in the Empire. In her wisdom, the Matriarch has seen fit to bestow unto her loyal vassal corporations the use of the land in her realm, for the common prosperity of the nation and its people. It is only fair that the Dynasty demands the most minor of financial recompense for its generosity."\n\nAs Current expected, even the tiniest notion or hint of taxation stirred discontented murmurs among the gathered kirin, and he moved to nip their discontent in the bud. "Let me pose a question to you all: what do you do with dividends from your investments? Do you take the money and pocket it? Or do you reinvest those dividends into your assets, and reap greater rewards during the next harvest? I am not proposing taxation, the government leeching off of the hard work of the productive members of society. Rather, I am proposing a mutual reinvestment of our hard work into greater yields in the future. And to do this, I have two proposals that we, as shareholders in the government, will vote on today. The first is an obligation of the vassals to invest in the social development of their own lands through education and social programs for the populace. The second is through an agreement to earmark a certain percentage of each vassal's revenue for the development of industry and infrastructure. I think you all will agree that either proposal will be a great boon for the Realm in the long run.""

kirin_council.60.d:0 ""With all due respect, ma'am, trains are not the future of our doctrine. Heavy cargo planes and highways that cut across the Realm are a far more flexible option than static rail lines."\n\n"With all due respect, sir, you can kiss my scales." The lieutenant crossed her forelegs and leered back at the stallion sitting across from her. "Nothing moves tonnage as reliably or efficiently as trains. Plus, you can slap some armor and some heavy howitzers on one and you've got an unstoppable monster on rails. I'd like to see your fancy transport planes do that."\n\nDr. Ardent Bloom sighed and rubbed the scales on his nose as the bickering continued around him. It was supposed to be a fairly simple meeting to discuss the modernization of the army, but the meeting had been derailed by debate over the future of supply, logistics, and doctrine. Two camps had clearly developed in the debate, and it was only growing nastier. On one side, a more traditional faction had emerged around the importance of moving things by rail, championing the simplicity, efficiency, and heavy tonnage that rail supported. Those would be key factors in maintaining control over territories, whether they be under occupation or centrally governed by the Realm. On the other, more innovative minds pushed for new ideas like rapid transport and flexibility using heavy cargo planes and highways that allowed material to be quickly repositioned anywhere in the Realm, not just at rail hubs and supply depots. Whichever side won would shape the future of Kiria's doctrine of war.\n\nUnfortunately, the talks were only growing more combative, and the last thing Ardent wanted was to be in the middle of a room full of combat-trained kirin going nirik as tempers flared. Thankfully, he was the chief economist for the NAKP, and he would be the one bringing the decision forward through the party's budget committee. As such, he had the final say on the matter."

kirin_council.61.d:0 ""Come on, Willow! The news is going to break soon, we can't wait any longer!"\n\nDappled Willow bit her lip as she tried to keep up with her friend as he slipped through the bustling crowd at the Fragrance Stock Exchange. The trading floor was packed with kirin and filled with shouts and raised hooves, all roaring beneath the hammering TICK TICK TICK of the ticker tapes spitting out an ever-changing list of price shares and call orders. It was all so overwhelming, but Fireflash had insisted that it would all be worth it.\n\nThrough some miracle, Willow managed to follow Fireflash through the crushing crowds to where dozens, if not hundreds, of kirin in suits and dresses all gathered together, shouting orders and signing papers while the ticker tapes continued their relentless ticking. There was a reason behind the madness: news had broken late last night that the wartime assets and industry of the Vermilion Dynasty would be consolidated under the newly-created Subsidiary Syndicate, with the Dynasty holding a quarter share and the NAKP holding one to match it. The remaining 50% of the shares would go to an undisclosed buyer, but everykirin in Fragrance knew it would either go to Sycee, Sorghum, or the AKAG as the big three VasCorps in the Realm. One of those corporations would get to control the Syndicate as its newest subsidiary, and the boost to its share price was expected to be astronomical. A mad speculation rush descended on the stock exchange, and Willow, whose father had been a top accountant with the Wingluck Consortium but who had never personally invested in the markets, felt overwhelmed.\n\n"One hundred shares from Sorghum!" Fireflash shouted as he forced his way to the front of the line. "Industry is where it's at!"\n\n"You'd do better putting that money on AKAG!" the kirin next to him shouted. "A homegrown automobile industry has no limit on potential!"\n\nWillow felt the blood drain from her face as the loudspeakers crackled to life in the stock exchange, and the feeding frenzy only grew more intense as the moment of truth drew nearer. "A-A hundred from Sycee!" she shouted, throwing down two months' worth of pay on the counter in front of her. The trader across from her swept away her money and produced a sheet of paper in short order, which she signed with wavering magic. And just as he took the paper away from her and she officially secured her shares, Willow strained her panicked ears to hear who won the bid for the Syndicate through the noise of the trading floor:"
kirin_council.61.a:0 "Sorghum shall utilize the Syndicate as an industrial subsidiary!"

kirin_council.62.d:0 ""Another drink, Major? There's still plenty of wine left!"\n\nScarlet Sunflower laughed and made a show of rolling her eyes as she accepted the offered glass of alcohol from the kirin who approached her. "Oh, stop it, Zen. I'm not a major yet. Not until my first day on the job." She took a sip of the wine and hummed, her eyes wandering over the kirin gathered for her going-away party, happily chatting, eating, and drinking while music played and the lights of Fragrance's harbor dotted the bay, providing a pleasant backdrop from the building's thirtieth floor. It was all so thoughtful of her colleagues, and she was determined to enjoy every last minute of it.\n\n"From regional director in Sorghum's Fragrance headquarters to major in the Army Assets Administration," Zen remarked with a playful shake of his head. "Everykirin in the building was bidding for that job, I think. I know I certainly passed my resume along." But he smiled and gave Scarlet a clap on the shoulder. "I can't think of anykirin more deserving, though. I've heard the AAA runs them rough over there, but if it's anything like the tight ship you sailed for us, I bet you'll do great. Just try not to forget about us when you're gone!"\n\n"Oh, you know I'd never do that," Scarlet assured him, and she took another sip of her wine, feeling the pleasant burn of alcohol settling in her gut. But truth be told, she couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed at her impending career change, even if she had every reason to be proud. Countless kirin like her had applied to join the Imperial Kirian Army's upper management and feed themselves into the gears of that all-powerful machine; very few were ever accepted. Those that were found themselves flush with prestige and influence on par with the old banners that once ruled the military, but were increasingly pushed to the sides as the Realm's old military modernized under the NAKP's efforts. Scarlet knew she would be pushed harder than she ever had been before, and she would probably make a lot of enemies in the process. But it was a position that rewarded ambitious kirin, and Scarlet knew she certainly was one of those."

kirin_council.63.d:0 "Firebolt rubbed shoulders with her husband as the pair walked along Fragrance's wharves on a hot day. Perhaps it was a little too hot; the metal scales embedded into Firebolt's nose felt like they were burning under the sun, and she had to pause for a moment to rub at them in frustration. It was the little things like that that reminded her of the war more than anything else, and how the bullet she took to the face would have killed her if it'd been a little bit further to either side.\n\nHer husband stopped and stood in front of her, casting his shadow over her face to give her a slight reprieve from the sun, if only for a moment. "We're almost there," he assured her, and he gave her a peck on the cheek. "We can ask Malt for some ice to cool it down."\n\n"I should have gone for ceramic scales, not metal," Firebolt groused, but she kissed her husband back and resumed walking. "Come on, we're late enough as is, Teak. Signal's probably started the party without us."\n\nTeak nodded, and the two continued along the way, watching as the crowd of civilians subconsciously parted for the couple as they strode with military bearing. It wasn't long before they made it to their destination, a small bar named Lookout's Point, and stepped inside. Subdued music filled the background as a few dozen kirin of clean military dress and atmosphere talked with each other and shared drinks, and the two went right to the bar where a group of kirin crowded around one particular specimen wearing his dress blues, complete with medal hanging from the breast pocket. "Congratulations, Signal!" Teak shouted, and the couple parted the crowd to shake hooves with the kirin in question. "I bet the NAKP's happy to have one of their finest soldiers in the party!"\n\n"Teak! Firebolt!" Signal exclaimed, raising his drink in his magic. "So great to see you! The ceremony was fun and all, but now the party's really getting started! Hey, Malt, get them some beers, will you?"\n\nSignal and Teak fell into easy conversation, and Firebolt exchanged courteous greetings with the kirin around them, though her mood dampened somewhat when she saw the pins of the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum on their lapels. She and Teak and Signal were soldiers who had earned their worth to the NAKP; the kirin of the Iron Chrysanthemum bought their positions with money rather than blood. Still, she stopped herself from bringing it up. It wouldn't do to ruin Signal's celebration by butting heads with his new party mates, would it?"

kirin_council.64.d:0 ""Ready to begin, sir."\n\n"Excellent." Commander Ficus Ginseng of the Sixth Special Rear Operations Squadron of Civil Defense gathered up his notes and nodded to his secretary as she readied the typewriter to receive his dictated dispatch. "To Lieutenant Commander Ginseng Varnish, 3rd Special Naval Squadron; Sister, by now your ships should be within sight of Sunflower and the hive of rebels infesting the area. I have not been able to share details of the operation with you until now for fear of rebels catching wind and them slipping our net, but now it will be too late for them to act. As I'm sure you are aware, the guerillas around Sunflower are the remnants of the Rising Fire, who rule the town with an iron hoof and demand tribute from the peasants living there in the form of food and fodder for their forces. Informants and loyalists to the Empire suffer under summary executions and collective punishment on their neighbors and families. In short, these are vermin that must be stamped right out, and such is your directive.\n\n"Reference Stratagem Nine according to the Civil Defense Counter-Insurgency Manual," Ficus continued, pulling his summary of the stratagem to the top of his notes. "This infestation is to be treated as a case of parasitism that we must spare no effort in rooting out. The bandits derive their sustenance from the peasants of the countryside they infest. They do not produce their own supplies; these they steal or receive in contributions from the local populace. Additionally, we have seen reports that they hide amongst the peasantry in plainclothes, and they receive additional assistance from beyond their area of operations. To that effect, upon arrival, you shall cordon off an area of twenty miles radius from the center of town and prevent the crossings of any creatures past this cordon. Once contained, you will destroy the sources of the parasite's existence. Torch any and all arable land within the area, contaminate wells as you see fit, and raze any places of industry or infrastructure you find. Any kirin suspected of providing aid to the bandits must be rounded up and executed, and villages that do not cooperate shall be razed to the ground. Remember that we are fighting a parasite, and to kill it, the host must temporarily suffer by necessity. Fevers are unpleasant, but at the end of the day, the host lives, and the virus dies."\n\nSatisfied, Ficus gave one last nod to his secretary. "I shall leave the implementation of the details to you, sister. Act accordingly, and Concord willing, we may be able to share stories over the New Year celebrations.""

'PROCURATE OF RHAPSODY PERISHES IN TRAGIC PLANE CRASH' it shouted, alongside an arrangement of portraits of the Procurate's late members. But though the news was a tragic blow to the pride of not only the city of Rhapsody, but the entirety of the Way of Fire, there was not a wet eye between the three pairs in the boardroom.\n\n"A tragedy," Fickle Current remarked as he glanced at the newspaper, but after a moment, he swept it aside with his magic. "A Marksist-Stallionist anarchist finds her way into Rhapsody's airport and the next thing you know, a routine flight from Rhapsody to Fragrance crashes into the sea."\n\n"A pity," Cypress Snow agreed, though the news didn't seem to bother him all that much. "They will be missed. They deserve nothing less than a state funeral and a week of national mourning. I assume we've already been in contact with their successors?"\n\nHis eyes slid over to the third kirin, and Dr. Ardent Bloom nodded. "Their successors have proven much more agreeable than the old lot toward our proposal to integrate the Procurate into the Empire's bureaucracy," he informed them. "And with their agreement, the shares of the Rhapsody Arsenal that the old Procurate once controlled have been generously transferred to the NAKP. Bringing the Arsenal into line with the rest of the VasCorps will help us present a more unified front for the nation, and finally quash those niggling whispers of rebellion coming from their board."\n\n"Excellent." With that, Fickle stood up, and his two companions did the same. "It's important that that matter is finally put to rest.

Yet another twelve hour day trying to play middlemare between five different departments that refused to communicate to each other except through her. But she needed the overtime, so she couldn't complain too much. Especially since, as a middle manager in Sycee's exports department, she actually qualified for overtime pay, unlike most of the kirin under her. It wasn't much, but the time-and-a-quarter pay was very much appreciated, especially with her mother's hip surgery coming up... and doubly so when Sycee's insurance didn't cover 'pre-existing conditions developed before the NAKP's assumption of state affairs'.\n\nMistletoe trudged off down the road, thinking only of the homemade soup her mother would have stewing on the stove for her when she got back. She was fortunate, she knew, as she watched crowds of kirin gathered at dingy roadside inns and gambling dens, burning away what little pittance of pay they had left over once Sycee took back its cuts for corporate lodging and the groceries they bought at the company store. They were the kirin who didn't have the drive or the brains to devote themselves to higher learning and becoming something more useful than laborers or pen-pushers for the trading houses, and as such, they would never rise above their station. They didn't have the drive to succeed, and as such, they would only be compensated for what they were worth. But Mistletoe knew she was worth more, and she pushed herself to prove it to Sycee. Every day, she busted her scales putting in extra hours for the company, and she knew promotions would be coming soon. The pay raise would be very much appreciated, especially while her mother recovered from surgery, and the higher pay grade meant they would qualify for larger housing accommodations. Maybe she and her mother could have separate bedrooms!\n\nA familiar face waved at her from the other street corner, and Mistletoe had to suppress a frown as she waved back. Kudzu worked in her department alongside her, and she knew he was a competitor for the promotion in her department. He was always kissing their supervisor's scales and giving her compliments on every little thing she did or wore, while Mistletoe was too busy busting her flank to make small talk. He was a competitor, and a threat to her future. But then an idea hit her, and a smile broke out on her muzzle. Next time Kudzu had his morning coffee, she'd secure her promotion."

Vermilion had finally entered a new age with the destruction of the last cell of Autumnal loyalists hiding out in the Vermilion Basin, and nowhere was that more obvious than in the buildings of steel and concrete rising above the ancient wooden and stone buildings. The new age of the NAKP had finally enforced its dominance over the old ways, and though Vermilion still felt like a city under occupation, the lifting of martial law before the parade made it obvious that the former capital of the Realm and the Matriarch Superior's centuries-old seat of power was starting to join the rest of the country in its march into the future. With one hoof in yesteryear and one in tomorrow, Vermilion was a city that straddled two great periods of kirin history, providing a bridge between the old and the new.

The little quip earned polite chuckles from the rest of the kirin, and Ardent nodded at the mare standing at the front of the room by a projector screen. "Please, begin. The board is very excited to hear what you have to say."\n\n"Thank you, doctor," the mare said, and her magic seized the projector switch and clicked onto a picture of idyllic rice terraces nestled in a pristine countryside. "Fillies and gentlecolts of the board, we spend our days working hard for our enterprises and doing the best we can to keep a leg up on our competitors. But successful work is hard work, taxing work, and kirin weren't meant to toil in offices forever. So why not treat yourself to a change of pace?

"You're the Chief Administrator of the Exclusive Naval Economic Zone of South Kiria, but the rest of the NAKP wasn't going to take you seriously if you showed up in that ridiculous garb of yours. You can take it off when we get to your ship."\n\n"I'm not waiting until I get to the ship," Roaring Fire muttered, and Fickle Current flinched at the sound of tearing fabric. He looked back over his shoulder to see the pirate queen stripped naked, and she tossed the ruined fabric into the lapping waters of the harbor. "Much better," she said with a happy lilt, and when she saw Current's fluster, she gave her flanks a suggestive shake. "What's that thing about pirates and booty...?"\n\nFickle pointedly turned away and continued walking, refusing to entertain the seaborne marauder's antics. "You're free to engage in whatever shenanigans you want when you're on your ship and out of my mane," he said. "As leader of the ENEZ, it's your duty to patrol the sea lanes along the coast of Kiria, collect shipping taxes and harbor fees, and project our naval power out into our waters. And if the state happens to need the shipping traffic of unfriendly powers disrupted or a statement made on some unfortunate coastal town, then I'm sure you'll find a way to do so discreetly. The line between pirate and sailor is oh-so-blurry in the fog of war."\n\n"I'll need ships," Roaring Fire said, cantering to catch up to Current after her little display. "I can't help but feel like my crew hasn't had a fair seat at the table after all we did in your little war."\n\n"You'll have your ships. Starting with that one." With that, Fickle Current gestured to a brand new cruiser docked in Hyacinth's harbor, its bridge glistening in the morning light. Sleek and modern, it was enough to leave the usually quick-witted and foul-mouthed Roaring Fire with her jaw agape. "She was launched under a rather boring service number. I'll leave the name up to you. Consider it the NAKP's first investment in the ENEZ. I have no doubt that with it, you'll have the funds in no time to grow your fleet."\n\nHe gave Roaring Fire a satisfied look, and after a few seconds, the pirate queen's astonished expression turned into one of giddy joy."

kirin_council.70.t:0 "Birthday Planning"
kirin_council.70.d:0 "It was the Matriarch's birthday, but it was not a happy one.\n\nThat much was obvious to Fickle Current as he stood off to the side of the Vermilion Throne and watched countless delegations from all across the Realm bring gifts and tribute to the Matriarch Superior. From wealthy VasCorp CEOs making personal visits to maintain the farce that they owed allegiance to Rain Shine and not the other way around, to lowly commoners screened beforehoof by the NAKP to show the love all kirin held for their Matriarch, the carefully choreographed song and dance played out before Rain Shine's sullen eyes and forced smile. It wasn't hard for Fickle to understand why Rain Shine wasn't happy; why would she be, when she was forced to serve as the NAKP's puppet to maintain its grasp on the Realm as it took power out of her hooves, away from Concord, and into the pockets of millionaires? But it was a charade that she maintained, if only to help keep the Realm stable. Current held no doubts that Rain Shine disapproved of everything he and his friends had done to Kiria, but she played her part to stop her kirin from killing each other. She was too good of a kirin, if too naive, to think of ending the lie for some greater good that lay on the other side of a river of blood.\n\nStill, between the gifts and the feast earlier that evening, which had consisted of a grandiose spread of traditional Kirian dishes and exotic fare from Equus, Griffonia, and other parts of Zebrica, Current found the gears in his head turning. He recalled several prominent party members and board executives of the various VasCorps talking with lust over the wealth and resources of the Hindian deer to the north even as they sampled small platters of its food. Talk of aggression against Hindia was common in parlor meetings but nearly absent in the boardroom, as it was understood that war with their populous northern neighbor could be catastrophic to the profit margins of the VasCorps. But Current wondered if there was merit to that talk or merely an abundance of caution. He knew that if he pushed the right kirin and justified it, he could have the Realm at war with Hindia in no time.\n\nBesides, he had neglected to give Rain Shine a birthday gift this year. He'd have to give her a special one next year."

The tall kirin looked markedly uncomfortable, the smile on her muzzle as fake and forced as the pretext for the war in the first place, but she painfully made her way into the pavilion regardless.\n\nInside, she found herself face to face with Fickle Current and a looted throne, and as she took her seat to the fanfare of trumpets, Current lifted a Hindian crown off of its cushion and rested it upon her head.

Fine wines, luxurious foods from across the world and performances by the greatest musicians money could hire had all been employed as a show of gratitude. Gratitude, and also to hopefully soften up the Changeling that was currerntly making himself comfortable in the seat across from Fickle Current.\n\n""It's been quite the lovely reception, if I didn't know better I'd say you were trying to butter me up," Finicus Vesali gave Fickle Current a knowing smile. "However, I still believe we have the matter of your payment plan to discuss."\n\n"Of course." Fickle Current smiled back, though he felt a small chill going down his spine. He had seen the estimates, and though desperate times had called for desperate measures, this was one debt he was not looking forward to squaring. "Some more wine while we discuss it?"\n\n"No thank you, and from one businesscreature to another, let's just get this band-aid ripped off without dragging it out, shall we?" Finicus's smile had turned vicious now. "The interest rate for the loan you took was set at 150%, quite the reasonable price considering the high risks of the investment I must say. Still, I am not wholly unreasonable, and though my queen is expecting the money back expeditiously, I do have some leeway.

kirin_council.721.d:0 "Everything was falling apart. Even if the suits could not see it, Colonel Rapid Gust could: this was was not ending in any way other than defeat. His forces had spent the last few days more in hiding than actually fighting, as the topic was more about how to get the hay out of here. Commandeering a boat was a desperate move, but he couldn't think of anything else beyond just surrender, and he wasn't quite that desperate to throw himself at the mercy of their approaching foes yet.\n\nOr at least he hadn't been until now. Hiding in the outskirts of Fragrance harbour, he stared in disbelief at the sight of hundreds, indeed thousands, of armed changelings offloading from seemingly every ship in the harbour, from fishing junks to passenger liners to cargo steamers. Had a Changeling invasion force been hidden aboard ships in Fragrance harbour all along, right under the NAKP's noses? They were already moving into the city, and any hopes that they were there as reinforcements withered quickly as he saw scores of unarmed kirin in NAKP uniforms being corralled onto barges under the watchful gaze of changeling guards.\n\nThis was what the suits got for borrowing money from the changelings, wasn't it? The bugs were here to secure their collateral, and that meant Fragrance... He looked to his exhausted soldiers, in no condition to even think about trying to shoot their way out. They would have to surrender... damn it all."

kirin_council.73.d_1:0 ""They pledged away their own home, gave away a city of Kiria, for money. And you expect us to honor that debt?" Autumn Blaze could not believe her ears, and stared in disbelief at the changeling in front of her. What he had told her left her sick to her stomach. \n\n"To an extent," Finicus Vesali clarified with a smile. "We are not wholly unreasonable and we are more than open to compensating you. Still, for the sake of Kiria's future relationship with the Main Hives Industries, I hope you can see that we poured a lot of money into Kiria, money that has benefitted Fragrance. All we wish is for is the oppportunity to recoup our losses, and the city centre of Fragrance will help us do this."\n\n"Oh, yes, that does indeed sound reasonable, just steal a city and ask the creatures you steal it from to not be rude. Of course," Autumn Blaze felt the disbelief slowly turn to anger. She had to stop herself and take a couple of deep breaths.\n\n"We are not going to budge on this issue I'm afraid, and surely Kiria has suffered enough without starting a conflict that will lead it into war with the Changeling Hives." Finicus's smile left his face, making it clear just how serious he was.\n\n"Let me offer you an honorable way out, however. Fragrance is one city, of little import to the whole of Kiria, and in return for avoiding another bloody war, MHI will provide you ample industrial and technological aid in return, providing Kiria with peace and progress. If you would choose war instead, that will be on you. I just ask you consider what Kiria truly needs right now.""
kirin_council.73.d_2:0 ""You are asking Kiria to accept foreign aggressors stealing an entire city, all because a pack of greedy merchants decided to pawn away their homeland for money. Why shouldn't we just attack and kick you back into the sea?" Dayspring Rose was nauseated by not the presumptious changeling in front of her but also the depths of the NAKP's amorality.\n\n"The city is quite well fortified, and the price you would pay for it is great." Finicus Vesali nodded his head to her. "Also, Fragrance is not a city that is very welcoming to the Rising Fire, ma'am. It resents the Silence for what it cost it, and if you seize it, all you will have is a city that loathes you and which would rise up in revolt before long."\n\n"Do you believe we are not willing to do whatever it takes to save our homeland?" Dayspring Rose asked him lowly, Finicus giving her a small smile.\n\"I am not so derogatory to suggest they would win such a fight, but there will be very little left of the city when you do put them down. Who benefits from that? The Fraternal Republic does not need more conflict, and for your understanding, MHI can provide what it does need; industrial and technological aid. We will keep Fragrance under control, make sure that the loans we gave are repaid, without you even really needing to be involved in the process. In return, you will gain all the aid that we can give you, reconstruction will be sped up, and the Fraternal Republic will not need to deal with another war, nor the rebuilding of a levelled city.""

kirin_council.737.d_1:0 ""You are banking on that Kiria would be unwilling to fight to maintain its territorial integrity." Autumn Blaze pushed back. Whatever words he was wrapping it in, this was an absurd demand. "If we yield, Kiria will become divided. If you yield, you have lost money."\n\n"That is a valid point." Finicus said, acting as though they were talking about food preferences before his face split in another smile, this one more sinister. "I suppose however that the kirin who caused all of this would be of greater import than a city. It just so happens that chairkirin Fickle Current has contacted us about receiving sanctury in Fragrance. In case of a breakout of hostilities, he could slip on a plane and be out of reach before you can set after him. Of course, if a deal is worked out between us, we would of course allow you to enter Fragrance in order to arrest him."\n\n"Selling out your allies, is it?" Autumn Blaze couldn't believe these changelings. Finicus meanwhile shook his head.\n\n"Our debtor, not ally. We were never allied with the NAKP, and we've completed our side of the bargain. Is there not a poetic justice that a kirin like him is captured since he didn't properly review the offer he was given? Besides, I think his capture would be more relevant for future stability than Fragance. What do you say? A toast to peace and future cooperation perhaps?""
kirin_council.737.d_2:0 ""The city can think whatever it pleases, and if it has drunken the NAKP's poison enough that it would rather fight than remain part of Kiria, that's on them" Dayspring Rose pointed out. Whatever words he was wrapping it in, this was an absurd demand. "You stand to lose a bit of money, not a piece of your homeland. I will indulge you enough that you have one chance to make a better offer.\n\n"Very well then, Fickle Current." Finicus retorted. "At the moment, he has sought shelter in Fragrance, and in case of an attack, he'd be able to board a plane and flee out of your reach. He is a greater threat to Kiria than one city, I'd hazard, and if we work out a deal, there's no reason for us to protect a debtor who defauled on his debts. Putting him in front of a jury will do much more for your legitimacy than Fragrance would, especially when he comes with all the technological aid you could ask for without his unpalatable ideology.

kirin_council.747.d:0 ""You have some explanation to do about this Kiria business, Finicus," Queen Chrysalis drawled as she stared the industrialist down. "Will you come clean right away, or will I have to drag it out of you?"\n\n"That won't be necessary, your majesty," Finicus bowed deeply before her. "Main Hives Industries has acquired the city of Fragrance in Kiria on behalf of the Changeling Queendom. The city's erstwhile owners owed us a quite sizeable debt, and when they failed to make due on it, the MHI's forces secured our collateral. We have secured the city and convinced the potential claimants to it to let the matter be, and it has cost the Queendom nothing. The changeling queendom now possesses a colony in Zebrica."\n\n"You went behind my back and seized territory in Kiria, risking a war?" Chrysalis summarised, leaning in towards him. "Do you expect me to be happy about this? And what is this city meant to provide? Tea?"\n\n"A 'war' that would have seen your opponents across the world and recovering from a civil war, your majesty. I won't deny it has been an audacious operation, but as you can see, it has all worked out for the best. As for what it will provide, it is a wealthy trading city and a gateway into Kiria, and the resources it lets us access will provide a steady cash flow. MHI will of course take full responsibility for this operation, both economically and administratively, and I have appointed a talented administrator for the region."\n\n"And anything of interest to the Queendom will be shipped back to Vesalipolis," Chrysalis finished.

"Fragrance is now officially under our protection, and we are in a position to assert control over the city and the Eastern side of the inlet."\n\nThe figure beyond his desk took hold of the folder and perused its contents. This envoy was disguised for reasons that escaped the korpskommandant. Sciaridae knew better than to be fooled by the apparently unremarkable drone before him and didn't ask questions.\n\nThe changeling hummed thoughtly as he read on.\n\n"As for potential candidates for the position of Chief Executive, I've narrowed them down to two choices," Sciaridae continued. "Cypress Snow and Ardent Bloom, both high ranking NAKP members—pages thirteen and fifteen respectively."\n\nWhile his guest flipped to the indicated pages, Sciaridae shifted in his seat. Snow was an academic and professor who was knowledgeable and well recognised among the NAKP base: landowners, industrialists, and the intelligentsia. Meanwhile, Bloom was the NAKP's chief economist before its collapse. Both kirins would have been excellent choices in Sciaridae's eyes.\n\nAfter a minute or so, the envoy glanced up. "Either one will fall in line?" he asked blankly.\n\n"Of course," Sciaridae replied. "Both of them sought refuge at our consulate when the NAKP was defeated. They will gladly follow our instructions, at least in the short run."\n\nNodding, the drone placed the folder on the desk.

kirin_council.76.d:0 "The sounds of earth-churning machinery emblazoned with the Main Hive Industries logo and hundreds of quartets of hooves at work echoed all over the Poplar Heights neighbourhood. Asides from the presence of changeling overseers, armed soldiers, and machinery, the build sites were nothing too out of the ordinary to the outside observer.\n\nBut Summer Smile knew otherwise.\n\nSummer herself was a member of one of the several unions that operated in the area. She and her family had lived in the neighbourhood before her grandparents' were born, and like most others residents, their home was everything. The nearby workshops-turned-factories had provided hard but honest work that was stable and reliable. She had the chips on her hooves to show for it.\n\nIt all changed when the occupiers arrived.\n\nThey first offered paltry compensation for the families of Poplar Heights to vacate elsewhere. Many had, of course, refused and had organised to resist any attempt to move them. The residents had fought before against hired thugs from the factory owners and even armed soldiers with orders from Vermilion. They had every reason to expect another group of high-hooved bandits to limp back home with broken bones.\n\nSummer shuddered as the images of explosions erupting around the ranks of residents and protesting kirins flooded back into her mind. She later learned that the changelings used three field guns and two planes to bombard the erected barricades. Those who didn't immediately flee faced the onslaught of bombs. The many wounded who survived were then confronted by the organised and ruthless changeling soldiery. Poplar Heights burned that night.\n\nNow Summer glared at the kirin collaborators either working on the site or guarding it with the few changeling soldiers. Thankfully she didn't recognise any of the neighbours she knew. It was a small comfort, but she held on to it dearly, for she knew that nobody from her neighbourhood had the strength to stand up, not after the devastation and massacre.\n\nShe looked down upon herself. Summer's coat was matted, dirty, and completely unpresentable. Only the goodwill and kindness of strangers that took in her and her family had kept them alive so far. What was she to do now?"

Preliminary findings suggest additional benefits for the latter, and more will be known once all of the chemical compounds are isolated. No notable diminishing in the mental faculties has been detected besides some difficulties focusing on singular tasks or conversation subjects. No appreciable difference was noted between direct ingestion of mota rubra and drinking the tea-like drink brewed as per kirin tradition.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nThere is a consensus among the team that the ingestion of mota rubra by kirins bears no greater risk than consuming alcohol. There is no reason to uphold the ban for civilian consumption to create consternation from the native kirin populations. Additionally, use by kirin auxiliaries may ensure loyalty towards changeling officers and should be encouraged. Upon complete chemical analysis, it may be possible to synthetically create an easy-to-swallow pill form of mota rubra to be dispensed widely among the kirin soldiery."

To what do I owe the honor?"\n\nFocus stepped into the room and gravitated toward a chair. No sooner had he taken it did the observant kirin awkwardly clear his throat. "Is it such an honor? Chairkirin, in the interest of time, I will state the reason I am here simply and plainly. I am here on behalf of the Artificers' Guild to lodge a formal complaint against the Sycee Trading House and the undue and anti-competitive behavior they have engaged in with the NAKP. The NAKP's favoritism towards Sycee has allowed the Trading Houses to benefit from roughly double the economic and business opportunities as the Artificers' Guild despite the fact that we pay the same in corporate tithes to the party. The Guild gives as much to the Realm's economy and defense as Sycee does yet we reap half the rewards. This is hardly equitable. As such, the Guild humbly requests that the Matriarchate's Government equalizes the balance of power between themselves and the Trading House so that the free market remains free and is not monopolized by Sycee." His statement finished, Focus finished with an abrupt nod. "I trust I have made my point clear?"\n\nThe statement had caught Current off guard, but as an experienced negotiator, he managed to keep his face expressionless. "I believe you have," he replied.

All our VasCorps are important members of the Realm and the party values their contributions equally."\n\n"If that were the case I would not be here," Focus said.

Current hated these places, hated the dirt and the noise and the sweat, but unfortunately, the kirin he was meeting with thrived in them.\n\nA VIP section dominated the second floor of the den, with many balconies and platforms overlooking the chaos below. Guards watched over the staircase leading up to it, the pins on their lapels marking them as security for the Sycee Trading House. They let Fickle Current and his bodyguards pass with a nod, and soon the NAKP chairkirin found himself in a backroom with a dozen kirin shouting and cheering around a fan-tan table as the tán kún removed the marbles from the board four at a time. As he approached the table, orange eyes from across it met his, and after taking a long drag on her cigarette holder, Silver Silks stepped away from the table and beckoned for him to follow.\n\n"Thank you for coming, Chairkirin," Silver said once the two of them had taken a private booth at the back of the room. "For the continuity of amiable relations between the party and the Sycee Trading House, it's imperative that we reach a mutually agreeable resolution as soon as possible."\n\n"I would have preferred to have this discussion in my office. The smoke makes it harder to concentrate," Current said, waving the smoke away with a hoof.\n\nThat put an amused smile on Silver Silks' muzzle, and the mare drew from her cigarette holder once more and let it float idly by her head with her magic. "Then I'll keep things short and simple for your sake, Chairkirin. Sycee finds the favoritism the NAKP is showing toward the Artificer's Guild unacceptable. We pay equal tithes yet they are afforded twice the opportunity and twice the profits of the Trading House. This is anti-competitive behavior, and we have already lodged a formal complaint with the party over our disrespectful treatment. To make it even more clear, Fickle, I'll put it this way. If the party does not do right by Sycee, then we will be forced to escalate the matter. And I'd hate to bet against the House if we do.""

But the old mare's arean was not the field of battle; no, hers was the courtroom, her sword her pen, her shield her encyclopedic knowledge of law and procedure. And when she squared off against an opponent before a judge, her arguments would bite hard and drag her unfortunate victim down into the dirt until Sycee's coffers bled it dry under mountains of litigation.\n\nAnd so it was as Madame Silvertael boarded her airship with Sycee's negotiation team en route to [KIS.Capital.GetName]. As the discontent and jockeying between the Trading House and the Artificers' Guild festered, the two VasCorps had taken to litigious thrusts, parries, and ripostes at each other in the Realm's courts. But litigation was expensive, especially between two heavyweight fighters with deep coffers and the willingness to go all-in to box out the competition, and so Madame Silvertael, once a renowned and notoriously successful lawyer in Skyfall before returning to Kiria, had decided to personally involve herself in the fight. By throwing her hat into the ring, Sycee's chairmare hoped to deliver a final, crushing blow to the Artificers' Guild.\n\nAs she addressed a crowd of gathered reporters before stepping onto her airship, the old mare assured them that it was her goal to find a resolution that pleases everykirin, as the ongoing feud benefitted nokirin. And, with a smile, she hinted that she'd already found an angle of attack that would deliver a fatal blow to the Guild's lawsuits and prove Sycee was in the right the entire time."

The Guild immediately responded that such heinous accusations are false and announced it would commence libel proceedings against Sycee. Silver Silks, in turn, announced that the Trading House would reallocate its legal funding toward an increase in the budget of its security assets, a response mirrored by the Artificers' Guild."

The sun had yet to rise, and wouldn't for several more hours, but the developing situation in the Empire was grave enough that it required an immediate meeting despite the early hour of the morning.\n\nAs Current listened to the captain's report, his eyes grew darker, his frown sharper, even as the other kirin present muttered in alarm or disquiet. The situation over the dispute between the Sycee Trading House and the Artificers' Guild was growing and escalating at an alarming rate. The two VasCorps had begun using their security forces to interdict and turn back convoys of goods and supplies belonging to their rival, and several reports of violent clashes between the two sides had already been reported and verified by the NAKP's investigative apparatus. On top of that, the Guild Technical College on the outskirts of Massicot was attacked by guerillas flying the banner of the Cascading Sparks, the flag of the rebellious western provinces, with students and faculty butchered and their labs and libraries burned to the ground; the Guild accused Sycee of staging the attack, but Sycee denied any involvement. Then there was the chilling story of a Sycee showroom raided by a paramilitary force wielding magitech rifles and wearing the patches of the defunct Realm and Harmony Party, with the top executives of several Sycee subsidiaries who were there on a meeting murdered in the chaos; Sycee accused the Guild of staging the attack, but the Guild denied any involvement. It appeared the two companies were engaging in espionage and banditry using the symbols of the Empire's enemies for plausible deniability.\n\nThe news was proving devastating to the economy, with stocks tumbling and the NAKP having to reach deep into its coffers to stabilize the markets. On top of that, the Marksist-Stallionist Workers' Party of Kiria was growing in size and staging strikes and walkouts all across Greater Providence, and the NAKP found itself stretched thin to stop those subversive activities. But even then, it was clear that the strikes would hurt Sycee's sweatshops far more than they would the Guild's factories, and it left little wonder as to where such a fringe political group managed to find the funds to organize to such an extent..."

kirin_council.505.d:0 "Cypress Snow was surprised to see the half-emptied bottle of brandy sitting on Chairkirin Current's desk when he entered his study. It wasn't that the NAKP's chairkirin was enjoying a drink that surprised him, but rather the brand. It was fairly cheap stuff, strong but lacking in the flavors and subtleties of finer brands. Looks like the Chairkirin intended to replace tonight's headache with a much stronger one tomorrow morning.\n\nStill, Cypress opened with a friendly jab as he sat down across from Fickle, who stared into the glass he swirled with his magic. "I thought I taught you to drink better than that in Yale," he teased him. Current scoffed lightly, but he didn't return the barb, and Cypress' features grew sterner. "That bad?"\n\n"Never before has the "Vas" part of "VasCorps" felt more fitting than now," Current said with a sigh, and he pushed a dossier over to Cypress. As the elder kirin leafed through it, Current elaborated. "The situation with Sycee and the Guild is deteriorating faster than anykirin would have thought. There's been an alarming increase in mercenary activities and terror attacks in the land those two control, each with enough plausible deniability for the VasCorps to deny any involvement. There was a shootout at the Grand Canterlot Teahouse, for example. My sources claim that Sycee-sponsored operatives attacked and destroyed the Guild's subsidiary. Many kirin went nirik and the whole thing burned down. The whole neighborhood was filled with paper houses that went up in flames too; we're still sifting through the dead."\n\n"I thought I heard something to that effect," Cypress agreed. "And I take it the other VasCorps haven't had much to say?"\n\n"They have not. They're probably negotiating with both sides as we speak. For now we can assume they're loyal, but tomorrow isn't today..." Current sighed and took another drink from his glass, a long and slow one. When he set it down he shook his head. "Maybe they know something we don't. I can't tell. And now I feel like a king sitting on his throne watching his vassals quarrel among each other, wondering how long I can hold my realm together. I think you'll forgive me a stiff drink over a good one in times like these.""

The early hour of the emergency meeting left him rubbing at his eyes as he settled in; he would need a double shot of espresso when this was over just to get himself back up to speed. "Let's hear the bad news."\n\nA mare in a black suit nodded and pulled a sheet of paper out of her briefcase as Fickle and the other kirin of the NAKP's executive council leaned in closer to hear her words. "At midnight last night, the Artificiers' Guild issued an ultimatum to Sycee to cease all aggression and pay reparations in damages for the actions they have undertaken against the Guild's holdings and corporate interests. They claim that Sycee's actions are illegal and contrary to the Imperial Code and the Way of Fire, and a direct challenge to the ultimate authority of the NAKP's rule of Kiria and the divine authority of the Matriarch Superior. Once again, they denied all involvement in the death of Sycee's former chairmare and expressed their desires to return to a more respectful business relationship."\n\nThe mare set the paper down and picked up another one. "Sycee's response was an immediate repudiation of the Guild's ultimatum. Chairmare Silver Silks reiterated her demands that the Artificers' Guild formally apologize for the murder of her aunt and to pay reparations to the Trading Houses in light of their heinous acts of corporate espionage and murder. She stressed that Sycee would be forced to take 'extraordinary action' to recoup its losses at the hooves of the Guild if it did not do so. The Guild immediately rejected Sycee's counter demands, and that's where things stand now. The other VasCorps have begun evacuating their assets and capital from the rival guilds' headquarters in Sycee and Massicot, as they claim they are too dangerous to continue to do business in."\n\nThe mare set down her papers and looked Current in the eyes. "As of a little over an hour ago, we have heard reports of intensifying fighting in Sycee and Massicot. The two VasCorps are no longer denying their involvement in each other's affairs, it would seem. Kirin have been identified on both sides wearing the uniforms and wielding the weapons of each VasCorp's preferred security forces. I think we all know what this means.""

kirin_council.507.d:0 "The ExecCo was in turmoil, and Fickle Current had been up since dawn pulling his mane out.\n\nThere was no more pretense to the game anymore: earlier that week, the Sycee Trading Houses and the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild had formally declared the beginning of 'hostile business relations' with each other, immediately followed by clashes and open combat between the two VasCorp's private security arms in the fields of the Vespertine Valley. In Sycee's holdings from the Comely Cape to the Peaks of Peril, and in the Guild's demesne from their Massicot headquarters to the southeastern coastlands, the two VasCorps had locked down their territory, rallied their private armies, and set all their industry and subsidiaries to produce equipment and materiel for a war at full bore. Even in Vermilion, the rumbling of distant artillery was difficult to ignore.\n\nThe problems did not stop there; no, they were only the beginning. The war was already undercutting the NAKP's authority over the Realm, as banners that would normally be supplied to the Imperial Kirian Army by the Guild and Sycee had instead defected to their parent corporations and both sides refused to engage in dialogue with the ExecCo while there was still 'unfinished business' to be dealt with. On top of that, a consortium of the VasCorps led by the Sorghum Foundry had unilaterally declared that they would keep the conflict out of the heartlands of the Realm, and established the Mellifluve Delta Authority that would answer to the consortium's board, not the ExecCo. On top of that, local NAKP governors and commanders of Civil Defense in the western reaches of the Realm had declared the Government for Peace and Security in the West, effectively establishing a western governorate independent of the party's control. In the blink of an eye, Fickle Current found his hold on the Realm effectively quartered with nothing more than lip service from its constituents to assure him of their loyalty.\n\nBut to Current, that was not the worst part. The worst came  when the ExecCo preemptively vetoed any attempts by the state to intervene in what was happening, citing Article 12 of the Imperial Code and stressing that the state must not interfere in intercorporate affairs without the consent of all the corporate parties involved. Even his own board was in revolt against him, and there was nothing Current could do to rein them in. And with the situation as volatile as it was, there was nothing he could do but sit and wait and pray that he could find a solution before the Realm's nationalist-corporatist experiment went up in flames."

kirin_council.508.d:0 ""Telegram for you, sir."\n\nFickle Current hadn't even finished fetching his office keys from the pocket of his suit before his secretary floated a folded sheet of paper towards his face with her magic. He took it in his own and held it aloft by his shoulder as he unlocked the door, thanking his secretary before stepping inside. It seemed today would be right to business, then.\n\nSetting his briefcase on his desk, Fickle sat down and unfolded the telegram. It was a missive from the Sycee Trading House requesting the NAKP's assistance in pacifying insurgent anti-government forces. Frowning, Current read further. According to Sycee's telegram, local farming communities in the Vespertine Valley had taken up arms and had started attacking the security forces of both Sycee and the Artificers' Guild as they clashed in the area, and had effectively challenged the rule of the VasCorps and the integrity of the Vermilion Empire itself. Such rebellion could not stand, lest it fester into widespread revolt in the Empire; Current knew this, and so too did Silver Silks, who had accompanied the request with a promise of generous reimbursement for the deployment of NAKP security services. Such an offer to have Sycee indebted to the NAKP was almost too tantalizing to pass up.\n\nBut Current was an established businesskirin, and he knew to look between the lines to find what Sycee's chairmare was not saying. He knew that if he deployed the NAKP's security forces at Sycee's request, the Trading House would try to use them to gain an advantage over the Artificers' Guild, directly or indirectly. On top of that, he knew that Sycee was desperate to win over its rival as quickly as it could. If Sycee really wanted NAKP security forces, then maybe playing hardball with them could extract a better deal after a period of silence..."

kirin_council.509.d:0 "Fickle Current had been just about to leave the office for the day when his secretary dangled a piece of paper in front of him as he stepped through the door. "Telegram," she said, offering him a sympathetic smile. "And yes, it's important. It's from the Guild."\n\nCurrent sighed and took the paper. "Thank you, but I'll deal with this one in the car," he told her, and with a wave, the NAKP's chairkirin left 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza behind and climbed into the backseat of his company car. Once the chauffeur set the automobile and drive and pulled onto the road, Current unfolded the paper and read it in private. It was a request from the Artificers' Guild for the deployment and presence of NAKP security forces to the Trypan Interfluve to deal with the 'deteriorating legal situation' centered around the city of Massicot. The Guild stressed that the dispute with Sycee over 'matters of regular business operation' had led to an increase in property damage in and around the city by 'criminal and illegal behavior' and that the kirin present in the city were 'expressing growing concern' over reserves of food, water, and coal. As recompense for the NAKP's 'generous actions in stabilizing the situation', the Guild promised to reimburse it with 'a generosity matched in value and in spirit' once things returned to normal.\n\nCurrent rolled his eyes and set the paper away. Despite the flowery language, he knew that the Guild just wanted to have access to NAKP security forces to aid them in their dispute with Sycee. They could try to cover it up however they wished, but at the end of the day, the artificers merely wanted the NAKP to side with them over their rival. If they bothered to reach out to him, however, then that implied that the Guild was unsure of its ability to bring its dispute with Sycee to a satisfactory conclusion. With that in mind, Current wondered if his silence would lead to the Guild coming back to him with a better offer in the future."

Throughout the peasant heartland of the Mellifluve Delta, in one great storm of smoke and fire, the peasants and villagers of the Realm all took up arms and marched against our garrisons. Countless mares and stallions of the NAKP were dragged out of their posts and murdered with scythes and pitchforks and swords, their blood watering the fields of Kiria and giving rise to an uprising of fanaticism and religious fervor we haven't seen since we snuffed out Rising Sun's hold over the west.\n\nIt wasn't just the plantations and rural settlements that have fallen, though. In the city of Sorghum, the workers in our factories attacked their foremares and NAKP officials with weapons forged in our machines and turned each one into a fortress. Coupled with an uprising from peasants outside of the city, the rebels were able to seize the city and all its resources and turn it into a bastion of rebellion and insurrection. The Children of Concord, as they call themselves, have spent the past few days purging and slaughtering anykirin they suspect of having ties to the NAKP, but despite this, some stragglers of the garrison have managed to escape and reform into ad hoc units just outside the city's borders.

kirin_council.304.d:0 ""What is the meaning of this?! Release me this instant!" Frozen Pyre, First Mystic of Sorghum, had been tending to his garden outside of his manse when an angry mob of peasants passed by. One of them had pointed at him and shouted something indiscernible, and before he knew it they had descended upon him en masse. Now, his house was a smouldering ruin, and he was being unceremoniously dragged through the streets of Sorghum.\n\nDespite Frozen's shouting, nokirin in the frenzied crowd seemed to pay him any attention. Soon, they passed by the town's Divine Fire temple; or, what was left of it, in this case. The NAKP-sanctioned temple had been torn asunder, the Imperial flags gone and the holy murals desecrated. There were even kirin dousing the exterior with gasoline. Frozen tried to protest, but his words only sparked more anger from the crowd. The last thing he saw of the temple before the mob dragged him away was the beginnings of an inferno.\n\nFrozen was confused before, but now he was terrified. What was going on? Where was Civil Defense? He tried to look around for something, anything to help him make sense of the situation. Another multitude of kirin joined the mob, these ones parading homemade banners. Frozen squinted his eyes, trying to make out what was on them. He saw simple drawings of Concord's likeness, along with some grainy photographs of somepony he only recognized from the NAKP broadsheet: the Equestrian Diarch, Princess Celestia.\n\nWhat scared him the most, however, was the third figure being depicted next to the others. An equine with a horn and wings, a mane of burning plasma, slitted eyes, a fanged sneer, and molten-gold regalia. These drawings were the most inconsistent and crude, as it seemed like everykirin had a different interpretation of what entity they had tried to depict. But who was it?\n\nHis thoughts were halted when the crowd began to chant a phrase that only served to terrify him further."

Celestia, the diarch of Equestria, receiving praise alongside Concord. A third, sinister-looking figure stood beside them. His thoughts turned to the other Equestrian ruler, Princess Luna. He recalled reading about how she had once transformed into a twisted version of herself called Nightmare Moon. But Celestia didn't have an alter ego! Were the kirin here trying to depict...\n\nFrozen's eyes went wide with realization. "Heretics!" he screamed. This was blasphemy of the highest degree, to both his faith and that of the Equestrians! He struggled against the mob's grip but to no avail. Some briefly paused their chanting to jeer at him. The mob jostled him roughly. The last thing he saw was the butt of a rifle before darkness descended upon him.\n\nThe mob continued to drag Frozen into an iron mill, part of the vast industrial complex owned by the Sorghum Foundry. Now, the workers had taken it over, much like everywhere else in the city. Through his dazed state, Frozen could do little as they ascended to the upper level of the factory. He groaned as the mob hefted him onto the safety railing above a large vat of molten iron. The heat and brightness of the liquid below brought Frozen to his senses. His foalhood fear of falling became reality as the madkirin pushed him off of the railing towards his demise. He desperately reached out to grab onto something, barely managing to wrap his hoof around the post in time.\n\n"CONCORD!" The angry mob continued to shout. One of them placed a hoof next to Frozen's shaking grip. "CELESTIA!" The hoof was pulled back briefly, as if they were preparing for a- "CONFLAGRATION!" Frozen's hoof was kicked away, plunging him down into the vat below.\n\nFrozen felt an immediate, overwhelming warmness around his body as his back struck the molten iron. He screamed as some of it splashed his eyes, blinding him. He flung his limbs in every direction, trying to free himself from the embrace of the agonizing heat. His screams turned into choking as the fiery liquid began to devour him. Soon enough, his movements ceased as the iron finally managed to melt his body."

kirin_council.328.d:0 ""I never took you for a believer in Concord. Most of the kirin who left the Realm when The Silence began left their beliefs behind with them. So what changed?"\n\nMahogany Blaze looked up from the shrine to Concord in Sorghum's temple and aside to the kirin standing next to him. Bright Burn had been one of his staunchest companions since he left Equestria to help the kirin of the Realm, and without him, Mahogany knew he would have been swallowed up by the culture shock of visiting his ancestral homelands in the midst of the chaos that gripped them. Smiling softly, Mahogany started to answer his question. "Before the revolt, I was part of the resistance in Sorghum against the Empire," Mahogany said. "I met a mare named Dayspring Rose. Did you know she used to be Rising Sun's protege?" When Bright Burn shook his head, he continued. "Well, she was. She and I got to discussing theology. I guess it's not unexpected given her mentor. What was unexpected was just what exactly she thought of theology."\n\nThe intriguing tangent made Bright Burn sit down by Mahogany's side. "Really?"\n\n"Yeah. Concord, Celestia, Conflagration — that's an idea that Dayspring had, and it really stuck with me. The Radiant Trinity. Three faces of our faith, of what makes us kirin." Mahogany shifted to a more comfortable position on his haunches and turned to face Bright. "It's like a metaphor. Something philosophical. You know what dialectic thinking is, right? I learned about it when I was a student at the Friendship University."\n\n"Reconciling two opposing viewpoints as a way to see the world," Bright answered. "Did Twilight Sparkle teach you that?"\n\n"No," Mahogany said, with a little laugh. "Actually, it was Professor Pinkie. But anyway, it got me to think of the Radiant Trinity in a similar way. Call it tri-alectic thinking, if you will.""

kirin_council.388.t:0 "When Three Become One
kirin_council.388.d:0 ""Well, think about it," Mahogany said. "The Radiant Trinity is a metaphor for the kirin condition. I feel that much is obvious but it's more interesting if you apply it to specifics. Like rulership. Or, at least, pieces of it."\n\nBright Burn nodded along, sitting in rapt attention while Mahogany spoke, his violet eyes wandering around the temple as he worked through his thoughts. "Think about it this way. A ruler could be like Concord: she can be divine, godlike, somehow above the reality of mortal concerns. That's what the Matriarchs Superior have striven to be in Kiria, and though they may be blessed by some divine magic, they're still mortal. They still die. But they still serve their purpose, even if they act like something they're not — and that's a dialectic thought," he said, winking at the aside. "Or, let's take Celestia. A ruler can be benevolent and virtuous like her, but nocreature save for her can ever be that compassionate. Even her sister, another demigod, couldn't! But she's an ideal to strive toward, something that we mortals want to be like. And in a sense, she seems more attainable than Concord, despite how oxymoronic that may seem."\n\nThen after a moment, Mahogany looked back at the shrine to Concord, and then through it to the torches burning on the opposite wall. "And of course, there's Conflagration. Rage and malice incarnate, but given strength through fury. Warlords and tyrants might be a symbol of Conflagration's rage, but they are only one facet of her aspect. Are we not all burdened by our rage? We can all become nirik if we give into it. The mystics in Vermilion saw it as a burden, but it doesn't have to be a curse. Our nirik forms are our most physically strong, and we gain our strength from rage and passion like Conflagration. The trick is to find a way to use that strength for good, and not for our own selfish ends."\n\nHe looked back to Bright Burn and awkwardly chuckled. "Sorry, that was a lecture and a half, wasn't it? I guess even this far from the School of Friendship, I just can't shake my studious ways."\n\n"You don't have to worry about that," Bright said, scooting a little closer to Mahogany. "I thought it was interesting. You really know your stuff.""

kirin_council.305.d:0 "The Sorghum Foundry was a symphony. Everywhere Kindling Flash walked, different melodies reached his ears from the kirin hard at work forging weapons to fight against the NAKP. On his left, hammers and presses stuttered out the marching staccato of a thousand hooves stomping down the oppressor; on his right, the grinding whine of saws and cutters severed the chains that had once bound them. More than producing instruments of war, these kirin were forging their freedom, and the discordant notes of industrial power weaved themselves together into a concert in Concord's name.\n\nIt was ironic, Kindling noted as he watched the workers at work, that in some part, the Children of Concord had the oppressors to thank for what he was hearing. Before the Silence, the Sorghum Foundry had been the largest factory complex in all of Kiria, but with the beginning of the Grand Gallop Onward, it had been eclipsed by the gigantic industrial parks elsewhere in the Realm. But the investiture of money and machinery had not passed Sorghum by, and the funding procured by the NAKP had helped to modernize the old craftskirin workshops and simple factories into an industrial powerhouse of its own. Of course, it had not all been for the better. Under the Empire, the Foundry had swallowed poor laborers by the thousands, turning their sweat and tears into black smoke and red steel, before disgorging the exhausted workers at the end of the day, minus those whose life and limb the factories claimed for their own. It had been harsh and cruel, but the oppressor did not care how many kirin were maimed or died. There were always more poor workers to shovel into the foundry like the coal that fed its boilers.\n\nThings were different now, Kindling was happy to see as he walked along the production lines. Now, the workers were free and labored for themselves, not under fear of the foremare's whip. And surrounding them, the cause they championed hung from the girders of the factory, from the red banners and flags to the broken and bloodied body of the foremare hanging from a noose of chains. As the whistle blew signaling the end of the shift and the start of the next, Kindling knew that in this moment of war and blood, their industrial democracy will be delivered into the world."

kirin_council.306.d:0 "Mahogany Blaze and Bright Burn entered the little unnamed town at the head of their profession, ringing bells in their magic. "The Children of Concord have a message for all weary souls longing to be free!" Bright Burn called out as they passed by houses with darkened windows and closed doors. "The breadbasket of Kiria has risen up in arms against the tyranny of Vermilion and the thieves and murderers that rule it! Come with us to witness the rebirth of Kiria and the redemption of the Dynasty!"\n\nThough their bells and chants turned the heads of several kirin in the village, Mahogany couldn't help but notice the empty weariness on their faces. The heartlands of the Realm and the many villages around it, villages much like this one, had suffered immeasurably in the chaos following the collapse of the Grand Gallop Onward. How many processions like his had come through this town to drum up support before him? How many times had these kirin been asked to lend their ears and their strength to a cause only to be left battered, broken, and even worse off than before? Would they even answer the calls of another one?\n\nYet follow the procession they did, and when they finally entered the town square, Mahogany looked at the kirin around him, both in the procession that followed him and in the villagers that answered the ringing of the bells. They straddled every walk of life left in the Realm, from young firebrands to poor peasants to repentant priests to businesskirin seeking to redeem themselves. And when Bright Burn gave Mahogany a nod and encouraged him to step up and give a speech, Mahogany, felt a lump forming in his throat and a stone sinking in his gut."

kirin_council.386.t:0 "Support from the Weary"
kirin_council.386.d:0 ""Turn your ears, kirin of the Realm, and listen, to the wisdom of the heir to the Vermilion Throne!" Bright Burn announced, his voice carrying a strong confidence that Mahogany lacked. The crowd fell quiet, curiosity overtaking them. Mahogany knew that what they saw impressed them more than anything he could possibly say; it was obvious to anykirin who had seen Matriarch Superior Rain Shine or her likeness before that she and Mahogany shared almost identical coloration, save for their eyes. He had been born in Equestria, but to anykirin who didn't know that, it wasn't that too far a logical step to think that Rain Shine was his mother. That fact, and the encouragement of Bright Burn and others in the Children of Concord, had led to Mahogany standing on the well, acting as the face of the revolution. It was too late to turn back now.\n\n"H-Hello, everykirin," Mahogany started, immediately stumbling over that simple greeting as his anxiety threatened to paralyze his voice. "My name is Mahogany Blaze. And, um, I've come to ask for your help. The Children of Concord need everykirin, you see, to, uh, fight back against the NAKP. They've... they've taken so much from us... and I don't want to ask for more but..."\n\nHis eyes wandered, and he shifted uncomfortably, but when he saw Bright Burn and the nod of encouragement coming from his closest companion, Mahogany swallowed hard and tried to raise his voice to drown out his worry. "But we can't do this without you. We have all lost so much in these recent years, I-I know that all too well. But things won't get better unless we do something about it now. Now, more than ever, do we have the chance to fight back. The Empire is still weak and off-balance. This may be our last, final chance to free ourselves and our home. If we wait any longer, then their strength will grow, and we may never be free again.\n\n"But this is my promise to you," Mahogany said, starting to find his voice and his confidence. "I promise that I will fight with you every step of the way. I won't ask you to do something that I wouldn't do myself. Together, we can throw off the shackles of tyranny and bring democracy to Kiria. We can bring the Realm back to what it was always meant to be: a haven for kirin everywhere! And..." he hesitated just a moment, before throwing himself fully into the role. "And I promise I will restore the glory of the Vermilion Dynasty and make this land a Realm worth fighting for!"\n\nThough unsure at first, cheering soon grew at the end of Mahogany's speech, and Bright Burn gave him a look and a wink. "They love you," he told Mahogany, straining to be heard over the noise of a town of weary kirin suddenly given life once more."

He approached the table, and when the two kirin sitting down saw him, Kindling offered them a smile. "Mind if I join you?"\n\nMahogany and his friend gave each other a look, and after a moment, the other kirin scooted out of his seat. "It's getting late; I should be off to bed anyway," he said, and he walked around the table to press his neck against Mahogany's for a moment. "You two enjoy your talk."\n\n"I'll do my best, Bright," Mahogany said, watching his friend go. Then he motioned for Kindling to sit down across from him. "You're... Kindling Flash, right?" Mahogany asked. "Dayspring mentioned you last time I spoke with her. She said you're a good friend and an ally to the cause."\n\n"Funny, Dayspring also mentioned you when I spoke with her," Kindling said with a chuckle, taking the offered seat. He gave Mahogany another look and let out an impressed whistle. "She wasn't kidding. You're the spitting image of Rain Shine. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were her daughter."\n\nMahogany groaned and put a hoof to his forehead scales. "You and a lot of other kirin. When Bright Burn and Dayspring suggested that I start going around calling myself the heir to the Vermilion Throne, I didn't think anykirin would take it seriously. Little did I know how readily kirin were willing to believe in something like that, or call me "princess" or "heiress" by mistake... I mean, I know I'm not exactly a farmer rippling with muscles, but I don't look THAT soft, do I?"\n\nThe two kirin shared a good-natured laugh, though it faded away when Mahogany frowned. "Honestly, I don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. I'm just a figurehead, a beacon to tie an idea of freedom to, propped up by my friends. I mean, we don't even know what we're doing half the time, but somehow it just works. The kirin of the Realm are willing to believe in me, despite how little sense it all makes. And now I feel like... like I'm in too deep now, you know? My life is no longer my own. I'm a symbol for the Children of Concord. Mahogany Blaze no longer exists, and the Vermilion Pretender is walking around in his scales.""

kirin_council.387.d:0 ""I'm not sure how much you remember of Rising Sun," Kindling began. "I don't know if you two ever really interacted much. But Dayspring and I were her followers, once upon a time. Two of her most important, if I'm being honest. She had a way of drawing kirin to her, of giving them an idea and making them want to give her everything they had to make it a reality. You can call it charisma, but I call it showmareship. She was very good at presenting to her followers a clear vision of the Kiria she wanted to create, and articulating that idea and how everykirin could help make it a reality. Sure, she knew how to play on a kirin's emotions with fiery speeches and passionate rhetoric, but the commonfolk are smarter than most give them credit for. The people need to know what they are actually fighting for, the world they're trying to realize at the end of all this death and destruction. If they don't have that, then they won't follow you."\n\nMahogany was quiet for a moment, staring into his empty teacup. "Then why does it feel like kirin follow me when I don't have a clear vision for the future I want to make?" he asked Kindling. "I have ideas, but I'm not good at getting them across, yet they flock to me regardless every time I present myself as the Vermilion Pretender. Why?"\n\n"Because you're a symbol to them," Kindling told him. "You're the Vermilion Pretender. You give them the promise that you're going to remake the Realm in the idealized version of what the Vermilion Dynasty is supposed to represent. Peace, prosperity, plenty for all. The commonfolk can interpret and project their own hopes and dreams and desires on you, through you, and that's why they follow you. But eventually, just being a symbol isn't going to be enough. When the questions get tough, the kirin following you will realize that you don't have answers, just a vague hope for the future -- unless you manage to show them what you want for the Realm."\n\n"But how?" Mahogany asked. "I'm not a particularly good orator. I get nervous giving speeches. How can I show kirin what I want for the future if I trip over my words half the time?"\n\nKindling Flash smiled at him and stood up. "I've got some old texts lying around. We can go through books and scrolls from famous speeches from mystics and Matriarchs of the past. If we study them, I think we'll be able to coach you up and help you put your ideas into words, and maybe like Rising Sun, you'll be able to get kirin to follow you through any hardships to come."

kirin_council.308.d:0 "It had been a long road from the last village, but Dayspring Rose knew that they'd arrive at the next one after one more day's journey. As the Children of Concord that had been traveling with her laid out their campsite for the evening, Dayspring wistfully thought back to the days when she used to travel the Realm by rail with her mentor. Life was easier then, but with Fragrance's soldiers keeping a close eye on the trains, the only way they could safely move about the country was on hoof. Not even the rivers were safe, filled as they were with the corporations' patrol boats. One day, she told herself, it would all be worth it, and she didn't have to travel across the Realm in fear again.\n\nAs the night grew darker and the stars twinkled to life in the heavens above, Dayspring spotted a familiar figure sitting at the edge of the camp, staring up at the celestial expanse above them. Her hooves took her to that kirin's side, and she sat down next to him with a small smile on her face. "What are you thinking about, Princess?"\n\nMahogany Blaze let out a resigned sigh. "Not you too..." he muttered, shaking his head. "Can't we just save that whole thing for the next village? You know very well I'm not related to Rain Shine. I just look like her."\n\n"That's good enough for the kirin we're trying to save," Dayspring said, though after the little teasing lilt, she gave her head a slight respectful dip. "Sorry. I know it's tough on you. I shouldn't tease."\n\n"It's fine," Mahogany assured her. "Whatever works, right?" He chuckled lightly, trying to make light of the strange circumstances both kirin found themselves in, then grew silent again. Only after a thoughtful pause did he speak once more. "I was just wondering..." the young stallion began, "Dayspring... what IS the Radiant Trinity? I've heard you and the others talk so much about it, but I feel like... like it just doesn't make sense."\n\nAt first, Dayspring was taken aback by the directness of the question, wondering for a moment if Mahogany was serious or not. But when she saw the look in his eyes, she knew it was genuine. "As in, who it is? Or do you mean what it represents?" When Mahogany nodded at the latter, Dayspring took a slow breath and shook her head."

kirin_council.398.d:0 ""I suppose it begins with our goddess," Dayspring said, laying down on the grasses and looking up at the stars. After a moment, Mahogany joined her as well, listening intently as she spoke. "Concord created us and our world, and the Matriarchs Superior have always claimed to be her temporal representative, the manifestation of her from the world of the divine into the realm of the material. But if that were wholly true, would they not be perfect beings? There have been nine Matriarchs Superior since the Vermilion Dynasty was created not even six centuries ago, owing to their longer lifespan. Most have been good, fair rulers, though Matriarch Effulgent Rose bent the Realm to satiate her desires for luxury and comfort, and Matriarch Noctilucent Charm stagnated our society for a hundred years when she instituted the Silence. Even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, beloved as she was and still is, failed to stop the foreigners from wresting control of the Realm away from her with their money and influence. To put it simply, the Matriarchs are not perfect, and many have wanted to claim their power. My old mentor was one of those kirin."\n\nDayspring's face twisted with painful memories, but she forced her emotions back down and continued. "She failed, and when the Rising Fire was crushed, I fled. While on the run, I found a book about the Equestrian princess, Celestia. When I read the text that night... I realized that it might be Celestia who was Concord's representative in this world, not the Matriarchs. Think about it. Concord created the kirin, yes, but she also created everything else that lived in this world. It would be hubris to insist that her avatar must be a kirin. Perhaps it was Celestia, a perfect, compassionate, immortal demigod, the living embodiment of peace and harmony. And when I read about her sister, Princess Luna, and how when she fell to anger and rage she became Nightmare Moon... well, wouldn't Celestia be similar if she fell? But instead of darkness, she'd be a searing flame, a warrior-goddess that manifests to defend her subjects. She'd be like... like a divine conflagration, burning everything that would wrong Concord's creations in this world."\n\nAfter a moment, Dayspring closed her eyes, feeling comfortable on the grass. "That's what the Radiant Trinity is, Mahogany. Concord, Celestia, and Conflagration are all aspects of this world. Its creator, its caretaker, and its protector. In the name of the Radiant Trinity, we can strive for the utopia of peace and harmony that has existed under Celestia for a millennium. And where those that came before us failed, we will succeed."

In Kirin-Trinitarian theology, Celestia exists in a duality: as a physical and temporal embodiment of Harmony - the benevolent and immortal ruler presiding over the world's creatures - and as a warrior-goddess that manifests to defend harmony, when it is threatened, with righteous purifying flame and divine fury, before receding duly once the foe is vanquished. That Celestia's avenging aspect in the form of the Conflagration had never manifested was, according to Kirin-Trinitarians, a testament to her divine purity.\n\nIn the name of Her Radiant Trinity, the ultimate mission of the Kirin-Trinitarians was to remake Kiria into the utopia of peace and harmony that had existed in Equestria under Celestial rule.§!\n— Trinity-Worship in Kiria - a Study in Theology and Metaphysics, Canterford University Press (1077)"

He could feel the golden sun on his back, warming his scales, and the faintest of breezes toyed with the tufts of fluff in his ears. Around him, the sounds of nature gave the world a serene peace, drawing Mahogany into its embrace, enticing him to set his worries aside and appreciate oneness with the world, if only for a little moment.\n\nThen a tickle settled on his nose, and after screwing up his features for several seconds, the young kirin let out such a sudden sneeze that he fell backwards in a flailing tangle of limbs.\n\nBy his side, Kindling Flash slowly opened first one eye, then the other, and his lips curved as he looked down at the flustered young kirin. "I take it your nose was not as at peace as your mind?"\n\nMahogany huffed and sat upright, an embarrassed blush starting to color his cheeks. "I'm just not good at meditating," the stallion grumbled. "Like... I don't know. I feel like I should be good at it, being a kirin and all, but I never did any of this stuff in Equestria. I just can't focus..."\n\n"Having difficulty setting aside your concerns for the Children, are you?" Kindling asked, and when Mahogany reluctantly nodded, Kindling gestured for Mahogany to once more resume his meditative pose and close his eyes. Only when he had done so did Kindling do the same. "Perhaps it will help you to focus not on worrying over the choices ahead, but of the truths as we know them," the older kirin said. "First, the truth to why we fight. We fight because the right to control one's destiny is universal to everycreature, no matter what their walk of life. Everycreature in this Realm has a right to control their own destiny, and we fight to create a democracy to let them do that. But another truth is that our fight is not a mere peasants' revolution. We fight to liberate all of Kiria; the peasants in the fields, yes, but the workers in the factories and the students in the schools, too. Everycreature has a right to democracy, to decide our collective fate and future, and it is in this promise that we find the strength to unite the population in our struggle. It is the truth of our fight and our purpose that will allow us to build a better future, a shared dream. Does that make sense to you?"\n\nMahogany slowly nodded. "Yeah... Yeah I think it does.""

The two kirin found themselves in the open courtyard behind a shrine to Concord in a remove village as part of their travels. Mahogany didn't know what denomination the temple really belonged to anymore; at once, it may have been a Way of Fire temple, then a Rising Fire temple, and now, at least for the time being, a shrine to the Radiant Trinity. The mystics inside had at least been gracious enough to offer the traveling Children food and shelter on their journey, and though Mahogany was thankful for their hospitality, he found himself wondering how sincere the kirin inside were in their adherence to the Radiant Trinity.\n\nBut he put those thoughts aside as Dayspring began to move her limbs and body in measured, flowing movements, and Mahogany did his best to match not only her motions, but her purposeful breathing. The two kirin moved and turned about their spaces, sometimes craning their necks, sometimes arching their backs, and at some points rising on two, and once even one, leg before dropping back to all fours. Though it only lasted a few minutes, Mahogany felt a little livelier by the time they reached the closing posture.\n\nWhen they were finished, the two kirin sat down and Dayspring offered Mahogany a smile. "Not bad," she told him.\n\n"I don't think I could ever be as good as you," Mahogany said. "I feel like I was tripping over my own hooves. And you said you do that daily?"\n\n"I at least try to. It's good physical exercise and it keeps you in shape. When I was fighting for Rising Sun, I would start my day with it. It would give me time to meditate on finding my warrior's spirit before throwing myself into the trials of the Rising Fire's struggle." Though talk of her past seemed to darken her face, Dayspring shook it away with a shake of her head. "Though I may have been misguided back then, the lessons I learned from it are still important. We have to make ourselves worthy of the Radiant Trinity's attention, being willing to fight and die in Her name, for Her divine glory, in the hope that She may recognize our pain and suffering. Through the nobleness of our struggle and our sacrifice, She will bless us with Her benevolent intervention. The movements help us spiritually connect with Her in the hopes of such."\n\nMahogany couldn't help but spare her a skeptical look. "That's unlikely, don't you think? Countless kirin have all claimed that Concord would help them in their time of need if they pleased her, yet here we are."\n\n"Well, you may be right about that," Dayspring said with a shrug.

kirin_council.311.d:0 "Russet Thrush lay on her belly beneath the prickly branches of a bramble, a well-worn but lovingly maintained Flare bolt-action rifle by her side. Hidden on a small hillock beyond a bend in the dirt road, Russet could see a five hundred meter stretch of road in front of her surrounded by undergrowth and shady trees. It would make a perfect place for an ambush, with even twenty kirin being able to massacre a convoy thrice their number with ease. Unfortunately for her, she was the only kirin along that stretch of road that prayed to the Radiant Trinity.\n\nDust rose over a distant hill, kicked up by the wheels of Civil Defence cars and trucks trundling along roads dry from a lengthy drought, and Russet readied her rifle and braced it against the mud and rocks she'd piled up for a solid shooting platform. She took a deep breath to calm her nerves and tried to think back to her younger days, days that felt like a lifetime ago. Once upon a time, she had been a champion in village shooting conditions, discovering her hidden talent when her father brought home a newly-produced Flare rifle and she stole it to shoot at jars like her older brothers did. But nowadays, instead of painted targets on wooden boards, her shots landed on fellow kirin. And though she tried not to let it bother her, she always felt sick to her stomach whenever her bullets revealed red paint after the shot, not before.\n\nThe first car appeared over the hill, and Russet ticked off the meters in her head as the convoy approached. "May the Conflagration protect me and guide my hooves as I do battle in Her name," she whispered to herself, aiming the iron sights of her rifle with the driver of the car leading the column. "May Celestia watch over and bless my family and comrades still fighting, and ensure that they live long, prosperous, peaceful lives. And when I am dead, may Concord receive me into Her love and warmth, in penance for the warmth I take from this world by my hoof."\n\nHer rifle let out a crack of thunder, and a heartbeat later, the windshield of the lead car shattered and it violently swerved off the road. Swallowing hard, Russet worked the action on her rifle, sighted in on the truck behind it, and immediately fired before the driver could react, sending the truck careening down an embankment and into a tree. Soldiers began to pour out of the trucks, quickly trying to locate the shooter, while Russet continued to fire, sending soul after soul back to Concord with each shot of her rifle.\n\nBullets began to fly back in her directions, striking the trees, the rocks, the dirt, but still Russet fired. The leaves of the brambles hissed as bullets ripped through them, and one fell into the open bolt as she cycled rounds as if to stop her from shooting, but she plucked it out and continued firing even as the suppressing fire grew ever closer. There was no chance of escape, Russet knew, and she fired and fired and fired until pain clawed at her throat and she collapsed on her father's rifle, spitting her own red paint onto the powder-stained bolt."

kirin_council.312.d:0 "It was nightfall in the little village, but that didn't stop the liveliness of a bustling day's activity. In fact, it only seemed to heighten it. A bonfire had been erected at the edge of town, and the many kirin of the village had gathered around to share food and drink and hear stories. Mahogany Blaze, who walked among their number as they sat and chatted, tried to make sense of it all. He had been told it was some folk tradition from a time even older than the Way of Fire itself, but that was all he could really glean from that. At least he had Bright Burn with him to help make sense of it all.\n\nAs they walked through the crowd, Mahogany suddenly stopped, his eyes falling on a winged figure sitting on the grasses with a score of foals crowded around her. She was a pegasus with ruffled silver feathers, and though her wings in a crowd of kirin had originally attracted Mahogany's attention, her face held it, and not for a pleasant reason. Her nose had clearly been broken some time ago, scars cut into her soft features, and a bandage wrapped around her head covered her left eye. As he looked on in surprise at the injured pony among their number, he pulled Bright Burn aside and pointed at her. "Who is she?"\n\n"Silver Lining, I think," Bright Burn said. "She joined our number only a few days ago. I heard she was part of an Equestrian aid mission, but some Civil Defense guardsmare gave her a brutal beating for trying to protect some foals about to be shot for theft. I thought she'd go back home after that, but..."\n\n"Kiria's a long way from Equestria and the magic of friendship," Mahogany mused, and the two kirin walked closer to hear what the pegasus was saying. Her forelegs moved in animated motions as she regaled the foals with stories of Equestria and its benevolent goddess, and Mahogany could see the wonder in the foals' eyes as they heard the tales of a peaceful land after having only known war and suffering for so long in Kiria.\n\nWhen she was finished, Mahogany couldn't help but step forward, and when he cleared his throat, the eyes of everykirin present fell on him. "You do our home justice," he said to Silver Lining, and the pegasus bowed her head. "It makes me miss it so. I too long for the days of peace and plenty... but Kiria is not Equestria."\n\nThat statement was met by a dozen or so cocked heads, and so Mahogany continued. "Celestia protects her ponies, but we don't have her to protect us. We have to stand up for ourselves and build our utopia by our own hooves. We have to struggle for everything we want to see in the world. But that doesn't mean that we can't use Equestria as our role model, our inspiration." He smiled, then added:"

Though he was supposedly the face of the movement to overthrow the Empire, he had rarely ventured near the front lines, instead using his image to drum up support in the heartlands of the Realm. But that all changed that morning.\n\nAs his caravan of supporters and believers had set out for their next destination that morning, they had suddenly come under fire from Imperial planes that had appeared out of the clouds. In the confusion, Mahogany and Bright Burn had fled for the nearest treeline. Lost and alone under the leaden gaze of the aluminum raptors above them, the two kirin decided to press onwards in the hopes of meeting the survivors of their procession at their destination, all the while using whatever trees and brush they could find as cover. What felt like a lifetime later, Mahogany and Bright emerged from the cover of the trees to find a company of about thirty militiakirin hunkered down behind the stone walls of a bridge. When they saw Mahogany approaching them, their eyes widened in surprise and most jumped to their hooves. "What's happening?" Mahogany asked them, cantering over while keeping a wary eye trained to the skies. "What are you doing out here?"\n\n"Militia," the lead stallion said, giving Mahogany a sloppy salute. "We heard there was Civil Defense in this area so we gathered to help out. We weren't expecting planes, though." He glanced back at the bridge his troops were gathered around. "We have to hold this bridge. They're coming right this way."\n\n"We're going to die here!" a mare exclaimed, and her rifle shook in her magic. "When those planes come back they're gonna kill us!"\n\nIt was obvious to Mahogany the militia was on the verge of fleeing, and he couldn't blame them; his own heart was still racing from the strafing he'd survived earlier. But he also knew that unless they did something, things weren't going to get better. Instead, he seized a nearby rifle in his magic and raised it. "I might not be a soldier, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to fight. This struggle is bigger than us, isn't it? Our oppression and hardship, we can't control that. But we can control how we answer it, and the way I see it, if we don't answer it now, then how are we going to answer it later? We have to stay and fight. A-and I've never shot a gun before, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try now if it means doing what's right."\n\nThe fire in Mahogany's words, unsure as it was, seemed to rally the militia, and they slowly nodded with him. But before anykirin could say anything, Bright Burn tapped his shoulder. "I'm with you, Mahogany. But that doesn't mean we need to hold the bridge. Let's hide in the trees there and ambush them when they get across, alright?""

During the Battle of Banyan Bridge, however, he would prove himself to possess the qualities of bravery, charisma, and visionary determination that are shared among all successful military leaders. The tenacious resistance by the bridge's defenders, mostly volunteer soldiers from a Sorghum workers' militia, delayed the advance of a Civil Defence reconnaissance force that would ultimately blunt the momentum of the Imperial Kirian Army's "Operation Mystic" offensive.§!\n— Cadmium Heir: Life of the Vermilion Pretender"

Do you not see that you have damned your spark to be extinguished rather than rejoining Concord's heavenly fire?"\n\nSpinel Serpent stood defiant in front of his home, his withering but incendiary gaze sweeping over the crowd of peasants that had gathered in his yard and keeping them at bay through willpower alone. Before the rise of the Empire of Kiria, he had been their Way of Fire priest; now, he was their priest, landlord, and mayor all in one. Everything that happened in his town happened only with his approval, and through cooperation with the Empire, he had gotten everything he had wanted, using the threat of eternal damnation and the snuffing of the immortal spark to keep dissent contained. A peasant may not fear death, but they would fear losing their promise of peace and rebirth through Concord's Holy Flame once their suffering in this life ended.\n\nSingle Spark knew this as she watched the peasants back down around her. Spinel was just one kirin, alone and unarmed, facing down a mob of a hundred and more, armed with stones and farming implements. But still he held power over them in his words and threats. How could a revolution even sprout, let alone blossom and bear fruit, if it was made from kirin of such weak will? How could they hope to break decades of oppression and fear if they didn't have the strength to break its powerless icon before them?\n\nShe whirled on the kirin that had followed her this far but couldn't bring themselves to take a step more. "What are you all waiting for?" she shouted at them, stomping her hoof. "Do you think your freedom will come for you if you wait? Do you think Concord will award complacency with her boon? We must prove to her that we deserve it! Prove to her that we are willing to take our freedom, and we are strong enough to bear it upon our shoulders! If we don't learn how to stand up against one stallion, how will we stand up against the Empire and the scores of oppressors its sick machinery feeds? How will we ever be free?!"\n\nThe crowd frowned, but ultimately it was another mare, barely older than a filly, who set it in motion. Hefting a rock in her magic, she stepped forward and let it fly with a cry of "Death to the oppressors!" The rock caught Spinel by surprise, striking between the scales on his nose, and as he staggered backwards with blood beginning to run down his muzzle, the crowd grew in fury and frenzy. More stones flew, and as the stallion fell to the ground under the onslaught, the rebels rushed forward to finish the job with their makeshift weapons. Single Spark watched it all with a satisfied grin on her face, and as the crowd sent Spinel's spark back to Concord's embrace, she knew they were finally strong enough to take a stand for themselves."

kirin_council_314_tt:0 "§LPerhaps most infamous among the quasi-religious revolutionary tactics employed by the Communion of Trinity is the practice of "Mass Empowerment Through Direct Action", colloquially referred to as "empowerment actions". The exact implementation of such a practice varied from province to province, and was a phenomenon almost exclusively confined to small agrarian villages in the rural countryside that were usually governed by a landlord-official appointed by regional representatives of the Vermilion government. These landlord-officials were often mystics or priests within the Way of Fire or its NAKP-sanctioned successor sect, the Divine Fire Patriotic Movement. Thus, they combined a religious mandate with governmental authority and economic power to dominate the village they ruled over as de-facto personal fiefdoms.\n\nThe Communion's "empowerment actions", then, which entailed preacher-provocateurs infiltrating rural villages, often bringing with them a stash of weapons with which to arm the peasantry, in order to rouse the village through fiery, impassioned rhetoric into lynching their landlord-official, was immensely efficient in spreading revolutionary zeal and anti-Vermilion sentiment among the rural peasantry and, according to Trinity-Worship doctrine, "empowered the masses to throw off their temporal shackles and accept no other authority than that of Her Radiant Trinity".§!\nA New History of Kiria Volume VI, 980-1060 ALB"

The town, which had seemingly known nothing but hardship and destruction through the Silence and then the wars that plagued the Realm following its end, now stood swaddled in the flags and banners of the Children of Concord. Though the threat of military retribution from the Imperial Kirian Army still loomed over Sprout following its liberation, the kirin in the town busily tended to repairing and rebuilding their small settlement, hopefully for the last time.\n\nYet nothing compared to the spirits of the kirin toiling under the sun. For the first time in seemingly a long time, they held their heads high and moved like a people empowered, a people who had seized their destiny and were ready to defend it. Armored kirin patrolled the perimeter of the town, alert for the threat of Imperial retaliation, while in the heart of the town, the collaborators who had kept Sprout's dreams of liberty under their hooves now languished in stocks, jeered and abused as the kirin went into the town hall to formalize their cooperation and alliance with the Children of Concord. It was a sign that the old order was gone, and a new one was ready to take its place.\n\nThe town hall had never been built to hold this many kirin, but today, it was filled to the brim, packed wall to wall with kirin ready to finally see themselves free and prosperous, and hopefully for good. It took some time to get everykirin quiet and ready to begin, but eventually the young mare in charge of the meeting managed to raise her voice above the din. The proposal was a simple but momentous one: the town of Sprout would join the Provisional Commune of Kiria and move from being a town liberated by the revolution to becoming a part of the revolution. It would change the town's history forever, just like the countless towns before it that had joined the fires of revolution. Little more than that needed to be said, and then it was time to vote."

This was not the first time a band of militiakirin had stopped by the nameless community of poor farmers, and she knew it would not be the last. And just like all the others, she knew what they wanted. So, calling out to her two teenage sons to wait in the field until she came back, Pepper trudged over the dry and brittle grass to the commotion where the other farmers in her community had already gathered to confront the militia.\n\nWhen she made her way to the edge of the crowd, she rubbed shoulders with her neighbor and leaned in close to be heard over the raised voices bickering back and forth at the front and center. "Is it the usual?" she asked, and her neighbor nodded. Pepper grimaced, knowing her day was about to get much more unpleasant, and slowly made her way to the front of the crowd where she could better hear the argument.\n\n"We fight to protect you!" the militia captain said, raising her voice as she strained to remain civil. "The least you can do for us is give us some food to keep fighting! How are we supposed to fight if we starve?"\n\n""We have no more food to give you," the village elder, Wheat Chaff, rebuked with a surly growl. "Every band of militia that comes through here wants our grain. Well, we gave at first. We gave and gave, and all you kirin do is take and take.But the drought means we barely have anything left. We have nothing more to give you. Go take your war and your hungry mouths elsewhere."\n\nBoth kirin glared at each other, but after a moment, the militiamare took one look around and saw how badly her band was outnumbered by angry farmers. "Concord will remember this," the mare spat, and she narrowed her eyes at Wheat. "And may Conflagration's flames take your blasted farm with her." Then they stalked off, and only when they were over the hill did Pepper let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding. Thankfully, the crisis had been averted.\n\nAt least, that was what she thought until she returned to her small plot of land only to find her farm's small granary doors wide open... and both her sons missing."

kirin_council.317.d:0 "Guarded Flame breathed in, the pungent smell of the sea filling his nose, and opened his eyes. He stood on a white, sandy shoreline with about a score of kirin in vermilion robes before him, watching him patiently. The nearest vegetation was a hundred paces away, and the waves in the swash lapped at his fetlocks and splotches of glass that dotted the sand. It was the perfect place for this kind of training, and though Guarded Flame had trained many kirin before him in this particular skill, it was dangerous, and steps had to be taken to mitigate that danger.\n\nWhen he felt they were ready, he took another breath and stepped forward. "The angry spirit of the nirik lives within each of us," he said, letting his gaze slowly pass over his pupils. "It is a dangerous thing, a creature of fire and destruction. It is our rage, our worst impulses unshackled. When we were created, Concord breathed the last spark of the Primordial Fire into ourselves, and our souls were split into two. The kirin is the creature of peace, of creation, and the nirik is the creature of violence, of destruction. This I learned when I followed the Way of Fire. But it always felt like there was a piece missing. That was when I discovered the truth through the Children of Concord.\n\n"There are three states of the kirin soul, not two," Guarded continued, and though his students tried to remain stoic and attentive, he saw a flicker of confusion pass across their faces. "The first is as we are, and the second is the nirik. But the third is a union between the two. And this is evident in the Trinity. Celestia represents peace and control. Conflagration represents violence and impulse. But the two are in unity with Concord, who balances them in equal measure. So too must we find a balance between our reason and our rage if we wish to control ourselves when in the nirik state, as the Valiants do."\n\nHe closed his eyes and reached into himself, and carefully, bit by bit, he coaxed out the raging flame in his soul. He felt the transformation overtake him, his coat turning black, his mane erupting into fire, his fangs lengthening and pushing aside his lips, but when he opened his eyes, he could still see clearly, even if the red haze pushed against his will and fought to encroach on his vision. "We will practice, one at a time, in finding this balance," he told his pupils, eliciting surprise and shock at hearing a nirik speak plainly and coherently. "It will be difficult. But there is nothing to burn here, and the ocean will soothe your flame should you lose control. Find your balance and unify your three selves. Only then will you become a true Valiant.""

Known as Valiants, these warrior-monks could join battle as ferocious nirik with full control of their faculties but blessed with the tremendous strength and mastery over fire of the nirik state, always able to calm down once the enemy was defeated and the danger had passed. The practices and methods of becoming a Valiant differed by sect and time, but the Trinity-Worshiping kirin of the Children of Concord sought to attain this control through rationalizing the representative balance of their trinity: Celestia the protector, Conflagration the destroyer, and Concord the creator.§!\n— A Journey Along the Paths and Ways of Fire"

Around her, crouching in the stagnant water of the rice paddies, were a score of armed guerillas and a couple of young kirin that served as her runners, all watching with anticipation as the Imperial oppressors blundered into the trap. Once the moment was right, she turned to a colt at her side and nodded to him. "Tell the other positions to be ready. Once the first truck goes up in smoke, we stand our ground and fight until the enemy is destroyed."\n\nThe colt nodded and galloped off, splashing through the water on lanky limbs, but he was hardly gone for a minute before another mare approached Flash. "Your plan is going to get us all killed!" she cried. "That convoy's got more than just supplies on it. It's got an entire detachment of soldiers protecting it, too, and they outnumber and outgun us.

Dayspring asked, and when Mahogany nodded, she let out a little sigh and glanced aside at the stallion next to her. "Well, first off, Kindling's right in that we need to have a democratic Commonalty, not just build off the rotten ruins of the Vermilion state. That's what did Rising Sun in; we both saw firsthoof what good trying to play at bringing a new order to Vermilion got her. So I understand why you want to go for a clean break with the past, as you advocated."\n\nKindling Flash raised an eyebrow. "And? The people need to be able to rule themselves through local democratic assemblies and recallable representatives to Vermilion. With the participation of the people, we can make a more fair Realm for all."\n\n"And you're skipping a few steps," Dayspring said. "To make that work we need the willing participation of everykirin, but there are plenty of places like Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Vermilion itself where we'll be lucky to get even a minority of the population to play along. So we can't jump straight into Commonalty. We need to build to it first." Her eyes slid over to Mahogany. "Mahogany, you've proved yourself to the Realm.

And if we're going to bring about this Commonalty that Kindling knows is our goal, then I think you're going to have to do it for real.

We must have Mahogany Blaze as our king!"\n\nThe proclamation created an uproar that seemed to shake the assembly hall with the stomping of hooves, though Mahogany could not tell if it accompanied more cheers or jeers. "This century for the Realm has been little more than the deposing and replacement of tyrants!" a voice called out from the crowd to loud agreement. "We would add to the cycle with a new one? I would like to believe that the seat of power would not corrupt Mahogany, that he would be just and fair, but this was a struggle waged for freedom, equality and democracy. And you would subvert that with a first among equals? The people fought and struggled for this. Let the people of the Realm decide our future. Give us the Commonalty that we fought for; don't replace the Matriarchy with a Patriarch!"\n\nShouting broke out, but it was ultimately Bright Burn who managed to quell it. "If the people should decide our future, then why not let them decide if they want Mahogany as well?" he called out, silencing the commotion down to low rumblings. "The people should vote on it, as they would with anything else in the Commonalty. Let them decide if they want Mahogany or not. Let this be the first vote of our new Realm!" As murmurs of agreement rose throughout the Assembly, Bright turned aside and looked at Mahogany, who seemed to be staring into the floorboards in thought. "Mahogany... Have you made up your mind? What do you think?""

kirin_council.324.d:0 "It was the day before the vote that would decide the future of the Realm, and Mahogany had gotten little sleep in the days leading up to it. He was tired and wanted to curl up and sleep forever, but even when he closed his eyes, anxiety would only allow him a fitful, restless sleep. Even having Bright Burn's warm body by his side did little to calm him.\n\nBut he had made up his mind about this long ago; it had just taken until now to find the words to say what he had to say. When he had expressed his intent to Bright Burn, the stallion had assured him that no matter what, he would be by his side and support him. Even though Mahogany knew that he would, that little reassurance over what he knew to be the truth was enough to call the assembly.\n\nThat morning, as silence fell over the assemblage of workers and peasants who had come out of their homes, fields, and factories to see him on the outskirts of Vermilion, Mahogany swallowed hard and raised his voice into the microphone standing before him. "People of Kiria, faithful under the Radiant Trinity, I thank you for being here today," he began, his voice wavering under his racing heart. But a tender look from Bright Burn at his side steeled his resolve, and he continued. "Tomorrow, the Realm will vote on whether it wants me to serve as its king or not. I will begin by saying that whatever the kirin of the Realm decide, I will honor. But I am speaking to you today, on the morning before the vote, to tell you that the crown is not something I seek. I do not want it."\n\nHe swallowed again as surprised and shocked whispers broke out in the crowd. "While I traveled the Realm finding support for the Revolution, I saw all I needed to see to know that the Realm will be in good hooves in the hooves of the people, not through some monarchical figurehead. Kiria does not need a king as much as it no longer has a need for the Matriarch Superior. And while I am flattered at the support I've seen for the idea of my kingship, I do not feel it would be in my place to rule Kiria as one. You all... you are all ready to take the first step by yourselves. It is time to finally partake of the fruit that you sowed with your own blood and tears.\n\n"If you still want to proclaim me your king, then I will take up the mantle," he concluded. "But you are ready. Vote 'No' tomorrow and make your dreams a reality. Only then, I think, will you finally know what you all are truly capable of. Thank you."\n\nBowing his head, Mahogany turned around and casually walked away from the microphone and the podium before anykirin could ask him a question. And only when he was out of sight behind the curtains did he let out a deep, deep sigh—and a surprised snort when Bright Burn kissed him."

But even though it was a vote, it seemed like everykirin in the Realm already knew the answer. The buzz was unstoppable, and the idea of the beloved Vermilion Pretender, Mahogany Blaze, taking his seat in Vermilion was all but accepted even before the polls opened.\n\nMahogany knew this too; though the throne was something he did not necessarily want, he knew it was what the kirin of the Realm wanted, and he was duty-bound to answer their call. So that evening, as the polls began to close, an assemblage of workers and peasants had gathered outside of Vermilion to hear him speak. Behind the curtain, Mahogany pressed his forehead scales against Bright Burn's for a moment, their horns briefly locking, before he stepped into the light to give them what they wanted.\n\n"Kirin of the Realm," Mahogany began, his voice wavering as he felt hundreds of eyes alight upon him. "I've seen the exit polling as I'm sure many of you have. Even if you haven't, word of mouth is a powerful thing. When the votes are counted tonight, I know that I will be your king. Though it is not something that I desired, I will assume the title on your behalf. I want to help you all, and if this is how you want me to do it, then I will.\n\n"But I will not be a ruler, not in the way the Matriarchs of the past have been," he continued, finding some steel in his voice when he saw Bright Burn smiling sweetly at him from the side of the stage. "I will know none of the material comforts of the Matriarchs, including the Vermilion Palace. I will continue to travel the Realm, to meet the people, to hear their grievances from their lips and not through notes and advisors. I will make it my duty to unite the many foals of the Realm, east and west, north and south, so that we are all once again one Kiria - a Realm healed and whole! And when my work is done, I will give up the crown and return the reins of authority to the people. Kiria will be yours to rule, as it always should be and shall be. I only hope to steer the ship out of choppy waters before the tiller is yours."\n\nAs cheers and applause rang out, Mahogany raised his voice to finish. "All faithful before Her Radiance, know that we are all equal before Concord. Just because I am your king does not make your better. Be my shepherds; see to it that I do not stray from Her Radiance's righteous path, and when the time comes, I shall rejoin the Commonalty as another simple soul.

kirin_council.350.d:0 "Underneath the concern and worry and anger that gripped Chairkirin Fickle Current and the rest of the upper echelons of the NAKP after the news broke, there was also another feeling: frustration. Frustration that unrest was allowed to foment for so long in the west. Frustration that attempts to stifle it had done nothing at best, and only further stoked it at worst. Frustration at the incompetence of the lower levels as they both struggled to understand and approach the threat, and their efforts made to conceal their failures from the brass rather than address them. At the very least, Current would make sure that those who had failed the NAKP would be part of the first counterterrorism operations to try and contain this 'Children of Concord' threat.\n\nAll those frustrations took their turn being vented in the war room between Current, Ardent Bloom, and other members of the Executive Council, but they were all resolved in one thing: if the NAKP's intelligence operations had failed to disperse the revolt before it grabbed ahold of the west, then they would crush it through any and all means possible. Hooves on the ground coupled with massed artillery bombardment, indiscriminate airstrikes against suspected rebel gathering posts, and armored columns that would crush any opposition into the dirt beneath their treads would accomplish what subterfuge had not. If the Realm's western provinces had to burn and choke on ash and smoke until the Children were punished, then so be it.\n\nOnly when the meeting was over did Ardent Bloom pull Current aside. "I have a message on behalf of the VasCorps," he said. "In recognition of the Empire's time of crisis, they have offered us three fully-equipped military formations to be put at the disposal of Civil Defence in suppressing the revolt. Their equipment rivals our best; it would be a shame to let such an opportunity go to waste."\n\n"The corporations do nothing for free, and we cannot be seen to have accepted them as gifts. It would be seen as a weakness, and nothing on the market is free," Current observed. "What do they want in exchange?"\n\n"It is not a gift, Chairkirin," Ardent assured him. "They presented us with the standard rates for their aid, though realizing this is a time of great crisis, we negotiated a discount to acquire their services for a single gold coin. Of course, realizing that the services the corporations render us far exceed the value of a coin, it would be wise to look into... other means of rewarding their generosity when all is said and done.""

Gentle Hoof to Civil Defense re: Dissuasion Tactics on the Rural Populace:\n\nPacification efforts in the Mellifluve basin continue to show promising signs of success. Recent efforts to dissuade villages along the river from joining the rebellion have noted a marked decrease in suspected rebel sympathizer activity. Responses have been varied but all trend in a positive direction: some villages are abandoned before Civil Defense arrives to implement dissuasion tactics, while others openly welcome our forces and hoof over both detained rebels and sympathizers for liquidation in a good faith gesture towards our protection. Recommend expanding activities further away from the riverbanks and show that Civil Defense can operate further inland, not just along the Great Mellifluve and its tributaries.\n\nAttached is a list of expended supplies that will need to be restocked before dissuasion operations can be continued; please deliver supplies to the usual depot:\n\n- 140,000 rounds machine gun ammunition\n- 30,000 rounds rifle ammunition\n- 250 incendiary explosives\n- 3 additional prison barges\n- 2 weeks rations for 5,000 soldiers (the rebels have scorched the fields so foraging has been less effective)\n\nAdditionally, see attached list of future villages that need dissuasion. Once resupplied with ammunition and explosives, will set out to engage in further operations. Hopefully shouldn't need to keep the pressure up too much longer; this month only 8,138 potential sympathizers and rebels were liquidated, down from last month's figure of 14,537. Looks like the message is being heard loud and clear, and villages are being more cooperative to avoid liquidation. Let's hope the trend continues."

kirin_council.352.d:0 "It seemed like the ashes of the revolt had barely settled before the Executive Council had gathered, along with the leaders of the Empire's many loyal VasCorps, in Fragrance to discuss the aftermath. Fickle Current watched the kirin around him discuss the impact of the revolt on the Empire, from suspected casualty figures to the much more important cost to the VasCorps' bottom line and damage to the Empire's economy. It would take a long time for the Empire and the corporations to rebuild their wealth following the destruction of so many profitable factories and fields due to the petulance of disgruntled peasants, and that left many of the VasCorps' leaders less than pleased. Current knew that they would expect financial aid and support from the government after they had so charitably negotiated a discounted contract for the use of their corporations' private security forces, but the drain on the Empire's already thin coffers were something that it could ill-afford.\n\nThankfully, Cypress Snow had drafted a plan before this meeting, and Current had already given him his approval to propose it to the VasCorps as a potential remedy to all their problems. "Now that the revolt is finished, it is time for the post-mortem question of: why?" Cypress began. "Why was such a fierce revolt able to gain such a firm grip on an already war-weary populace? Let us put aside the failures of the local authorities and security forces who let it fester, as the seeds of revolt should never have been sewn in the first place. Let us instead go straight to the root of the problem: the poor, primitive, and recalcitrant peasantry are fundamentally unaccepting of our beliefs in the liberating power of the markets and our devotion to the Divine Fire. Give them too much freedom, too much time to think, and they will inevitably be drawn towards wrong answers and false promises. The natural drift of the poor kirin's state of mind is toward revolt, and as such, they must be watched closely to ensure that they do not fall victim to this backwards way of thinking.\n\n"To that end, I propose that we work to redefine the relationship between the peasantry and the state," Cypress continued, while the leaders of the VasCorps listened with growing curiosity. "We shall make the peasantry wards of the state, wards of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine. She shall see to them as their mother, providing for their needs in the form of food and shelter. In exchange, they will owe her their utmost loyalty, and it will be up to all of us as the trusted instruments of the Matriarch's will to ensure that they are worked hard, watched close, and firmly disciplined. To that end, the Executive Council will work on distributing the peasantry to each of the VasCorps as their humble wards, and giving you full authority to work them as you see fit to ensure that this does not happen again. And Sorghum Foundries, as the party that suffered the most during the revolt, will be given the lion's share of wards to help rebuild their home city. I hope that sounds agreeable to everykirin?""

In exchange, the Vassal Corporations, with the aid of the NAKP, have promised to protect the citizens of Kiria, and have taken the first step in addressing inequality by abolishing wages and other 'rights' that only promote resentment and instead negotiate contracts and services with the towns under their jurisdictions.

"If you do not cancel this order, then the NAKP will owe Sycee a debt, and the funding for reimbursing their losses will come out of Fragrance's budget for the next year. Which, I believe, is an election year."\n\nCherry knew that the representative was trying to threaten her with the prospect of the NAKP shifting financial support toward competitors, but she wasn't going to let those tactics get under her coat. "There won't be an election next year if Fragrance falls!" she shouted back. "And instead of doing everything they can to shore up the city's defenses, the corporations are already cutting losses and running! What do you think it looks like to the people of Fragrance when Sycee hauls all their gold out of the NAKP's coffers and tries to ship it off somewhere else?" She snorted and flicked her tail in anger. "The kirin of Fragrance are more patriotic than Griffonian transplants like Sycee, it would seem. They used the money that Sycee would flee back to Griffonia with to at least defend our city."\n\nThe representative gritted her teeth and tried to plead with Cherry one more time. "Fragrance will never be under direct threat. The setbacks on the frontlines are temporary and reversible. Think long-term here. If we return that money to Sycee, that shows good faith in the business practices of the NAKP, and they will repay the favor. If we withhold it, then we burn bridges.

Moments to relax in the chaotic dance of ruling the NAKP and championing its efforts in the Realm left little time to have to himself, but thankfully tonight was one of those rare moments where his secretary had cleaned his schedule without telling him beforehoof. Without those little impromptu breaks and free evenings, Current knew he would work himself ragged, but thankfully somekirin else was out there to look after him.\n\nAs he sat down at his desk to read through the stack of foreign newspapers he'd had delivered to his penthouse suite in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, however, there was a sudden knock at his door. Current paused, glancing in its direction, trying to remember if he was expecting anycreature that evening, before the door suddenly burst inwards and a kirin galloped into the room, crowbar held aloft in his magical grip. The chairkirin jumped out of his seat in surprise and tried to back away, but the crazed kirin dropped the crowbar on the floor and seized the collar of Current's suit, dragging him over until they were practically nose to nose.

Ardent muttered to himself. The stallion was in poor state; it was obvious that he had run himself ragged trying to find an explanation ever since the treasurer had alerted him to the calamity. "All of our gold, a stupendous amount of wealth, gone! Vanished! I-I don't see how that's possible! Somekirin would have to have seen it disappear!"\n\n"There were no alarms tripped?" Current asked, trying to make sense of the situation himself. "No residual magic in the vault? You had our unicorn mercenaries perform thaumaturgical scans, did you not?"\n\n"All that and more!" Ardent shouted, wincing when his raised voice seemed to shout back at him from the empty, echoing vault.

This is the kind of magic that only a very skilled mage could be able to pull off. But on top of that, I contacted some zebra shamans to take a look around, and they found nothing. Nothing!" He fell to his haunches in despair. "What are we going to do? If word gets out that the NAKP is bankrupt, all of our legitimacy collapses!

If Concord sought to damn or humble him, well, she had succeeded, if only for the moment.

kirin_republic.1.t:0 "A New Fire Rises" ##unused, replaced with WS
kirin_republic.1.d:0 "Rising Sun softly smiled with pleasure as she looked out over the crowd that had gathered to hear her speak. Hundreds of kirin stood on the shores of the Great Mellifluve, where only an hour earlier, they had used pitchforks, scythes, sledgehammers, and whatever other tools they could get their hooves on to rout the garrison of Vermilion loyalists who had tried to reassert order over Chrysanthemum. The garrison had been armed with rifles, but they were only forty against four hundred. It hadn't been much of a fight at all, but now that blood had been spilled, Rising Sun knew there was no turning back.\n\n"My faithful foals!" Rising shouted, her voice carrying out over the crowd, sweet and enticing. "The Silence is over, and today, we have brought about its destined conclusion. The corrupt mystics of The Way of Fire who ruled over us from Vermilion have been cast aside from our lands, and today, The Rising Fire steps forward to do our duty to Concord. Where the hedonists in Vermilion have twisted and perverted Concord's divine will to suit their own interests, we kirin of the west stand true and stand firm to her ideals. For too long, the hedonists have oppressed the kirin of the Realm by claiming to speak with the voice of Concord, and forcing us to act as they behave through their lies. But why do they not want the common kirin to commune with Concord directly? Why do they insist that they are the only ones who can interpret her will, and then in turn tell us what her will is?\n\n"The answer is simple," she declared, her eyes coming alive like a growing flame. "Because they do not wish for us to know Concord's will. In their corruption, they have forced their will upon us, and called it Concord's. They have even ensnared our beloved Matriarch Superior in their lies. But we shall fall for them no more! The Rising Fire has always encouraged every kirin to seek to understand Concord's will on their own, and that understanding has brought us to where we are today. We all know what Concord wishes of us: she wishes us to stand strong, to stand together, and to support every kirin with equality, justice, and peace. The west has figured this out, but the rest of the Realm remains oblivious. And so they shall until we can bring The Rising Fire to the gates of Vermilion and set our Matriarch free from the clutches of those who have entangled her in lies!" She raised her hoof into the air. "Today marks the beginning of Kiria's salvation! The Rising Fire shall save Kiria from corruption and oppression! And we shall march to Vermilion and rescue the Matriarch, or we shall all die trying!""

kirin_republic.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Radios all across Kiria lit up today with the voice of Rising Sun, the leader of the Rising Fire movement in the seceded western region of Kiria. Vowing to reveal the truth of Matriarch Rain Shine's corrupt and villainous advisors, Rising Sun broke the news to all of Kiria that it was Vermilion's own agents, the Banner of the Covered Cage, that was responsible for the complete annihilation of the prospering town of Sunrise several decades ago. Whether Matriarch Rain Shine did not have the chance to break this news to her subjects herself or was complicit in its secrecy, none can say for certain. Rising Sun turned the news of the massacre into a rallying cry for kirin all across the Realm to join the Rising Fire in saving Kiria by freeing Rain Shine from the corrupt advisors in the capital. Her words have already begun to stir up support from commonkirin throughout the fractured realm, threatening the stability of her competitors."

kirin_republic.3.d:0 ""Citizens of Kiria, my name is Rising Sun. I am speaking to you from a radio station in Chrysanthemum, and I have an important message for you. Already there are countless lies in circulation about who I am and what the Rising Fire stands for, all spread by kirin who are not only my enemies, but the enemies of a free Kiria, and the enemies of Concord Herself. The Rising Fire teaches us that Concord is different things to different kirin, and so I shall channel this teaching into my address for the many ears I am reaching throughout the Realm.\n\n"For the devout followers of the Rising Fire, wherever you may be, and for the citizens of the Fraternal Republic of Kiria, know this: a new day has dawned, and the sunrise is beautiful and brilliant. We shall all march forward together to bring about the blessed glory of this brand new day, and our teachings and way of life shall free and liberate all of our brothers and sisters still languishing under oppression. Our just cause cannot be stopped.\n\n"For those longing to be liberated from corruption, from hedonism, from injustice, know this: The Rising Fire marches to throw off your shackles, and to welcome you into our cause. You will know only peace, and duty, and our indomitable faith in our most holy Concord. No longer will you be forced to bow before a corrupt clergy, forced to pay tithes you cannot afford just to provide them lavish riches and wasteful excesses. What you earn by your blood, sweat, and tears will be yours to keep, and together, we shall cast down the parasites that drink your blood and force you into ruin. Our righteous cause cannot be stopped.\n\nFor our most holy Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, who languishes in her gilded cage in Vermilion, know this: our armies march to your summons, and the hour of your freedom will soon be upon you. You are the most divine creature in this mortal realm, and your union with Concord's divinity entitles you to the right to rule over the kirin people. But you are beset upon all sides by those that would use you and deceive you, kirin that claim to be your friends but use your name for their own selfish ends. Though your words may be controlled by the priests who claim to speak for you, rebuke them at every opportunity you can! Speak in the defense of the Rising Fire! The people of Kiria must know the truth! Our holy cause cannot be stopped!\n\n"And for those of you who would stand against the Rising Fire, know this: your fates have been sealed, and your end is coming soon. Repent and join the Rising Fire, or burn in your sin. Our mighty cause cannot be stopped!""

kirin_republic.4.t:0 "Divine Defense and Overwhelming Offense"
kirin_republic.4.d:0 "Rising Sun had gathered her closest confidants about her in the central chamber of Chrysanthemum's largest temple. She had made the space her center of command for the time being, and she felt some sense of irony about it. Here, in these perfumed chambers, she had once studied the Way of Fire as a young acolyte, and had spent countless hours debating the mystics on theology. Now, so many years later, she had returned as the senior-most priestess of the Rising Fire, and this grand temple would be the first coal that would set Kiria ablaze with righteous passion.\n\nGathered about her were several kirin she trusted the most. On her left was Dayspring Rose, the acolyte she had taken under her wing, and on her right was Kindling Flash, one of the most influential grassroots preachers in the west, and the stallion from whom Rising Sun had first learned of the Rising Fire while in Verdant. Sitting opposite them were the soldiers Tinder Blaze and Fern Thorn, two of the precious few kirin loyal to the Rising Fire with any kind of military experience whatsoever. Rising Sun and her companions listened in dutiful silence as Tinder Blaze explained their situation. "The simple fact of the matter is devotion and fervor will only get us so far. You can get a hundred peasants to charge in the name of Concord, but they will all be killed by a hundred shots from a hundred riflekirin at a hundred yards. Our troops, if you could call them that, are equipped with antique swords, farm equipment, and primitive firearms. Once Vermilion recovers from the shock of our violent secession, we will be crushed in short order."\n\n"Concord would not allow her true faithful to be so short an order," retorted a priestess of minor reknown, whose name eluded Rising Sun. "She will protect us on the field of battle and bring a swift end to our enemies."\n\n"Concord is not here to solve our problems for us; like a good mother, She provides us with the means to attain our success, and it is up to us to accomplish it." Dayspring Rose's rebuke was wise beyond her years, and Rising Sun nodded in approval of apt quoting of Concord's teachings. Her protege then turned to the soldiers. "If this is what Concord has provided us, then it is up to us to find success with it. How can we do that, Bannerkirin?"\n\n"We will have to fight unconventionally," Fern Thorn concluded. "We will never win a pitched battle, but if we carefully maneuver and deploy our forces, we can bait Vermilion into traps and ambushes. If we encircle our enemy a few banners at a time, no amount of firepower or discipline will save them from destruction when peasants ready to die in Concord's name charge them from all sides. We will trade land for lives where necessary, and if we are careful enough, we can make sure that the lives lost are the heretics', not ours.""
kirin_republic.4.a:0 "This is Concord's will, and thus it shall be done."

kirin_republic.5.t:0 "A Call to Arms"
kirin_republic.5.d:0 "Thousands of kirin had gathered in the fields outside of Chrysanthemum's ancient walls, packed shoulder to shoulder as they tried to get a look at the orange-robed mare standing on the bed of a wagon in their midst. They were kirin from every walk of life, from faithful and devoted acolytes of the Rising Fire to the peasants and volunteers who had answered the call to fight for their freedom from the oppressors in Vermilion. But they were all united in one belief, the belief that if they did not fight, then they would languish in slavery, and the mare standing before them was the only one who could save them.\n\nRising Sun looked out at the kirin assembled all around her, and as she began to speak, she slowly turned in a circle, making sure all of the kirin present had an opportunity to see her face, meet her eyes, and know that the words she spoke were the complete and utter truth of the world. "We are all, each of us, a soldier who fights in Concord's name," she proclaimed. "Though we may not all fight on the field of battle, we each find a way to contribute to our divine and righteous war against the heretics and nonbelievers who rule over our country. With our words, with our weapons, with our sacrifices, we shall march through our beautiful Realm, overcoming the ineffectual challenges of those who would stand against Concord's divine will. Like a fire sweeping over the dry grasses of a plain scorched under the stifling summer sun, so too shall our cause sweep over Kiria, growing stronger the longer we march. In every town, in every village, we shall find more kirin to join our cause, and our strength will grow while those who stand against us grow weak and weary. We shall overwhelm our enemies with our indomitable will, and the Rising Fire will be the flame that cleanses and scours the land! We shall march onto Vermilion, and when we do, the heretics of old, the Way of Fire, shall be no more. No more shall they oppress us! No more shall they bleed us for everything we possess to satiate their selfish greed! We shall take Kiria back from the hooves who have poisoned it so, and in so doing, we shall once again restore the Realm to Concord's divine rule! Fight on, keep the faith, and we shall have victory everlasting!"\n\nHer words were met with thunderous cries and the stamping of hooves. Some kirin were even weeping in their passion, and a euphoric frenzy rolled through the crowd. Soon, a chant had been taken up, echoing over and over again, screamed into the heavens by a thousand voices:"
kirin_republic.5.a:0 ""For Concord and Kiria! For Concord and Kiria!""

kirin_republic.6.t:0 "Rising Sun's Doctrine of Momentum"
kirin_republic.6.d:0 "Artillery rumbled in the background, many miles away, providing its own thunder to rival that of the storm bearing down on Commander Ember Glow's camp. The winds and rain tore at the canvas flaps of her tent, and water seeping in under the bottom was slowly turning her personal quarters into a quagmire of mud. A map was laid out on the wooden table in front of her, along with a battery-powered radio in the corner. Through it came Rising Sun's voice, making yet another patriotic proclamation to the kirin of the Fraternal Republic, her bravado and passion a serviceable distraction from the unpleasant weather. "Kirin of the Republic!" Rising Sun proclaimed through the static. "As we grow in strength, our enemies, the decadent Vermilion Realm, rotting and rotten to the core, shall grow ever weaker. The balance of power rests on a single point, and as one of us rises, the other shall fall. For every mile we take, every heretic we end, every foal of Concord we liberate, our cause grows stronger, and Vermilion's pathetic resolve grows weaker. We shall march onto the Matriarch's holy city ever faster, ever stronger, and Vermilion's vise grip on our beautiful Realm shall crumble by the hour. For there is no force as great as that of our Mother, our beautiful Concord, and the divine will through which she empowers us. Her favor will turn the tide of the war and spread the Rising Fire throughout the Realm!\n\n"Times may seem dire now," Rising Sun continued, her voice dropping from impassioned to reassuring, "but it will not always be so. All we must do is survive the initial onslaught from the heretics, and we shall emerge stronger than ever before. Turn away their clumsy strike and deliver a deadly riposte, fighting with every ounce of your being to overwhelm and destroy our enemy. We will hold the line, we will counterattack, and we will soon go on the offensive. Remember, everything you do, you do for Kiria and Concord! Fight until your dying breath, and then fight some more! Concord's Holy Fires shall be our divine fury!"\n\nEmber Glow could only look up from her map and shake her head as Rising Sun's voice was replaced with thunderous applause. In place of tactics and doctrine, the First Priestess relied on passion and divine favor to secure victory for the Republic. But with inexperienced soldiers, little supplies, and no other option, the Commander could only hope that Rising Sun's impassioned pleas would somehow turn the tide."
kirin_republic.6.a:0 "The only thing we have on our side is Concord. It will have to be enough."

kirin_republic.7.t:0 "The Voice of Concord"
kirin_republic.7.d:0 ""For what do we, the pious, the true believers, have to fear in death? There is nothing to fear behind the veil of death. There will not be darkness or despair; rather, each and every one of us, when we die, will be welcomed into Concord's loving embrace, and the spark that lives within us will rejoin the great Primordial Fire that She so carefully tends to."\n\nKindling Flash looked out over the kirin gathered around him as he let his words sink in. They had come from nothing, the downtrodden peasants as poor as the land they worked through the Silence, but now the Rising Fire had risen them to greatness. They were the instruments of Concord's will, and he was Her herald. "But just because we should not fear death does not mean we should hasten to embrace it," Kindling Flash continued. "Each of us may be a spark of Her will, but without fuel, even the greatest fires will wither and die. It is up to us to provide fuel for Her fire, to toil in Her service, to bring about the manifestation of Her most divine will before our own sparks fade away. In the battles to come, many of us will fade away as we give the ultimate sacrifice for Concord, but our work will fuel the fire that will set the Realm ablaze in heavenly light. And against the tumultuous winds of our enemies, the heretics and hypocrites that would see our work undone, the foreigners and conquerors that would enslave us, we shall stand firm. We shall never retreat, and we shall never surrender! We fight with Concord's blessing, and her blessing will give us victory! Let all who take up the torch of her blessed will be hailed as heroes, and let all who cower from their destiny be thrown into darkness!"\n\nAt that moment, the artillery placed on the hills around them began to fire with a frenzy, and Kindling Flash grabbed a rifle in his magic and lifted it into the air. "We fight for Concord! We fight for Kiria! We fight for the Rising Fire! And today, we will be victorious! Now, my brothers and sisters of the faith...""

kirin_republic.8.d:0 ""The Rising Fire fights for the Matriarch! The Rising Fire fights for Kiria! The Rising Fire needs you, sons and daughters of Kiria, to fight in its name!"\n\nThe kirin was dressed in the simple red robes of the Rising Fire, and in his magic he held dozens of bells fashioned to a wooden rod that he shook to summon a clatter of jangling wherever he went. This was his fourth trip up and down the main street of the tiny village of Chenar, and he had already amassed a small collection of kirin to parade around with him. Many carried the few worldly possessions they needed with them in burlap bags, while some followed with nothing at all. But what they lacked in material wealth, they shared in spiritual and patriotic fervor. All were willing to fight in the name of the Rising Fire, and all would give everything they had to see it triumph over the Fraternal Republic's enemies.\n\nAt the end of town, two kirin, one old, one young, hugged a young mare standing in the front lawn of a hovel, her bags packed with clothes, food, and an antique sword. "Do not go, Cerise," the old kirin said, a stallion who had seen numerous winters pass before eyes now heavy with tears. "The farm needs you. Your parents in the fields need you. You know nothing of war. What will you do with that sabre when the soldiers of Vermilion fight with rifles? You will be killed for nothing!"\n\n"If I die, I will have died for something, grandfather" the young mare said, her voice confident and adamant. "It is my duty, my patriotic duty to Kiria and to Concord Herself, to save the Matriarch and the Realm. Do you not hear the mystic's words? Everykirin must do their part. I have been practicing my swordwork, I am strong and fit, and I will do my part to save the Realm. If you cannot give me your blessing to fight for Kiria, then at least give me your prayers to keep me safe."\n\nAt this, she gave her grandfather one last hug, and then slipped out of his embrace to join the procession in the streets. Her grandfather broke down into sobs as she turned tail on him and left, and Cerise did her best to block out his cries with her house disappearing behind her. It was only when she had made it to the town square that she felt her younger brother cling onto her hind leg. "I'm coming with you!" the colt announced. "Together, we'll fight for glory and make mom and dad proud. We'll save Kiria together, and we'll save them!"\n\nCerise grinned as she turned aside to hug her brother. "Yes we will, Cinnabar," she said, pressing her horn against his. "We'll be the heroes Kiria needs. Together.""

kirin_republic.9.t:0 "Concord Giveth..."
kirin_republic.9.d:0 ""The blessings of Concord be upon you and your family," the mystic said, vermilion powder coating her cleft hoof as she rubbed it on the nose scales of the farmer standing before her. "For all that you give, Concord will return to you a hundredfold, when the flames of the Rising Fire burn brightest at the break of day."\n\nBehind the mystic, a pair of soldiers dressed in the crimson uniforms of the Rising Fire's militia loaded up a beat-up wooden wagon with sheafs of wheat, barrels of carrots, and crates of onions and cabbages. The plants on the fields around them were bare, freshly harvested, and more farmers worked between the rows of crops to package the produce in crates for transportation. The farmer before the mystic, with the vermilion dye freshly rubbed onto her scales, bowed her head in deference, but she watched her family at work in the fields with a hint of worry. "I remain one of Concord's faithful," she said, and she slowly raised her head. "But what of my family? We are willing to give all that we can for the soldiers on the front, but how can we survive the winter if Concord asks for all of our harvest?"\n\nThe mystic only smiled sweetly back at her. "Concord provides for all the faithful in their time of need, just as you have provided for the Rising Fire in the moment of its greatest challenges. Through her benevolent wisdom, she will ensure that you will be cared for through the winter, and your family fed." She turned to the soldiers, who nodded back at her and began to haul the cart away. Moments later, the mystic gave the farmer one last nod and departed along with them.\n\nThe farmer could only stand in place and watch them go, and she worriedly bit her lip as she watched her harvest disappear down the road. "But how?" she wondered aloud, the question remaining unanswered in the empty fields."

kirin_republic.10.d:0 "Rising Sun stood before the two kirin brought before her, one mare and one stallion, as they bowed their heads in greeting to the chief priestess of the Rising Fire. They were the commanders of her two newest banners, the Banner of the Scouring Flame, and the Banner of the Cleansing Fire, together in union forming the Sanctified Banners, and they each had a job to do. "The Sanctified Banners are the newest forces committed to the fight to uphold Concord's benevolent authority, but you shall not see action on the battlefield," she told them. "Yours is a war that shall be fought and won far from the front lines. Yours is a war of the soul, a war to protect the spark of the Primordial Flame that burns within each and every one of us. Your actions will be just as important to our victory as the actions of the soldiers fighting in the mud and blood at the front."\n\nShe turned to the stallion on the left. "Golden Lumen, you are my commander for the Banner of the Scouring Flame. To you, I entrust the important task of following the soldiers on the front lines and making sure that our territory is pacified and compliant to the Rising Fire. You will go to [Root.Capital.GetName] and conduct anti-partisan operations there, where Vermilion loyalists are spreading lies among our people like a disease. You will strike hard, and strike fast. You will smoke them out like rats, and like rats, they will be dealt with like the vermin they are. Make sure that your solution sends a clear message to those that would oppose the Rising Fire."\n\nThen she turned to the mare on her right. "Linseed Gilding, you are my commander for the Banner of the Cleansing Fire. To you, I entrust the important task of maintaining the spiritual purity and devotion of the Republic. You will travel to the village of Sunflower in the Jade Expanse and cleanse the heretical and corrupting influences that infest that city. There, they believe that there should be no priests or mystics, that everykirin is able to commune freely with Concord. But while nokirin should ever truly be separated from Concord, how can they hope to understand their communion without the mystics who have studied to guide them? They will fall astray and be misled, and their heresy will destroy the Republic from within. Their misguided beliefs must not be allowed to spread. I want a stop put to those heretical practices, permanently."\n\nBoth kirin bowed before Rising Sun in acknowledgement, and she dismissed them with a wave of her hoof. "Go, then. See to it that your missions are a success. I eagerly await news of your accomplishments.""

But you know the terrain better than the dogs of Vermilion, and their numbers will not save them when the fire of Concord's fury crashes down upon them. Be with your families and get some rest. We march at first light tomorrow."\n\nThe bannerkirin commander watched the kirin of the village disperse back to their homes, many sharing excited yet nervous whispers about the glory to come tomorrow. Yet there would be little glory for them to share in tomorrow; they would likely be killed almost to the last, and those that did survive the assault would have no fond memories of the horrors they were about to witness. It bothered the commander, and she turned away to return to her tent.\n\nHalfway there, her subordinate caught up to her. "Is something wrong, ma'am?" the younger kirin asked. "If you're worried about the battle tomorrow, I have the utmost confidence in the conscripts. They're ready to fight and die for the Republic and for Concord."\n\n"I have no doubt in the inevitability of our success," the commander responded, slowing a half-step for her subordinate to fall in beside her. "But it will not come without great cost to the kirin of this village. This isn't the first time I've had to recruit the local population into an impromptu vanguard. They aren't here to fight; they're here to die, to buy time for the banner to make up ground and start our assault. They die so the soldiers like us don't have to."\n\n"Doubts may plague us, commander, but we must remember that we all fight and we all sacrifice for the good of the Realm," the other kirin assured her. "Every kirin that is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice brings us one step closer to victory. We can never lose faith in the righteousness of our cause, that we do what we must to create a better Realm. The means may saddle us with guilt, but surely that guilt is better than living with the knowledge that we did not do everything we could to bring about a more perfect Realm?" She nodded to herself and added, "That guilt would be the most bitter of all to me, ma'am."\n\nThe bannerkirin commander slowly shook her head. "You may be right. It is better to sacrifice and win than to be timid and lose. But that does not mean it gets easier to send kirin into the jaws of certain death." She sighed and offered the lieutenant a salute. "Get some rest. We need to be in position to do our part when they do theirs tomorrow. Otherwise, it's all for naught.""

kirin_republic.12.d:0 ""Come on, Daddy! The Republic needs our help!" A kirin filly banged a tin cup against a large metal wok she held in her flickering magic, skipping in circles around a stallion hefting a wheelbarrow in his magic. Inside the wooden wheelbarrow were all sorts of metalware, from pots and pans to old farming equipment like trowels, scythes, and spades. The two kirin joined a small procession of villagers, all carrying their own metalware, to a great stone furnace in the center of town.\n\n"There are things we can live without, Comet," the father said to his daughter. "But I still do not think giving up our wok to the Republic is a good idea. How will Mommy cook your favorite meals?"\n\n"With fire!" Comet exclaimed, as if it was the most obvious answer in the world. "We're kirin, that means we can be fire and stuff! That's what the mare in the red robes in town said! That's why we gotta do our part!"\n\nThe father frowned at the congregation of kirin in the center of town, surrounding the furnace. One by one, each kirin deposited their metalware into the heart of the furnace, where a great crucible heated by nirik melted it down into crude pig iron. The mare in the red robes, a priestess of the Rising Fire, preached with fiery passion about the sacrifices everykirin must make to the Realm and to Concord, and her words whipped the crowd into such a frenzy that kirin would let their passions get the better of them and slip into the nirik state, only to hop into the furnace with the other nirik and add their heat to the fire. It was almost blasphemous—wasn't the point of the kirin religion to prevent the temptations of the nirik state? But Kiria had changed so much in such a short time that he did not know for certain anymore.\n\nIt wasn't long before father and daughter made their way to the front of the line, and Comet giggled gleefully as she hurled the family wok into the furnace. "We're doing our part!" she proudly proclaimed, though her father only managed a smile for her sake. His thoughts were on more pressing concerns, such has how to prepare dinner when they returned from town. But the look on Comet's face convinced him he was doing the right thing. He had to be; but he could only hope for his daughter's sake that she was right."

It is the heart of the Fraternal Revolution, and it shall withstand any attack or siege by our cowardly enemies! So long as one pious and patriotic citizen of this city lives it will not fall!"\n\nBannerkirin Chaplain-Commander Hot Air proudly puffed out her chest at those words, her gaze wandering over her awed crowd—of foals. Fifteen or twenty foals, chaperoned by one sleeping grandparent in a rocking chair in the back, had gathered around Hot Air's small stage, wide eyes fixated on the bannerkirin, or perhaps the couple of kirin hanging from the gallows behind her, each with a placard hanging around their name stating their crimes. Though the crimes written down on each placard, such as the hoarding of food or shirking conscription, probably meant nothing to the illiterate foals in front of her, Hot Air couldn't afford to be picky with her grand speech. After all, with most of the town's adult populace either already fighting on the front or busy building defenses around the neighborhood, she was just happy to have any kind of audience whatsoever. "You are the strength of the Rising Fire, the backbone that will allow it to weather any heretical assault by our enemies!" she proudly proclaimed. "If this city falls, it will not be the end of the fight. You will go to ground and fight anywhere, any way, at any time you can, until the conquerors have no choice but to flee before their occupation becomes their doom! You will inform your fellow citizens of their patriotic duty to fight until the bitter end comes, no matter how it may, and that to submit to the enemy is a cowardly affront to Concord herself! And lest you think our only foes be those from beyond our borders, think again! The enemy could be among us, and we must be ever vigilant for traitors in our ranks!"\n\nAt this point, one of the foals bravely ventured to raise his hoof in the air. "Missus Bannerkirin?" the colt asked, shrinking back a bit from her intimidating attention. "Umm... I have to go to the outhouse...""

kirin_republic.14.d:0 "The rafts glided silently along the waters of the Great Mellifluve, the kirin huddled on them quieter than the dead as they guided them into the reed-lined shore of the river's eastern bank. The mud and plants softened the impact of their landing, and like wraiths, three dozen kirin swarmed off the rafts and stole up on the village overlooking the water without a sound. Steel glinted under the starlight, with some blades catching a yellow edge from the candles burning in the windows of nearby homes.\n\nA pair of soldiers on sentry duty chatted under the flickering electric light of the town administrator's office, rifles slung around their shoulders. It had been another quiet night for them, save for the occasional distant rumble of artillery far to the north. But that changed in an instant when a ferocious rebel yell sounded from all around the village. They both jumped and raised their weapons, but were cut down in a hail of bullets as kirin clad in black and crimson burst into the light, smashing through windows or kicking down doors in an intense coordinated assault. Screaming and shouting broke out throughout the village as the town's garrison tried to respond, but it was a hopeless endeavor. Within half an hour, the entire garrison had been killed or driven from the streets, and teams of kirin proudly wearing the colors of the Rising Fire began to move from building to building, chasing out anykirin inside and setting fire to the contents.\n\nSoon, all the marauders gathered in front of the town library and forced open the doors. As soon as they entered, they immediately began to raid the shelves, pocketing any and all literary material they could get their hooves on, and dumping scrolls into sacks by the score. But they all paused when one of their members called out in surprise, and moments later hauled over a kirin stallion with thick rimmed glasses perched on his scaly nose, depositing him on the floor in front of a circle of raiders. The leader of their gang, a slender kirin with white coat and red scales, used her magic to get a look at the stallion's face and raised an eyebrow. "Sage Snoot, is it? We heard you might be around here."\n\n"P-Please, d-don't hurt m-me," Sage stammered, trying to shield his face with his forelegs. "This is a B-Bookstorm, right? The locals m-mentioned it. B-But I thought you were only after b-books!"\n\n"Knowledge is what we're after," the mare corrected him, and she turned to her second-in-command. "He's a learned kirin, a scientist of some renown around these parts. Take him with us; the Rising Fire will benefit greatly from his service.""

kirin_republic.15.d:0 "Little Lotus shivered in the rain. She huddled in the mud at the bottom of a ditch alongside a muddy road, the angry black clouds of the storm blotting out almost any light from the sky. Her stomach ached from hunger, and her knee was swollen and turning an angry red. The laceration running its length had started weeping yellow with pus, and it hurt to move. But the throbbing ache was the only thing that reminded her she was alive.\n\nShe hadn't been prepared for war. She and her sister, Orchid, had been conscripted with half the adults from her little village, given a sword, a week's rations, and a canteen of water, and sent to the front lines to fight for the Republic. Their first contact with the enemy from Vermilion had been a disaster. Vanguards had shattered her ad hoc regiment with fire and fury in minutes, and the survivors had scattered to the winds, fleeing for their lives. Lotus didn't know where her sister was; she didn't know if Orchid was alive or dead. Lotus had fled into the woods when the kirin next to her lost his horn to a bullet, and afterwards, she had been too terrified to go back and look for Orchid. Instead, she only fled deeper into the woods, though her flight turned into a limp when she slipped on a mossy rock, fell, and sliced her hind knee open on a spur of shale jutting out from the ground. From there, she had limped for three days until she found Banner-Sergeant Last Stand, who had taken her into his unit of survivors. But instead of retreating west, he had advanced to the east, and promised to personally shoot anykirin that shirked their duty to Concord and the Rising Fire. They were to fight behind enemy lines, attacking anything they could to disrupt the supplies of the Vermilion loyalists. Even from the front lines, they could still see the Rising Fire to glory.\n\nA bird's call sounded out from the nearby trees, though Lotus knew it wasn't a bird, but a warning. Grimacing as she forced herself to peek over the edge of the ditch, Lotus saw a column of two dozen kirin escorting a couple of wagons laden with supplies moving toward her. Swallowing hard, she retreated back into the ditch and pulled her sword out of the cloth protecting it. The supply train was wandering right into Last Stand's ambush, and as soon as she heard the signal, she was to leap out of the ditches and undergrowth with the rest of the survivors and attack it. The ambush party had just as many kirin as the escort, but Lotus shivered when she saw that the escort had modern rifles with shiny bayonets fixed on the end. They were well-fed, well-equipped, and well-trained; Lotus was starving, sick, and scared. But when she heard the signal and the cry went up from the sides of the road, she forced herself to stand and hobble toward the wagon, only to lock eyes with a soldier who pointed his rifle at her and fired."

"It's the same story all across the country. I wouldn't expect it to be any different here in the army camp."\n\nThe other kirin in the camp, Kindling Flash, flashed her an apologetic smile and sat down across from her, a cup of tea in his own magic as well. "Well, while the Rising Fire may have cut out all the wasteful excesses of the mystics of the Way of Fire, the temples in Chrysanthemum are still better supplied than an army camp near the front lines. How goes the work there, old friend? I've been so busy keeping morale up at the front that I haven't had the time to check in on the progress you've made in creating our new government."\n\n"Our people are receptive to our work," Dayspring assured him. "They're a pious and plain folk that have been abandoned by Vermilion for so long. But their loyalty is beautiful and humbling. We have so little to give them, yet we ask so much of them. Their willingness to give, and give without complaint, assures me that what we're doing is right. Just."\n\n"The kirin of the west are hardy creatures," Kindling agreed with her. "They are content with life's simple pleasures, not the lavish frivolities of Vermilion. Yet even still, I sometimes cannot help but feel like we betray their trust. We requisition their supplies and conscript them en masse into our armies, all to emerge victorious in a struggle to topple an apathetic regime that has plagued them for so long. We offer them little choice in the matter, only the promise of a better tomorrow."\n\n"Have faith in Rising Sun's plan," Dayspring Rose said. "My mentor has thought this all out at length. She understands the necessity of the measures we take. And the people do too. We show them care, which is far more than Vermilion ever showed them, and tell them that they rule themselves now. They are liberated under the Rising Fire in a way they never knew they could be liberated before. They are wholly devoted to our cause because we earned their trust, and they know as well as you and I that one day all their struggles will be worth it." She picked up her teacup and took another sip, and when she lowered it, her words were animated with passion and belief. "Tough times require tough choices, Kindling. But these tough choices we make will create a better world when the fires of war die down once more.""

All around him, a crowd of peasants and soldiers had gathered, certainly more kirin than there were houses in the town. They watched him speak with wide eyes and rapt attention, and the more his words found their ears, the wider slight smiles became.\n\n"We love Concord, and we love Kiria," Kindling Flash proclaimed. "Through our piety and our patriotism, we will achieve peace and prosperity. Our Fraternal Republic is not a perfect nation by any means, of course not. What nation is perfect on its first try? But the important thing to remember is that we are working through our flaws, together, side by side, to overcome them. The shortages, the rationing, the fighting, the hardship, all of that are the trials by which we shall temper our movement into a perfect utopia. After all, Concord does not grant Her blessings to those who are unworthy of them. We must prove to Her that we are worthy, that Her faith in our race as the custodians of the Last Spark was not misplaced.\n\n"And what will Her blessings look like?" Kindling continued, posing the question to his audience. "I know what they will be, for I have seen them in the flames and in my meditations, and I have watched Concord spell them for us in the fireworks in the night sky. The Fraternal Republic's future is to become a temporal dominion-to-be of Concord, where all shall want for nothing. There will be enough food for every family to feast upon every night. There will be enough shelter for everykirin to sleep with a roof over their heads. There will be enough honest work for every kirin to be fulfilled, enough clothing for everykirin to protect themselves from the elements. We will all have autonomy, liberty, equality, and fraternity under our great democracy, and nokirin shall be exploited or oppressed by those who would seek to profit off of their suffering. A perfect utopia, shaped in Concord's love, modeled after Her benevolent wisdom!"\n\nA cheer went up from the crowd, and a broad smile formed on Kindling's muzzle. "We are all children of Concord, and thus we are all brothers and sisters. We are a family, and so we must all love each other as a family!"\n\nAs the crowd cheered Kindling's last proclamation, a figure watched from the shadow of a nearby building, lips pursed.

kirin_republic.19.d:0 "Rising Sun gently set the latest reports from her banners on the frontlines into a wooden box and closed it. Then, with slow and purposeful movements, she rose from her study within Chrysanthemum's temple and moved toward the balcony overlooking the city below her. It was nighttime, or just about to be, as the last of the orange glow from the sun faded from the evening sky. Below her, the windows of the buildings came to life with candlelight, and shadows moved within them as kirin retired for the night. They were safe from the fighting and could go to sleep without worrying about Vermilion's dogs pounding down their doors in the middle of the night... for now.\n\nRising Sun allowed herself a small frown as she turned the words in those reports over in her mind. The situation at the front was a desperate one—though it was not like she had ever expected it to be anything else. The war against Vermilion was winnable, but it would not be won without colossal sacrifice on the part of every kirin in the west. Alongside the sacrifices of food and material, there were also sacrifices of the mind and heart to make as well. As much as she championed the moral justice and piety of the Rising Fire, Rising Sun knew that honor would only doom her movement to utter failure. There was no room for piety and ideology in the dirty business it would take to crush Vermilion under her hoof; instead, every kirin must be willing to harden themselves to do what they had to do to win. Ruthless cunning would be Vermilion's undoing, and as Rising Sun watched the shadows shift about in the buildings surrounding the temple, she realized that there was a tool as of yet almost entirely untapped by her movement.\n\nShe looked to the east, where the armies of Vermilion were approaching. The front line was too long and her people too few to stop Vermilion's advance, but the Rising Fire was a movement of the people. She began to formulate a plan, a gamble, that would see the Fraternal Republic triumph over her enemies. Every indefensible position would have to be abandoned, the soldiers pulled back and concentrated for decisive strikes where they would be needed, while the kirin who remained would fight behind enemy lines. Everykirin in every town would be expected to attack Vermilion's garrisons wherever and whenever they could, disrupt the supply lines of the Republic's enemies, and wage a perpetual guerilla war to grind Vermilion's soldiers and resolve into dust. Rising Sun knew the reprisals would be harsh and brutal, and the partisans left behind to fight in the name of the Rising Fire would be exterminated to the last. Thousands upon thousands of kirin would die, but it was a sacrifice she needed to make if she was to have any hope of winning the war for her people. Their sacrifices would buy her forces time, and once Vermilion was too weak to fight any longer, she would spring her trap and unleash the full fury of the Rising Fire upon the crumbling resolve of her enemies.\n\nIt would be an inglorious war, but one Rising Sun knew she would win."

The little town had been all he'd known in his twelve short years of life, and soon it would be naught but ashes. His home was gone, his neighbors' homes were gone, the entire village was gone, put to the torch by several soldiers, most of them teenagers little older than him. It was all part of First Priestess Rising Sun's plan to bleed Vermilion into submission by leaving nothing for them to take but ashes, and he knew he should be happy to play such a role in the downfall of the corrupt mystics. But all he found in his stomach was a hollow sadness as his life turned into orange fire and black smoke.\n\n"Black Briar!" A filly called out to him, and Black Briar looked over his shoulder to see Petrichor trotting over. "There you are!" she said when she made it to his side, her saddlebags stuffed with all the worldly possessions she could fit in them. "I was wondering where you were. I thought maybe you stayed back to help the soldiers burn the town down."\n\n"No," Black Briar said, but he could only frown at the flames. "What are we gonna do now, though? Our parents are fighting the war, and when they're done, they won't have a town to come back to. How are they gonna find us when it's all over?"\n\n"The soldiers will help them find us, don't worry!" Petrichor chirped. "Besides, my auntie Reed will look after us. She lives in the city, and the soldiers won't burn that down. Cities are too big and stuff for stuff like that.

Curious, the two colts hurried to the front of the procession, wondering what all the noise was about, when they spotted a kirin dressed in mudstained red robes standing on top of the roof of the village's well. Surrounding them, disgruntled villagers glared up at the kirin Anise recognized as one of the Rising Fire's bannerkirin mystic-commanders, who beseeched them in a pleading tone.\n\n"The Rising Fire needs anykirin, anykirin willing to continue the fight, to join with us," the bannerkirin pleaded to the assembled villagers. "The survivors of our banner will be falling back into the forest to continue the fight behind enemy lines, but there are so few of us who aren't wounded and able to fight. If we are to succeed, we need fresh ponies willing to fight in the name of Concord!"\n\nBut unlike the words of the mystics and recruiters that had come through Anise's village last month, where they had found an enthusiastic audience, the bannerkirin's words were met with anger and hostility. "You took all of our able-bodied mares and stallions last month!" somekirin from the crowd shouted up at him. "Mothers and grandmothers sent their foals and grandfoals to fight with you. Now you want more?" "What happened to our volunteers?" somekirin else asked. "Where are they now?" A third voice challenged the bannerkirin with words that were almost treasonous. "Vermilion had us pay our tithe in gold and crops, not our foals! At least they had the decency to leave our families alone!"\n\nThe bannerkirin on the well could only wince at the angry accusations and questions. "Nokirin should have to send away their children or siblings to war," he said, doing his best to mollify the hostile crowd. "But these are dark times. The armies of Vermilion bear down upon us at this very moment, and we need everykirin who can fight to fight for the Rising Fire! There will be nothing left if you don't!"\n\n"There will be nothing left if we do fight," somekirin in the crowd retorted, and their words were picked up in an angry grumble. "Die in the woods, bannerkirin. You won't have any more of our families!" At that, the crowd began to disperse, deaf to the bannerkirin's pleas to not turn their backs on the Rising Fire.\n\nBut Anise remained, seemingly rooted to the spot. He remembered how his older sister had left to fight when the banners came last month. Maybe she was still out there somewhere? He would never know if he stayed in the village, but if he followed the soldier...\n\nHe turned to Sesame and gave his little brother a hug. "I'm gonna find Coriander," he told his brother.

Outside, gunfire and screaming created a terrible sound of death, and the rumbling of distant artillery coupled with the thundering of nearby explosions added a terrible bass boom to the noise. It had been that artillery that had ripped her home apart and had killed her husband, and that artillery had shattered a pot and lodged a piece of clay shrapnel as large as her hoof deep inside her gut. Given enough time, it would be the death of her, too.\n\nShe coughed weakly and grimaced with her bloodstained teeth as another stab of pain throbbed in her abdomen. Her thoughts went out to her children, all four of them, and she wondered if they were safe or if Vermilion's artillery had killed them too. She had sent them running with her sister at the last moment, right before the attack began, knowing all too well she'd never see them again. But when the Rising Fire soldiers had taken up positions in her village, she had dared to hope that maybe there was a chance. But that hope had quickly proven misplaced. The soldiers the Rising Fire had sent were green recruits who had never tasted battle, and their desultory defence had lasted only ten minutes before they broke ranks and fled. In the end, the Rising Fire had done nothing to save her village, only leaving it and the kirin trapped inside of it as nothing more than a speedbump, a pile of bodies to slow down the relentless tide of Vermilion's advance.\n\nLentil could hear the soldiers approaching outside now. She knew from the stories that they were cruel and heartless monsters, and were likely to kill anykirin they could get their hooves on in retaliation for the relentless guerilla attacks the Rising Fire subjected them to. They would storm into her home and kill her as well. Metal rattled over her head, and she limply looked upwards to see her mother's sword hanging above the ruins of her mantle. Her mother had been a bannerkirin in her youth, a fine one as she claimed, and Lentil had always known her mother to have a warrior's spirit in her heart. Would she have died in a corner, feeling sorry for herself? No. She would have fought, howling her rage at the world that had taken everything from her. To Tartarus with the Serene Tendency, and damn the Rising Fire too. Their war had trampled her life underhoof and left only pain.\n\nShe forced herself to stand and pried the sword off the wall with her magic. Then, dragging the tip along the ground, she hobbled to the ruins of her door, blood dripping on the ground. And when she saw Vermilion's soldiers standing in front of her ruined home, she raised her sword, howled in rage and anguish, and engulfed herself in blue and pink fire."

Crippled river boats were floated listlessly between the city's many islands, their hulks burnt out and ruined, while kirin on small canoes and rafts paddled around them. In the city's massive floating market of the Coruscating Lagoon, the noise and busy traffic of hundreds of kirin buying and selling goods on the waters of the Great Mellifluve had been replaced by a press of little wooden dinghies all jammed together, all to hear the voice of the kirin standing at the base of the statue of an ancient kirin Matriarch rising from the murky waters.\n\nKindling Flash looked out over the joyous kirin floating before him, many hugging across boats and dancing on rafts so joyously that it was a wonder they didn't capsize. Verdant was his home, and this was the happiest he had ever seen it. After a days-long battle, the kirin of the Rising Fire had broken the yoke of the Vermilion's oppression, and the city where the Rising Fire had been born had finally returned to the revolution.\n\nHe turned those thoughts into his words, and he used his words to rally the crowd. "It has been a long struggle, my brothers and sisters of the faith, but after long last, the Rising Fire has finally returned to Verdant in force! It was here that the true revelations of Concord's divine will were revealed to us, the faithful, and it was here that the Rising Fire was born! It was here that a movement that will purify Kiria in the pyres of piety saw its first spark, and it is here that the growing wildfire of righteousness now rages! Verdant survived the Silence because of our faith and our communal love for one another and Concord's will, and now, it is our responsibility to share our love with the rest of Kiria!"\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Kindling Flash beamed; if nothing else, he knew he could die happy knowing he had freed his home from the kirin who had oppressed it for so long. "When the revolution began, Verdant's best and brightest had left for Chrysanthemum to continue their work. Now, we return to Verdant, triumphant and jubilant, and ready to fight for the freedom of the Realm. Who is with me?!""

Up at the top of the terraces was an artillery battery, pounding away at the bulk of the Rising Fire forces several kilometers away. She and the dozen soldiers under her command had been selected to silence those guns, capture them if she could, and remove the pressure on the battalions holding their ground against the latest offensive.\n\nThe morning skies were gray and rainy, helping to muffle the noise of her small band of soldiers as they crept their way up the rice terraces, inching their way closer to the guns. With any luck, they could reach them without being spotted and tear into the gun crews in a frenzied attack before they knew what was happening. But luck was not on their side, as a patrolling sentry happened to glance down the hillside just as Saber's force made for the next terrace and the cover it provided, and raised the alarm.\n\nWith the element of surprise lost, Saber had but two choices to choose from: retreat and save her team, or press on with the attack. But if she retreated now, the results could be disastrous for the rest of the army. That left only one choice, and with a piercing shout, the bannerkirin leapt up to the next terrace and led the charge. Her squad followed her without question, adding their yells to the charge, and terrace by terrace, the team advanced in the face of strengthening gunfire and heavy resistance.\n\nIt was a murderous climb. Every time they rushed for a terrace, somekirin died. What had started as a group of thirteen had dwindled to five by the time they made it to the top.

May Concord, in her divine wisdom, have mercy on her soul."\n\n"How the mighty have fallen," Rising Sun quietly mused to herself. Long had she known about the pirates of Nacre sailing under Roaring Fire's banner. For years they had menaced the riverine trade that sailed out of Verdant, or what little remained of it throughout the Silence, abducting and slaughtering helpless foals of Concord for their own pleasure and gain. She wanted nothing more than to smite the pirate before her, to strike her head from her shoulders with a sword and toss her body in the river, but cold logic stopped her. While executing Roaring Fire would be helpful to add to her image as a protector of kirin everywhere, the pirate queen was a skilled warrior and could be a useful tool.\n\nA plan formed in her head, and she stepped forward, signaling to the soldier to yank Roaring Fire's mane back to force the pirate to look her in the eyes. "Roaring Fire, menace of the seas, terror on water. I should have you killed for your many crimes, but Concord is merciful. She will not discard what can still be of use to Her glory, and so it is with you. Thus, I offer you a choice; prostrate yourself before me as Her messenger and fight in the name of the Roaring Fire, or prepare your spark to be returned to the Primordial Fire in Her care."\n\nRoaring Fire glared up at Rising Sun, fixing her with a dreadfully baleful look, and for a moment, Rising Sun wondered whether the pirate queen would be defiant to the last. But reason won out in the end, and the pirate slowly bowed before Rising Sun. Nodding in approval, Rising Sun turned to the soldier. "Bring her to her cell to rest and eat up. She will need to be strong to serve our Goddess."\n\nAs the two kirin left, Rising Sun turned aside to where Dayspring Rose stood behind her. "You will accompany the pirate," she told her faithful acolyte. "You are the brightest and best of our young leadership, but you lack experience in the field. This will be a valuable lesson.

So, who's the lucky kirin in need of magical compulsion?"\n\nAll eyes turned toward Roaring Fire, who stared back defiantly. "Her," Dayspring Rose said, and she marched closer to the pirate.

kirin_republic.27.d:0 "Rising Sun inwardly seethed as she watched the temple fill with weary kirin, their faces exhausted, downtrodden, afraid. In them, she saw the flickering, fading dream of her Republic, the guttering embers of the Rising Fire. Her enemies were strong, too strong, and her followers were weak, too pathetically weak. They were failing her. They were failing the Rising Fire. But Rising Sun would not let their weakness be the end of her dream.\n\nAs she stepped forward to address the congregation, the murmuring in the room drew quieter, and Sun let her eyes wander over her followers' faces before she proclaimed with a simple, strong statement: "We will not win the war with Vermilion." The uproar was as she expected; cries of fury, of despair, of panic filled the temple, but the officers sitting at the fringes of the congregation remained stoic, impassive. Rising Sun knew that they understood the situation better than anykirin else present, and the doors to the temple momentarily opened and closed as a dissenter, mane and horn alight with pink sparks, was hurriedly bundled out of the room. As the cries of dismay reached a feverish panic, Rising raised a hoof and silenced it with that one simple motion. "It is our duty to make sure that the Rising Fire is never extinguished!" she proclaimed to them all. "Vermilion may win, but that does not mean our end! It is our duty, our sacred duty beneath Concord, to survive and fight another day when the hedonism of our enemies leaves them weak and unprepared!"\n\nShe gestured vaguely off to the west, to somewhere beyond the walls of the temple. "Over the mountains lies a small and backwards nation. Centuries ago, kirin settlers moved into the small nation of Taungpau and taught the locals the ways of Concord's truth. They have long been in isolation, and thus have been spared the excesses of the Way of Fire. We shall march to Taungpau and take refuge amongst our brothers and sisters, and together we shall stoke the flames of the Rising Fire once more. Everykirin, you have one night to gather what you can and burn what you cannot take with you. The Rising FIre shall live on!"\n\nAnother furore began, but it was silenced as a bannerkirin by Rising Sun's side raised his voice over the noise. "The Fire Priestess has spoken!" he declared.

When she saw that it was Winter Frost and not Autumn Blaze or Fern Flare, Rain Shine adopted the neutral divine persona that she knew the priestess expected from her as Matriarch Superior of the Realm. "High Priestess," she said simply, watching expressionlessly as the High Priestess of the Way of Fire bowed so low her horn made a muffled scratch across the wooden floors. "What news has Concord seen fit to offer to Her Matriarch today?"\n\n"She has given us a great gift, Matriarch," Winter Frost said, rising from her bow. From within her robes she pulled out a simple scroll, and with her magic she laid it a respectful distance away from Rain Shine's hooves. "Do you remember our great shock at the Rising Fire's invasion of peaceful Taungpau? Well, it would appear that their invasion was a success, and now they are asking us for a cease-fire."\n\n"An armistice?" Rain Shine asked. "The Rising Fire seemed so eager to make war in the first place. Now they ask for peace after violating the sovereignty of a neutral nation?"\n\n"They have abandoned the western reaches of the Realm to our armies, Matriarch," Winter Frost informed her. "They have withdrawn to the mountain passes of Taungpau in exchange for surrendering the Realm to us. It is evident that they are simply buying time, and even though they approach us under the banner of peace, the moment they think they are strong enough to fight us, they will try again." She stomped her hoof, and Rain Shine was taken aback by the display of emotion by a priestess before her Matriarch. "Reject it, Matriarch. We must destroy the Rising Fire now while we have the chance. We cannot let their heresy fester on our borders, no matter how many must give their lives in Concord's name to force the mountain passes.""

kirin_republic.29.d:0 "Rising Sun sat in the main chamber of a frigid temple high in Taungpau's mountains. Once upon a time, it had been dedicated to one of the earliest interpretations of the Way of Fire. Now it was a crumbling ruin, with boarded windows and cobwebs hanging from the old timbers holding up the ceiling. It was a fitting metaphor, Rising Sun bitterly thought to herself. One faith before hers had died in this temple. Perhaps the Rising Fire would suffer the same fate.\n\nBefore her, on a simple table, lay a simple scroll. Sun had read it and reread it thrice now, and the response left a hole in her gut. It would seem the hedonists in Vermilion were determined to fight the war to its end. There would be no peace; consequently, the only hope for the Rising Fire was to resist as long as it could. Her brave patriots would hold every mountain pass they could and make Vermilion bleed for every inch of ground, but she knew it wouldn't be enough. Barring a miracle, this would be the Fraternal Republic's last stand.\n\nRising Sun looked out a nearby window, where howling, frigid winds ripped past the temple, carrying snow in their gale. Concord's warmth had abandoned her. Now there was only the bitter cold. But with or without Concord, Rising Sun knew she would fight until the end. She would fight and die, a martyr to her cause. Better to perish in the mountains than to live a slave, or be brought back to Vermilion in chains.\n\nRising Sun knew she would die. But her legacy, and the last spark of the Rising Fire, would live on."

The air was bitter cold and the wind harsh; she had to pile on extra coats to venture out into the snow and ice, an experience she was hardly used to from living along the Great Mellifluve's pleasantly warm branches. In the town below her, kirin and llamas anxiously shuffled along the streets, keeping their heads down as ragged bands of Rising Fire soldiers walked among them. Whatever life the town had had long ago been squeezed out of it, and neither the conqueror nor the conquered could escape its weight.\n\nRose clutched a small pendant against her chest and closed her eyes. What was left for the Rising Fire now? The retreat from the Realm into the mountains of Taungpau had been a success, and after a ferocious and desperate fight, the soldiers of the Rising Fire had subdued the isolated nation and turned it into their last bastion of strength. Rising Sun ruled from [KIC.Capital.GetName] with martial law, and the Fraternal Republic had been formally dissolved. Dayspring and all the other kirin who followed Priestess Sun were now kirin without a nation. They were soldiers of the Rising Fire, and little more. Their only consolation was that Vermilion had agreed to a peace treaty with the Rising Fire, even if only Dayspring and a few other kirin knew that the terms of the treaty had demanded the dissolution of the Republic in the first place.\n\nDayspring didn't know what the future held for her fellow followers. Rising Sun promised that one day they would return to retake the Realm, but for perhaps the first time in her life, Dayspring didn't believe her longtime mentor and friend. Their strength dwindled by the day as more and more kirin deserted. Dayspring wondered if one day she would join them.\n\nShe pressed the pendant against her heart.

The hardliners are having a debate with Kindling Flash, because the former want to impose stricter discipline within the Path. Our First Priestess has proven her worth before Concord. She needs all of us behind her, loyal, supportive, to steer Kiria along the path of development and prosperity. She deserves it. She will lead us to greatness. Kindling Flash doesn't disagree, he agrees entirely that Rising Sun has a mandate to rule, but there must be space within the path for debate and criticism, because it is only through critical reflection that we can become stronger. It is not out of disloyalty, but love and loyalty that I point out our shortcomings and offer proposals as to our collective self-improvement. Rising Sun turns to Dayspring. What do you think? Dayspring says that the hardliners seem right, but Kindling also has a point. A sword forged in a crucible must then be quenched in icy water, to test the strength of the blade.

A literate population is a pious population. Knowing how to read and write allows creatures to articulate more complex and higher thoughts, allows them to self-actualise, she says. Agreed, says Kindling. That is why we need to not only educate the people in religious texts, but also other things -- literature, science, poetry, philosophy. Rising Fire thought may well be the basis and foundation for our anti-illiteracy campaign, but it cannot be the be all end all. As the First Priestess has said, the self-actualisation of the kirin people is our ultimate objective. This is pretty spicy. Kindling does not contradict Rising Sun outright, but his counterproposal implicitly contradicts Rising Sun's view that the anti-illiteracy campaign should solely be based on religion. One of Rising Sun's lackeys says that Kindling's proposal is overly idealistic, and detracts from the First Priestess's line of argument. The Rising Fire should concentrate on teaching the peasants to read and write, and the best way to do so is through religion. Anything else will muddy the waters and confuse the peasantry, who need a strong, firm, guiding hoof of the Rising Fire to teach them proper and pious thought, and to guard against the foreign decadence of the northerners or the corrupted perversity of the degenerated Serene Tendency thought.

KIR_way_of_fire:0 "The Way of Fire"
KIR_way_of_fire_desc:0 "The Way of Fire encompasses the omnipresent religious beliefs of the kirin species, where fastidious devotion to the fire goddess Concord succeeded where conquest and diplomacy failed in uniting the kirin species under one flag. The teachings of The Way of Fire encourage friendly relations with one's neighbor and strongly discourage any thoughts and actions that could lead to a fall into the nirik state, helping to facilitate the construction of a functional kirin society. As part of its beliefs, all kirin owe complete devotion and reverence to the Matriarch Superior, their divine leader who unites with Concord's godly divinity upon her ascension, and whose will is interpreted and executed by a robust caste of priests and mystics scattered throughout the Realm. Defiance of the Matriarch's decrees is considered blasphemy against Concord Herself, and so the Matriarchs of Kiria rule with absolute theocratic authority. This is useful for keeping the populace in line with the Matriarch's desires, but less useful in facilitating the expression of new ideas."
KIR_banner_system:0 "Thousand Banners System" #千旗制
KIR_banner_system_desc:0 "When the first Matriarch Superior of Kiria, Iridescent Dawn, united Kiria under the rule of the Vermilion Dynasty and the Way of Fire, the followers under her command numbered in the hundreds of thousands. On the steps of the Imperial Palace at Vermilion, Iridescent Dawn rewarded the most loyal of her soldiers with a sacred banner bestowed with the divine blessing of Concord, before decreeing that their descendents shall continue to serve in the defence of the Kirin Realm as their forebears once did. On that day, a thousand military lineages were born, all proud sons and daughters of Kiria and Concord.\n\nBefore the Silence, there numbered a little more than five hundred Banners throughout the Realm. By then, each Banner represented an entire generation of soldiers, all part of the same clan, the largest of which possessed hundreds of family members, whilst the smallest could number as few as a dozen. By dint of the hereditary nature of their unique status, Bannerkirin were granted land to settle upon after service in the Vermilion Banner Army, where they free to raise their offspring to become the next generation of Kiria's warrior class.\n\nThe Silence had decimated both the political power and military prowess of Kiria's Banners — a long decline abruptly cessated by the breakneck modernization of the Realm. In the age of industrial warfare and technological marvels, will Kiria's Banners adapt to keep up with the times, or will Kiria's newfound modernity prove to be their coup de grâce?"

KIR_pol_1:0 "Autumn Blaze"
KIR_pol_1_desc:0 "Autumn Blaze was never meant to rise as far as she has in her life, born the daughter to poor farmers in Massicot. Though originally destined for a life of the same hardships and meagre living as her parents, Autumn's family managed to get their daughter residence in a temple to Concord in Massicot at the age of seven, where she studied for five years before dropping out and returning to the family farm. In those five years, however, Autumn learned how to read and write, how to perform arithmetic, and perhaps most importantly of all, how to study and interpret the teachings of the fire goddess Concord in religious texts. Though she would never use that particular skill in service to The Way of Fire, Autumn made excellent use of her command over words as both a sword to attack with and a shield to defend against, allowing her to use it as a tool to carve her own path in life. Though she originally put it toward making musicals, plays, and even thought-provoking comedic dissections of the stagnation of kirin life under The Silence, it would serve her the best in 1006, when the Equestrian delegation to Kiria wandered into Massicot.\n\nBeing one of the only kirin in Massicot who knew Equiish because of her studies, Autumn was able to guide the Equestrians, two ponies named Fluttershy and Applejack, to Vermilion, where they sought to make contact with Kiria's Matriarch Superior, Rain Shine, and establish diplomatic ties. Because of her efforts, they were successful, and Autumn ultimately formed a close friendship with Rain Shine when all was said and done. That friendship led her to become Rain Shine's first premier, and now she seeks to guide the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival as its steadfast and enthusiastic leader. Time will tell if she is successful."

KIR_pol_2:0 "Fickle Current"
KIR_pol_2_desc:0 "Despite his rise to prominence in Kiria, Fickle Current was not born a son of the Realm. Rather, he was foaled in Skyfall, where his family had fled the crushing economic collapse that struck hold of Kiria as The Silence was imposed at the beginning of the 10th century. It was there in Skyfall that the Sycee Trading House, one of the Realm's strongest trading conglomerates before The Silence, had relocated, and Current's family enjoyed close ties to the Trading House that left them extremely wealthy. With the wealth that his family possessed, Current was able to afford a prestigious education in Yale, where he was personally tutored by Cypress Snow, another member of the Kirin diaspora and its foremost literati. Under Snow's guidance, Current learned to sharpen his business acumen and cunning insight that would serve him well as a successful businesskirin and, later, the natural fit to represent the business interests of the returning kirin diaspora during the Grand Gallop Onward.\n\nIt was only late in 1006 when Fickle Current stepped hoof in Fragrance, the city of his ancestors, for the first time as The Silence began to lift across the Realm. Remembering the tales of how ineptitude and superstition in Vermilion once forced his family into exile and nearly impoverished them, Current soon resolved to be a champion for the kirin who lost everything in Fragrance and do everything he could to truly modernize Kiria according to what he and the rest of the Kirin diaspora knew in Skyfall and throughout western Griffonia. Unfettered capitalism would be the order of the day, for the wheels of progress in such a backwards land could only be turned with the grease of tremendous investment into the Realm. If Kiria ever wanted to truly join the modern world as a funcitonal nation, it would take an almost unimaginable level of investment, and so Current has resolved to do everything he can to make the nation an enticing opportunity for the wealthy. "
KIR_pol_3:0 "Winter Frost"
KIR_pol_3_desc:0 "Born in the mountainous monastery-town of Agate, Winter Frost was surrounded with the religious and mystic fervor of The Way of Fire from the moment of her birth. As she grew older, the young kirin quickly found herself deeply infatuated with the love and divine guidance the Kirin fire goddess, Concord, had blessed her people with, and as such, Winter devoted her entire life to understanding Concord's teachings and sharing them with the rest of the kirin species. Regularly spending many dark winter mornings in mediation along the highest peaks of the holy mountain range that surrounded Vermilion, Winter Frost's devotion was soon rewarded when she was chosen to go to Vermilion and further her service to Concord by serving Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. As such, Winter became one of the few kirin who had personally met and interacted with the reclusive Matriarch before The Silence ended, and she became personally devoted and loyal to the Matriarch alongside her fierce devotion to The Way of Fire. Such devotion led to her becoming personally favored by the Kirin Matriarch, and by the time The Silence was officially repealed, Winter Frost was the most influential priestess in Vermilion.\n\nAs The Silence gives way to a new era of politics in Vermilion, Winter Frost has become the loudest critic of reckless modernisation and provides a solid rock to anchor the concerns of the kirin religion to, regularly pushing against motions, bills, and decrees that she believes threaten the sanctity of Concord's divine teachings. While the Plenum seeks to find new answers to the challenges of modernization, Winter Frost works to bring Kiria back to its roots of firm faith and unyielding devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire, and find the answers to Kiria's modernization problem in Concord's teachings."
KIR_pol_4:0 "Rising Sun"
KIR_pol_4_desc:0 "Not much is known about the mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and what is known paints only a vague picture at best. By her own admission, Rising Sun was born in Chrysanthemum and studied to become a priestess in the Way of Fire. But even as a priestess, the mare was often regarded by her peers as too smart for her own good and twice as cunning as the most mischievous fox. She would regularly debate her senior priests about the merits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to the Matriarch Superior's decrees when all they brought about was suffering and ruin for the people of Kiria, and was regularly chastised for it. For the mare who was too smart by half for the lifestyle she had chosen, Rising Sun had reached a frustrating theological dead end to the problems surrounding Kiria.\n\nRealizing that she would never advance as a priestess in The Way of Fire, Rising Sun sailed down the Mellifluve where she ultimately ended up in Verdant at the age of 20. Once there, she quickly realized that Verdant was prospering where Chrysanthemum languished. The Silence was still in full swing over the city, but the many island communities of Verdant had formed their own cooperative communes that worked together to the benefit of all without breaking any of the Matriarch's decrees. Additionally, there was no rigid religious structure that dominated the everyday lives of the kirin in the city, only an individual communion between the average kirin and Concord, with spiritual leaders to aid their followers along toward their own revelations. Rising Sun quickly immersed herself in these beliefs, and in no time at all, had risen to the top of this new sect of The Way of Fire. Naming her sect the Rising Fire, Rising Sun would return to Chrysanthemum to spread her new teachings to the kirin of the west, and made many visits to towns and workshops around Kiria before ultimately ending up in Vermilion as the Grand Gallop Onward progressed to bring her teachings to a new level of national awareness."
KIR_cypress_snow:0 "Cypress Snow"
KIR_cypress_snow_desc:0 "The foremost intellectual of the kirin diaspora and mentor to Fickle Current, Cypress Snow serves as the bridge between the struggles of a modern Kiria and the ideas of the diaspora born and raised in Griffonia. Cypress hails from the lineage of the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild, and was tutored from a young age with the best scholars that money could buy, both within Griffonia and from Equestria overseas. His sharp mind and great ambition led to him pursuing several doctorates at both Griffonian and Equestrian universities, and he would eventually move to Yale and serve as a professor and mentor for countless members of the kirin diaspora that sought the best education they could afford. In each of them, Cypress instilled a sense of pride and superiority that they were the lucky kirin to escape the wasteful devastation that The Silence had imposed on their ancestral homeland, and they were better for it. And furthermore, he assured them that one day, perhaps, they would return to Kiria and remodel it in their own image, that of the enlightened kirin who had shed the superstitions of the kirin theocracy to modernize like the rest of the world.\n\nNow Cypress Snow has returned to Kiria at the behest of his former protege, Fickle Current, to help recruit kirin from the diaspora and urge them to return to Kiria. Working closely with Current, Cypress makes sure that the whims and wishes of the diaspora are presented to its de facto leader for consideration, and aids in keeping them in line behind Current's policies. This has given him a great amount of influence in kirin politics, and puts him in a unique relationship with the wealthy and powerful returning diaspora that even Fickle Current himself lacks."
KIR_pol_6:0 "Roaring Fire"
KIR_pol_6_desc:0 "The pirate queen known as Roaring Fire has become familiar with accomplishing the impossible. Born as a poor fishermare in Nacre on the pirate-controlled Auburn Isle, Roaring Fire joined her first pirating expedition at the age of 11 and never looked back. As she gained experience, so too did she gain respect from pirates all over the Isle for her fearless bravado and sharp mind. By the time she turned 19 she was captain of her own ship, and through clever diplomacy and cunning intrigue she began to amass a coalition of pirates and assembled a small flotilla. It was with this flotilla that, on one fateful night in 997, she lured the previous de facto pirate leader of the Auburn Isle and his ship out of his cove and beset upon him with a ferocity pirates still talk about in Nacre today. While cannonfire ripped through the wooden hulls of both junks, Roaring Fire swung off a rope and launched herself onto the enemy ship, where in a brutal display of blood and death, she cut through pirate after pirate until finally finding and besting the enemy captain. When she returned to Nacre the following morning with that pirate in chains, she cemented her legend and earned the loyalty of the brigands and buccaneers that called Auburn Isle home.\n\nThanks to her cunning, the pirates of the Auburn Isle have managed to survive into a new age. After successfully negotiating with Fickle Current to join his forces with her pirate armada serving as a mercenary navy, Roaring Fire spared her home from destruction by a resurgent Realm of Kiria and saved her pirates from the gallows. Now, standing at the forefront of a brave new world, the pirates of the Auburn Isle are firmly devoted to their pirate queen, and Roaring Fire is determined to not let them down."

Born in one of the Banner's clandestine camps in the mountains ringing the Vermilion Basin, Ember Wane is a kirin utterly devoted to the mission of Noctilucent Charm's last Banner — to uphold and defend the Silence at all costs. Trained from childhood in the ways of the bannerkirin warrior, Ember Wane succeeded his mother to become Commander of the Banner in his mid-forties and at the peak of his prime, having led his fellow bannerkirin all over Kiria on many a campaign to quash those recusants and heretics who dared break the Silence. Under Ember Wane's leadership, the Banner of the Covered Cage defended the Realm from threats within and without.\n\nWhen Matriarch Superior Rain Shine proclaimed the end of the Silence, the Banner of the Covered Cage withdrew from their operations all across Kiria and returned to their home bases in the mountains of the Vermilion Basin. Their mission to uphold Noctilucent Charm's final decree concluded, the Covered Cage and its Commander now seek a new purpose — to serve Rain Shine's new regime any way they can. But will the rest of Kiria be as accepting of their service? Those who have seen Ember Wane's many scars speculate on their origins: some say he got them while fighting off pirates in the defence of a fisherkirin village. Others claim that he got his scars from the eradication of the Sunrise Sect, whose clockwork golems and steam howitzers failed to prevent the Covered Cage from massacring all the inhabitants of Sunrise. No matter what the common kirin think of him and his Banner, Ember Wane will be an influential player in the breakneck development of the Realm of Kiria in the years to come."

Officially, the Arsenal never ceased operation, having received a special writ from Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm to remain in operation throughout the Silence. The Arsenal had always been the premier military supplier of the Procurate and the Realm, and therefore they had some prestige in the eyes of Concord. In reality, the Arsenal's forges had cooled many years before the Silence for lack of funding, resources, and expertise.\n\nAs the Silence came to an end and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine decreed modernization and openness to be the order of the day, the Procurate decided it would be wise to try and resurrect the Arsenal once again.

Just prior to the enactment of the Silence, Sorghum had begun to look like a truly modern city of the time, with new structures of brick and steel being erected in its industrial districts.\n\nAs the provincial capital of the rural-agricultural Great Mellifluve Delta region, Sorghum occupies a perfect geographical position for labour-intensive industrial production, with its factories presenting a chance for famers from the rural periphery to earn relatively high wages as urban workers."

KIR_artificer_guild_desc:0 "Founded sometime during the 8th Century, the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild has long been the vanguard of scientific and technological innovation in Kiria and Eastern Zebrica; the Guild's prolific experimentation with steam and clockwork mechanics in last decade of the 9th Century were the dominant driving force behind the rapid modernisation of contemporary Kiria.\n\nThe Guild had fiercely resisted the Silence, withdrawing to their strongholds at Massicot and Fragrance and seceding from the Realm. The devastation of Fragrance in the aftermath of a punitive expedition by the last remnants of organised Imperial forces led to the exodus of the surviving members to Griffonia, where the Guild would endure a century in bitter exile.\n\nThe post-Silence generation of the Guild's leadership-in-exile kept abreast of the latest technological developments in Griffonia, with some even having taken up teaching positions at the prestigious universities of Yale."
KIR_wingluck_consortium:0 "Wingluck Consortium"
KIR_wingluck_consortium_desc:0 "The Wingluck Consortium is unique among Kirian corporations in that it is not actually from Kiria. The founders of the Consortium, a griffon named Sevac Sembavat and her pegasus wife Starfruit, were from New Mareland, and immigrated to Kiria following the lifting of the Silence. The two of them were fascinated with the natural ability of flight, and sought to replicate it on an industrial scale. Securing a loan from the businesspony Gladmane, they began work on plans for large commercial airliners before being contracted by the New Mareland government for military aircraft design. However the two of them were never a couple to simply be content with what they had in life, and when they saw the chance to expand into the virgin markets of Kiria, they took the risk. In an agreement with the Sycee Trading House, they settled their debt to Gladmane and moved all their operations to the northern Kirian region of Greater Providence. Their pioneering designs were heavily patronized by rich kirin who have long wished to sail the skies, as well as forward-looking Bannerkirin commanders who see promise in such "Flying Fortresses"."

KIR_collegium_desc:0 "Without brilliant minds at work, Kiria can never enter the modern age, and the All-Kiria Collegium is the gathering of those minds. Created in an attempt to bolster Kiria's intellectual might, the Collegium acts as a mix between a university and a general research institute, working constantly to advance Kirian science beyond the bounds it was confined to during the Silence. The faculty at the Collegium is made up primarily of diaspora Kirin from Equus and Griffonia, augmented by domestic researchers and other foreigners given jobs as professors or visiting fellows. This diverse cast of characters means that the Collegium is a hub of foreign ideas, often drawing the ire of the Way of Fire. Like many of Kiria's other modern institutions, the Collegium is heavily influenced by the National Association of Kirin Patriots though one of their chief theorists, Cypress Snow, who serves as both a professor of Classical Literature and the president of the university. However, the Collegium's role in modernizing Kiria must be valued above its ties to the NAKP, lest Kiria be lost in the ashes of the past."
KIR_massicot_academy:0 "Massicot War School"
KIR_massicot_academy_desc:0 "Before the Silence, before even Iridescent Dawn set hoof on the land not yet known as Kiria, there was war. The Kirin, so vulnerable to the whims of their emotions, were perhaps more than most swept up by the bloody revels of warfare. Upon the shores of the Great Mellifluve, those ancient folk trained their children in the art of combat, where the finest of those who would fight for their city-state came in as children and came out as warriors. It is said that recruits were forced to jump into the frigid waters in winter as an initiation ritual. Those young foals would either drag themselves out by their hooves or be dragged to the icy depths, only to leave as corpses.\n\nAs Kiria united and time progressed, this ancient training ground became a fully-fledged academy that forged the youth of Kiria into the finest blades of the Matriarch Superior. Those bannerkirin who could call themselves graduates of Massicot provoked envy and admiration alike, right up until the decrees of Noctilucent Charm. The Silence left the School a glorified museum, patiently waiting for the day of its resurrection, where its hallowed halls may be filled with the disciples of bloodshed once more."

A modern industrial conglomerate, the Concern has bought up factories and mines across Kiria to manufacture both modern industrial products such as automobiles and tractors, as well as weapons of war. While questions have been asked about the Concern's treatment of workers, its leadership's drive for Kiria's modernization and industrialization cannot be ignored.\n\nWorth nothing is the Concern's close ties to the National Association of Kirin Patriots. Ardent Bloom is chief economist of the NAKP, and Zenith Bloom makes no secret of her personal involvement in the less-than-savoury activities of the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum — the NAKP's paramilitary organisation and, as some allege, smuggling network. But politics aside, Taurus has shown an interest in developing native Kirian tanks and armor, as long as they get to be the ones to manufacture it."

Crane alternates between coy courtship and fierce commercial competition with the National Association of Kirin Patriots over its private modernization initiatives — a tense, capricious, and mercurial relationship that the Kirian commentariat love to hate.\n\nCrane cares little for the temporal affairs of the Realm, save for those that concern its most modern and commercially-promising venture, Crane Aircraft. But if one were to strike at this one limb of Crane, the whole beast may soon come knocking."

Shipments from Dreamboat do not arrive very often, but when they do, everycreature hears about it.\n\nMany clients contract Dreamboat for shipments that need to sail through the South Kirin Sea, to ensure that their cargo is protected from pirates by the best sailors money can buy. Dreamboat's rivalry with Scarlet Sails Shipping is the shipping industry's worst-kept secret; indeed, stories of thrilling skirmishes at sea between Dreamboat mariners and the pirate scoundrels of Auburn Isle have become the stuff of maritime legend, and do much to burnish Dreamboat's brand image. Allegations of collusion with Scarlet Sails Shipping, their seemingly pirate-immune navy, and their dubious ties with Pirate Queen Roaring Fire are wholly unfounded."

KIR_nirik_state_desc:0 "Throughout history, there has always been the concept of Apocalypse, and the creatures that propagate it. Be they lunatics, doomsayers, prophets, or the genuinely concerned, such creatures weave tales of grandeur and sacrifice, of fervent hope and insurmountable dread, of butchery and plague. They wield fear with as much grace as any swordsmare, whipping those who hear their stories into a frenzy of anxiety and defiance, only to inevitably be disproved by the jeering mundanity of Fate.\nNow, it is widely agreed, we have far surpassed any apocalypse ever conceived.\nMillenia of progress have been immolated in smoke, trampled by the weight of those fateful mistakes and the hubris of a race which dared to believe it could move past itself to become something better. Such dreams are but nostalgia now, idle trivialities to be contemplated by the few kirin who yet remain sane in this cataclysmic hellscape. Nirik in the thousands fight and kill and die, but do not live, doomed to be slaves to the grim will of Rage. Optimism lays dead, sacrificed on the altar of Despair. All that is left for those hapless few whose hope has not been consumed by the inferno is to pray for deliverance, most likely in the form of another major power intervening for fear of the nirik threat fulminating outwards.\nPray to whom? No one knows. Even Concord no longer holds vigil over the Realm of Shattered Hope, Tartarus Incarnate on earth."

KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_B1:0 "the §YRealm of Kiria§! into an industrialized nation by the end of Year 1011. The Plan is the cornerstone of the §YAll-Kiria Plenum for National Revival§!, an assemblage of Kiria's best and brightest summoned to Vermilion, at the behest of Matriarch Superior §YRain Shine§!, to guide the Realm out of the §RSilence§! and into the modern era. Supported by Kiria's friends in Equestria, funded by the wealth of the returning Kirin diaspora, fueled by the resurgent flames of Kirin patriotism and driven by the indomitable will of the Kirin people, Premier Autumn Blaze believes that the Plan can succeed — but only if the Plenum learns to work together, in spite of their ideological differences, towards their shared goal of a strong, independent, and modernized Kiria."
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_A2:0 "The success of Imperial Premier Autumn Blaze's §Y3½ Year Plan§! has abolished the last vestiges of the §RSilence§! in the Realm, setting Kiria on the path to becoming a modernized industrial nation. The All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival has matured"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_B2:0 "from a shiftless gaggle of bickering demagogues into a forum of Kiria's most capable stateskirin and scholar-officials, united by a common purpose — to see the Realm §Cstrong and prosperous§!, emerging from the Silence to assert Kiria's place on the world stage. The millennium is still young, and the Plenum's lofty vision of an Eastern Zebrica united under the aegis of the revived §OVermilion Dynasty§! may well gain traction amongst a Kirin people galvanised by their nation's meteoric rise.\nAs the Grand Gallop Onward progresses, and as the Reform Bureau, the Morning Secretariat, and the Plenum all find themselves fonts of power in a rapidly centralizing nation-state, Kiria's diverse array of ideological tendencies must cooperate and compromise if the dream of a §GKirin-led Zebrica§! is to be realised."

KIR_crisis_1_mission_desc:0 "The Lifeblood of Kiria, the Great Mellifluve is the river that brings life to our beautiful realm and facilitates trade throughout its fertile valleys and lush forests. But while the Great Mellifluve gives us life, we are inadvertently killing it.

KIR_crisis_3_mission:0 "The Crisis of Bread and Rice"
KIR_crisis_3_mission_desc:0 "Our exploding population and the movement of kirin away from the subsistence farms filling the countryside and into our reopening cities has created a dire crisis in our food supply. Cities are emptying their granaries much faster than anticipated, and old farming techniques are insufficient in providing enough food to keep the cities from starving. We must find a solution to this crisis and encourage our fellow kirin to give everything they can afford to see us through this next dreadful winter."
KIR_crisis_4_mission:0 "The Incendiaries' Movement"
KIR_crisis_4_mission_desc:0 "The Incendiaries are a group of kirin peasants and farmers who are loosely affiliated with the Rising Fire heresy of our religion, and they have decided to express their frustration and disillusionment with the Grand Gallop Onward by striking out at our modernisation projects.

KIR_finish_railway_desc:0 "Following the lifting of the Silence over Kiria, Equestrian investment into the Realm's modernisation slowly grew. The influx of Equestrian venture capital and generous donations from the Kirian diaspora in Equestria culminated in the construction of the Vermilion Radiance Line, a railway — the first in Kiria — to connect the capital of the Realm to the port city of Radiance, historically known as the Vermilion Gateway. However, cost overruns and the technical difficulty of carving a path through the dense and hilly Sakura Forest meant that this venture stalled. Already, a railroad unravels from modern neo-Pegasopolian train termini in the hearts of Vermilion and Radiance both, only to end abruptly at the fringes of the Sakura Forest. A little bit of political pressure will breathe new life into the venture — to carve a path through the forest and connect the capital to the sea."

With The Silence ending, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has decided to regularly schedule 70 days of open court where petitioners could see her and make their voices heard.

In this way, even kirin at the fringes of our realm can feel like their voices are personally heard by the Matriarch, and in turn, Concord Herself."
KIR_stab_decision_1:0 "Bolster the Way of Fire"
KIR_stab_decision_1_desc:0 "Centuries ago, The Way of Fire unified the kirin people in a way no warlord or diplomat had ever achieved before. Our faith in Concord and her divine avatar, the Matriarch Superior, allows us to come together as a peaceful nation and reject the violent urges of the nirik state. In these frightening new times, however, faith in The Way of Fire is fading, especially after the harsh stagnation of The Silence.

While their countrymares may call them sellouts, these collaborators defend their new liege with vigor and professionalism.\n\nIf you are in the Kirian military or colonial bureaucracy, and are assigned to a posting in Zaikiria, it means one of two things. Either you have done so well in your previous assignment that you have been given a stable, calm posting as a reward for everything you have done, or you are so mind-numbingly incompetent, but not quite enough to be fired, that you need to be put somewhere that you cannot possibly mess up your job. This is because Zaikiria nearly runs itself. The population are kirin, almost all are adherants of the Way of Fire, and there are legions of local leaders willing to work with the Commandery administration in one way or another.

The reasoning for this was not clear, until a Crane Industries headquarters opened in the capital city.\n\nCrane has turned Taungpau into a personal project of theirs, ruling over it with complete autocracy and surprising benevolance. All Crane corporate subsidiaries have activities in the Mandate, and the quality of life there has actually risen. The Banner of the Paper Crane itself is led by a member of the Mallow family, but the government of the region is headed by a local llama collaborator, showing Crane's surprisingly benign attitude towards the region. Crane's end goal is to turn Taungpau into a "sister nation" to Kiria, one where the Mallow family holds personal rule, and the natives living there eternally in their debt, owing everything to the family and corporation that made their nation prosper."

While technically the Banner is a very elite force, it is drawn not from the normal banner system, but from the private armies of VasCorps, all of which want the metals buried in the soil. Within the Banner's numbers, you can find soldiers of fortune of all stripes, creatures who more often have a loyalty to a paycheck than to the Empire of Kiria.\n\nBut that's fine; the Empire itself doesn't even care about controlling the majority of the Protectorate.

The corporations of Kiria would have their mining concessions, as well as ports on the coast, and deer could work for them for a fair wage. The Banner itself would control the capital, but all administration outside of the city would be left to local collaborators from the local deer. But the pact was not always honored.\n\nThe Banner's job first and foremost was to ensure stability. On most days this meant letting deer temples worship their own gods as long as they had a portrait of the Matriarch Superior somewhere in the building.

KIR_CFR_mandate:0 "The Changeling Ost-Zebrikan Mandate"
KIR_CFR_mandate_desc:0 "The International City of Fragrance is not so much a colonial possession of Vesalipolis and its Queen as it is a corporate colony of Main Hive Industries. The secessionist war against Vermilion by the National Association of Kirin Patriots was bankrolled by MHI capital, secured by collateral in the form of swathes of real estate throughout Fragrance. The untimely military defeat of the NAKP obliged the MHI to seize their collateral, taking control of Fragrance mere hours before the arrival of the Kirian vanguard in pursuit of the routed NAKP forces.\n\nIt was not to emissaries of Vesalipolis who the NAKP surrendered Fragrance, but Changeling mercenaries of the Vespidae Korps organised by MHI to fight for their kirin corporatist brethren. While the Queen's standard may fly over Fragrance, and although Vesalipolis greedily siphons capital and resources from the commerce flowing through the city, it is MHI who governs this foreign enclave on Kirian soil. Always predisposed to optimal cost-effective methods, the MHI technocrats have adopted a laissez-faire managerial style to their administration of the International City. Save for the matters reserved to the exclusive remit of the Changeling Ost-Zebrikan Mandate, including defence and international relations, most municipal functions are undertaken by the local kirin collaborators of the Civil Administration.\n\nIt is not out of benevolence, but necessity, that MHI and the Changeling Mandate has relinquished power to the Civil Administration. While there is very little love lost between Vermilion and the Fragrancese kirin — erstwhile supporters of the defeated NAKP — they will never accept the status of colonial subjects in their own hometown.The Changeling Mandate is financed almost entirely by MHI, and for them to govern Fragrance wholly under military occupation would require such marepower and resources as to turn the International City into an unquestionably loss-making venture."
KIR_masquerade:0 "§OThe Masquerade§!"
KIR_masquerade_desc:0 "Although there exists no historic enmity between the changeling and kirin races to render unpalatable to Vesalipolis the high degree of autonomy granted to the Civil Administration, which Queen Chrysalis would no doubt have quashed had Fragrance been a city of ponies or, Hatcher forbid, Equestrians, the technocrats of the Changeling Mandate are under no illusions as to the unpopularity of their rule. MHI had, after all, seized control of Fragrance as a creditor taking advantage of the NAKP's humiliating defeat at the hooves of Vermilion. Such autonomy would only breed contempt, conspiracy, and, ultimately, rebellion against the foreign interlopers, whose occupation had conveniently provided a protective umbrella under which to lick their wounds in preparation for revenge against Vermilion, but which will outlive its usefulness, sooner or later.\n\nIt is in recognition of this fact that the Changeling Mandate has taken great pains to ensure that the autonomy of the Civil Administration exists only as an illusion, a legal fiction to salve the much-bruised egos of their kirin wards. The Infils.-kommando Ost-Zebrika works tirelessly in the shadows, exercising the old Changeling politico-military traditions of infiltration and impersonation, to quietly dispose of Fragrancese politicians, industrialists, and security officers who show signs of disloyalty, revanchism, or anti-Changeling sentiment, their identities usurped by consummately-professional Changeling infiltrator-understudies.\n\nThe Fragrancese kirin are allowed to believe that they rule themselves, and that the Changeling Mandate merely serves to ensure their protection from Vermilion's vengeance. But should the masks ever come off, they will find themselves to be sorely mistaken. Their autonomy exists solely at the discretionary indulgence of the Infils.-kommando, and those who would threaten the security and stability of the International City will soon find themselves surprising their friends and family with their newfound and uncharacteristically outspoken appreciation of the benevolence of Fragrance's Changeling protectors."

CFR_KIR_Focus_1:0 "International Fragrance"
CFR_KIR_Focus_1_desc:0 "Our arrival has riled up the locals. They will not accept a changeling ruler, nor do we have the resources or marepower for a conventional military occupation. Korpskommandant Sciaridae will have to pick a suitable collaborator to head a kirin government under Changeling protection. Naturally, whichever candidate we pick must satisfy both the local kirin and interests back in Equus."
CFR_KIR_Focus_2:0 "Urban Renewal"
CFR_KIR_Focus_2_desc:0 "Fragrance is an ancient city, and it is evident from the extensive urban sprawl that its builders did not think far ahead. Additionally, there are several districts in which known agitators reside. With the appropriate application of incentives and —if need be— force, we can clear out the rabble and make way for new, modern city districts."
CFR_KIR_Focus_3:0 "New Dockyards"
CFR_KIR_Focus_3_desc:0 "The natural harbour of the Fragrance Inlet was barely exploited by previous Kirian administrations, and the current naval facilities are wholly inadequate for an international city. Renewed efforts and investments to set up a solid foundation for the naval base and trade port will breathe new life into Fragrance and consolidate our supply lines that lead back to Vesalipolis."
CFR_KIR_Focus_4:0 "Light Manufacturing"
CFR_KIR_Focus_4_desc:0 "The newly vacated locales are now available as industrial zones and await new factories. With select investments from Equus, we can jumpstart the industrial sector and begin strengthening the economic state of Fragrance. Eventually, the International City will be an industrial powerhouse in Eastern Zebrica in its own right."
CFR_KIR_Focus_5:0 "An Interface between Zebrica and Equus"
CFR_KIR_Focus_5_desc:0 "The current mandate was hastily written to satisfy early requirements by our benefactors back home. With our position in Ost-Kirin being secured, our legal experts can take the time to improve upon the mandate to facilitate investment and diplomatic efforts from our backers in Vesalipolis."
CFR_KIR_Focus_6:0 "Security Contractors"
CFR_KIR_Focus_6_desc:0 "Much as we would wish it otherwise, the divisions that came with the expeditionary corps are insufficient to defend Fragrance from any potential invasion.

A thorough examination of its properties by our botanists will determine whether or not we should allow the cultivation of the flower."

They strive to map and catalogue every personal relation, every business transaction, and eventually every thought of their subjects to maximize efficiency and preempt threats. The paranoia of the leaders quickly filter down into every stratum of society, as anyone could be an informer. But is it paranoia if they really are watching you?\n\nIn the International City of Fragrance, a gleaming metropolis on the shore of the North Kirin Sea, the Old Guard of the Changeling deep-cover infiltrator corps rule from the shadows. They are heirs to centuries of Changeling espionage tradition, consummate maestri of geopolitical drama, courtly intrigue, and ministerial thespianism. Discredited and disgraced after the disastrous Canterlot Defeat of 1002, the deep-cover infiltration doctrine was discarded in favour of modernised Sickertruppen tactics. A small but virtuosic cast of Changeling understudies carefully coached to assume the identities of foreign politicians, state bureaucrats, and military leaders was replaced by uniformed formations of saboteurs and infiltrators tasked with military operations behind enemy lines. The painstaking art of Changeling deep-cover infiltration had no place in a world of industrial and mechanised warfare.\n\nIn Changeling Fragrance, however, Operationsdirektorin Cheli Cerae and her cadre of infiltrator-thespians have found a safe haven. The vast continent of Zebrica has yet to be inoculated against the alien pathogen of Changeling subversion. On these foreign shores, the doppelgängers have found their new hunting grounds.§!"

They had not expected there to be such immense popular support for the Righteous Realm Movement, determined to avenge Kiria's humilation at the hooves of the Changeling foreigners while Vermilion stood idly by. Nor had Vermilion expected such a stabilising conservative force as the Procurate to yield so easily to the Society's firebrands and demagogues. For this, we have our infiltrators to thank. But we cannot expect Vermilion to languish in its stupor.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1_TITLE:0 "I'm So Overwhelmed!"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1:0 "I left Vermilion a few weeks ago to go visit the new steelworks that have been erected in Fragrance and Rhapsody, argued for and funded in large part by §YFickle Current§! and his like-minded business partners. I've traveled a little bit around the Realm as part of the job, and even a little bit before that when §YThe Silence§! still had our people locked in its grasp, but I've never been this far north. I thought all of our realm was like Vermilion or Massicot, either withering cities dwindling as they decayed, or small villages full of kirin trying to scratch out simple lives with no support or assistance from the government. But Fragrance and Rhapsody are nothing like that! They are still splendid cities, places that tried so very hard to resist the economic and societal collapses of The Silence, and managed to save some of our culture and way of life from before The Silence brought everything to a standstill. I don't know how better I could describe it. The kirin in these cities still have life and color in them, a sense of optimism that tomorrow is going to be a §Ybetter day§!. That's something I share with them, and it made me oh so happy to see it during my travels.\n\nOh, shoot, I'm getting off topic. Or am I? I don't know. Anyway, the §Ysteelworks§! that Fickle Current's clique funded are an amazing sight to behold. These aren't just workshops where blacksmiths forge steel and work their craft; this is something else entirely, a §Ymodern revolution§! that was smothered in Kiria a century ago, but was refined and perfected by the griffons of Griffonia and the ponies of Equus. These are entire factories filled with heavy machinery powered by electricity (another invention from over the seas; it makes me realize just how small my world was growing up in The Silence!) and guided along by workers who pull levers, hit buttons and somehow wrangle these machines into doing all the work for them. And the results can't even be compared to the work of smithy workshops and guilds; these factories can produce §Yin a day§! what an entire guild of talented blacksmiths can produce in a year! Sure, it loses some of that personal touch, but when we're trying to drag our entire nation into the modern era after a century of sitting on our hooves, this industrialization is practically a blessing sent by §YConcord§! herself. Current and his friends might be a little too cynical and greedy for my tastes, but the inventions they're bringing in from overseas, and the capital they're investing in setting up our industry, more than makes up for it. I can only hope that some of the fruits of their labor can make its way down to the ponies working in the steel mills; those I talked to said they worked §Yten or twelve hours a day§! in the scorching heat, with only a few breaks throughout the day. But it pays better than farming (so I've been told), and besides, we kirin like the heat anyway. It's a rough start for many of these workers, but I feel that given enough time and hardwork, this will all pay off for them like it will for the rest of us. We just have to believe in the future we're all building §Ytogether§!.\n\nI believe in that future, and in the Matriarch Superior, and in Concord's blessings. To some extent, I believe in Fickle Current and his compatriots too. We just have to work together to make the best use of the blessings Kiria has been given, and we can shape our future into anything we want it to be. And I'm going to do §Yeverything§! I can to help make it happen!" ##Note: the first three entries for all four characters will be available to KIC and KIS as well, as these entries will occur during the 3 1/2 year plan; that is, pre-civil war.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2_TITLE:0 "Playing Middlemare"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2:0 "Reform, reform, reform! I don't know how many times I had to say that word during the first meeting of §YThe Reform Bureau§! (oh darn I just did it again!), but today was a very busy day! Since the Matriarch Superior made me the premier of the §YPlenum§! (I still don't know why she trusts me with that much responsibility), I was automatically made the head of the Reform Bureau, which is just basically a fancy way of saying I have to be responsible for getting all the influential delegates from the Plenum into one place where we can discuss the specifics of how we want to enact things that get passed on the debate floor. We are, essentially, the §Ycentral government§! of Kiria, and we act with a limited amount of imperial mandate that Rain Shine blessed us with. That's a lot of responsibility for a young mare from Massicot to handle, but I'll do my best to save the Realm and not let the Matriarch down!\n\nUnfortunately, trying to get everykirin to work together is like herding cats, and I've never had a pet cat before, let alone two or three or four, so I'm a little short on experience. §YFickle Current§! brought in a lot of his buddies from overseas, and though the capitalists are providing a lot of the capital and ideas we need to get this whole modernization thing moving, I feel like I have to stop them from reshaping Kiria to §Ysuit their interests§! over those of the common kirin. At least I have somewhat of an ally in that in §YPriestess Winter Frost§!, who is wary about how rapid modernization will alter the social fabric of the kirin species, but I often feel like she goes a little too far. If you try to suggest anything that changes the way kirin society functioned during The Silence, she usually §Ypushes back hard on it§!, afraid of how any hint of modernization could possibly weaken the influence of §YThe Way of Fire§! in our culture. I had to end up playing middlemare between the two and finding a §Ycompromise that helps out everykirin§!, but I don't know how much longer I can keep that up if Winter and Fickle don't get on the same page. It's exhausting! Oh, how I wish I had Applejack and Fluttershy here to help show us how to follow §Ythe Equestrian model of Harmony...§!\n\nBut I'm not going to give up, not at all. Even if it is exhausting and draining, I'm going to keep going back into the Bureau and doing my best to move things along for the good of all the Realm. Hopefully, as we keep working together, we'll be able to get everykirin to have fair and honest debates about how we're going to modernize the country. We all have a common goal, afterall. It falls on us to figure out how to get to it. I'm confident we'll find a way to make that happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3_TITLE:0 "Why Me?"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3:0 "I do not think that I am a good Premier.\n\nOh, how do I even begin? Today's assembly at the court was a complete and total disaster. In the midst of our bickering, a procession of kirin following the religious doctrine they call §YThe Rising Fire§! entered the court, led by a mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and asked to join in on the Plenum. I wanted to let them join, as every kirin should have a voice in determining §Ythe future of the Realm§!, but I let myself be bowled over by §YWinter Frost§! and §YFickle Current§!, who immediately opposed Rising Sun and her followers from joining in. Winter despises The Rising Fire, calling it and its followers §Yheretics§!, and I'm pretty sure she'd toss them all into the sea if she could. Current and his pals don't like the ideas of a §Ycommunalist society§!, because they feel it's a threat to the industry and capitalism they're trying to set up in the Realm. And me? I don't know what happened in court. I felt like I wasn't sure if letting Rising Sun and her followers join the Plenum was the right idea. §YEquestria§! once had a problem with ponies who had a similar mindset to Rising Sun and her sect, and it caused so much misery up there. Maybe I just didn't want the same thing to happen here in the Realm.\n\nBut Rising Sun and her followers are gone now. When I refused to welcome them to the Plenum, they were §Ychased out of the city§! by supporters of Fickle and Winter... and even some of my supporters as well. Instead of talking things out with Rising Sun, we refused to listen to what she had to say and used force to make her go away. And you know what scares me the most? Winter and Current were §Ymore than happy§! to use force to get what they wanted. I'm starting to think that not every debate and problem we're going to encounter at the Plenum can be solved with §Ywords and compromise§!. Force of will and personality (and, I hope, only those two kinds of force) will be what drags this Plenum across the finish line. I don't know if I have the mettle to stand up to Current and Frost when it counts. If I did, maybe I would have made sure that Rising Sun and her delegation had a seat at the Plenum to contribute ideas for the revitalization of our nation.\n\n§YThings are going badly§!, I feel, and this whole ordeal is turning out to be less fulfilling and uplifting than I thought it was going to be when I agreed to be the Matriarch's premier at the start of it all. But it's too late to back out of this now or feel sorry for myself. I have to push on and keep doing my job, no matter what it takes. §YAll of Kiria depends on it§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_4_TITLE:0 "Title of Entry 4"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_4:0 "(Make this all past tense, in the first-person and reflective, please:) Autumn Blaze at home. Thanks, Applejack, for the supplies. Our troops will appreciate all the Equestrian-made gear they can use. She is having tea with Applejack, who says that Fluttershy apologises for not being able to come, because she doesn't like war and Equestria needs her. It's fine, says Autumn. I'm sorry too, that we couldn't meet under better circumstances. I'm a failure. The civil war is because of me. Aw sugarcube, don't say that, says Applejack. It'd have taken a supermare to be able to make a century's worth of progress happen in three and a bit years, all the while keeping the government from imploding. I wish I could offer more than words, but war is brewing on Equus too, and ponies have never been good at war. What do I do applejack? says Autumn. Applejack doesn't know, and its not in her place to tell her how to govern her country, but Applejack gives her words of reassurance that she's fighting the good fight, for a cause that is right and just, and that Autumn should take heart that her Party is behind her to uphold democracy and harmony. With Winter Frost, tradition in and of itself isn't a bad thing, but ah feel that she takes it a mite too far, you know? clinging on to the past while the world changes around you is a sure fire way to get left in the dust. Also, Applejack has brought somekirin with her - Mahogany Blaze, friendship school graduate. You brave brave kirin, says Autumn. You could have stayed safe in Equestria, but you chose to come back. Mahogany: all the stuff i've learnt about friendship and harmony would've meant nothing if I didn't fight for it in the place where it matters the most - home. Applejack was Mahogany's teacher; they should have some heartfelt interaction before saying goodbye. Mahogany: I'll make you proud, professor Applejack. [KIR.KIRGetProtag1Entry4AJOptional]"
KIRP1E4AJExtra:0 "EXTRA TIDBIT, place this wherever you feel is proper. where the Rising Fire and Rising Sun are on the side of Vermilion. Applejack tells Autumn to be careful; the Rising Fire preaches equality before Concord, justice, and freedom, but I don't trust Rising Sun. That mare has got something to hide, and when she makes promises of democracy and social justice it feels to me she's not being entirely honest, hiding something. She just ain't genuine. Call it a gut feeling from the element of honesty. be careful."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_6_TITLE:0 "(if the player recognised the covered cage from crisis.21)" ##I want this entry to talk about the Sunrise Massacre.
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_6:0 "You called me to a secret briefing, Autumn Blaze says. What's it about? How are you, Premier, Ember Wane asks. I was surprised. Oh, I'm ok. I appreciate the sentiment. Ember Wane nods curtly, and cuts to the chase. I had you meet me so I could brief you on a potential new fighting force that could turn the tide of the war. You know about the Sunrise Massacre? Autumn nods stoicly. What about it? Ember: the Sunrise Sect met us in battle outside the village. There were about half a thousand of us. They numbered fewer, but they had the better weapons. Contraptions of pipes and hissing steam that lobbed explosives into the air to fall on our lines, alchemical fires that burnt through our scales as if they were paper, their warriors wearing thaumaturgical batteries that boosted their magical power, so their foot soldiers possessed telekinetic proficiency to rival our best adepts. That battle almost broke the back of the Covered Cage, but in the end it was we who survived. Ok, so? asks Autumn. But all those inventions weren't really the point. Gimmicks at best, not real substitutes for skill and training. They weren't warriors. But from a cavern under the ground, they sent out rank after rank of clockwork golems - mindless automatons marching in lockstep with the singular purpose of our destruction. they were controlling it with some kind of antenna, like the radio emitters you see nowadays. Swords and arquebuses were inefficient against the copper and steel of those golems. we barely managed to hold our ground the first night against the metal onslaught. We managed to infiltrate into the village and destroy the antenna, and that's how we won. Autumn makes to speak, but Ember cuts her off with a raised hoof. I'm getting to the point. after the battle, we went into the opening in the ground, into the cavern from which the golems emerged like a flood. What was down there? rank upon rank of more golems, thousands at least. all of them immobile, but not broken. we didn't doubt for one moment all it would take is for the right signal to reactivate them, unleash them upon Kiria. So we sealed up the cavern with lead and stone. I think I understand, says Autumn. I assume you know where Sunrise was? Yes, says Ember Glow. We erased it from all our maps, but there are still some of us who were there, who remember how we got there, where it is. Autumn: clockwork golems from half a century ago won't be a war-winning weapon, but it'll certainly give us an edge. We'll mount an expedition with scientists and engineers, and harness the ghosts of the past to fight for the future."

I enjoyed the poem for its lyrical poetry, but only now, in the twilight of Kiria, do I truly understand the poem, being in a similar position as Princess Fall Shade, presiding over the ruin of her nation.\n\nPremise: this diary entry is written by Autumn Blaze the night the Triumvirate collapses, moments before she gives in and becomes a nirik. Reference the song "A Kirin Tale". Autumn's worldview is thoroughly shattered. Her efforts to bring Kiria out of the Silence and into modernity have failed in the worst possible way, with the supporters of Winter Frost and Rising Sun slaughtering each other in the streets, the northern traitors on the march, and Kiria in flames as nirik transformations overtake the Realm. Fear of hurt? The fear's there for a reason. Like a moth, I drew too close to the flame of modernity, and got burnt. We tried to chase the rainbow but now the skies of Kiria seem destined to be filled with clouds of ash and smoke forever. I feel the anger and fury building inside me - anger at Winter and Rising, yes, for ruining the Realm for their completely insignificant feud, and towards the northerners for causing this whole mess in the first place, but mainly towards myself - I'm a failure, the ruination of Kiria. I wasn't good enough. I was a fool. This mess is on my bloodstained hooves. I can't hold it back any more. The anger and self-loathing within me wants to break free, to scour away the shame of my failure in fire and blood. I'm not going to fight it any more. I'm sorry, Fluttershy. I'm sorry, Applejack. I'm sorry, Rain Shine.\n\nOh Concord, what's become of Rain Shine? (she did not even think to consider Rain Shine's fate in her own despair. The moment before she transforms, she remembers the Matriarch Superior, who was in the capital all the time.)"

It caused a landslide, revealing an ancient tomb, at least several millennia old, buried beneath tonnes of rock and soil, now displaced by the nuclear hellfire that bathed the Headlands in flame. It was not soldiers, but local survivors seeking shelter, who came across the ancient tomb, and found within a sarcophagus made out of an unknown metal alloy. Inside was a skeleton of a tall, slender equinoid, lacking the scales of a kirin but possessing a long, curved, elegant horn embedded in its forehead. The possibility of fakery notwithstanding, this would mark the first time the remains of an eastern unicorn have been found. In kirin mythology that predates the Way of Fire and Concord, the kirin race was created as the offspring of the eastern unicorns - a sub-type of unicorns reputed to have prodigious magical ability, distinctive for their flowing manes, tall, lithe and slender figures, and curved, long, and wickedly sharp horns - and dragons. In a time of war in Kiria, this discovery spurred some interest nationally, but most of the eagerness came from international observers and archeologists.\n\nAutumn Blaze was shown photographs of the tomb, the sarcophagus, and the skeleton taken by military officers who came to seal the tomb. In this entry she reflects about the eastern unicorn myth and their purported creation of the kirin race, and this recent groundbreaking revelation in this time of war. A childhood myth, mildly blasphemous, dismissed as nothing more than an old mare's tale. Stranger things have happened."

Autumn Blaze was sent to a monastery, the same monastery she used to live in before the Silence ended and her political career began. The old Monastery Matriarch was killed when NAKP artillery shelled the monastery. The new Matriarch is cold towards Autumn, though always proper and polite. Autumn is going to live out the rest of her days in this monastery quietly reflecting on her failures. She gets occasional visits from youngsters, idealistic kirin youth looking to this reformist Premier for words of wisdom or inspiration, but they always leave disappointed - Autumn has nothing worthwhile to tell them, merely platitudes and vague assurances that democracy will come to Kiria someday. She is a spent force, crushed by the weight of her failures. Reflect all this in this journal entry."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1_TITLE:0 "Concord's Will"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1:0 "Praise be to Concord that in Her divine wisdom, She has seen fit to end The Silence that has blanketed our realm for too long. The kirin people have had §Yone hundred years§! to repent and reflect on the sins of modernization that nearly undid all the hard work of The Way of Fire in unifying our scattered and quarrelsome race centuries ago, and I feel that our society and culture has learned a great deal from the experience. Concord imparted Her will to punish Her errant children through §YMatriarch Noctilucent Charm§!, and now She has decided to forgive us through §YMatriarch Rain Shine§!. Now the only question is this: did we learn our lesson the first time?\n\nDuring Matriarch Charm's reign, §Yunchecked and unfettered modernization§! nearly collapsed our society, as the hedonism of modern conveniences turned our society away from the simple truths of The Way of Fire. We, our parents, our grandparents, and even our great grandparents have atoned for these mistakes. As proudly supportive of tradition as I am, and naturally wary of any change that could undermine Concord's divine authority in our lives, I nevertheless believe that we can safely bring the Realm out of The Silence and into the modern era through careful reflection and consideration of how our choices align with Concord's will. We cannot be willing to blindly turn our faith from our Matriarch to enlightenment and luxury, for then we lose sight of Concord's vision. Foreigners like Fickle Current and his capitalists have been born and raised without Concord's guidance in their lives; they are no followers of The Way of Fire, and they should not be allowed to dictate the future of kirin society. But their money and innovations can serve Kiria in Her vision all the same. One example is the §Yexpansion of roads§! that many of my fellow priests and mystics have volunteered to organize and lead. All across the Realm, my fellow spiritual leaders are recruiting peasants from the fields to repair and renew the roads linking the Realm together, roads that have long fallen into disrepair and disuse throughout The Silence. It is important work that needs to be done, and this modernization will allow us to once again §Yreassert Concord's will§! across the Realm. It is a truly noble project, and just one of many ways we can use the tools of the modern time to reinforce our tradition and our heritage.\n\nBut such a venture also comes with its own risks. The disconnectedness of The Silence was a test placed by Concord to measure our devotion and reward our faith in Her. But now that we are reconnecting the realm, it is clear that some have failed the test. §YHotbeds of heresy§! have sprung up in the west, even in cities such as Verdant and Chrysanthemum, where the mystics and their followers have turned away from The Way of Fire to adopt their own set of heretical beliefs. Connecting Vermilion to these cities is not a one way street; just as they allow the Matriarch to reassert her authority over the west, they allow the heretics to spread their lies and falsehoods further into the east. Such heresy is §Yunacceptable§!, and I will do everything in my power to stamp it out before its corruption can ensnare Vermilion. Such is Concord's will, and as one of Her priestesses, I am Her instrument. I will not fail my Goddess, nor will I fail my Matriarch. I will be the voice of tradition and heritage that Kiria needs me to be, for the good of the Realm."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_2:0 "Concord, my Goddess, if You have seen fit to challenge me in such a way, please lend me the strength to pass Your test.\n\n§YThe Way of Fire§! is beset by heretics and traitors at every corner. Today, Fickle Current and his cronies orchestrated a takeover of the government through paper and honeyed words. They stole the divine authority that Concord blesses our Matriarchs with for themselves, turning the Morning Secretariat into the central governing body of the Realm, and removing Matriarch Rain Shine's ability to rule by imperial decree, as has been done in the Realm for centuries. All of this was done under the pretense of codifying laws and political power, but it is nothing more than attempting to put the rule of mortals over the §Ydivine will of Concord§!. The Realm is slowly losing the religious foundations that made it so wonderful and stable, and nokirin outside of my followers seems to care. We were a squabbling mess of petty tribes and villages before The Way of Fire saved us all. What is to stop us from returning to this dreadful way of life should we forget the importance of its five tenets?\n\nIn time, I believe the kirin of Kiria will see the truth of what Fickle Current and his allies are: corrupt and godless businesskirin §Yonly in it for themselves§!. The people of Kiria will stop them from turning the Realm into their plaything, of that, I am sure. But what I am less sure about is the subversive activities of the heretic, §YRising Sun§!. From the moment she entered Vermilion, I knew that she had but one goal on her mind: to destroy The Way of Fire and replace it with her own heresy that she calls §YThe Rising Fire§!. She and her misguided followers believe that their individual communities share a deeper connection with Concord than our divine Matriarch, that the word of the Goddess Herself can be deciphered by the common kirin instead of needing the interpretation of educated and trained priests and scholars. Though she did her best to hide it today, I am sure that this harlot sees the weakening of our Matriarch's authority as a blessing, a way to weaken the righteous grasp of The Way of Fire over the Realm, allowing her to spread her heresy far and wide.\n\nWhat concerns me most about Rising Fire is her §Ycunning§!. Any sensible and respectable kirin would immediately denounce heresy against Concord, but Rising Sun has managed to trick countless thousands of kirin into following her beliefs. Her mind is sharp, her tongue quick, and her eyes seem to see everything at once. I have seen her work at the Plenum ever since our §Yhopeless Premier§! mistakenly saw fit to allow her delegation to participate. She is shrewd and cunning, and plays off of the other delegations to get what she wants. She pretends to support The Way of Fire and the Matriarch when it is convenient, and abandons them when it is not. All the while, her supporters campaign in the city, ever-deepening their entrenchment in the capital of the Realm. Were that I had the power of the first Matriarch, §YIridescent Dawn§!, who could subdue foes with her words and whose talents of theology and rhetoric were unmatched in all the Realm, who could talk a nirik out of their rage when all other methods fail. Were that I could use her skills to dismantle this heretic sect on the Plenum floor, to make the rest of the Realm see how close we are to falling to heresy. Every second that we entertain The Rising Fire is another moment it has to strengthen its position. Something has to be done sooner rather than later. Otherwise, §Yall is lost§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_3:0 "Today, I returned home to my mountain village of Agate for some much-needed rest and reflection. The challenges of the Plenum are numerous, compounded by the fact that the clarity of our Matriarch's mind is confused and confounded by §Ythose who seek to trick her§! for their own gain. I am, of course, primarily talking about Fickle Current and his NAKP cronies, but I have complained about the stallion too much already. I would rather focus on more pleasant thoughts tonight.\n\nAgate has not changed much since last I visited, despite the impressive progress of the §YGrand Gallop Onward§! in modernising almost every facet of our lives. The monastery is still quiet as ever, with long periods of quiet, peaceful meditation in the gardens during the day accompanied by wind chimes and birdsong. At night, the fireworks pop and sparkle with a rainbow of bright and beautiful colors in §YConcord's honor§!, illuminating the stone square on the mountainside where we gather to sing her praise. But even here, the passage of new decrees is plainly visible. Kirin who were but colts and fillies when I descended to Vermilion in service to the Matriarch years ago are now grown mares and stallions, and many of them have answered Matriarch Rain Shine's §Ycall for aspirant Vanguards§! to join her in Vermilion. Before they would do so, however, they will first venture to the Noctilucent Forest in the borderlands for intense and harrowing training. I have seen how such training hardens the hearts and souls of many a kirin before them, so I took it upon myself to honor these kirin with Concord's blessings before they depart. As I rubbed the holy ashes across their head scales and across the stripes of their horns, I could only think back to when these brave souls were but foals scampering across the monastery grounds. I had known them all, and had the honor of teaching them our holy tenets and Concord's divine guidance as they grew up. §YStone Cleft§! had always been strong and clumsy, but had a tender kindness to his heart that left him with only friends and without enemies. §YFire Whip§! was lithe, cunning, and temperamental, but she always stood by those she trusted and respected, and I know she will make an excellent Vanguard. And then there's §YFirefly§! and §YDragonfly§!, the inseparable pair of brother and sister who did everything together, from mischief as little foals to proudly serving their Matriarch. They and the others I blessed today are some of the best and brightest kirin I know, and though I worry for the hardships they will soon face, I know that they will triumph over them all and bring honor to the Realm.\n\nAs I placed the ashes on the last kirin, I stepped back and asked them a simple question: who do you fight for? Without hesitation, they all answered that they fought for the §YMatriarch Superior and Concord§!. Even though it was the answer I expected, it still left me deeply pleased and relieved to hear it. These kirin will not be beholden to the self-serving interests of Fragrance, nor the squabbling Plenum, nor the Morning Secretariat and its factional politics, and certainly not the heretics of The Rising Fire. They are loyal to Concord and the Matriarch first and foremost, and no temptations shall lead them away from the path of righteousness and honor. They will charge into battle carrying a hoofwritten anthology of Concord's divine teachings and tenets, never forgetting that it is because of Her glory and guidance that the Realm was created, and in that, §YI feel proud§!. They serve as an ever-important reminder that the work I do in Concord's name is important, and so long as my brothers and sisters in the faith similarly remember our devotion to our Goddess, we will be able to protect Kiria from the forces of unchained modernisation that threaten to §Ydestroy it§!."

Fern Flare was there in lieu of Autumn Blaze; she prefers Fern Flare much more - a mare with no illusions as to the harsh realities of politicking, that sometimes you need to put your lofty ideals aside to get real results. A shame, then, that Fern is just as much a harmonist-liberal, perhaps more so, than Autumn is - she is a much more formidable opponent if she wants to be, making deals, compromises, quid-pro-quos that are a hundred times as effective at garnering support than the Premier's impassioned speeches at the Secretariat. Thankfully, we met not as opponents today, but as humble subjects of the Matriarch Superior. I had been lobbying her to bestow special wartime priviledges onto the militant aspects of the Way of Fire, and after a few meetings she has acquiesced. The Extraordinary Declaration will grant all Way of Fire chaplains and mystics-commander serving with the Vermilion Banner Army on the front lines of the war against the secessionist and seditionist Fraternal Republic full discretion to deal with all captured Rising Fire clergy, to get confessions, informations, and to impose punishment. I applied a bit of pressure throughout our meetings, and managed to get in a clause where, if the situation demands it, the Way of Fire faithful may summarily execute the heretic, to prevent them from escaping with vital secrets, where it would be necessary to protect the morale of the Vermilion troop, or to shield the local populace from heretical thought.\n\nObjectively, the negotiations were a huge success. The Way of Fire has been empowered, and then some, with the powers it needs to wage a holy war of righteousness against the heretics of the west. Still, there is a part in me that recoils at this declaration, extraordinary indeed in the brutality and ruthlessness that it will facilitate amongst our ranks. It is not a success that I have been able to secure these powers from the Matriarch, but rather, an admission of defeat - total and utter defeat, that the legitimacy of our cause, the strength of our conviction and the ability of our faith, had not been strong enough to outcompete the Rising Fire to win the hearts and minds of the kirin. We had failed to contain the threat during the Grand Gallop Onward, squandering our one and only chance to suppress the heretics in the Plenum without bloodshed. We had lost the battle of wits and rhetoric; the Rising Fire had made the more compelling arguments, touched the lives of more kirin, been more effective a religion. Now, we seek to rectify our mistake in blood and fire. My disgust, contempt, and, yes, hatred for Rising Sun is as strong as ever, for having sucked us all into this maelstrom of death and destruction, but I wonder if she feels the same? If she feels a similar melancholic regret at the path Kiria has taken?"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_5:0 "Winter Frost reached an accord with the hardline ultratraditionalists within the Way of Fire. Although very much the minority, the ultratraditionalist monasteries also produce the most martially-skilled, well-disciplined and organised, and theologically devout mystics - prime material for an inquisitorial corps working to protect the Way from hereticism and treachery in battle and on the home front. She has always been wary of them, yet the nature of the deal struck between them stipulates that she will have to present a proposal to the Matriarch for the formation of such an inquisitorial corps - oficially the "Corps of Concord's Confessors". In reality it would be a fait accompli; in the event that the RaHP fights to refuse official permission for the Corps, the hardliners will still go ahead anyways. The hardliners make her uncomfortable because their militant zeal and fervent self-righteousness, bordering on the bloodthirsty, is all too reminiscent of the Rising Fire. In more peaceful times she would have had them sidelined but the harsh reality of the civil war, the pressing need to counter the rheetoric and propaganda of the secessionists, means that the hardliners will have to be unleashed on our enemies to save our own skin. Having reflected on my dislike of the hardliners, perhaps I see in them the quality of harsh, cold-blooded conviction, a burning ambition to see their will made manifest, that outstrips my own determination and devotion. Kiria is being torn apart by so many forces - sacriligeous extremisim, the godless capitalist opportunism of the NAKP, the militant liberalism and modernism of Autumn's Equestrian lapdogs, and now these within my own faction, whose faith and conviction burns stronger and more violent than my own. Contrasted against all these forces, the principles of tradition and moderatism seem very inadequate and impotent. But I shall be a bulwark against the deluge; like a rock in a stormy ocean I shall stand firm, resolute and unwavering, enduring the depredations, until the crashing waves subside or I am toppled and ground into dust."

The dominance of the Serene Tendency over the Way of Fire in Kiria, once nigh-unassailable in the past, having even survived the Silence - has now come to a definite and definitive end. The Rising Fire will not be going away anytime soon, and the traditionalists will have to coexist with their rivals in an uneasy power-sharing relationship. the hardliners will never be satisfied, of course. Even now, they still call for the total and complete destruction of the Rising Fire as a religious and political force, not content with the hard-fought status quo - the result of the power struggle in the Secretariat which brought the Serene Tendency to the brink of ruin. But the Serene Tendency has survived, and they did so not by resolutely sticking to their dogma, but by adapting and making concessions to modernity where necessary, while refining and strengthening the pillars of their doctrine to stay true to their fundamental principles. The civil war was the most brutal and effective of wake up calls, and in the ensuing struggle with the Rising Fire the Tendency was forced to reforge itself into a more focused faith. Well, things could have been a lot more worse. At least now we can be sure that the Tendency will not lapse into complacency, as we might have had our monopoly continued. Once we win the war we'll come out the other side stronger and more robust than before."

There are some thoughts that a mare like I simply cannot voice in public, but not to acknowledge them would be deeply dishonest, and I still have enough faith and conviction in me to deliberate candidly and without illusions on the future of the Serene Tendency, for the sake of the Way of Fire, of whom I am the foremost leader and thus bear a responsibility to guide it in a way that best protects its interests. I think that the civil war, disastrous for Kiria and her people as it has been, ultimately was a net positive for the Serene Tendency's control over the Way of Fire and the kirin people, albeit in the worst possible way. Vermilion's victory against the perfidious northerners and the heretics in the west allows us to triumph over our ideological foes by crushing them on the battlefield. The fact is that the Serene Tendency may not have been able to win otherwise, had we sought to fight through palace politicking and populist rabble-rousing in the Plenum or the Secretariat. The hardliners will never admit that the Tendency was decaying from within, chained by its own rigid dogma, while contenders to the hearts and minds of the kirin people chisel away at our dominance from without. Triumph through force of arms was thus the easiest way out for the Tendency. It's easier to crush our enemies than to face up to the reality that the Tendency needs to reform itself and modernise in order to adapt and survive in the new millennium. But this will only buy us time. We share our victory with the harmonists, and their ideology is one that is far more suited to the modern world than ours. The Serene Tendency will have to adapt to the current reality if we don't want to become overrun by the notion of liberal democracy after we have fought so hard to defeat the heretics."

This could all have been avoided had Autumn Blaze not mismanaged things so terribly. Now to bring Kiria back on the right path. Steer Kiria away from foreign thought and domestic heresy. Roll back the populist, destabilising, irresponsible rhetoric of the RaHP, who tried to give democracy to a people ill-suited for it, like letting a young foal play with a dagger because it would teach the foal to defend itself. The Way of Fire stands behind me, as well as a growing faction in the RaHP who have had their foalish belief in absolutist democracy stripped away by the harsh reality of the civil war. The Radiant Hierocracy, the Serene Tendency's theocratic hierarchy, is poised to take over the running of the state from the secularised civil service established by Autumn Blaze. This secularisation is the root of its failure to prevent the collapse of the Realm leading to the civil war. Restore order, stability, harmony and balance to Kiria, as it should have been. I can make things right. Not to bring back the Silence. There's no going back now that the floodgates have been opened.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_1_TITLE:0 "My Forefathers' Land"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_1:0 "It is still surreal to me that I am now living in my ancestral motherland. I may have been born in Skyfall and spent the better part of 54 years of my life in Griffonia and Equus, but §YKiria§! has always tugged at my heart from afar. I grew up hearing stories from my grandfather about the country he left behind and the family he had to say goodbye to, and though those memories are tinted rose with the passage of time, the stories he told were not happy ones. §YThe Silence§! destroyed his successful trading company and uprooted so many kirin like him, kirin who fled across the world to find a better life than the life the Matriarch and The Way of Fire forced upon them at home. Those who did not flee were left destitute in the apocalyptic aftermath of economic suicide; who knows how many relatives my family once had who have faded into §Yobscurity and squalor§! because they could not flee to Griffonia like my grandfather did? I have thought many times about reconnecting with distant relatives who spent their entire lives living in The Silence instead of abroad, but always decided against it. What family I have lived in Griffonia with me, not in Kiria, and those that lived here would only be asking for handouts from a §Ysuccessful businesskirin§! who made his fortune in more opportune places.\n\nBut now that I have returned to Kiria, there is much work to be done. Foremost among these tasks is bringing back §Ythe diaspora§! and making sure that their voices will be heard in the reconstruction of our nation. Kiria is hopeless without her foals educated abroad, foals who have gone on to be successful capitalists, industrialists, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and more in nations that appreciated their talents. From the moment I arrived in Kiria, I have spent as much time as I can afford trying to reach out to the diaspora and §Ybring them home§!, and my labors have thus far borne many fruits. Just last night, I concluded a party in Fragrance where I brushed shoulders and exchanged words and promises with many of these lost sons and daughters of Kiria. In exchange for their financial support, I promised them §Ylucrative contracts§! and business deals in the resurgent Realm to make their time and money worth the investment. I have indebted myself under a mountain of favors, but like any good businesscreature, I am good at finding ways to get others to foot the bill. §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! and the rest of the government will make excellent patrons to exchange these favors with; after all, everything I do for the Realm benefits them greatly.\n\nSoon, my vision, and the vision of the Realm's lost foals, will emerge triumphant over this period of reform. We are all organized, disciplined, connected, and funded in a way that no other kirin in this Realm is, even our Matriarch. We will be Kiria's saviors, and as such, we will make sure that we are amply rewarded... §Ywhen the time comes§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2_TITLE:0 "The Charter of Rights"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2:0 "It pleases me to see the progress we've made in modernizing the Realm when we have the right kirin to guide the process. Our latest victory was the §YCharter of Rights§! that I saw passed through the Plenum. Kiria's legal system was a mess, but what is to be expected of a §Yhopeless theocracy§!? The nation was held together by hundreds if not thousands of vague religious rulings and conflicting interpretations of Concord's divine will. This made it very hard for any enterprising kirin to maneuver in the system; what one mystic thinks is acceptable may be completely unacceptable to another, and in disputes such as these, mystics and priests immediately defer to their higher authority without question. In most cases, that ends up being the §YMatriarch Superior§!, giving her ultimate decision making authority over the Realm. But now with the Charter of Rights passed, §YThe Way of Fire§! no longer holds such absolute authority over the land. The Charter is a single codified document free of confusing and vague religious statutes that explicitly lays down the word of law. Of course, I made sure that such a Charter was not §Ytoo restricting§! in its legalese. There is space to maneuver, semantics to exploit, and technicalities to find, all perfectly legal within the law for a kirin clever enough to find them. I even managed to score crucial victories for §Yprivate property rights§!, freeing much of a kirin's wealth and assets from mandatory tithes to The Way of Fire, a useless tax that would cripple investments and incentives for any business trying to operate in the Realm. This has been, undeniably, a win for §Ycapitalism§!, and the future of Kiria is looking bright.\n\nBut there is always room to improve. A good businesskirin will not settle for reducing their taxes to 20%, when they could instead be 15% with enough pushing and prodding. Despite the influence I wielded over the Charter, §YPremier Autumn Blaze§! and her allies still managed to include provisions for labor rights and civic freedoms. These are the sort of things that are good to have in a developed nation where they can be afforded, but Kiria is not a developed nation. We are poor and agrarian, and these reforms §Ystand in the way of progress§!. But at any rate, I only see them as temporary obstacles. Autumn is hopelessly outclassed by her job, and I cannot help but feel sorry for the poor mare. She is young and clueless to how the world works; she only earned the position because Matriarch Rain Shine feels §Yindebted§! to her for some reason. I fully expect her support to evaporate as she continues to blunder her way through the Plenum, and when that happens, I have enough support to replace her as the §Ynext premier§!. I'd do a much better job than her; that is something everykirin can agree with. And that also affords me the opportunity to make a few changes that benefit those who have given the most for the modernization of the Realm. I know many partners and connections who would benefit greatly if those labor rights were §Yremoved§! from the Charter, for instance..."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3_TITLE:0 "An Honest Trade"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3:0 "Today, my friends in Fragrance Enterprise and myself met with the Equestrian delegation over the transfer of §Yship schematics§! and blueprints into our hooves. While the designs of the ships they gave us were outdated by their standards, and the fire control systems and battery schematics were similarly antiquated to the modern world, they obsolete the three ships we raised from Fragrance's harbor to the point where they'd only serve well as training dummies. But this transfer of knowledge wouldn't even be possible without the efforts of our §Ymisguided premier§! in befriending the Equestrians. Even though she may be hopelessly outclassed by the requirements of her job, even a broken clock is right twice a day, as they say. The deal is not perfect, of course; in exchange for these blueprints and schematics, we had to agree to give Equestria §Yprospecting rights§! for any resources that they find in Kiria, so in exchange for a one-time gift of obsolete knowledge, they earned themselves a steady stream of valuable raw materials to siphon out of our nation. This won't hurt us in the short term, as Kiria is so underdeveloped and improperly exploited that we do not have a lot of resources immediately on hoof for delivery. In essence, we're only exchanging a small fraction of an already pitifully small potential in this deal. But we will be stung in the §Ylong term§! if we do not find a way to renegotiate or renege on the deal as we properly exploit the resources of our lands. Equestria will gain an ever-growing share of our material output, sapping us of what should be ours by right.\n\nWhile the deal itself went off without any complications, I had an unfortunate encounter with the delegate by the name of §YApplejack§!, one of Autumn Blaze's friends and supposedly a member of the so-called §YElements of Harmony§!. I think she was supposed to represent Honesty if I recall correctly, which is a useful trait to have when negotiating a business deal, though I did not care all that much to properly commit it to memory. Magic artifacts are useful tools but their importance is increasingly diminishing in a modern era of technology and science. At any rate, the mare pulled me aside after the meeting and tried to give me a lecture about §Yproper cooperation§! with the other leaders of the Plenum. And though she did not outright say it, she implicitly accused me of using the Plenum for the benefit of my friends and myself over the benefit of the Realm. While she is correct that the path of modernization I wish to take Kiria on does directly benefit the returning diaspora like myself, it also stands to greatly benefit the Realm as a whole, and cooperation with my colleagues only comes when they meet me halfway. It is not fair for one party to bend over backwards to please an uncompromising partner, after all. I did try to explain this to her, but the mare must be part donkey—that would explain her stubbornness, at least. It seems that the only system she's willing to accept and understand is one that directly mimics the §YEquestrian model of Harmony§!, and anything else is completely foreign to her. Now, at least, I understand where Autumn Blaze learned her hopeless idealism from.\n\nProper cooperation with my peers does still remain an elusive ideal, I will admit, and not one that I can easily reach. Many of the ideas of the other cliques are §Ysimply incompatible§! with a modern Kiria, particularly the traditionalist nonsense that priestess Winter Frost spouts out during every session of the Plenum. I cannot afford to compromise with her too much, else I will lose the backing of my followers and supporters. They wish to see a §Yproperly modernized§! Kiria, not one laden with the burden of outdated religious philosophy, and if I am perceived to be too weak, then I will be ousted as the NAKP's leader. Even in this, life is like a business, and an incapable executive must be replaced for the good of the company. Only in this case, the company is the country, and it cannot have a weak executive board if it is to prosper and be profitable. I will have to be careful to find the right balance between §Ycompromise and dissent§! if I am to steer the fortunes of both Kiria and myself to a more profitable tomorrow."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_4:0 "If I had thought that politicking and maneuvering within the constraints of the §YAll-Kirin Plenum for National Revival§! had been difficult enough, I have quickly learned that being given even broader freedom to make decisions and enact policy has only come with an increasing amount of headache and late nights. But as Chairkirin of the NAKP, it is under my direction that Fragrance marches forward to a new era and a brighter tomorrow. I have done everything I can to make that dream a reality, and perhaps no step has been more important than the plebiscite we have just concluded throughout the north.\n\nThe plebiscite to guarantee the self-determination of the kirin of §YGreater Providence§!, those of us living north of the Great Mellifluve's watershed, was a risky step forward. I had no idea how Vermilion would respond, but I had hoped that §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! would allow her subjects to make their own decisions on whether to answer directly to her in Vermilion or seek their autonomy they so craved. But the success of the vote has laid those fears to rest. An §Yoverwhelming majority§! of kirin voted to follow the leadership of Fragrance and the NAKP into a new golden age, one free from the backwards traditions and superstitions in Vermilion, and the Matriarch, regardless of her feelings on the matter, will not attempt to overturn the results. Now, the kirin of Greater Providence will be ours to look after and lead into the future, and that is likely to prove an §Yeven more daunting task§! than organizing and conducting the plebiscite ever was.\n\nBut despite it all, I remain convinced that the efforts of the NAKP and the good kirin of Fragrance will show the Matriarch that our cause is just and will, ultimately, serve the §Ygreater good§! of the realm. The Matriarch has much on her hooves right now, with the trouble caused by §YThe Rising Fire§! in the west; if Rain Shine does not want to see her realm completely shatter beyond repair, it is in the best interests of both parties for the NAKP to take a more active leadership role in Greater Providence and ease the administrative burden on a theocracy that has not suffered infighting for §Yfive hundred years§!. Now that the north has our independence, we will be willing and able to aid Vermilion in the fighting against §YRising Sun§! and her band of heretics, and when the dust settles, the Matriarch will owe us a debt, and one that I intend to leverage. I intend to negotiate with Rain Shine on §Yuniting the realm once more§!, but on my terms, not hers. And in the end, what is a trivial thing like independence when instead we could position the NAKP to have easier access to the tools of governance over the §Yentire Realm of Kiria?§!"

I knew Vermilion would likely respond with hostility; after all, I announced the secession of Fragrance with §Yfiery rhetoric§! that was sure to make scales itch in the capital, even those of the usually calm and kind §YMatriarch Rain Shine§!. But regardless of any actions taken by Vermilion, we pushed on with the vote, and were rewarded with a resounding success. An §Yoverwhelming majority§! of the kirin of the north voted to side with Fragrance, and with the agreements brokered between Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Radiance helping to align the smaller villages in between under the umbrella of the NAKP, Vermilion now faces a §Ystrong and united§!

The symbol of the Matriarch Superior is a §Yvery powerful symbol§! to have in one's court, and despite the secession of the north and the raging heresy that keeps Vermilion's attention to the west, the common kirin is still likely to hold §Ysome measure of respect§! for Matriarch Rain Shine. Therefore, I have had to frame the goals and ambitions of the NAKP through a lens that is palatable to the country folk who still worship her divine status as §YConcord's avatar on earth§!. Greater Providence, led by the strong hoof of the NAKP, will prepare to defend itself from the hedonists and reactionaries in Vermilion and the violent heretics in Chrysanthemum, and we will march south to Vermilion to §Y'rescue'§! the Matriarch Superior. I have little intention of sharing power with the misguided Matriarch once Fragrance's efforts for national salvation finally reach their climax, but she will be a useful symbol to keep around. Until then, we must §Yprepare for the worst§!, as even though Vermilion is distracted with the civil war in the west, they are not yet a toothless dragon.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_6:0 "I am not one to record my failures on paper; after all, a failure is only a failure §Yif it is a mistake you cannot undo§!. But, unfortunately, my latest political effort is one such failure. I had staked so much on its success, as had so many of the lost foals of Kiria now returned to their ancestors' lands. Alas, it seems it was not meant to be.\n\nIn Skyfall, my friends and I, all the sons and daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of kirin who fled the Realm at the start of The Silence, dreamed of one day §Yreturning home and making our mark on Kiria§!. We were predominantly descendants of northerners, from cities like Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Radiance. All of these places were cities and cultural centers §Ydistinct from the kirin of the heartlands§!, outside of the watershed of the Great Mellifluve that defined the rest of the country. We dreamed of returning home and carving out an identity for ourselves, giving birth to the state of §YGreater Providence§!, so-called because of its unity around the greatest of the northern cities, Fragrance; in Providence, Rhapsody's Demesne. At the helm of the NAKP following our split from Vermilion, I thought I had the means to make such a dream a reality. But it turns out that such a dream was merely the dream of §Yforeigners§!. The local kirin of the land, those who have lived here throughout The Silence, wanted little part of our ideas brought in from abroad.\n\nThe plebiscite to settle the issue on the proposed §YNorthern Compact for Self-Determination§! was a colossal failure. We failed to secure the vote margins we needed to claim overwhelming victory, and as such, there was no unified movement in the north to secede from Vermilion and join ranks with Fragrance. Without the support of the rest of the north, my dream of Greater Providence may never materialize. And, to my great shame and embarrassment, Vermilion has already begun to §Ycrow about its victory§! and cite the loss in the plebiscite as proof that Fragrance and the NAKP do not speak for the north. The road ahead to our dream of a Greater Providence remains rough and rocky, and though the NAKP will stagger on and attempt to rebound from this loss, I am ashamed to admit that §YI remain in the throes of melancholy§!. But despite this, I must carry on. I am the chairkirin of the NAKP; I do not have the luxury of indulging myself in wasted time.\n\n§OThe dreams of summer\nBloom fruitlessly in autumn\nI reach, and they die.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_7_TITLE:0 "My Legacy"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_7:0 "I have long sought to make Kiria a modern nation, to shape the homeland of my ancestors into the ideal of a rational society and global champion of the free market and all that comes with it. Back in Griffonia, my compatriots and I would talk about all the changes we would bring to the home of our forefathers, and how we would stamp out the rotten mysticism that led to the Realm falling into such a deplorable state over the past century. §YBut times have changed, I feel.§!\n\nWhen the War of the Double Secession began in the ruins of the Grand Gallop Onward, there were many in the upper echelons of the NAKP, myself included, that felt §Ywar with Vermilion was inevitable.§! After all, the kirin of Greater Providence are rather unlike our cousins in the Realm's heartlands. Throughout our history, the kirin of the north have been excluded from the watershed of the Great Mellifluve river, and the sometimes testy history of Vermilion's dominion over Fragrance and Rhapsody has helped foster §Ya separate cultural identity§! that the north is only now beginning to embrace. The kirin of Greater Providence, spurred on by ideas the Diaspora has brought back from Griffonia and Equus, are undergoing a §Ycultural revival§! led by Fragrance and myself. And in a Realm that has only known one master for centuries, many assumed that we would have to settle our differences with Vermilion through force of arms.\n\nBut, to everykirin's surprise, §Ywe have not.§! Once, I dreamed of using the NAKP to aid in imposing my vision of the future on the Realm whether it wanted it or not. But instead, the kirin of Greater Providence have surprised us all by urging us to find the more rational and moderate approach toward reconciling our differences with Vermilion and claiming the independence that we have long desired. And as it turned out, when we finally arranged to discuss our differences with the government in Vermilion, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were each willing to abide by the idea of §Ylive and let live.§! Did I think it would ever come to this? I would be lying if I said I did. But am I pleased with how it has turned out? Quietly relieved that war with Vermilion was averted? Yes, I do think I am.\n\nWar is a dangerous gamble for all parties involved. It is expensive, destructive, and devastating. Could we have gained more by forcing the issue with Vermilion and taking up arms? Of course we could have. But we also could have §Ylost everything we had§!. A disastrous failed war with Vermilion would have all but crushed the dream of a cultural awakening of Greater Providence and the realization of our shared future, and the dream may never have risen from the ashes again. Instead, like any shrewd businesskirin, we negotiated a deal that benefited all parties, and it has left us with a secure foundation to build our future upon.\n\nBut can it be so cut and dry? Even though we avoided war with Vermilion, there is a large cross-section of our populace that wanted it. And war fever, once whipped into a frenzy, §Yis not so easily dispersed.§! Many kirin in the north, practically foaming at the mouth for the opportunity to destroy Vermilion, now find themselves in an awkward peace, nationalism and jingoism shoved aside in favor of curbing our losses and cutting a deal. I have no doubt in my mind that these next few years will be dedicated towards dispelling §Ynationalist discontent and inevitable unrest.§! The promise of peace and prosperity will keep things sane for now, but as time passes, the memories of what war and death actually are will fade, and there will be those who insist that there is more to be gained through war than there is to be lost. But they are wrong; war is nothing more than a §Yvicious cycle of barbarity§!, where needless death and destruction quashes progress and stifles commerce. Perhaps it is a miracle that I and the NAKP were able to prevent it from happening to us, too.\n\nBut I suppose now is not the time to think about what could have been, and what we narrowly avoided. We must focus on the future and the opportunity we have secured and invested in. One day, when our investment grows into something even more beautiful to behold, all of Greater Providence will remember that §YI was the one who planted the seed§!; after all, a legacy is the only thing that remains of us when we pass on."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_8:0 "It seems that this struggle against the decaying structures of governance that still suppress the growth and fruitful blossom of the Realm seems fit to remind me time and time again that the Realm has always had a great future but has been §Ychained down by fear and superstition.§! The latest reminder was in the form of a special report I received from the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis on the recent actions of a commando detachment tasked with destroying munitions and supplies in Vermilion. While the commandos were successful in their task, they were unexpectedly attacked during their exfiltration by a few dozen of what the survivors called §Y'clockwork stallions'§! which were immune to the blades and small-arms fire of the team. These clockwork machinations had weapons of their own, including small arms, and the commandos suffered heavy losses in the attack before they were able to disengage.\n\nWhen I read the report, the stories of the §YSlaughter at Sunrise§! came back to me. I was ignorant of this ugly story in the Realm's history, but some of my friends who maintained closer ties to our shared homeland told me about it some time ago. Sunrise was a small holdout of the Artificers' Guild during the imposition of §YThe Silence§! during Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's tyranny that had flourished with a constant stream of inventions that pushed the boundaries of what technology was capable of. From things like thaumaturgical batteries that could supercharge a kirin's telekinetic ability, to processing machines that were comparable with the best computational devices that money can buy today, and everything in between, they embodied the spirit of progress that the NAKP champions, and their descendants, today's Artificers' Guild, pride themselves on. Among their finest works were the §Yclockwork legions§!, soldiers of brass and glass that were unbreakable and unstoppable in their time, but unfortunately too few in number to save Sunrise. A secretive paramilitary group reportedly named the §YBanner of the Covered Cage§! attacked the town without warning, slaughtering everykirin inside and destroying or burying as many of the Guild's technologies that they could find. One can only imagine how much was lost in this attack by paramilitary reactionaries, and how much further the Realm could have been along today had Sunrise prospered and the Silence failed earlier.\n\nStill, it is with some bemusement that I must note the irony in the Realm seeking aid in the buried and forgotten relics that Matriarch Rain Shine's own mother sought to destroy during her reign. Am I worried? No. Impressive as they may be, these are inventions a §Ycentury past their time.§! Technology and weaponry has improved since the age of flintlocks and blackpowder. These delicate, intricate constructs of glass and brass cannot stand up to withering heavy machine gun fire, or mortar bombardment, or the crushing treads of armored vehicles. What the NAKP represents is §Yinnovation and progress.§! Vermilion has dredged up these relics from the old days, but what we already have now is superior to theirs. This is what makes us different: the NAKP actively creates and strives to make new, progress and innovation for its own sake, while Vermilion disdains technological progress as a threat to stability and their own control over the Realm, instead content to feed, parasitical, off of the fruits of the labor of others. This is why they shall fall, and the NAKP will lead the Realm into the §Yprosperous future it deserves.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_9:0 "Today was the day that I've been waiting for ever since we made the wise move to cast off the leaden weights of the Realm's superstitions and take charge in bringing Kiria into the future, kicking and screaming if we had to. Vermilion had finally fallen to our forces after fierce resistance from the Way of Fire loyalists and their allies, and the chaos of warfare and the damage of thousands of nirik running amok through the streets has left the city in a sorry state, but I made sure that §Ythe Vermilion Palace was to be unscathed§! and the most severe punishment would befall any unit that engaged in combat with the Matriarch's personal guard. Indeed, when the city had all but fallen to our forces, the Iron Chrysanthemum established a defensive perimeter around the palace to protect it from looting and make sure that the Matriarch could not be smuggled out by her bodyguards. Not that it would have been easy to smuggle out a mare twice as tall as the rest of us, but it was absolutely critical that the Matriarch remained exactly where she was until we were ready.\n\nAnd today, we finally were. After exchanging messages with the defenders of the palace, we negotiated safe passage for myself, Cypress Snow, and several other NAKP grandees to see the Matriarch personally. We entered with my own company of bodyguards, passing by haggard defenders and hundreds, if not thousands of civilians that had fled to the safety of the palace when the fighting began. They watched us with fear, some hate, but I think most present was an overwhelming sense of relief that §Ythe fighting was over§! and they could try to return to the normalcy of their lives without the fear of bullets and mortars raining down on them. There is much work to be done to rebuild the Realm, but I will not deny them that much if it means their future cooperation with the party.\n\nAs for the meeting with Rain Shine itself, it happened in the throne room, surrounded by the members of her personal banner, far more disciplined and stalwart than some of the soldiers of the most professional armies in the world, and wholly loyal to her word. The throne room itself was grand and opulent, but not nearly as much as I had remembered; a hole in the roof and damage to the intricate carvings along the walls and the ceiling of the antechamber had been the results of a §Ystray mortar§! that had hit the palace. As for Rain Shine herself, she had dressed herself in her finest raiments, though I noticed a linen bandage peeking out from under the collar of her dress; perhaps she was in the throne room when the mortar hit and suffered injury to her person as a result, and I could only thank the heavens, and Concord if she would hear my words, that the Matriarch had not been killed in the fighting. §YUnifying the Realm would be impossible were she to perish.§!\n\nI have no need to record what was said between us; I read from a prepared statement that the NAKP had captured Vermilion and liberated the Matriarch from the twin forces of decadence and heresy, and it would be through our strength and wisdom that the Realm would be saved from those who had corrupted and ruined it. I said that the NAKP humbly requests the Matriarch to §Yreclaim her position as leader§! of the kirin people in all properly flowery and respectful language as decorum demanded, and Rain Shine gave her assent. What I find more interesting than the words were the emotions of the Matriarch herself. While she appeared perfectly regal, maintaining the otherworldly divide that separates her from the rest of kirinkind as Concord's avatar in this world, I could tell behind the neutral mask she wore that §Yshe was furious.§! After all, why wouldn't she be? The government and she had entrusted to her friend, §YAutumn Blaze§!, had been toppled through war, and the task of the Grand Gallop Onwards unfulfilled. To her, I and the rest of the NAKP are the enemy, the kirin who stole the Realm from her, and no amount of false proclamations of loyalty and humility to her will change that. She knows that she will serve little more as our §Yfigurehead§!, a symbol to parade around the Realm that the NAKP are the rightful rulers of Kiria. I am only grateful that she assented through the farce and played along; were she to refuse, fighting would have resumed in Vermilion, and if the Matriarch dies, then there is nothing holding the kirin people back from the §Ywarlordism and nirik rampage§! that plagued our lands before the Way of Fire. I think she agreed because she knew there was no other choice, and if she refused to play along, far, far more of her subjects would die in the chaos, and the Realm itself might have very well burnt to the ground.\n\nBut what is done is done now, and this marks an important step in bringing the nastiness of the civil war behind us. With Vermilion under our control and the Matriarch in our pocket, it is only a matter of time before the §Yflames are extinguished and peace returns once more§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_10:0 "As I prepare to get some rest tonight and prepare to enjoy the weekend for a change, my thoughts drift back to a meeting I had today about the state of the §YThousand-Banner System§! that has long been the backbone of the Realm's military. Cypress Snow led the meeting and I was able to sit back and listen, as once I did when he gave his seminars back at the Cafe de Fiori in Bruma, when my future was still full of many 'ifs' and not as many 'whens'. The meeting was part discussion, part history lesson. The Thousand Banners were a military caste of hereditary warriors and officers who fought for the Vermilion Dynasty, but §YThe Silence§! scattered them to the winds of the Realm. Most never recovered, simply disappearing into history, but a few survived until the modern day, despite the odds. These were the banners which still retained the 'Traditional Four Facets' of a true Banner: political, economic, familial and military. When the §YAutumnal Premiership§! attempted to restructure the Vermilion Banner Army by forming infantry divisions bestowed with the titles and trappings of banners, despite most lacking any descendants of banner families in their ranks, and despite lacking any of the political-economic power or martial legacy that came with them, it created a chimera of an army that had one hoof in the past and one in the future with little connecting them in the present. They were §Ywasteful, disorganized, and ill-prepared for combat§!, as they unfortunately found out in the middle of the war. The banner armies Vermilion fielded styled themselves after ancient banners while trying to mesh Griffonian ideas of military organization into them, which ultimately resulted in a chaotic and dysfunctional mess with an incoherent chain of command.\n\nOnly one banner truly remained by the time Autumn Blaze finished mangling the system into something grotesque, and that was the §YBanner of the Starred Taurus§!, who under the wisdom of the Bloom lineage, allied itself with the NAKP. As Cypress suggested that we move to officially dissolve the Thousand Banners system, and in the process remove the elements from our military that fought for Vermilion and are now traitors, Dr. Ardent Bloom worriedly asked if an exception would be made for the Starred Taurus. I know enough about the stallion to know that this was not out of concerns of its history or legacy, but rather the §Yeconomic and political security§! of the Bloom lineage. I suppose such concerns for the wellbeing of one's family are commendable, but typically selfish; he did not, after all, make any motions to protect the privileges of fellow bannerkirin and banner remnants that sided with the NAKP during the war. I have made sure to work that adjustment into the final draft of the decree we will present to Matriarch Superior Rain Shine for her to sign into law on our behalf. After all, keeping the rest of the banner remnants happy, even though §Ymost are industrialists or politicians now§! and not soldiers, will be a comfortable base of loyalty to build the ever-climbing ambitions of the NAKP upon.\n\nThat's an interesting thought: most of the senior bannerkirin who had joined the NAKP have already found ways to be wealthy and powerful independent of their bannerkirin status, primarily by being of use to the party. I personally know some who have foregone their banner identity to present themselves as industrialists, politicians, or proper military commanders first and bannerkirin second."

The building is only three stories tall and has a small selection of rooms, but each is well-stocked and more than sufficient for hosting small groups of NAKP executives. It's §Ybuilt to serve exactly its intended purpose§!, much like the rest of the town.\n\nBaobab is an artificial construction down to every last detail. Its spot was chosen specifically to control as much of the lawless western reaches of the Realm as possible, its buildings stout enough to withstand mortar fire, the grid-patterned boulevards wide enough to provide line of sight for snipers and machine gunners down numerous blocks. Baobab is a §Yfortress masquerading as a city§!, and that goes down to the kinds of kirin that will live in it. All of them are soldiers and their families, given free property in the town if they've served for a decade in our armed forces, or made available for a small subsidized rent if they're active duty or veterans who have not yet served that long.\n\nI watched this morning as the first of those inhabitants arrived in the town, carried in on gleaming half-tracks to the town square, where I delivered a short speech about the law and order they bring to the §Ylawless and orderless west§!. Being soldiers, I know that they will make Baobab successful. Hospitals and public services will be staffed by well-trained military personnel, and law and order will be maintained by a well-regulated citizens' militia that will police not only Baobab but the surrounding countryside as needed. Baobab represents the linchpin of our regional defense strategy: a town of soldiers, in essence a §Yself-sustaining military garrison§! that will be able to deploy its soldiers faster than our military to quell any local uprisings and unrest.\n\nNo more will we have to rely on rugged rangers attempting to police a lawless world where the sky is high and Vermilion is far away. Baobab was expensive to build, and the proof of concept was realized in a very short amount of time, but it is §Yonly the first§! of militarized settlements the party will construct in the west. Next on the docket are MilSet Iroko and MilSet Banyan, but these will be cheaper to build now that Baobab is more than just an idea on paper. Baobab, Iroko, Banyan, and all the MilSets that come after them will be the home of Kiria's new military class, the professional soldiery, the §Yproud successors§! to the legacy of the Thousand Banners. These incubators of iron discipline and military efficiency will raise new generations of professional soldiers, creating a self-sustaining and loyal fighting force to the Realm. In a few years' time, revolt and revolution will be a thing of the past, even this far away from Vermilion. Baobab, and the cities that come after it, will represent the physical embodiments of the new §YImperial Kirian state§! made manifest."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_12:0 "§YDo I believe in myths?§! Well, I would at least say that what we know today as myths were born from true stories, warped and distorted over time from a hundred generations of imperfect translations and retellings. A modern myth may be full of fanciful and impossible elements, but there is likely still a kernel of truth buried somewhere inside, even if it has become buried under layer upon layer of fabrication, like the grain of sand at the heart of a pearl. One myth I never expected to find that grain of sand in was the creation of the kirin race, and to discover it in the midst of senseless tragedy perhaps makes it even more profound.\n\nSunset Headlands was, for whatever reason, the target of an atomic weapon. The destruction caused a landslide that revealed an §Yancient tomb§! that must have been several millennia old, buried beneath tons of rock and soil now displaced by the force of the weapon. It was not soldiers who found this tomb, but local survivors seeking shelter. Within the tomb they found a sarcophagus, and within that sarcophagus, an ancient skeleton. Tall, slender, and undoubtedly equinoid in nature, the skeleton lacked the scales of a kirin but possessed a long, curved, elegant horn embedded in its forehead. Now, of course there is the possibility of fakery, but the NAKP, upon hearing about this discovery, seized the skeleton and presented its horn to me. It is, without a doubt, the horn of an §Yancient eastern unicorn§!. This would be the first time the remains of an eastern unicorn have been found, and the proof of such a discovery lends surprising credence to an ancient kirin myth.\n\nThe myth predates the establishment of the Way of Fire in the Realm, a tale that the Way of Fire denounced as antithetical to the divine creation of the kirin race by Concord's hoof, and our role as her chosen custodians of the Primordial Flame that birthed the world. In that myth, the kirin race was created as §Tthe offspring of eastern unicorns and dragons;§! it explains our similarities to our unicorn cousins elsewhere in the world, and the fire and destruction that accompanies the rage of the nirik state. Questions of equinoid and draconic compatibility notwithstanding, it would explain our nature to some of our earliest philosophers who looked at the world and saw creatures so similar to us yet fundamentally different beyond the malleable borders of our warring states. It poses a curious academic question opening the door on a matter thought long closed, but it serves little use in a time of war like this. Perhaps the only question relevant now is how easily the war could have been won had we discovered the secrets of the eastern unicorns, and many, many more discoveries and ideas, instead of allowing the Way of Fire to §Ysuppress them in the name of religious supremacy.§!"

Truth be told, I should probably get back to writing that speech instead of distracting myself with my diary, but I've been working on it since dinner and need to take a quick break. Perhaps sketching my thoughts down into this book will help me better put words to paper.\n\nKiria has risen from the Silence, and at last, the damages of §decades of mistake§! has been undone. The Realm is healthy and strong under the leadership of the NAKP, and I do not think even Matriarch Rain Shine can doubt that we've been far more successful in creating a strong Kiria than Autumn Blaze or Winter Frost ever would have. We have secured the legitimacy of our rule at home and backed it up with economic prosperity; now, we need to turn our attention outward. It is our destiny to be the §Yprotector of all kirin§!, from the griffon colonizers in the west, the tribal zebra of the south, and the growing deer threat in the north. Not only will we protect our people, but we will make it our mission to spread civilization beyond our borders, to conquer in Concord's name and to expand her demense.\n\nIt is delusional to expect to succeed in our task by converting the people we conquer, though. The faith of Concord is a kirin faith, and those beyond the borders of the Realm are not kirin. They will not be her foals, nor will they be wards of the Matriarch and her Vermilion Throne. They will be subjects of the Empire, not Concord. It is not religion that we bring them, but §Yideology;§! these backwards regimes will have their markets opened to capitalism, development, and technology. They will provide the labor for the engines of progress, and as we lifted ourselves out of the Silence, so too we will now uplift our neighbors from their backwards ways. They will assuredly fight and struggle, but united under the Vermilion banner, the other races of Eastern Zebrica will be able to attain a portion of our glory. When we have all of Eastern Zebrica behind us, then we will be ready to make our presence felt on the world stage; not just in Zebrica, but §Yfuther abroad.§!"

My fellow mystics and I have spent the past several weeks traveling along the new roads laid down in the §Yrural west§! of our realm, spreading the glorious news about §YThe Rising Fire§! and how we must adapt the tenets of Concord's faith to a new day. The Silence has taught all of us who follow The Rising Fire important lessons; namely, that we do not need a pyramidal religious order to understand her intentions, that we do not need the temptations of the modern age that turn us away from her glory, that we do not need the legal codes and shackles of some foreigner's ideas of governance to run our nation in defiance of Concord's will. Verdant and Chrysanthemum §Ythrived§! during The Silence, because we learned how to properly interpret and adapt Concord's intentions to the century of communal isolation that it bestowed on the realm. Common kirin organized in their communities, each finding their own meaning in Concord's creations, and working together for a truly classless and equal society can do more good for Kiria than §YThe Way of Fire§! ever could in the modern era. The doctrines of yesteryear belong in yesteryear, and they must modernize too along with the times if they are to hold sway in the future we proudly strive towards.\n\nWe have spread the news and beliefs of our doctrine to §Ycountless kirin§! on the roads we have traveled, and we have been repaid amply in the kindness of strangers and even by the government officials of our Matriarch Superior. Wherever we travel, somekirin is willing to offer us a place to stay for the night and a warm meal, as it is well known that to treat one of Concord's priests with kindness §Yinvites her blessings upon your household§!. And government officials give us alms and gifts, encouraging us to continue to spread the word about the end of The Silence and motivate the populace to rejoice. Though most do so perhaps mistakenly; they believe that we are priests of the old tenets of The Way of Fire, not mystics of The Rising Fire, and doubtless we would get into heated confrontations with them if they knew the truth; most officials from Vermilion I have gotten to know are §Yfairly dogmatic§! in their old beliefs, and would not react well to anykirin professing something some would see as §Yheretical§!. But what they do not know will not harm them, and it will make our lives easier as we continue to spread the word.\n\nWe have enlightened many converts today, just as we did the day before, and as we will continue to do tomorrow. We are the §Yforefront of a movement§!, the tip of the spear, and the fruits of our labor will one day be sweet to savor. Until then, we must do our best to make sure Concord's true divine will is heard throughout the nation."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_2:0 "The wonders of modern technology are truly a blessing from Concord. Where once we roamed from town to town and village to village by hoof, the advent of modern transportation in the form of §Ythe railroad§! has greatly aided us in spreading the beliefs of The Rising Fire to the kirin of the realm. We can visit several towns in a day, whereas before we could only visit one town in several days, stopping at inns or farms along the road and speaking to only a hoofful of kirin before moving on. With such an efficient vector for proselytisation as the railroad, the Rising Fire is spreading §Yfaster than ever§!, and more and more kirin in more and more towns are finding the truth in our teachings. This is truly one of the greatest boons our movement has ever seen, and proves that modernization and The Rising Fire are made for each other.\n\nWhen night falls and the day's tracklaying has ceased, miniature shantytowns spring up at the end of the line. They are populated by an §Yentirely new class§! of kirin who are more than eager to embrace The Rising Fire. On any given day, I speak to tracklayers, coal miners, mechanics, and even prostitutes who populate these transient railside camps. Many are pleased to have a job free of the dull monotony of farming and fishing, but they also feel §Yinadequately rewarded§! for the services they provide by the foreign businesskirin who employ them. The work they do is backbreaking and dangerous, and yet they barely earn more than farmers and fishers do for their labors. The Way of Fire does not care for them, and would rather that they §Ynot exist at all§!, as the traditionalist mystics and priests are wary of the new developments happening in the Realm. But §YThe Rising Fire supports them§!; they provide important labor for their communities, and in the eyes of Concord, they are favored by her divine blessing. Under our teachings and guidance, they are helping to build communities that will appreciate their work and reward them amply. We will do what the leaders of the realm will not do: acknowledge them, recognize their troubles, and treat them as equals. Such is Concord's will, and such is my purpose on this earth.

It is a queer transition and one that I'm not used to, but it is proving to be more effective. Since the §YTransmission Office§! was opened to receive petitions from kirin all across the realm, my followers and I have spent our time writing letters on behalf of the common kirin throughout the Realm, acting as their representatives to petition the Matriarch Superior through the office. It is a change that benefits the common kirin more than their leaders at the §YPlenum§! would believe. The Office of Transmission is designed to serve as a direct interface for the Matriarch to hear from her subjects when they cannot make the journey to Vermilion to petition her in person, but a large portion of our nation is still §Yilliterate§!, meaning it is useless to them. My fellow mystics and I are all literate by our training and education, and so we visit these kirin, put their complaints and desires onto paper for them, and make sure that they are received by the §YMatriarch herself§!.\n\nThis has been a great boon to the commoners, as otherwise, they lack the necessary influence to make their voices heard, especially by the leaders of the Plenum. Priestess Winter Frost is insular and myopic, and sees any kirin speaking out about how The Way of Fire has failed them as §Yheretic rabble to be ignored§!. Fickle Current is indifferent; he is foreign-born and foreign-educated, and sees himself above the afflictions and desires of the commoners, viewing them only as §Ytools to be used§! for his own personal gain. And Premier Autumn Blaze, though well-intentioned and caring, is naive and inexperienced, and simply §Ylacks the awareness and knowhow§! to address this problem. The harsh realities of modernization are leaving us common kirin behind, and so somekirin must serve as their herald and their champion. Just as I have always faithfully served §YConcord§!, so too shall I serve §Ythe poor and downtrodden§! of Kiria. And as they realize their voices are being heard and their complaints are being addressed, the common kirin of the Realm will remember who listened to them and who fought on their behalf, and they will remember that it was The Rising Fire that saved them—not §YThe Way of Fire§!."

There could be no negotiations with the decadent Way of Fire; the only recourse that we have left to resolve our disputes on religion and Concord's holy light is §Ythrough battle§!. But it is better this way, in a sense. Before, my followers and I had to make concessions, engage in petty palace politicking, backroom maneuvering, and more; all the tools of §Ythe Great Game§!, of which I am no novice. But back then, during the Grand Gallop Onward, every word I said was carefully chosen, every action taken carefully considered, and I had to hide my disdain for the kirin like §YWinter Frost§! behind sweet smiles and pleasant conversation. It was a sport I was good at, but it was tedious. But now, the game has changed, and I find myself in open rebellion against Vermilion, fighting tooth and nail with the deluded souls that cling to the hedonism of the Way of Fire, for all the good it has done the realm and the kirin who suffered under it. It is refreshing to share my words more openly with kirin who believe in what I have to say than to debate with those §Yblinded to the truth.§!\n\nBut now that the game has changed, my focus must likewise change by necessity. When we march into Vermilion, it shall herald a new age for the nation, a nation reborn under a §Ynew and revived§! Realm of Kiria. As Concord's foremost chosen and loyal First Priestess of the Rising Fire, only I have the knowledge and pious faith necessary to save the Realm and bring the faithful of Kiria back to peace and prosperity. My word shall be law, for I alone have been deemed truly worthy by Concord Herself to speak for Her, and nokirin—not naive and incompetent, §YAutumn§!, nor shameless reactionary §YWinter§!, nor slimy foreigner §YFickle§! will be able to stand in my way. I shall be free to shape Kiria in Concord's most blessed vision, and even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine §Yshall dance to my tune§!, for hers is a weak will, unfit to rule over all of kirinkind. Kiria's moment of glory is coming; all I have to attend to now is the simple matter of §Ywinning this war§!.\n\nBut if that were the only thing I had to concern myself with, victory would be all but assured. There is, and will remain, the matter of holding the Rising Fire together about me until I can accomplish my dream, the §Yrealization of Concord's will§! in Kiria. The Rising Fire is hardly a monolithic organization; there are many different ideas, opinions, and cliques that exist within its strata, many of which are at odds with each other, and only united through the arduous and righteous task we have ahead of ourselves. But when the Way of Fire has been defeated, and the foreigners sent back to distant shores, what happens then? My followers and the commonkirin throughout the Realm §Ygive me their implicit trust§!, but that does not mean I will control it forever. Their trust in me must remain when Vermilion is subjugated, and for Concord's will succeed, I cannot be displaced from Her holy mission. She has placed Her divine trust in me, has chosen me to be the executor of Her will, but that is not something that everykirin will acknowledge. Imagine what sorts of §Yterrible calamities§! will befall my beloved Realm should my work be started but left unfinished? The thought is too terrible to consider. When the stakes are the future of our nation, and even the future of our entire species, there can be no gambles, no unwarranted risks taken.

No longer shall the center of our governance be situated in one static location. Instead, our bureaucratic apparatus in [Root.Capital.GetName] will gather their important documents, procure wagons and trucks where we can find them, and create a mobile command center so that our capital may always be on the move, to follow the charge of victory as we sweep aside Vermilion's dispirited resistance and serve as the administrative §Ytip of the spear§! to make the best and quickest reaction to any new developments on the front. If we are able to see the situation and react faster than Vermilion, then we will always hold the initiative, and whomever holds the initiative will be the eventual victor.\n\nIt is not without its risks, however. That I realize. Civil servants and penpushers don't make the best soldiers, and we will inevitably lose equpiment, documents, and kirin on the long march around the country. There is a §Ygreat danger§! as well, in that if we move too close to the front lines, a desperate offensive by Vermilion could encircle our mobile capital and leave our forces leaderless and confused.

Having the capital follow me around will separate it from §Ythe weak willed in [Root.Capital.GetName]§! who in my absence would set us about a ruinous path as they make decisions blinded to the true story at the front.

Fire, fury, and passion are not symbols of our failure, but §Ymetrics of our success§!, for the Realm could not be born anew without cleansing flame.

Her platoon had encountered the advance guard of a Vermilion banner regiment, but those weren't kirin they fought, but clockwork golems of brass and glass. The golems were impervious against their small-arms and blades, and they had to fall back time after time, leaving behind the wounded and dead to be tramped by the inexorable march of the golems, but they'd perservered, taking heavy losses, and in the end it was mettle that bested metal. The mare brought a gift: a serrated blade ripped from one of the clockworks, the esoteric design a century old, strangely organic-looking, with curves and abrupt edges. It would seem that Vermilion has invoked the ghosts of the Silence. Who knows how they acquired the clockwork legions of Sunrise to fight their battles, but they did. This is irrelevant - a hoofful of golems will not change the tide of the war, and their mechanical lockstep, intimidating as it is, will falter against the inexorable march of history, Kiria's history - that it will be the people who triumph, and that it will be Rising Sun who will sit on the Vermilion Throne, to bring Kiria into a new age of enlightenment and prosperity."

After many hours of grueling negotiations, throughout which my comrades and I were sustained by our indomitable belief in the divine righteousness of our cause, we hammered out an agreement - Winter Frost leading the Way of Fire, some delegates from the RaHP, and us - for the Matriarch to proclaim to all of Kiria. And what did she proclaim? Why, a decree affirming the reconciliation between the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire, that both faiths will exist in mutual harmonious coexistence, that they, both devoted to the worship of Concord, will never find cause to go to war with each other, being cousins in the faith, if not brothers and sisters outright. The decree codified the equality between our religion and Winter Frost's, officially recognised and enshrined via a Matriarch's proclamation our right to exist, to spread our faith, to be a fully-established part of Kirin society. The stick of a threatened war, coupled with the carrot of the Path's full cooperation and assistance in resisting the northern traitors, has accomplished more for the Rising Fire than any war would have been, without necessitating even a bit of bloodshed. Of course I am under no illusions as to the reality of the situation; the hardliners in the Way of Fire will never accept the Rising Fire as equals, when they view our very existence as an affront to Concord and Kiria, and these hardliners exert a great deal of influence on our good friend Winter Frost. Poor Winter - forced to accept this humiliating compromise by the civil war, so slavish in her devotion to tradition and propriety that the idea of even protesting this decree of a Matriarch is anethema to her, and now having to face down the elder hardliners who will no doubt be raging against this most (un)fortunate development. I could almost feel sorry for her. Though there are those in my own camp, the Path's most devout, that decry this submission to Matriarch Superior, and this commitment to coexist with our decadent, fallen rivals, they are not so powerful or prominent to pose a threat to my control over the Path. The Rising Fire will accept this compromise, and we will capitalise on the vast opportunities it presents to spread our faith far and wide."

The power struggle was grueling, yes, but I'd do it again in a heartbeat if the only alternative was to resort to force of arms. There are those in the Path that think we should have gone further, to relentlessly hound the charlatans of the Tendency until they have been wiped out as a political force entirely, but that would have resulted in conflict. Winter Frost may not have had the backbone to fight to protect her faith, but the hardliners of the Tendency certainly do. It's true that the fruits of our victory are mellow and modest. But the fact that we have secured the recognition of the Matriarch through orthodox means pleases me greatly. It proves that I'm a good enough statesmare to achieve my goals the hard way. After we conquer the rebellious northerners and bring them to heel, I'll lead the Rising Fire into a new age, helming Kiria from the imperial capital of Vermilion itself. The post-war period will require a transformation of the Path. Where we had thrived in the opportunities created by conflict and instability before, we will now have to become the party of peace and prosperity, to cement our power. The more militant factions of the Path will have to be reined in or cast out, but that's just how things have to be."

It caused a landslide, revealing an ancient tomb, at least several millennia old, buried beneath tonnes of rock and soil, now displaced by the nuclear hellfire that bathed the Headlands in flame. It was not soldiers, but local survivors seeking shelter, who came across the ancient tomb, and found within a sarcophagus made out of an unknown metal alloy. Inside was a skeleton of a tall, slender equinoid, lacking the scales of a kirin but possessing a long, curved, elegant horn embedded in its forehead. The possibility of fakery notwithstanding, this would mark the first time the remains of an eastern unicorn have been found. In kirin mythology that predates the Way of Fire and Concord, the kirin race was created as the offspring of the eastern unicorns - a sub-type of unicorns reputed to have prodigious magical ability, distinctive for their flowing manes, tall, lithe and slender figures, and curved, long, and wickedly sharp horns - and dragons. In a time of war in Kiria, this discovery spurred some interest nationally, but most of the eagerness came from international observers and archeologists.\n\nRising Sun herself went to the site of the tomb. Accompanied by weary soldiers clad in ad-hoc radiation protection gear, she gazed upon the sarcophagus with her own eyes, observing its millennia-old occupant. She grasped its horn in her magic and tugged; it was firmly attached to the skull. In this entry she reflects about the eastern unicorn myth and their purported creation of the kirin race, and this recent groundbreaking revelation in this time of war. If the eastern unicorns were true, then it follows from this that there was a period before Concord, before the kirin had come to inhabit Kiria, where these graceful  creatures presided over the realm. Theological conclusions; akin to evolutionary theory to Christian fundamentalists. She decides that the news of this discovery must be suppressed, and ordered the tomb to be sealed, but not before taking the eastern unicorn skeleton back to her headquarters."

That may be the ideal, but we face challenges that require expedient solutions. The forces of reaction are defeated but not broken. In Fragrance and Rhapsody, in Greater Providence, in Vermilion and Massicot, the remnants of the old world plot and scheme their counterattack.

She who controls the youth controls the future. Their loyalty is key to our survival. So what if this is indoctrination? The threat of counterrevolution necessitates this unpleasant expediency. The counterrevolution is the "primary contradiction", the solution to which requires indoctrination, which is contrary to freedom of thought, and thus represents the creation of a "secondary contradiction".

The Republic must be united to be strong, and to be united we must embrace centralisation, not only on a technical level but also on the level of political thought and debate. If the levels of government within the Republic are squabbling factions, then we are no better than the bad old days of the Plenum, and we all know how that ended. The Incendiaries were integral to the success of our revolution and the establishment of the Republic, but their time has ended. Kiria does not need scattered and infighting groups of revolutionaries and rebels running amok in the countryside. They have to submit to the authority of our new government in Vermilion so that all of Kiria may march in lockstep towards the bright new future we are building. It is true that institutionalising the Incendiaries robs them of their characteristic dynamism, innovation, and determination, yes. But have I not proven my worth as a ruler? Have I not, with my leadership during the war, brought the Republic to victory? It is time they accepted my right to rule and placed their trust in my leadership, and to respect my edicts. While the Incendiaries remained outside of the authority of the central government, this could not have happened, ever. History will vindicate me; they will understand that this was not so much a necessary sacrifice (though it is necessary) but rather a logical progression into the next stage of our revolution -- the period of centralisation and consolidation after the initial military success to forge a new political and economic order.

Like a disease, they must be eradicated before they contaminate the body politic. Marksism, arisen out of a very different context, history, and material conditions than Kiria's, is completely unsuited for Kiria and the kirin race. The sterile and pseudo-scientific aspirations of Marksism is the worst kind of cosmopolitan elitism, as it rejects the dominance of Concord above all, and the important role priests and mystics play in kirin society as Concord's chosen administrators and leaders. The ignorance of the MSWPK is blatant in their attempt to impose their ideology on Kiria. Of course, Rising Sun is also angry because the MSWPK is an ideological rival to the Rising Fire, especially in the cities where there are workers in factories. The idea that the state should be separate from religion is also a challenge to the power of the Rising Fire. Rising Sun is not an impartial actor. She writes that the MSWPK is more dangerous than the NAKP. It is a threat on par with the blasphemous sectlets within the Path that we had successfully stamped out. We need to do the same to the MSWPK before their grasp irrevocably tightens around the hearts and minds of the urban population of Kiria. Rising Sun's strongest justification: the MSWPK is a foreign ideology transplanted onto Kiria. The NAKP and the MSWPK are two sides of the same coin, foreign interlopers trying to exploit Kiria. It has no place in Kiria. We must treat it like we treat any other invasive species: by rooting it out with utter prejudice to destroy it entirely. Re: the arrest of Cherith Kattumaram, the Skynavians' denunciation only proves that they were trying to infiltrate Kiria to spread their ideology. Why else would they denouce an internal Kirian affair?

In retrospect this dream was not her own; it was the dream of the Kirian people, and she had only guided it to realisation. She feels immense gratitude to Dayspring for helping her make the right decision, and the deepest regret and shame for her foray into authoritarianism before Dayspring set her straight. it was so tempting to hold on to power at that moment, make sure the history books portray her legacy as rightoous, unassailable, saviour of Kiria and mother of the nation. But that would have been wrong, and deep down she would have known that, and no amount of propaganda or revisionism would have changed the truth. the truth would have come out anyway, as the example of the Sunrise Massacre shows. better to be honest and truthful now, where she can respond to her critics and victims, make proper apologies and amends, and work towards redemption and rehabilitation, than to be forever vilified as a tyrant when the truth is exposed after her death. She is grateful that the revolution was not a revolution, as in a full circle that takes Kiria back to where it started, but had succeeded in overthrowing the old order. She had played her part in bringing that to fruition. Now it is time for her to take a step back and let the kirin people decide how they want their new Kiria, the new order, to be like.

For the first time in my short life that I've spent following her, she has entrusted me to make my own decisions and §Yexecute Concord's will§! to the best of my capabilities. She has given me use of the troublesome pirate, Roaring Fire, to aid my team of Valiants in our tasks, and though the pirate does her best to needle her way under my scales, I do my best to shut out her disingenuous words.\n\nThe High Priestess had tasked us with hunting down and smiting one troublesome heretic who goes by the name of Quarrelsome Wren. Whether it was his real name or not, I do not know, nor did it matter. What mattered was that High Priestess Sun had branded him a heretic, and for that, §Yhe had to be dealt with.§! Once a faithful follower of our way, he had dared to question the divine will of Concord to Rising Sun's face, questioning whether she was truly the executioner of Her will, and as a result had been condemned and expelled by the faithful priests and mystics in attendance at the temple that day. Ever since fleeing Chrysanthemum, he had wandered from town to town, §Ysubverting the Rising Fire§! with his lies and heresy, corrupting the rank and file and confusing the peasants who did not know he had been branded a heretic. But when we heard that he was hiding in a remote monastery in the mountains of the Cinereous Strath, Rising Sun had dispatched me, my Valiants, and the pirate to deal with him.\n\n§YI do not think I will soon forget what I witnessed today.§!\n\nWhen we arrived at the monastery and demanded that Wren surrender, he refused to show himself, and the monks at the temple attempted to defend him when we entered. Things rapidly grew out of hoof, and several of them §Yturned into niriks§! to defend the heretic. We had to fight to get to him, and I was forced to strike down kirin who should have been my brothers and sisters with my sword. It disturbed me, but the actions of the pirate disturbed me more. She §Yreveled in the slaughter§!, like a monster sent by Concord to punish Her enemies, and those that raised a hoof against her were brutally cut down in a flurry of swords. Violence should only be the last resort when those that oppose Concord's divine will give you no choice, but they should never be something to indulge in.\n\nIn the end, we found Quarrelsome Wren as he tried to flee, and one of my Valiants shot him through the legs to ensure he couldn't. As I put my sword to his throat and asked the heretic if he had any words, he surprised me with §Ya question§!: has Concord ever proven to anykirin else that Rising Sun is her champion other than Rising Sun herself? I retorted that her successes so far have proven Concord's favor for her, that she would not have gotten this far if Concord did not see her as Her champion. But Wren only asked me again: if Rising Sun claims to speak for Concord, why has Concord not assured the faithful that Rising Sun's authority is derived from Her divine will? How could she §Ytruly speak for Concord's divine will§! if she is not the Matriarch Superior, Concord's avatar on earth and embodiment of her will made manifest?\n\nI did not have the opportunity to question him further; disgusted by his heresy, one of my Valiant companions silenced him forever with a bullet to the head. I could only stare in shock, but magic tugged on my mane and I looked over to see Roaring Fire about to drag me out of the burning monastery. "Meditate on it later, little filly," she scolded me in her hoarse voice, "unless you want to join the monks under the ashes and timbers." I knew she was right, and so reluctantly, I followed her out of the temple. I looked back over my shoulder as we left, only to see it collapse in on itself with a §Ygush of fire and a cough of smoke§!, and I found I could not shut Wren's voice out of my mind, no matter how hard I tried."

While I'm sure the hedonists in Vermilion are §Yhappy to see these heretics in our territory§!, Rising Sun knows that we could not stand their presence. The more the Rising Fire splinters and fractures, the weaker we become until one day Vermilion will bear down on us with an unstoppable tide of §Yfire and blood§!.

As I watched my team put the last of the heretics to the blade, Roaring Fire approached me, and I could tell from the smile on her muzzle that I would not enjoy what she had to say next. "That's efficiency," was how she began her insinuations. "These peasants were no match for your team. Rising Sun's little morning star never had to get her sword bloody." I would have replied, but the stench of blood and smoke §Ymade me feel ill§!, and unfortunately, that damned pirate took that as leave to continue her petty remarks. "This is some liberation," she remarked, and she did her best to look me in the eye as she added, "I bet this seems like some kind of mix of tragedy and comedy to anykirin else. A tragicomedy, if you will. After all, it's not like the commonkirin would §Yunderstand the difference§! between what these kirin believed in and what you do."\n\nHer words incensed me enough that I felt I had to respond to silence her. I told her that she would do better to keep her theological musings to herself. I was the one who was the acolyte of High Priestess Sun, not her, after all. And if she continued, she would quickly find herself on the end of her leash. But whether she desired to antagonize me further or just didn't know better, the pirate continued her heretical thoughts. "Didn't the Vermilion dynasty do the same during §YThe Silence§!?" she asked me, and she shrugged as if the question that left her muzzle wasn't stained with the poison of heresy. "Your little priestess herself has said there's no one way to worship Concord. I heard her say it herself during those boring little sermons you make me attend. So why can't she tolerate these kirin? Maybe it's because she doesn't like the whole §Y'equality between all creatures, equality under Concord'§! thing they've got going on."\n\nI couldn't stand her insinuations any longer and pointedly left her after that. I know she was mocking me, trying to find ways to turn my faith into a weapon to cut myself with. She's more §Yattentive to theology§! than she otherwise appears, so it would seem. But she is wrong. Perfect equality between creatures before Concord was how Noctilucent Charm justified the Silence a century ago, and the kirin people need mystics and priests to help them understand Concord's will. Misguided notions of total equality only lead to conflict and separation, and it is something we can ill-afford right now. §YWe must all be united under Rising Sun§! if we are to have any hope of defeating Vermilion and the Way of Fire, so that Concord's true word can finally reach all the kirin of the Realm."

If we are to prevail against Vermilion's superior numbers and better equipment, we must make sure they take nothing from us. They will find no shelter and no food wherever they advance, and Rising Sun has ordered that all towns in the way of Vermilion's advance are to §Yburn their villages and fields to the ground§! to ensure they do not get anything. But there are those errant towns that refuse to heed our call. Their residents return to their homes after our soldiers retreat, and even welcome the advancing armies into their villages without resistance. Wheatchaff looked to be the next to do this, so we were sent preemptively to ensure that Priestess Sun's mandate was upheld without exception.\n\nMy team made quick work organizing the destruction of the village and the evacuation of the residents, and as they set fire to the fields and towns, the town's mayor, the pirate, and myself watched from a nearby hilltop. At first, the mayor was inconsolable.

At that point, her misery became anger. She screamed at me that we had condemned them all to death. There is no food to be found amongst the miles of burning fields, she said, and no shelter to be had in the ruins of burnt out villages. She said that the forest was no place to be for the elderly and infirm, and even went so far as to claim life under Vermilion §Ywould have been a better alternative to their exile§!.

Before she could lunge, however, Roaring Fire cut her down with a single stroke of her saber, and the mayor's blood spouted from the gruesome wound on her neck and covered my face.\n\nI do not remember much that followed. I think I was in shock. Why do these kirin not understand what we must do to win? Why do they not see that if they do not embrace sacrifice, we will all lose?

Roaring Fire observed that Rising Sun had never asked the people of Zaikiria or Taungpau (where kirin are in the minority) what they felt about being assimilated into the Great Realm of the Kirin. The answer to Roaring Fire's jab was, of course, obvious and easy; I asserted that the Rising Fire had proven its worth as Concord's faithful servants on the temporal plane and that we would be liberators of our kirin sibling in Zaikiria and Taungpau, to create one great big family of kirin. But I more and more feel that this is merely a party line that I am regurgitating mindlessly. I cannot accept as truth that all, or even a majority, of the kirin in these lands would happily and gracefully accept our rule, and I am sure that they would resist our invasions out of genuine fear and the desire to maintain their self-determination, howsoever misguided their nationalism or ethnic chauvinism may be. Is my belief wavering? Kindling and his associates had boycotted Rising Sun's rally. They're very much a minority faction within the Rising Fire, so the most they could do was to walk out. Not that a majority would have mattered anyway -- Rising Sun's word is law, her edicts and decrees incontrovertible. Roaring Fire, sensing blood, of course took the opportunity to torment me further. She said that neither the Republic nor the Rising Fire cared much for its ideals any more, and that this was a nation under Rising Sun.

With the end of the war, the villagers are returning, only to find that their homes have been taken over by the veterans. Breakdown of negotiations between the villagers and veterans was exacerbated by the bias shown by officials from the regional Banner Jurisdiction towards the veterans, who of course were their comrades-in-arms. There were nirik transformations, and the veterans responded with force, hacking to death a ringleader of the displaced villagers with swords and stringing her body on a wire above the main street of the village.\n\nI established all these facts post-facto; when I arrived in the village, the villagers had all been killed or chased off by the veterans, who raided and burnt down the campsite outside the village the villagers had erected. The local bannerkirin commander, an affable stallion, told me that the veterans were only enforcing their land warrants granted legally and rightfully to them by Rising Sun's government. This is true; the land warrants, by design or incompetence, grant their holders such a wide degree of power to occupy and possess land and property that the veterans had done no wrong at law. I had been in the room when the land warrant was drafted; the aims are clear -- resettle veterans loyal to the Rising Fire across Kiria to better consolidate the rule of our Republic and pacify and integrate territories that were formerly strongholds of Serene Tendency or NAKP power. The cost in casualties and goodwill of this strategy is evident, but it is undeniable that the strategy is also achieving its objectives. However, I fear for the future this strategy is going to create -- a future built from conflict, persecution, and oppression, undeniably so. I fear that we are creating a new generation of guerillas whose offspring will be taught to hate the Rising Fire and the Republic, and not without good reason.

Though she has no patience for Concord or justice, she is an honest mare, and a mare of honour and courage. I dislike immensely her coarseness and ruthlessness, but these things no longer disgust me. I harbour for her a wary respect. This entry isn't just about Dayspring's misgivings about the Rising Fire's employment of these former enemies. It is also about Dayspring's complicated relationship with Roaring Fire."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_5_entry_8:0 "Dayspring Rose reflecting on her exile. She is on a small junk, with a backup electrical motor, with Roaring Fire, sailing to the Zebrides. Roaring Fire is an adept sailor (she was the pirate queen, after all) and she only needs to use the sails to propel the junk. Her life in Kiria as a leader of the Rising Fire is over, yet she feels calm. She knows resolutely she made the right choice. It still pains her to think about Rising Sun, her mentor who had been a mother to her, who'd raised her from birth after finding her abandoned by parents killed by Vermilion bannerkirin. Rising Sun's betrayal had torn a hole in her heart. But Rising Sun had raised Dayspring right. When push came to shove, Dayspring chose Kiria, democracy, and justice over Rising Sun and power. Discuss more about Dayspring's feelings. She's left behind her entire life, the Rising Fire, Kiria. She can never go back. She's split from most of her friends and comrades. Dayspring is grimly resolute. She may have failed to prevent Rising Sun's usurpation, but at least she will prove to the world and history that there were still those within the Rising Fire who had opposed this. They will sail to the Zebrides, where Kindling Flash had gone. They will join with his burgeoning resistance movement in exile and see what can be done. Keep fighting."

Newcomers in a rapidly-industrialising yet fractious Empire, with each Kingdom, Duchy, and Barony jealously protective of its own domestic industries, which were already starting to compete against one another to consolidate market share, the AKAG was forced to subcontract itself out to Griffonian competitors in order to generate income. Guild Artificers, formerly renowned throughout the world for the exquisite craftsmareship of their steam and clockwork constructs, were relegated to drafting blueprints for cheap, consumer-grade wristwatches and household boilers.\n\nIn 989, the AKAG underwent a leadership reshuffle. The death or retirement of the last of the AKAG's Artificer-Guildsmasters, senior craftsmares with prodigious engineering experience, cleared the way for the ascension of a new type of guildsmare to the Guild High Council — corporate executives, more often than not bearing degrees from the Middenheim School of Economics, who were more interested in profits than innovation and whose goal was to transform the Guild from an association of craftsmares and inventors into a competitive business.\n\nThe AKAG diversified its operations, taking advantage of technological advancements to market a myriad array of consumer goods, including cars, telephones, home appliances, radios, and the like. An expensive marketing campaign did much to burnish the AKAG brand, touting the sophisticated yet exotic appeal of the Guild's centuries-long legacy in faraway Kiria to win over Griffonian consumers.\n\nThe AKAG is now a highly successful multinational corporation with a talon in every pie. Sensing opportunity, the Guild's executives made sure to gain an early clawhold in the emerging market in electronics, mainly catering to high-net-worth clients like governments, militaries, and other corporations.\n\nThe AKAG which returned from exile bears little semblance to that which departed from Kiria a century ago. Its artificers are all salaried employees overseen by corporate managers, and the Guild invests heavily in real estate and financial speculation to supplement the income from its manufacturing operations.§!"

But once the Silence came, the fortunes of Sorghum and its foundries would turn. The then-Governor of the Foundry understood that the Silence would mean the end of her corporation, so she liquified all her assets and filed for "bankruptcy." In reality, she began making covert investments into far less glamorous industries. Though she had terminated all her labourers, she retained the Foundry's paramilitary outfit of foremares, notorious for their vigilance and brutality as whip-cracking overseers. Mercenary services and protection rackets became the primary sources of income for the Foundry in anarchic Kiria.\n\nAfter the Silence was lifted, the current Governor decided that a return to form was in order. Through the aggressive acquisition of farmland around the city through buyouts and evictions, the Foundry was able to construct entire industrial suburbs housing new foundries in which to stoke the flames of production, if only to supply its paramilitary army with top-of-the-line weapons for their next missions. Following in the hoofsteps of the Foundry's operating model prior to the Silence, those farmers from the surrounding countryside displaced by the accelerating modernisation of Kiria were lured to the city with promises of better opportunities, only to be trapped into debt servitude and made to work in backbreaking conditions for subsistence pay. Unfortunately, Sorghum's star will only rise higher, much to the dismay of the kirin of Peace-and-Plenty and the Great Mellifluve Delta as a whole, whose youth are spat out from the factories with scars both physical and psychological, missing limbs, or as corpses, and whose rivers and fields are soiled by the black effluent spewed forth from the bowels of the Foundry.§!"

All the largest naval manufacturers and merchants did business in the city, and the kirin there were proud of their role in the Realm's economy. But all of this changed when Noctilucent Charm saw fit to impose the Silence on the Realm. Her decrees abolished all hierarchies, currency, and from this, the concept of trade itself. To the city of Fragrance, it was nothing short of the apocalypse. The city was the traditional center for innovation and foreign contact in Kiria, and the Silence would surely mean the end of everything they held dear.\n\nSince the decrees of the Silence would also entail the disbanding of Vermilion's navy and army, save for a few Banners given special dispensation, as well as the loss of trade, the prospect of the Silence especially upset the Kirian fleet based in Fragrance. So, the fleet's captains did something radical: they mutinied, disobeyed orders to scuttle their ships, and turned to whaling, smuggling, or piracy to keep Fragrance's maritime economy alive. Vermilion's response was swift and brutal. In the last military campaign of the Vermilion Banner Army before their formal disbandment, they marched on Fragrance and enforced the Matriarch's decrees by force, demolishing Fragrance's port and shipyards in a punitive expedition and burning whatever ships had remained at anchor in the harbor.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the Silence, Fragrance saw its chance. The diaspora flooded into the city of their ancestors, and many returnee shipwrights pooled together their knowledge and capital to rebuild Fragrance's ruined shipyards and render them operational. Combining domestic craftsmareship and foreign innovation, the shipyards of Fragrance function once more.§!"

While she may be a seafaring corsair, Roaring Fire also has considerable business savvy. Recognizing that piracy won't always work, she established Scarlet Sails Shipping as a safety net if her more dangerous ventures ever went south. However, while the company may have started as a front for Roaring Fire to launder her ill-gotten gains, it has achieved considerable economic success over time, if only because their vessels are the only ones entirely safe from Roaring Fire's fleets.\n\nCurrently, Scarlet Sails Shipping is run by Taupe Caulk, a Middenheim-trained economist, who, while maintaining the company's ties to their pirate benefactors, has also taken up contracts with the Vermilion government and has seen fit to expand the scope of Scarlet's legitimate business ventures.\n\nHowever, the old saying always sticks: Once a pirate, always a pirate.§!"

Eventually, you can fold it no more, and it becomes as tough as steel. The more hidden folds there are, the stronger it becomes."\n\nThe history of Crane goes back longer than almost any other corporation in Kiria, and presiding over it all for generations has been the Mallow lineage.\n\nThe mythical story of Crane's founding goes something like this: the first Mallow was a kirin named Lacebark, who lived on top of a mountain during the warlord era before the Way of Fire unified Kiria. As an army of nirik approached his home, he accepted that he would die, and decided, as his last wish, that somekirin else ought to prosper in his absence. Thus, he stowed all his meagre worldly possessions into a felt bag, and tied them to a large paper crane he had made. He then released the crane into a gust of wind that swept it off the mountain, and he watched it fly away. To his surprise, Lacebark survived the nirik attack, and lamented that he had given away all he had to the winds. However, a few weeks later, a paper crane would fly into his window with a different felt bag attached, and containing half of the items he had first sent out — gold ingots, precious gemstones, beautiful porcelain ware, and rolls of intricate masterwork calligraphy. Each week, another crane returned, and as Lacebark took the chance to send out more wealth, more and more returned each week. Thus was birthed the Crane investing consortium.\n\nCrane is powerful not because it excells in one particular industry, but because it has a hoof in every pot. It is even said that some of the loans that first funded the Sycee Trading House came from the Mallow family, so that the Trading House would always have a soft spot for Crane in their future dealings. Crane today is respected by all, even the Vermilion Dynasty, for its wide reach and the hundreds of thousands of kirin that are variously indebted to it.\n\nCrane cares little for the temporal affairs of the Realm, save for those that concern its most modern and commercially-promising venture, Crane Aircraft. But if one were to strike at this one limb of Crane, the whole beast may soon come knocking.§!"

Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has lived her entire life upholding the imperial decrees that instituted the societal and cultural stagnation and decay of the Realm of Kiria, and never once did she imagine that she would be the kirin to undo them. The decrees had been issued by her mother, Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm, in 902, and when she passed in 971, Rain Shine swore upon her ascension pyre that she would maintain her mother's policies and devote her life to studying the Way of Fire and the teachings of the fire goddess, Concord, to protect Kiria.\n\nHowever, in 1006, an unexpected diplomatic mission from Equestria ventured into the isolated nation and reached Rain Shine's court in Vermilion. There, two bearers of the Elements of Harmony, Fluttershy and Applejack, argued that they had seen kirin living in poverty and squalor all throughout the realm as a result of The Silence, and while it was effective in preventing nirik transformations, it needed to end for the good of all kirinkind. They offered Equestrian aid in getting the nation back on its hooves, and Rain Shine, isolated from her subjects in the royal palace and oblivious to their plights, realized that continuing The Silence would only spell doom for her subjects in the long run. Though she had sworn to uphold her mother's policies, once Rain Shine learned of the terrible cost The Silence had on the people of Kiria, she agreed to repeal her mother's decrees and end it once and for all.\n\nNow, with The Silence ending in Kiria, Rain Shine has pledged to make up for her mother's mistakes and bring the kirin species into the modern age. But after 60 years of seclusion in Vermilion, Rain Shine may find that her authority is nowhere near as strong as her mother's was a century ago.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

As she grew older, the young kirin quickly found herself deeply infatuated with the love and divine guidance the Kirin fire goddess, Concord, had blessed her people with, and as such, Winter devoted her entire life to understanding Concord's teachings and sharing them with the rest of the kirin species. Regularly spending many dark winter mornings in mediation along the highest peaks of the holy mountain range that surrounded Vermilion, Winter Frost's devotion was soon rewarded when she was chosen to go to Vermilion and further her service to Concord by serving Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. As such, Winter became one of the few kirin who had personally met and interacted with the reclusive Matriarch before The Silence ended, and she became personally devoted and loyal to the Matriarch alongside her fierce devotion to The Way of Fire. Such devotion led to her becoming personally favored by the Kirin Matriarch, and by the time The Silence was officially repealed, Winter Frost was the most influential priestess in Vermilion.\n\nAs The Silence gave way to a new era of politics in Vermilion, Winter Frost became the loudest critic of reckless modernisation and provided a solid rock to anchor the concerns of the kirin religion to, regularly pushing against motions, bills, and decrees that she believed threatened the sanctity of Concord's divine teachings. When Kiria collapsed into civil war as a result of her protests being ignored, the priestess soon replaced the inept and naive Imperial Premier Autumn Blaze as Rain Shine's most important advisor. Now, Winter Frost works to bring Kiria back to its roots of firm faith and unyielding devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire, and find the answers to Kiria's modernization problem in Concord's teachings.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

It was there in Skyfall that the Sycee Trading House, one of the Realm's strongest trading conglomerates before The SIlence, had relocated, and Current's family enjoyed close ties to the Trading House that left them extremely wealthy. With the wealth that his family possessed, Current was able to afford a prestigious education in Yale, where he was personally tutored by Cypress Snow, another member of the Kirin diaspora and its foremost literati. Under Snow's guidance, Current learned to sharpen his business acumen and cunning insight that would serve him well as a successful businesskirin and, later, the natural fit for leader of the NAKP during the Grand Gallop Onward in Kiria.\n\nIt was only late in 1006 when Fickle Current stepped hoof in Fragrance, the city of his ancestors, for the first time as The Silence began to lift across the Realm. Remembering the tales of how ineptitude and superstition in Vermilion once forced his family into exile and nearly impoverished them, Current soon resolved to be a champion for the kirin who lost everything in Fragrance and do everything he could to truly modernize Kiria according to what he and the rest of the Kirin diaspora knew in Skyfall and throughout western Griffonia. Unfettered capitalism would be the order of the day, for the wheels of progress in such a backwards land could only be turned with the grease of tremendous investment into the Realm. If Kiria ever wanted to truly join the modern world as a funcitonal nation, it would take an almost unimaginable level of investment, and so Current has resolved to do everything he can to make the nation an enticing opportunity for the wealthy.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_autumn_blaze_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 20 September 977 in Massicot\n\n§YBiography:§!: Autumn Blaze was never meant to rise as far as she has in her life, born the daughter to poor farmers in Massicot. Though originally destined for a life of the same hardships and meagre living as her parents, Autumn's family managed to get their daughter residence in a temple to Concord in Massicot at the age of seven, where she studied for five years before dropping out and returning to the family farm. In those five years, however, Autumn learned how to read and write, how to perform arithmetic, and perhaps most importantly of all, how to study and interpret the teachings of the fire goddess Concord in religious texts. Though she would never use that particular skill in service to The Way of Fire, Autumn made excellent use of her command over words as both a sword to attack with and a shield to defend against, allowing her to use it as a tool to carve her own path in life. Though she originally put it toward making musicals, plays, and even thought-provoking comedic dissections of the stagnation of kirin life under The Silence, it would serve her the best in 1006, when the Equestrian delegation to Kiria wandered into Massicot.\n\nBeing one of the only kirin in Massicot who knew Equiish because of her studies, Autumn was able to guide the Equestrians, two ponies named Fluttershy and Applejack, to Vermilion, where they sought to make contact with Kiria's Matriarch Superior, Rain Shine, and establish diplomatic ties. Because of her efforts, they were successful, and Autumn ultimately formed a close friendship with Rain Shine when all was said and done. That friendship led her to become Rain Shine's first premier, and guided her through the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival as its steadfast and enthusiastic leader.\n\nNow, with her like-minded Harmonists in secure control over Kiria, Autumn can extend her influence once more, having learned many hard lessons from the Plenum. With the country in her hooves, she seeks to reconcile Kiria's traditionalist and theocratic past with a vision of a modern Harmonic nation like Equestria. Time will tell if she is successful.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

KIR_rising_sun_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13 July 969 in Chrysanthemum\n\n§YBiography:§!: Not much is known about the mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and what is known paints only a vague picture at best. By her own admission, Rising Sun was born in Chrysanthemum and studied to become a priestess in the Way of Fire, as such a lifestyle was the only way to escape the utter stagnation of The Silence while it still held Kiria in its stranglehold. But even as a priestess of The Way of Fire, the mare was often regarded by her peers as too smart for her own good and twice as cunning as the most mischievous fox. She would regularly debate her senior priests about the merits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to the Matriarch Superior's decrees when all they brought about was suffering and ruin for the people of Kiria, and was regularly chastised for it. For the mare who was too smart by half for the lifestyle she had chosen, Rising Sun had reached a frustrating theological dead end to the problems surrounding Kiria.\n\nRealizing that she would never advance as a priestess in The Way of Fire, Rising Sun sailed down the Mellifluve where she ultimately ended up in Verdant at the age of 20. Once there, she quickly realized that Verdant was prospering where Chrysanthemum languished. The Silence was still in full swing over the city, but the many island communities of Verdant had formed their own cooperative communes that worked together to the benefit of all without breaking any of the Matriarch's decrees. Additionally, there was no rigid religious structure that dominate the everyday lives of the kirin in the city, only an individual communion between the average kirin and Concord, with spiritual leaders to aid their followers along toward their own revelations. Rising Sun quickly immersed herself in these beliefs, and in no time at all, had risen to the top of this new sect of The Way of Fire. Naming her sect the Rising Fire, Rising Sun would return to Chrysanthemum to spread her new teachings to the kirin of the west, and made many visits to towns and workshops around Kiria before ultimately ending up in Vermilion as the Grand Gallop Onward progressed to bring her teachings to a new level of national awareness.\n\nNow, Rising Sun finds herself on top of the Realm's food chain, in a position of almost unlimited authority and power. The Rising Fire has risen with her as well, and her beliefs are ready to be shared across the Realm. The Rising Fire is grappling with The Way of Fire, and Rising Sun will be the one to bring about a new era of theology and change to Kiria, one it never could have imagined before.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_roaring_fire_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3 June 973 in Nacre\n\n§YBiography:§!: The pirate queen known as Roaring Fire has become familiar with accomplishing the impossible. Born as a poor fishermare in Nacre on the pirate-controlled Auburn Isle, Roaring Fire joined her first pirating expedition at the age of 11 and never looked back. As she gained experience, so too did she gain respect from pirates all over the Isle for her fearless bravado and sharp mind. By the time she turned 19 she was captain of her own ship, and through clever diplomacy and cunning intrigue she began to amass a coalition of pirates and assembled a small flotilla. It was with this flotilla that, on one fateful night in 997, she lured the previous de facto pirate leader of the Auburn Isle and his ship out of his cove and beset upon him with a ferocity pirates still talk about in Nacre today. While cannonfire ripped through the wooden hulls of both junks, Roaring Fire swung off a rope and launched herself onto the enemy ship, where in a brutal display of blood and death, she cut through pirate after pirate until finally finding and besting the enemy captain. When she returned to Nacre the following morning with that pirate in chains, she cemented her legend and earned the loyalty of the brigands and buccaneers that called Auburn Isle home.\n\nThanks to her cunning, the pirates of the Auburn Isle have managed to survive into a new age. After successfully negotiating with Fickle Current to join his forces with her pirate armada serving as a mercenary navy, Roaring Fire spared her home from destruction by a resurgent Realm of Kiria and saved her pirates from the gallows. Now, standing at the forefront of a brave new world, the pirates of the Auburn Isle are firmly devoted to their pirate queen, and Roaring Fire is determined to not let them down.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_the_silence_desc:0 "For the better part of a century, the Realm of Kiria has stagnated under imperial decree by the Matriarch Superior that outlaws discourse on all things societal, technological, and political, collectively referred to as the Silence. Perhaps one day the Realm will be freed from these decrees and the Silence will end, but it is not this day."
